I think I'll just complain :) lalala So recently, I've noticed that there are five recurring jokes in my WHOLE life.  Five. They are: 1. Ashleigh is a big slut. 2. Ashleigh is a lesbian. 3. Ashleigh has no friends. 4. Ashleigh is a dumb blonde.  Unfortunately, I managed to combine the last two (see how there are only four? ohhh ahahhahaha yea now you get it) while on the phone with Carisa and Matt (a conversation mostly about them calling me a lesbian slut... :P). Of course this warrants a "Wow Ashleighs is such a dumb blonde joke."   I think that instead of actually saying it, people should just come up to me and say the number corresponding to the joke or, if they're really in the mood to slam me "One hundred twenty-four!!! ohhhhhhhh haahahahaha".  It would save us all a lot of time.    Now my quest in life is to find more jokes, so maybe I could get ten or so, just to spice things up.
