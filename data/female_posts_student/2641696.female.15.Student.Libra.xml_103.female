If I follow along does it mean I belong or will I keep on feeling different from everybody else?   If you haven't already heard me crowing from the rooftops, yes, I just bought Audio and The Complex by Blue Man Group. I'm in love. Audio has music, plain and simple -- elaborated music that's played in most of their shows. The Complex has lyrics, and a lot of guest artists, and the three phrases up there are lyrics from a song: "Sing Along." In fact, those are all the guy says, and he just repeats 'em over and over. It's awesome. That's one of my favourite songs.   It just lets you think or drift away, without being in your face or obnoxious or anything... I don't like listening to songs with words, unless it's all very musical and the words aren't supposed to pop out any more than the rest of it.   I am in a slightly grumpy mood, for various reasons. I'm tired. I've been conscripted to write a story for DareARTS, something which I am most certainly not looking forward to. A really good friend of mine said THE most jack-ass thing he's ever said to me since the day I met him, but the worst part is that another, even better friend, who was there when he said it, didn't even do anything to defend me. I'll get over it -- just I don't exactly trust either of them at all any more, which really makes me mad because they both used to be best friends. Guess this just goes to show ya that high school friendships don't often last past graduation for a reason. I have a piano exam next week and I'm not prepared yet, at all. Just I can't bring myself to practice, for all the reasons stated above.   All in all, I'm pissy. Don't bug me. I'm currently of the opinion that becoming a hermit  now  might serve me better than waiting until I've grown up. I love people and all, I just can't stand them.
