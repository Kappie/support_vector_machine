It's like...people can take advantage of you, stomp on you, treat you like shit, rip your heart out, and so on...and we'll just keep coming back for more as if they were handing out cookies. "Maybe if I pout or cry they'll feel sorry for me and stop it..." Admittedly this thought has crossed my mind. You'd think by now I...and all the other girls like me...would get it. If someone is going to be wreckless with your feelings...they aren't going to care if it makes you cry. If they were going to care...they wouldn't have hurt you in the first place.   I think sometimes it's like a challenge or something. "I am going to make this person love me if it kills me!" Maybe it's like the dejected feeling you get when feelings, although verbally reinforced, aren't reciprocated in the actions of others. But get real, is it worth it? Why do you care what this one person thinks?   The worst part for me...I can acknowledge the dangerous habits...but have no idea how to stop it.
