Foxwoods seemed like someone ate dinner at a buffet before they stuck their finger down their throat and threw up a casino.  But Mohegan Sun was absolutely gorgeous. Everything had a larger-than-life feel to it, yet it was intimate and personal in all the right places, in all the right ways at the same time. It was great. It was perfect. That's simply  how it's done.   My little feild trip today brought back a shitload of memories. Just being in that kind of atmosphere again- It's no Vegas, but I won't be getting any closer anytime soon. Who would've guessed that even the dirty parking garages and ashtrays would make want to cry. The noise in the casinos- a hum of people talking, chips clanging, machines beeping and playing their annoying as fuck little songs- It's something you can't get anywhere else, and I love it.  But now I miss home.
