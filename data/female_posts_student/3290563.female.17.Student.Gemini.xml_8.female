I got up today around 1:30 and went driving on the highway for the first time. It wasn't as scary as everyone made it out to be and I did quite well I think!  I have my algebra exam tomorrow and I just know I'm going to fucking fail it. There's no way I'll pass it. I hate math I hate it soooo much! I don't really know what else to say because nothign big happened. I'm feeling more tired lately and I don't know why that is. And now I'm hungry. *sigh* and I have to pee.   After I finish updating this I might just go and take a shower. Next weekend I want to go to the movies with Melissa and see 13 Going On 30. It looks like a really cute movie and I wouldn't mind seeing it! Lots of things are happening in people's lives nowadays and I realize that I'm not the only one who feels this way. But that doesn't make the pain go away.  I listened to Freak Out, Together, Fall To Pieces, and I Always Get What I Want. That song is so fucked up it's not even funny lmfao. I feel sorry for Avril and no wonder it's only a bonus track over in Japan. It sucked major ass. I love Together. It's so cute. Freak Out is my absolute favorite though. I dunno when the Don't Tell Me single is supposed to be out over here. I hope soon cuz I really wanna buy it.  I noticed that I jump around on topics in this and I hope it doesn't confuse you lmfao. If it does, get over it. I don't wanna go to school tomorrow. I just want to sleep for the rest of my life if that's alright. I work tomorrow. 4:30-closing. I hope they don't have me washing the dishes. I hate doing that. It's so boring and hectic and they complain that I don't wash fast enough.  Ricky is doing just fine. He's the cutist little thing ever. I love him so much lol. He's so small too and he likes to attack my feet. It tickles, but then again it just annoys the hell outta me because I can't take my eyes off him for one second. I'm so very tired. Have I said that already? meh whatever. I'm done updating this thing for right now. Maybe more later tonight. If not, then tomorrow after work, or before work.  Much love
