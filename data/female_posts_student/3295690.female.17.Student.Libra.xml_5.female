I can't help it though, last night I went to Eden, a new club in town that was completely dead and is formerly known as "Lalaland" the main gay bar of our tiny little city.  And God knows what happened, its not supposed to  be  a gay bar anymore, but as it happens Bec and myself were the only straight women there. *blink* Uh huh... It was the minute I saw a blonde girl going the country mile with another chick right at the bar when the words "Girl! I wanna take you to a gay bar, I wanna take you to a gay bar, I wanna take you to a gay bar gay bar gay bar" got into my head, and now for the life of me it won't get out!   So I'm randomly walking around, humming the tune in my head and it got me thinking. It's not that great a song, but dear God is it catchy! I mean, seriously, it's not often than you can get a room full of people screaming out "I wanna take you to a gay bar", especially when half of the people in the room are homophobic men. :P   Ugh, anyway, clubbing last night, interesting experience. *nods* As I mentioned earlier, started out at Eden and seeing as Dave's buy 2 get 1 free deal seemed to be holding out, I ended up getting incredibly trashed as did my beautiful sister, and then heading out to Surreal, where we somehow managed to fluke getting in on the same ID. :P Anyway, we danced, we drank and we decided that in our very drunken states at about 3.30am we should probably head home! So off we went, getting myself home at around 4... and then calling Mark which was the strangest experience I've ever had.  So weird, he's so innocent, and so Christian, and yet at 4am he's talking incredibly dirty and telling me he'd reconsider his "virgin til marriage" status if I wanted him! *dies* What the?!?!!?! Wow, so strange... and I'm not even going to go into details about the rest of it, it's like... meh... yeh, so strange though.  He confuses me so much, half the time I think he must be doing a Tane, as in telling me the things I want to hear for the sake of not rocking the boat, and then other times he's just so sweet and sincere, I can't imagine why on Earth he'd ever say something to me that wasn't the complete truth.  And then of course he does dumb things like tell me that I'm beautiful.  What kind of person does that? What the hell are you supposed to say to that? Oh gee thanks, I know I am. :P I hardly think that would go down well.  And when I say "no I'm not, you don't need to say things like that" he gets shitty about it!  So what the fuck are you supposed to say?! Grrr...  God dammit I want the fucking boards to go back up.  I have been waiting. *taps foot impatiently* for like days. And it is fucking well time for them to go back up. Yes. Now. Right now.  And I'm still confused about men... Tom, ugh, just  leave me alone mate.  I love you to bits when you aren't following me around like a puppy! Hamish... Well he just confuses me completely.  He tells me he's in love with me and then acts like nothing happened.  John, hrmm... let's just not go there.  Mark. Nuff said.  And Wil, ever-lingering in my thoughts...  Okay, this is totally just procrastination its 12.17am, I have to work in the morning, and my house is a shitheap that I need to clean before my darling (yeah right) mother returns from her trip with her man, and there is absolutely no logical reason for me to be writing this right now other than the fact that I am the best procrastinator in the whole wide world.  Go me.  Ugh, I'm going to post this damn thing and at least do the washing up.  I haven't been able to drink for the past few days because we have no cups, so I think that's a good idea!   Lots of love n such, and do yourself a favor.  Go to a gay bar gay bar gay bar. ;) Sims xoxo
