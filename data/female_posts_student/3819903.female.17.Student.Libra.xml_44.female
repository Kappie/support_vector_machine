We planned this forever, so i went over to Nicole's House at 9:30 to wait and see if anyone was going to randomly show up at her house.  Nope...no one did.  So, in the midst of lying on her couch, I got a phone call from my dad saying, "I'm going golfing, and my clubs are in your car!"  So I leave NB's house to high-tail it over to mine, and drop of his clubs!  So, i asked him who he was going with, and if they need an extra player, to call me up!  There's nothing like playing a championship course for free!  WoW!  So, not 20 minutes later, I get that call saying, "you can play if you get out here as quick as you can!"  So, I rush to put on my "Sunday's Best"- Golf Clothes, and speed there...going 8 over, it still took me 25 minutes to get there!  Oh well, met up with them on the 2nd hole...and gave myself a generous par for the first hole (its a straight shot, easier green, have gotten pars there before).   So, I played 17 holes, with my Dad, Uncle Buck, and my Grandma.  My dad didn't have a hole in one this round, but played so-so, he shot 84,  I played like crap, and should've shot like 84...but shot 90.  Buck shot 92, and hated the fact that his 17 year old neice, beat him!  and my grandma, who's a member there, and note: 75 years old- Shot 103!  My grandma hit the ball so far it was hystarical!  With her demoed, R7, TaylorMade (which is meant for men, who can hit it 250), and my grandma is smacking it down the fairway, like 160 yds!  It was awesome!  Overall a great day for golf, and great game none the less!  So, during my outing, Nicole called me up to see if I wanted to go see  Caberet , at the Sunset Playhouse?  I was game, I love musicals, and to see some racey 1930's acting...I was game!  So Nicole had told me, "it's not a jeans and a t-shirt place, so you need to dress up to some extent."  So I wore my cute little sundress, and Nicole wore black pants.  Certainly with us standing right next to eachother, I looked a little over dressed!  But...we also we the youngest ones there!  Apparently, the whole town of Elm Grove (all old people with money), came out tonight to get aroused!  So I felt a little out of place and a tad over dressed to say the least!  But, overall, the play was awesome, I had never seen Caberet done before, and I was impressed with all the talent!  And, knowing me, the whole time I'm sitting there looking at the guys--not oogling over them-- just trying to decipher if they're gay or not!  It was a pretty hard mission!  But, I came to the conclusion, that only one guy didn't seem so feminine...and he was the one playing the most flamboyant gay there!  He played MC, and had the greatest singing voice, I had ever heard in a musical!  I was blown away, I could've listened to him for hours at a time!  Man, Nicole and I agreed there were some great voices, and some awesome dance scenes!  I definitley would see it again!   So during the 15 minute intermission, we called up the Poker Boys, and asked if they were up for some poker!? But the only thing was...they'd have to wait for us until after the play was done and we were home!  So, they obliged! And Pat, Joe, Sam, Kristen, Nicole, and I played some Hold 'um!  It was a great time...but I definitley didn't win this round!  I was out second behind Joe!  Joe and I were the first one's out!  That's uncommon!  We're usually the last one's standing!  But After I was out I stayed for a little while and watched some more hands, then--due to extreme drowsiness--I went home, I had such a long day it was nuts!  I couldn't even write this on the day it happened! I went straight up to bed, and crashed!   I woke up and tried to remember everything that happened the day before!  And wrote, what I just wrote!  Wow thats weird!   Ok Game plan for today:  Work (gag me!) and then we're seeing The Village, should be good!
