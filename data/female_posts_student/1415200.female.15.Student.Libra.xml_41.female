And yes, I still have welts on my arms. I bet Dan does too. Wow, Corey came back. It's been forever and 3ft since I've seen him. I swear to you he has grown like 3ft. Hes almost as tall as me! Thats really ah-mazing. I don't want to go back to school tomarrow. I think I'm getting sick again. I just got over being sick!! I have a theory that I need my tonsils removed.
