Aww, and a whole two days study leave until I see people again, how will I cope? :P What stupidity, having the ball then doing all our exams! Oh well, it was cool.*two late nights = :|* Sooo tired. I'm actually moving forwards though, tomorrow's my first day of work and I'm going a little bit non-revision crazy which isn't too good... ooops. Sorry pessimism.  urlLink www.nailsea-school-2004.tk  There's the point to this blog. Don't worry, I won't blog during the exams! It's our year's forum thingy so you can talk to people from our year, which is kind of pointless cause we don't not know them yet so we can't isult people!
