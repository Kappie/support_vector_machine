Blah. I don't really care that much, I just don't want to make a tape. That bites.   Math was boring...shock shock. Gym was ok. We started swing dancing. I'm square I guess. I can't swing dance. And French was....eh, it was french.   I just worked on my driver's ed thing during lunch. I guess that wasn't so bad. Then we had an assembly and then...I watched the end of Testament. What a depressing movie. Wow. I don't think I've ever seen anything so depressing.   That was really about it though. My day was so uneventful and now...I have nothing to do which I guess is nice but in a minute way, I wish I was in marching right now. That scares me.   Ah well, I guess I'll go...I don't know. Maybe I'll go sleep. I'm really tired. Maybe I'll take an hour nap. Yeahh, that'd be really nice. :)
