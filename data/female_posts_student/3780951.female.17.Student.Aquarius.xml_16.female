Yes, i have the best leaders, Susan, Randy, Jamie, and Blackman (Travis) and the people there are really cool. I mean, i love ALL the youth workers, you get really close to 'em, ya know! ;-) :-D They have to be the coolest people in the world..i mean, i dont know very many people who want to hang out with a bunch on teenagers at least twice a week! those, my friends, are cool people!!  Well, I start my AC class in the morning, im a little nervous, i'll admit, but nothing I cant handle! Maybe i'll see some of you cool youth workers around..I got class Tuesdays and Thursday at 8 at the Sullivan building!  I love Seinfield, so much that im going to leave my blogging now and go watching!   Love you....
