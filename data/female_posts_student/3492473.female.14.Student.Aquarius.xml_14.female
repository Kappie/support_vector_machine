Between holding hands and falling in love, you begin to learn that: kisses don't always mean something, promises can be broken (just as quickly as they were made), and  sometimes, goodbyes really are forever.   What's the point in smiling if you have  no one  to smile for?  *I'm not supposed to love you, I'm not supposed to care, I'm not supposed to live my life, wishing you were there. I'm not supposed to wonder where you are or what you do, I'm sorry I just can't help myself, I fell in love with you*  When you fall into love, be prepared for the other person to fall out...most relationships  DON'T  last a lifetime!!  I'm gonna smile like nothing's wrong, talk like everything's perfect, act like it's just a dream, and pretend he's not hurting me.  *Not All Scars Show* *Not All Wounds Heal* *Sometimes You Can't Always See* *The Pain Someone Feels*   The closer we grow, the further away we get.
