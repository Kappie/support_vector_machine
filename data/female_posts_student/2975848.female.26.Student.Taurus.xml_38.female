    
       
       The End   A rope around my neck Squeezing more and more Stop feeling the pain Now I’m drown in agony Squeezing more and more I feel my soul leavin My body’s deposed of life Squeezing more and more No tears fallin No regrets Squeezing more and more I’m hanging here alone As I lived my life Squeezing more and more The end is near My last gasp Squeezing more and more No returning No salvation I’m finally gone
