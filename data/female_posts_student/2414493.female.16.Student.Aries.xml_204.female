I had to borrow money from Keira, who took me out to lunch. I had a constant headache. And I was yawning all day long. I tutored, but only for a bit and I didn't know some of the stuff. Probability is old. But I still haven't mastered it.  Sin.   I am more than aware of my own weakness, so when I see others fall from grace it's sadness. And that when I'm cheated that some higher power manages to help me attain revenge. I try not to do anything that slights anyone. But it happens, I guess. And sometimes I'm the one who loses, too. And when it happens, I'm usually powerless to do anything in defense.   I can't declare myself religious in any way, but karma is often a comfort. Let the sinners suffer hell when everything accumulates upon them. It's the only way, really. We suffer from the constraints of societal opinion and personal moral weakness.   I find weak points. We are often unwilling to demolish idols, if I may, but allow me time to pass my own judgments.
