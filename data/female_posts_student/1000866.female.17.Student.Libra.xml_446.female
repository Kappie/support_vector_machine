I gave my drivers ed presentation today. It wasn't bad at all. Boring yes...but not bad.   This is driving me crazy. Haha, like how I go from talking about drivers ed to..."this is driving me crazy?" Haha, whoo, I crack myself up sometimes. Anyway, I wish we hadn't gone an hour behind and stopped marching all at once Not only do I feel like I have a lot of time after school because there's no more marching, but it gets dark so early so it confuses me. I seriously thought it was like...8:30 when it was 5:30 today. It's annoying.  I think I have to go rent Testament again and watch it and get quotes this time. I pretty much just watched it during class, but we have to write a paper with quotes and stuff. Argh. It'd be ok if it didn't need quotes. Ah well.  It still amazes me how great this week has been. I mean...it's pretty much all because of one reason or...well, one person but still. I actually think this week would suck if not for that.  He picked a good week to tell me. :)  Anyway, I guess I should go finish up my cleaning.   Hmmm, I seem to write a lot less in here when I'm happy. I wonder if I'll start writing less in here or not. Probably not. I've actually gotten pretty attached to this thing.
