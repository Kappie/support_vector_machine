I'm from an all girls school, and girl to girl relationship is no surprise or a shocked for me. But its kinda' confusing how they can love each other like that, and I mean head over heels! Some girls I know cry when their special someone wouldn't speak to them or hide something from them. Some wrote endless love letters or kept on smiling when they cherished a special moment with their significant other. Some get tingling all over, even just a sight of their crush or love ones. Hello! What the hell boys are for? One of my teacher said that they haven't feel love yet, and when we do, they will just look at this girl relationship like a funny part of their lives. But if ever a girl liked another girl and vice versa, are they both lesbian? My seatmate keeps on telling me that I'm a lesbian because and don't act like a girl. But I don't get crushes with a girl like her! She said that she was the girl in the relationship, but still, she got into it so what's the difference? Am I, who doesn't act girly, a lesbian or she, who's in a girl to girl relationship, is the lesbian?   How do you actually define a lesbian?
