Brittany Murphy said that in a magizine interview that i read the other day and after that ive had a whole differnt look on life. Ive been    happy  for no reasion really. I smile a lot. I look at my self differently. I always have this excited feeling in my stomach for no reasion at all. This has all happend in like 3 days and these have been some of the best 3 days ever. I havnt done a thing, exept i watched a movie with #3 (witch would have made me really  happy  anyway), ive been out side a lot, planted some flowers, got some picture frames to put some pictures up in my room. But really its just been very ralaxing and  happy . I think it makes me even more  happy  to be  happy  becasue i havnt truly been  happy  for a very very long time. Yea i would be  happy  for like a day becasue something happened. But im  happy  just becasue, i have no reasion and thats really a good feeling.
