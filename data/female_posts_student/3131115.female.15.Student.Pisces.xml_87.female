I'm always afraid of being beat up at the fairs...haha, I get really nervous when I go. I guess it's okay though, everyone likes Bill...so I dont think that I have enemies anymore. I used to have atleast 3 enemies at one time..and somebody always had to give me a dirty look. I remember some stupid clown guy that critisized people, and he made fun of me and Danielle Hand...(yes, I was friends with her at one point)..I got really mad though..Why? I dont know.   I'm listening to The Pixies..hehe, for some reason I've come to love listening to their song called 'Where is My Mind' I belive that's the name...I'm not sure though. I watched the end of Unbreakable today...it's an AMAZING movie. I love it how all the good directors and actors work together, and they're usually about the same people in totally different movies and it's awesome. I was going to watch American History X again today, but I decided to watch Jackass instead because I didnt have enough time, and Jackass is fucking funny. It would have been so cool to see 'ZACKASS'..which was something that Zack Zabor and Bill were going to do...It would have been insanely funny. I wish that they would still do it.   I was picking fleas off of Bills puppy today. I dont know why I said that..I guess that just popped into my head for some unknown reason. Actually, now that I think about it, I was itching (or scratching as most people say) my arm, and that made me think about it. I came to realize right now, that usually when something pops in my head, something triggers it. Like...I always say random things, but I guess that they aren't random to me..just to the other person. I feel soooo dirty this summer. I'm always with Bill really early in the morning and really late at night, so I never have time to take showers. I feel so insanely dirty. I mean, yeah..I make time and all..but this summer, I went 3 days without taking a shower...EWWW! The thing is, is that I dont even realize it either..it's like...shit is going by so fast now. I remember when it was like just starting July, and now it's almost August. Still one full month to go of summer. That seems like a really long time, but I guess that it's not.   Leaving..:'(
