This movie is hitting box offices all time high rates, grossing about 40 million in pounds on its opening day. The trailer is capturing our attention, and so is Tobey Maguire. I'm going to watch it.  EDIT: Right after I posted the entry, my cousin rang me up to ask if I was free today to catch the movie. So I went with my brother to watch Spidey in action. This is the first time I see the whole cinema so packed. Finally, some competition for Harry Potter. All the shows from 1:00pm to 4:30pm were fully booked, except for some lonely seats here and there. Good thing for us we were able to snatch some seats by the side for the 2:00pm show. Nice action-packed movie, I enjoyed the part where he tried to stop the speeding train. But the only thing my brother remembers is the lady with her violin singing her out-of-tune Spider-Man song. Okay, I shouldn't reveal too much for those who have yet to see it. Go watch Spider-Man 2! You don't want to miss it. This might just be the last blockbuster to hit the screens this year after Harry Potter and Troy.
