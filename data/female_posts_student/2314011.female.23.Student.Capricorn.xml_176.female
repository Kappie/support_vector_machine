Have my oral argument in less than 4 hours and can't sit still; can't get my palms to stop sweating; can't focus on my breath; can't get the vision of freezing in front of "The Court" when they ask me an easy, obvious question I've been rehearsing for 3 days.    The fucking thing's not even graded for god's sake.    I'm reminded of my days of high school debate, when the morning before each competition brought similar symptoms (not indications of a disability or request for accommodation, mind you) and I wondered why I even got myself involved in this shit.  But, once the round began and I stepped up to the podium, took a deep breath and began, I was fine and in the zone.    My cold finally took hold last night around 3, when I awoke with terror and avoidance plans, and the medicine is providing a nice haze to the already adrenaline-fuzzy world.    Thank god my power suit has a zipper.  The Chief Justice loves gals with zippers.
