Every time you close that door, Another door is opened.  And every time you say goodbye, a different word is spoken.  Every time you look at me my back is facing you,  And every time you ask to see me I'll have something else to do.  Every time I join your game, You're not playing fair,  And every time I really love you, I pretend that I don't care.
