I could honestly see myself living there when i get older.I get to go back to Germany next summer with my mommie, thats gonna be cool. Its just gonna be like a family reunion thing, almost all of my family lives in germany, so i hardly get to see them. ******ok im gonna vent for a sec... and krissy knows what im talkingabout,bc we endure this shit all the time back ingood ole hick indy( Who's gonna smuggle in the beer? man i need beer! i wish i could drink right now! - this is whatalmost all of my stuck up classmates say, i mean its almost required for them to say that at leastonce a day!)Whats really fucked up tho when u go to Europewith a group of american teenagers is that they are so fucking dumb that they cant get over the No drinking age limitrule. Its like every where we went it was like, omg i cant believe we can drink, i was like um ok, but what about the CULTURE?! I mean ya i had my share of drunken nights and drunken fights with krissy... HEY KRISSY, MY EYES ARE BLURRY! lol yah her and i actually got into a fight bc i said something then took it back! good times! we were yelling at each other in the middle of a street in Austria! lol And u know ur bad off when ur best friend takes the shaving razor away from u... lol well n e ways back to what i was saying is that, when u go to europe and u see so much culture and things that are 1000's of years old, then u make ur way back to Good Ol`e Indiana, u realize what ur missing. I mean in Indy we treasure the Circle, and omg watch out for the Farmers Market, EVERY WED! i mean come on, these arent things to be excited over folks! People might think im just talking about nothing now and maybe laugh at me, but until u go there and realize how big of a joke the US really is, u wont understand. Its like, we only get Patriotic after something tragic happens ( 9/11) or near 4th of july... its almost like our country is a joke.
