I was supposed to go see it with Karen and Anna, but then Tiffany, Desi, Evinne (sp?) and her boyfriend Chris came along. Me, Karen and Anna liked it, it has a good twist. They didn't like it because they didn't understand it. lolz...But I liked it, you should go see it. I crapped my pants...Just because of the suspense. But whatever I liked it. So after the movies when we were leaving it was Me, Karen, Anna, and Tiffany and we were walking to the car and these guys in this car started like following us while we were walking and they were like "hey baby" and shit like that and we couldn't see but we just ignored them. Then they drove off saying "It's because we're Mexican huh?" And so I yelled back "They're Mexican too you dumbass." But whatever, that was the first time I got hit on like that...Weird. lol, but nonetheless was funny.  After the movies we decided to go to McDonald's because we were starving. So we went to one and we ate in and then the night started to get interesting. We went in and the two guys working the counters looked like they were ten....But anyways it was kind of funny. While we were eating Tiff and Anna spotted something and they had a look of shock on their faces so I turned around to see. And THERE WAS A MAN WITH A COLLARED SHIRT IN A BRIGHT BLUE SPEEDO WITH KNEE HIGH SOCKS.... LOLZ.. Karen was sitting next to me and I was like "Look in the reflection, Look in the reflection!!!" And she was like :0 It was so funny. When Tiff and I went looking for him while "getting refills" We heard this guy say "Man, I think I lost my appetite." I got a picture of him on my phone! But um he was far away....I think that's a good thing. hahaha. Then while leaving I elbowed some guy...oops! And then when leaving the place there group of guys were looking at us and I was like "Get in the car before we get raped!" It was Anna's idea to go to that certain McDonald's and I will never trust her again!!! lolz..  Told ya it's never dull with those gals....I had a good time.  Oh ya know what? I really like Alicia Keys... I think she's really Classy. yeap, anyways..  What has recently been on my mind... :D Wellllll... I had a good day except for when David told me that he had to leave for a week.... :( it's only been like a day and I miss talking to him....lolz.. I think I understand when people who have b/f or g/f's feel when they make a big deal about a week when their lover is gone....He isn't my lover, just to set the record straight. lol. Just miss talking to him is all since we talk like everyday.  OOOOhhhhhhh!!! Let me tell you this! lol...  Side note: I think I laugh too much...  Back to my story, David had a dream about me! lolz... Tells you how much he thinks about me ;) I will spare you the details because it's none of your business. But yea, he's a cool guy....He makes me laugh A LOT. And everyone knows how much I love to laugh and make people laugh....That and food. So if I find out he cooks I don't know what I'll do! Hardy har har. Yea....  Ok I think I've written enough....  P.S. My uterus stopped hurting!! yay.
