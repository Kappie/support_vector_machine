Look into my eyes See the eternity I can offer you. No more pain. No more tears falling. Follow me… Follow me… yes! Don’t cry anymore. Let me wash those tears forever. Let me turn you into my queen. You’ll rule beside me, The underworld. You’ll have all your desires satisfied. Guarantied! No more pain… indeed. Drink the blood of his, Suck his essence. Refuse your material life. Refuse your beloved ones. Refuse your beliefs. Refuse your old god. And enjoy your new life, Full of pleasures, Beside me, my sweet midian.
