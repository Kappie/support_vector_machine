I loved you unconditionally But you never loved me back I was waiting for you to love me But love is what you lacked  I dreamt of us together And wondered if you did the same And kept wishing maybe one day You'll stop these childish mind games  Now I don't know what to say Or where to start Because I never dreamed You'd be the one to be my break my heart  I won't think of the good times Or the way you made me feel I'll just forget it all And go to someone whose love is real  The memory of your kiss Will soon be gone And I won't have to wonder anymore If we could've belonged  I say this right now Wishing it was all true But the fact of the matter is Tonight, I'll go to bed and cry over you...
