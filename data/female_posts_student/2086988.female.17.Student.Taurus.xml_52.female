The big 2-0!!! Only one more year until he can drink "legally" lol, yeah he wouldn't do that...He's a good boy! And I love him so much!!!!!!!!! :::sigh::: I wish I was 18 though, life would be alot easier, that's for sure...   I do cherish you For the rest of my life You don't have to think twice I will love you still From the depths of my soul It's beyond my control I've waited so long to say this to you If you're asking do I love you this much I do
