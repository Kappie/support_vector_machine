We had to do our routines to this really loud crap music and I get seriously pissed just listening to the stuff. You can't even really classify it as music...it's just sort of noise with a few catchy melodies thrown in here and there. I seriously felt like injuring the person who made us do hip hop. And, everyone was bugging me trying to borrow my Converse shoes and stuff, and I was like "Uh..no.Go buy your own stupid shoes." I'll shutup now, and stop making everyone elses lives miserable. To make this post more interesting I'll post a poem.  Hourglass  There's no time to remember just time to forget  Visions of you creep through my mind like whispers I never should have heard I never had you and I don't deserve you yet I can't lie and say I don't want you but I can pretend.  Everydays a cherade put on to hide from you I don't need to speak when I have a pen to translate raw emotions into words that you'll never hear cuz they will never escape the pages of this book.  We will always be stuck on opposite sides of the looking glass and I can't break this glass time is running out for us.
