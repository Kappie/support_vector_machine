And well to the readers who have seen our wonderful bolg, I, Natalie( a.k.a the big N, or Natalia), part of the fabulous four, am for the first time since this blog has been published decided to grace everyone with my presence (Partly because up till now my computer has not worked well enough). Anyway back to Seaside and the wonderful girlys who share this wonderful place with me. The countdown has started and only a few days left ( thank goodness, I am desperate for a tan renewal). Two of the very fabulous four have already departed to this very special haven, where all of us girlys can depart from our very hectic schedules and enjoy the sun, fun, and whatever else we can conjure up for our pleasure. This year however I believe that we will be making yet another fabulous documentary,though what it is about has not yet fully been decided upon. Past documetaries include 1. The Pink House 2. Clothing discrimination 3. The Twenty dollar bill As you can see we have quite the imaginations, hehehe. Anyway I probably should wrap this up before I make everyone jealous. So I must run      Ciao,         Natalia         (you know you love me!!!)
