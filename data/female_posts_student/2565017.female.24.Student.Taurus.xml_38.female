I hope it won't result to complete negligence to this blog and rather just even out a bit (no more "5 posts per day" type of thing).  Anyway. School semester is over and ahead is the 11 week summer holiday, of which 8 weeks is working a summerjob. I'm moving back to my parents' house sometime next week. It should be ok. I screwed up a couple of courses this semester and I'm going to have to retake the exams from them next fall. I don't mind, I'll try to bury myself into studying a bit more. We'll see if it works out as planed...cos nothing ever does.  I'm already high on planning an amusement part trip for July with some friends. I hope everyone's schedules can be matched for 1 day, lol. I wanna go get some scary, screamy rides!!!!! Over and over and over and over..... wee hee.  My friend Tatu even suggested we should make it a LARP... Jesus, is he a live-action-rolegame-playing freak or what!! Nah, he just wants me into it too but bleah. I have enough fun in my life anyways :P When it's rides vs. larp, larp is the definite loser.  Hmm, I'm living for the future now, cos present is just a bit boring. I have nothing much to do here alone, except wait for that internship feedback/evaluation-conversation with teacher and supervisor. *sigh* Oh well. I'll be getting it over with. Nothing could be nicer.  And now... I'd like to recommend an online radio for you:  urlLink Live 365  great music from ANY genre, I think.... haven't explored so profoundly, cos I just concentrated my picks to BREAKBEAT!!! surprise, eh?  Have a nice life y'all  :P
