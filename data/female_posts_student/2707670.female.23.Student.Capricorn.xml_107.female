We watched movies, Saran Wrapped a boy's truck and wrote WKU (western Kentucky university) on his back window with maxi pads, sang some karaoke and everyone else had a lot to drink. We had a great time and went to bed around 2am. But at 3:15 am the boys decided it was time to wake us up again. Unfortunatly they can't just call or knock on the door they pounded on it. I thought something had exploded outside. We ended up yelling out the window at them to go home. We got up the next moring had breakfast and cleaned up then we were off to the farm tour. The best part was that Whitney and Leatta were drinking all day. We had fun and got to see a variety of things. Then we ended at Zach's shop where they had this great spread. We had burgers and hotdogs along with chips and fruit and cookies. It was awesome. We eventually ended up going bowling... I don't really know how but it was nice. We made it back to West Lafayette fairly early but we were all tired so we hit the hay. We also all have two tests this week we haven't studied for so we needed to be alive today. Of course I am writing this instead of studying so I could have probably stayed out and got just as much accomplished.
