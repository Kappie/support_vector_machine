Having to not sleep for at least 8 hours and having to not regained a not so good morning made my head swirl in a very explicit and irritable manner. Who would have love this day. Yeah right.. but still.. i cannot help but think of all my damn problems that had always settled on the bottom of my mind.. This is not good for me to see, but the reality seems to slap it on my face that I can do nothing but blame myself for doing such things.. SOBRANG ALANGANIN ng relationship nmin ngaun.. I even feel like he is just sticking to me for the fact that I might go insane if ever he leaves me for Pam.. My whole memory crashes down and my whole individuality seems too low for me to contain all these. Ewan ko.. feeling ko mageexplode na ko.. sobrang gulo.. if only i could wish for my best.. pero it's impossible.. pero sbi nga  ni  elisa.. once you've decided to do it.. then have the initiative to start it and paninidigan mo! well now.. how on earth will i have to have that kind of  attitude when I was born this stupid.. God.. Im losing my sanity!
