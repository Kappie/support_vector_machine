Because it seems that people have this  un -natural (I stress "un", because I know it's not always the norm) tendency to degrade others in an attempt to upgrade themselves. But why? Does an individual really have any right or  ability  to judge other people based on immeasurable standards? Or even on measurable standards...in the case that they haven't measured them. I mean, where do people go along saying that they're "prettier" or "smarter" or "better" than anyone else?   "Hi. Let me take a minute to 'prove' your inferiority to me."   I just don't understand why people have to make everyone inferior to them. Like no one else is worthy of their presence or their time. People just act as though they have a better grasp on life than anyone else. Like everyone else is so much less intelligent. And sometimes, they succeed in making others feel worthless. But you want to know the truth about these people?  They aren't better than anyone.   And I've felt it a thousand times...where someone has to knock you down to boost themselves up.  Or where people brag to make you feel insignificant. I just hate people like that. Because their release of low self esteem is to put others down...and my release of low self esteem is to take it.  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  In other news...   that is all.  Have a lovely day crazies. I'll catch ya later.
