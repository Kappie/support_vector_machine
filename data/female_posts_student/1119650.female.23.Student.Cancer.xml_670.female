You will rise from this like a phoenix, twice as strong and twice as beautiful and expotentially more amazing and wise.  You are someone who breathes life into every place they go and you are cheerful and selfless and someone who would do anything for anyone if you were capable of doing it.  This isn't you and though you've had to retract for fear of words like barbs and daggers tearing at your heart, I know somewhere, you're in there still deep down.  Just your smile can light the way back for you.  Please don't forget to smile.  I love you.  xoxo
