Therefore, from the age of four I was in my school hostel for thirteen years.  I still have memories at the Bishop’s college hostel.  It was 1983 when I first went to the hostel.  I was the youngest out of all girls in the hostel.  The halls were divided into age groups. Age 4-5 hall was called  the “baby dorm”. I can’t remember any exact situations during my stay at the baby dorm, but I do remember everything from “Arc angel’s dorm” (Age 6-12) and “St.John’s” (Age 13-16). The halls are wooded floors, and the beds are lined up separated with a locker for each individual.  We all had the same colored (green) bed spreads, provided by the school. Rule number one was not to sit on the bed while the bed-spread is on.  Yes, it was definitely strict with rules and regulations.  We had to get up at 5.30 am for the bell that rings just on time, and the sound would just pierce through the ears.  After getting ready there would be a 15 minute prayer time. We had separate rooms for the Christians, Buddhist, Hindu and Muslims.  6.30 am is breakfast time. I always looked forward for the food.  The menu was same for each day of the week.  So we would know what is for Mondays, Tuesdays and so on.  No, we couldn’t rush to the dining room. We had to line up according to the age group and go to  the “refectory”.  Even though some of us were not Christians we had to sing the grace before we sat down to eat.  Everyone had to use cutlery provided, no using fingers (Most Sri Lankans use the hand to eat), because that would mean cleaning up the table and laying the table for the next meal.  If we wanted more food, we had to raise our hand and ask for it.  We were given half and hour to finish up and then a bell would ring and everyone had to finish eating and sing the grace again.  We were not supposed to take any food from the refectory. I would never forget the moment, when my friend (Surangi) tried to steal bread and go pass the matron and she ran behind her.  Surangi ran as fast as she could, but she was stopped by the principal and she was punished for breaking the rules. From that day onwards, Surangi was known as the “paan hora” (bread-thief).   Since, we had boarded floors, it was scary at night.  There were stories about ghosts, as the hostel was like 150 years old.  The rumor was that the hostel was a hospital before it was a school. Because we did have hospital like beds and the halls looked like wards.  There were stories like that at certain nights a nurse would push a trolley counting all the patients.  And this nurse had a candle and she would wear white.  This really freaked me out.  The scariest part was hearing footsteps.  One Saturday night I was having trouble sleeping.  I was tossing and turning when I heard the “footsteps”.  It sounded like someone wore high healed shoes and was walking up and down the hallway.  I couldn’t breathe.  My eyes were hurting after squeezing them so hard. I would never forget that day.   	School starts at 7.30 am and goes on till 1.30 pm.  Right after school we would have lunch and then we would have a rest period till 3.30pm and then the same bell would screech for tea time.  After tea it’s play time which is one my favorites.  I was with a small clique of 10 and we would have our own little games, hide and seek, hopscotch, “one-two-three bumble bee” and so many more fun games.  Well next bell was for “prep” time.  I dreaded it so much. Two hours of silence and glued to the books was not fun.  But after that it was diner time and then “shower” time to get ready for bed.  We were allowed to watch TV for half and hour and that would be news.   Bishop’s College hostel was the best time of my life.  I have gone through tears, laughter and every possible feeling that a person could go through.  Learning how to get a long with various people from different backgrounds, abiding by the rules, learning to respect teachers and each other was some of the things I learnt.
