(Wouldn't have it any other way!) Hehe, but then it gets waaay too hard! And every thing's running at you! Aaargh! But I was alright *cough cough* Ok, ok, so I died in about 5 minutes geesh! Aargh, I need to get out of this house! I'm getting all cranky and every one's decided to bug me! Fun aye? Hmm... my dad's about to have his head amputated if he tried to kick me off one more time. PRIVACY! Does that mean nothing nowerdays? (People walk in when you're typing, isn't that private?) *crank crank KABOOM!* Better go! Bubi!
