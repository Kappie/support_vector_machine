Anyways I mean I dont care for him myself.....but he got ragged on so much cuz he is so anti-bush and there he goes and gets photo with the man! But really put yourself in his shoes, if you were there and offered to pose with the president would u say no? I dont think I would even if he is driving our country into the ground. From what I gather hes prolly a nice guy in the wrong job...well hell we all know he is in the wrong job but ya know! I will try to put the picture somewhere on my blog!
