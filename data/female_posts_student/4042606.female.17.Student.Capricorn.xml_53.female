After I finish posting this I will probably go and take a nap. Hopefully Ian will be able to post this. For some reason I am only able to type it, then I will sit and rot. Luckly Ian has been doing the uploading for me. I heard about Michelle, I don't know her so I won't make any comments. I know though that Ian and his friends will be able to handle it, their tough.  On a much lighter note, I have heard that the south park characters are causing much more trouble then they are actually worth. So, I am not even going to deal with them anymore and just delete them. I worked hard on those too...
