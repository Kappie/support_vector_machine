It shows so many deep levels and meanings and is completely kickass. A) Dumbledore's not afraid of him and Voldemort knows it. B) To show Voldemort that he's still human and able to die. C) Dumbledore thinks calling him by his (in his opinion) unintimidating title is silly. He only calls Voldemort "Voldemort" around other people. D) Dumbledore's just calling him by the name he had at school.   I don't know, I get this thrill every time he does it. Yes, it does turn me on. I'm totally turned on by 150+ year old fictional wizard.   McGonagall: The way she was combating Umbridge at every turn, making her AWESOME, and the way she was still totally strict/unfair/etc./old self .... she's actually one of my favorite characters. One of her best lines is "The YuleBall is of coursea chance for us all to - er - let ourhair down." Also "May I offer you acoughdrop, Dolores?" ALSO,"I wonder how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continueto interrupt me? You see, I do not generally permitpeople to talk when I'm talking." She's. Just. So. Frickin. Cool. She's like an older, more sarcastic version of Hermione.  That green pastel Bug is still sitting in my neighbor's driveway. I'm SO bored today. I ought to be reading a book or something. And my internet is still acting up, so don't be surprised if I am kicked off, etc. Ohhh - do I hear the beginnings of a storm?  I have to pack for camp tonight. I loooooooathe packing and unpacking. Sometimes suitcases sit in my room unopened for days.
