Quoth the lovely  urlLink Anna :  "This summer, New York City's most eligible bachelorette will join Greenwich's most eligible bachelorette on a trip to PARIS fuckin FRANCE. This will be directly following our spring break trip to Las Vegas.  It's time to take action. I guess with all the hair and body stuff Ive done and now this, it's safe to say my mothers death has affected me in the sense that, hey, you only live once, and Im gunna do everything I want to do, Im gunna find a way, and Ive found a way to do this, so Gwen and I will make short stops in Italy, England, and Spain, and then vacation with bagettes, hot men and the Eifel Tower. "   This changes things...My new to do list: 1. Lose 20 lbs by April (thanks to kickboxing I can do it) 2. Go shopping for  real  binkis with Anna for Vegas. 3. Polish up on my french and spanish and try to learn Italian.  I've got the important basics down for France and Spain (Voulez vous coucher avec moi? and Dame un beso), just need to learn something flirty in Italian.
