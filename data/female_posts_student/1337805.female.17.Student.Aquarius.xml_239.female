I stood in there for about 2 minutes before my feet went numb and I couldn't feel them anymore. Then me and Ayla ran out and into the nice, warm hottub....where I proceded to not move until about 6. Ayla brought me juice and pop and water and crackers and a popsicle (she was my cabana boy) and we just hung out..I was trying to tan..I think I only browned my face, if anything. Oh well. My bathing suit slowly changed from dark blue to purple to pinkish...The chlorine in the hottub I guess was slowly dying it..soo..oops. Guess I need a new bathing suit before I can go swimming in public pools again :P Sorry Laura.   Other than that, pretty dull day. KILLER cramps in block 2 and 3. It was gross. I feel really pretty right now, I'm just wearing jeans, a bra and a wifebeater...so simple :) Just renamed and organized most of my music too. The big test is coming up, listening to all my songs and deleting the ones I don't like, as well as converting all the .wma files to .mp3 so I can have the option to burn them onto an Mp3 cd....what a nerdish life I lead. I'm out.
