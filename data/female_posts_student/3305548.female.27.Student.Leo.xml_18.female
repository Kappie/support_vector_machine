I was registered for two classes but due to what I learned when I conquored the financial aid office, I opted instead for one class each summer session.  Financial Aid Debriefing:  After looting and pillaging their main headquarters and taking down their General Ignorance, and waiting patiently in their "waiting area," I spoke to a financial aid counselor. Who, informed me, that if I was only registered for 1 Summer Session that I would get less financial aid. (?!?!?!?) Right-oh then, it was about $1000 less for the summer package total with only being registered for one session and that just wouldnt work out at all. So I split my schedule like pea soup (but less green) once more. I dropped the class for which I havent received the book (its somewhere out there in never never land and I am going to return it the SECOND I get my hands on it....) However I am still amazed at how the only way I can get accurate and reliable information is to go to the Financial Aid office in person.  That seems like a poor choice in information dissemination for a school that sponsers a distance learning/online class program. It just doesnt seem to mesh.  Right well, after the ordeal of the financial aid office and schedule changing again (I am at the moment taking Statistics 511 for Summer Session 2 - joy of joys) the troops (my husband and I) decided to relax and enjoy Morgantown a bit.   Oh and before we went to the FA Office we took a tour if Lakeside Village - a psuedo apartment complex that we are likely to move into when we go to Morgantown. Its quite nice really in alot of ways. It feels smaller than the floor plan I drafted to match the website, and the apartment we toured was a mirror image of the floorplan I drafted out...so it was a little backwards. The closets were nice, the overall apartment was nice...but it was smaller than expected, and we could have some storage and furnishing issues potentially. However the apartment we were in is not the apartment we would move into. Most of them are different from the apartment we visited and vary on the floorplan slightly...and the kitchen counter color (thank god! - it was mauve and most of them are forest green!!!) The porch for the downstairs was very unimpressive - a concrete slab - the decks are only upstairs even though they are portrayed in the floorplan on the website as upstairs and down. I think the Master Bedroom was lacking a little in size and good design. But we can hope a place that comes open at the right time for us might be better laid out in that department. The Manager Pat was very nice and we were impressed with the overall grounds.  Okay, so now for the movie! After the FA office we went and caught a matinee at the mall and saw Shrek 2. I dont normally care for sequals much but Shrek 2 took the cake. The animation style and character designs were unchanged, but the story line was even better. The villain was much improved and helped the story along immensly. I really liked that the villain is not some ugly or malformed or inherently evil character - someone quite pleasant and pleasing who just has a character flaw if you will.   Puss in Boots was well done by Antonio Banderas if not slightly underwritten - my hubby thougt he seemed like dead weight at times, and I suggested he didnt have enough lines or personal character development. The soundtrack was excellent per expectations. The Counting Crows song was very nicely done, the version of "I need a Hero" was awesome - both in the movie and in the credits, and the Police/Sting cover was way cool. What I loved about this movie - the first one was about the support of friends/best friends - this one was about support of family and teamwork among friends. The theme was different and played well. I loved the contemporary references. They were done sooooooo well and are very current :) There are plenty of them too - and they are consistent. I like the way they play with the fairy tale world more. Everything from the shady bar and the characters within, to the appearances of the various characters at the ball. I like the overall comparison of Far Far Away to Hollywood/Beverly Hills. It plays well, and serves as a great contrast to the swamp. Another theme of Shrek 2 that they get just right is the concept of changing for the ones we love. They hit it home without breaking the bat. I like movies that use power without force. Since it was a mid week matinee during the school year we were in a nearly empty theatre...with only a few toddlers and homeschoolers about. Most of the university population had left town (unless they were taking summer classes) so it was a nice empty theatre. Bonus! I totally recommend viewing Shrek 2.   After the movie we went to our absolute favorite restuarant in Morgantown - Asian Garden. They serve a full menu of Thai, Chinese, and Malaysian food in both meat and meatless versions. According to some vegans I once knew all of their meatless dishes are vegan as well. You can get anything there - I swear. We ordered Bathing Ramna -er yeah- its a beef dish served with broccoli and peanut sauce. Its Thai :) Its delicious!  Then we headed home. On the way home we talked about my potential future jallopy and whether Luke wanted to trade in his Jeep or not for a more fuel efficient (albeit older) car. The jury is still out on that one. When we got to town we sped by our old house on the south side of town and met the temporary occupants and their kittens as I searched for the book discussed above that hasnt yet found me.  We then headed to some car lots to peruse potential junkers for me to drive :) I found a cool (read: old and retro) mercedes 83 station wagon...which it turns out they want 2995 for (ug...) I doubt its the jallopy for me. I called the small time dealership about it today...I am a little surprised they want so much for it considering I could spend the same thing on a car 10 years younger (1993 Ford Somethingerother with fewer miles and less issues...) across the street. *baffled* He said he doesnt bargain...but I will let him sweat until August and if the car is there then - offer to take it off his hands for $2000...or not. As I mentioned before it just might not be the car for me. A nice used Saab on the other hand....(not that we will find one around here...) What is it with me and Euro cars?  Oy, I am having a hard time focusing today!  When we got home from our excursion a "toy" was awaiting us...our very own Minolta Z2 digital camera!!!! Wooot. Thus the photo of my cat posted in the blog below this one :) We played with our toy for a bit and then crashed for the night. What a day it had turned out to be.  Minimal (read: No) blood was spilled in the FA office at WVU - I was feeling generous and there were too many witnesses anywho. I decided to go undercover as a confused and nice grad student...it worked like a charm.  I FINALLY got a call from the BREW beagle rescue place (I think I applied like two weeks ago...) and the lady wanted me to contact them again a month before we were moving. Fun fun. All this waiting around is going to kill me. Waiting for car, waiting for money, waiting to lose weight, waiting to go to Morgantown, wait wait wait..."Hurry Up and Wait" (Blondie - "Sunday Girl") I am extremely patient...sometimes...with kids, with animals, with most people, but I am not good at just waiting...for long periods of time.  *sigh*  all the news in fits of print...  oh and i saw an article about the highway bill and how bush is threatening to veto it if its not under a certain cost....which would be way too low to accomplish much. part of the highway bill is funding things like filling pot holes and whatnot across the US...odd that Bush mentioned to the Parkersburg mayor when he was in town that the mayor needed to "get those pot holes fixed" and now he wont approve a program that would pay for it. ironic to no end.  --mack
