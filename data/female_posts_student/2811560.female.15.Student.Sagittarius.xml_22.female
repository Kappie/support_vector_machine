Got 2 CDs- Abra Moore and The Best of Gershwin. Yep, I'm a nerd. So it turns out this Alan D. Perkins (new band director) guy is coming for a little visit this week. I can't wait. Its really scary because this year is a huge turning point in Lake Park Marching Band history. We're either gonna end up sucking really bad, being really mediocre or being really awesome, and no one really knows where we're headed. This guy must be good, though. We'll just have to go with the flow and hopefully everything will turn out well. Today kinda sucked though, I puked 3 times this morning. Damn bagel. Meh.
