We went to see The Perfect Score and its a good movie. :P Yay! lol ok  *off the phone with Lauren* (haha)   "Does it look like i need the answers?!" "It looks like u need a pimp!" LMAO ok i love that..haha no one would understand unless they saw it all go down...  Im mad!! ahhhh The whole thing with cat and joe and hooking them up just so i can see the look at catherines face when she actually sees him (hes sooooo butt ass ugly and i dont like cat) back fired! ugh. I totally forgot joe had access to a webcam and that he kept a picture on his profile. UGH how stupid am i?! well i figured cat wouldnt be bright enough to look at his profile, since i dont usually look at profiles and im brillant haha, well she did...i guess hes smarter than i thought. BUT seeing his ugly ass face, she still wants to meet him in person! AHHH what is wrong with her?! SHE MUST BE A FUCKIN ALIEN DEPRIVED OF ALIEN SEX IF SHE WANTS HIM! AHHH EW GROSS *BARF-A-TRO-IOUS* yuck. well, still--people do look different in person at times, i know i do, so im still waiting to see her face next weekend (if all works out) when we go to the mall. MUAHAHAHAH *evil face* She cant stop talking about him. Joe this joe that, joe is awesome, joe is perfect, joe likes singing in the rain, unc, and art AND hes not gay...well no shit, of course hes not gay, wait..i take that back, i bet hes gay and is just lookin to be seen with anyone to make people think hes into girls. THATS WHY HES FRIENDS WITH GAY LORNE. there we go!! lol like i said, im brillant. :D I asked cat if joe was cutier than charlie, a guy she had talked to a long time ago, and knowing that charlie is prob HOTNESS compared to joe, cat said "umm apples and oranges" OMG she went on for DAYS about how ugly charlie was, and im going on for DAYS about how ugly joe is...but hey, this boy is ugly. I may sound mean but then again i never said i was the hottest thing on this earth, but i would be compared to joe. I guess my point is that i was trying to be mean to cat and my plan failed. NOW i really want them to hook up and be happy...and i wanna meet this jonathan dude that goes to central and ( i didnt know this at the beginging but hes friends with Lorne..opps) I saw him on his cam and hes such a cutie!!! hes a freshman, but he doesnt look like one. Oh well, who cares anymore? He would just have to be AT LEAST 15. Thats all i want cuz some 10th graders are still 15. NOT 14, HE CANT BE 14! lol I think i mentioned in a previous blog that joe told me lorne would kill jonathan if he ever got involved with me--all the better. it would make lorne hate me :D yay.
