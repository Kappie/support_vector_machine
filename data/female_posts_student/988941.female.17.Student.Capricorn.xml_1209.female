I hope everything is OK.   I have a dent in my head above my eye from where I hit my head on the corner of the corner seat yesterday. Grrr. Then i had to go to work. To do the delivery. But it didn't even turn up. Which is good because that means not much work this weekend. Hehe. But it meant I kinda wasted 2 hours (paid though) when I could've gone and joined in with the quiz night. Grr. Fine.
