Because I wish stuff would go back to the way it was back then. I mean, have you ever looked back on something and been like "wow...I was so happy." Or you start to think about someone who's sorta been in the back of your mind, and you're like "wow...I really really cared about them. They really made me happy." It's nice to think of things like that. The only really sad thing is that you probably don't even hardly cross their mind anymore.  I was also thinking back to this past summer...like, the very beginning of the summer, and camping and such. Those were good times. Just...happy. I'm always so alive in the summer...God, I love it! I remember nights I would just stay up all night, just happy over nothing, and then being so tired at work the next day, but so blissful. I remember one day at work, I was so tired, yet so peacefully happy that i just watched the pool water around me in awe, and I just closed my eyes, put my face against the sun and soaked up the warmth.  Wow...I just suddenly got carried away. Didn't even realize I was typing.  Summer makes me happy. I wish it was summer. :-\  Goodnight you crazies.
