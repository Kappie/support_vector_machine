I'm in Lauren's basement, folding sinner papers." -Dave talking to someone on his phone  Last night, I went street witnessing with the evangelism club from school. Two kids accepted Christ, and that made the whole hour and a half of praying in the freezing cold and being ridiculed for it completely worth it. After we were done, we went back to Lauren's house and after watching Lauren's 13 year old brother smoke Dave and John in ping pong, we watched Gladiator. I won't even try to explain all the ways that movie will never be a serious experience for me again, what with Charlie and Dave's commentary. It was a really amazing night.
