We had dinner and then snuggled up on the sofa, with candles, a lava lamp and Elgar's cello concerto.  And talked.  And talked. And then talked some more.  So at 4am we decide that we should probably go to bed, so we get into our PJs and are about to go to sleep when suddenly Lizzy realises that there is a fire outside the back of the house.  She goes out to investigate and it really is quite a large, uncontrollable fire.  She lives in a terraced house, where they all have quite small long gardens and at the back of the garden a few doors down this fire was raging.  Was also quite dangerous as it backs onto the local hospital.  So Lizzy rings 999 and suddenly not 1, not 2 but 3 fire engines come with lights flashing and everything.  So there are Lizzy and I in our PJs stood in the middle of the street with 3 fire engine's worth of firemen - some women's dream come true!  They eventually put the fire out, which was probably started by some kids or something and we crawl into bed at 5am. But by this point we are like totally awake and its almost light out, so we got out Vinyl Cafe that I happened luckily to bring with me and listened to the 'Jock Strap'!  Sleep followed immediately.  Woke up at er....1:30pm.  Felt like a proper student, but pretty rubbish (scanky - UK version of the word) too. Started remembering everything that happened last night, or should I say this morning - and at first thought that I had just been dreaming.  So it was an interesting night all round! Not sure I'm going to sleep tonight now though. Oh well.  Oh just remembered about Survivor predictions!  I can't believe tonight is the last night!  mexx
