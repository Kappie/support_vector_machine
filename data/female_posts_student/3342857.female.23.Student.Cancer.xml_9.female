Hm....today TY is again in doubt on her path again...everytime i see her like this, it just makes me feeling helpless because i know i just don't know how to help her. I seriously hope that she can take things as it goes....to her, i might seems to be someone who's immature, someone who's brain is still not fully developed yet...in terms of thinking but i think i've been taking things the way i want it to be (at least it's not dwelling too far away)...i have been in a playful mood...not because i really like it but because if i am to be down like the rest then things won't be better either...i think this world always need a clown-like personality person to cheer up everyone.....in the next few post...i'll describe more about my personality...
