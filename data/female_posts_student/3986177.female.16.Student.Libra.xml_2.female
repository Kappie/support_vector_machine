Kloz Ncounta had a tryout for ‘miss teen philippines’ today n I was gonna miss it. I replied with a "fine then!" n went back to sleep angry. When I woke up I got over my bad mood very quickly =). My mum n dad went shopping and my sister went to work. Hehe that meant I had the hoouse all to myself!! I played sum music full loud, danced round like a complete psycho, played da piano n sung as loud as I could, did cartwheels n flips in my living room, hung with my baby dog chucky, watched harry potter, ate migoreng and even did sum of my homework! It was entirely ‘ella’ time n I lurvved it. Do whatever u want, whenever u want, however u want… its da best feeling!! I’m sure many people could argue that I could’ve used this time more productively and I should be doing sumthin more worthwhile, but lemme tell u this; doing sumthin that u love IS worthwhile. Its what keeps me sane, seriously! Haha I bet I know what ur thinking now, "this comin from a chick who likes doing cartwheels in her spare time"… Well all I’ve got to say is it makes me a happy little vegemite =) oh n ur mean. Haha getting of track… back to being alone in my funky spunky house. Eventually I got tired of being a psycho n plonked my ass down on da sofa. I didn’t move for 3 hours… well I slept for 2hrs n 15mins but for the remainder I literally sat, stared and thunk my brain to bits.  I thought about so many things. Funny how the mind works. One thing links to another which links to another, and soo on. In the space of one second its probably possible to think at least 3 different thoughts. I was there for 45 minutes -_-  The subject that crept up the most were my friends. So dats wat this blogs about. If ur my friend (and u know that u are) all I have to say is thankyou n I luv u all to bits. It makes me soo warm and tingly inside knowing I got people like u guys who care about me. Recent events brought this back to my attention. For those who don’t know I’ve been sick for more than a week. And although I hated it and I neva wanna go through that agen, it all made it worthwhile. The day before the big competition, Elite, Kloz Ncounta were at pcyc practicin. That’s when "The Fever" struck. I was lying down n shivering n I dun really remember much but everyone givin me jackets to keep me warm, sittin on my frozen toes, givin me yummy tea, and all tellin me I’d get better, it’ll only last a day, I’ll be able to dance in Elite. I seriously didn’t think I could, which made me cry cuz I didn’t wanna let all these special people down. We worked so hard to get this far n I was bout to ruin it all. *sigh* I was sucha sad sight, I got everyone down in the dumps. Great way to finish day day, huh? Well I gotta say a huge thankyou goes out to martin n richard who took me home that day. In a taxi mite I mention! I still say a bus would’ve been fine, $20 cheaper as well… nah jkz… for real, they’re my heroes. The next day I got many many messages from my friends who cudn’t make it. Sorry if I didn’t reply guys!! They meant a lot to me. All saying good luck n go get that trophy!! Haha even Anna called up straight afta she got back from the ski trip to ask how it was! My bestest cuzzin celina called up her friend durin our performance to ask how we were doin! My friends are da best =) Big thanku to mei, cath n louise who hauled their asses all da way to blacktown to watch! Ooh n dariusfor taking me home n for being the wonderful person dat u are.  With all this positive attitude n encouragement, who wouldn’t get better? I swear God must luv me. Make that me AND martin cuz I got him sick after he took me home. We were cured (even if it was only for dat 6 minutes we were on da stage). I wouldn’t trade that experience for the world. U know wat its like to have so many people cheering for ya? Puts u up on a high n u dun come down for hours… days even!! Hahaha I’m onto another topic… well maybe I’ll talk bout it more next time cuz I’m getting tired n I bet u dun wanna hear more mindless babble from my mouth. One last big THANKYOU and I LUV U to all my friends out there. Having u guys around makes me truly believe that I am da luckiest girl in da world =)
