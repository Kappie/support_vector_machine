I'm hiding myself. I always ruin everything. I'm ugly. I'm fat. I'm incredulously spontaneous. I am unorganized. I'm messed up. I'm beat up. I'm wandering in hopeless dreams. I spend my day in never going to come true fantasies. I hide my thoughts and feelings in stupid poems and in the pages of books. I stay up late so my mind can not think about my day because it's too sleepy. I ward off others so they have no chance of ever hurting me. I can't admit when I cry, weeping...     What's the use in living anymore? What do  I  have to live for? I bet if I killed myself that no one would miss me either. I bet no one would care to come to my funeral at all. I bet they'd have a party to celebrate that I'm out of their lives, 'cause all I ever do is slip up and do all of the wrong things. I'm not nice and sweet and perfect... Nope, I'm just mean, cold hearted, and the farthest from being perfect that a human being with a heart can be... I suck. I should go to hell after all of the mean things I have done. I shouldn't be alive. I don't deserve the friends that I have. I mean, they're everything I'm not. I don't deserve my friends or my family or my neighbors... Why am I living? I've got no use here on Earth! I'm a pathetic excuse for a human being! God or whoever the hell created me must have been fucking insane when creating me because I am completely and totally worthless. I'm  WEAK ! I CAN'T BELIEVE I SHOWED THEM HOW I WAS FEELING.  WHAT WAS I THINKING?  I should have known that it wouldn't help... I should have known that no will EVER understand the pain I feel... GOD, I WAS SO STUPID.     If I could, right now, I'd hurt myself... But, no... I'm not allowed to because I made some stupid promises to my family that I wouldn't do anything like that... Well, who gives a damn about what I can and cannot do according to other people?? Well, I can tell you right now, at this very moment, I do not care at all on what other people have said. All I know is that I am DYING inside right now and that I HAVE to make it stop before it all completely breaks down and all hell breaks lose. I've had that happen once before and it wasn't too pretty... I need something to releive all of my freaking feelings that go away. I NEED something to do it. I hate it! I can't control the way I'm feeling no matter how much I try. I HATE LIFE! I can't control anything that goes on in it. I can't do anything right. I'm worthless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
