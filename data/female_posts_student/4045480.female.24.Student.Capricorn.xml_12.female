No craziness, no hassle, I just wish it was warmer so I could bask in the sun and enjoy the pool. But it's August in Chicago and we're having a record breaking cold spell, I swear I wanted to go pick a pumpkin out today it was that cold.  I did get a case of the blahs today, I had to get out of the house so I got in the car and drove. I wasn't hungry, but I needed something. I found myself pulling into the local TJMaxx, and had some shopping therapy, and then went to Cheeseburger in Paradise with KJ and on to see Anchorman, funny movie, probably not his best but it worked. I dunno, maybe all this stress about school and work and sick friends was finally getting to me.  And I can breathe a sigh of happiness, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IS BACK ON!!!! Yes, I am a huge football fan, and I love Monday Night Football, even when I don't care who wins. Pre-season Bears are just around the corner, yeah! I don't think we are going to win this year, just be better than last year. A girl can live without a man, but she can't live without her football.
