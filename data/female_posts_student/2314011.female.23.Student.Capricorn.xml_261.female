She felt the familiar tug to write, the one she's felt circling for a month, 30 miles ago and doesn't care how long she'll have to stay here to get it all down.    With every passing mile and new-yet-perfect song, the last two weeks and years slide into place.  She watches from her new perch, marveling and remembering and letting go.  She suddenly found herself up here on a lazy day last week.  The one they gave themselves to recover from their adventure on the coast.  It felt much like the first time there together, what with the U2 on the stereo and wall coverings about to change.  And at the same time, it felt like only last year, when every minute was taken by all by itself.  This realization came as they sat on her couch, him with his sketches, her with her lunch and revelations.  They're both at the top of their respective hills, after much work and toil, they're finally at the place they weren't completely sure they'd reach.  At first it seemed odd to actually be here, in one piece and so...content.    She's spent more time than usual thinking about the path(s) behind her.  Not longingly or jealously, but because she knows it's almost time to leave them where they lay, behind, for good.  She's about to start a new path and it may be a while before she's able to see this far in all directions again.  She's caught somewhere between something's end and a new thing's beginning.  And even though part of her is still sad at the end, it's almost habit to rejoice at the beginning, the change, the shift.  They've been good to her, even when she didn't know it at the time.  And when old habits start kicking in, telling her to figure this new thing out, she returns to the seeds planted over Christmas, about enjoying the quiet, the calm and the not moving.  She's learning to rest in the pause at the top and bottom of each breath.  It whispers to her and the messages are easier to hear (and follow) than the shouts and shoves that used to guide her.  The person she's been becoming is settling in and is about to take over.  But for the moment, everybody's resting, taking stock at the oasis she finds herself at.       She gave a bit of herself to someone again for the first time since she loved completely and remembers why she waits patiently, finding comfort in knowing such gifts won't hurt as much as she feared.     She's lived up to all her hype and is finally comfortable with being bored.  Soon she'll be ready to go journeying again, to explore and learn big things with a vengeance.  For now, though, she's enjoying the view, the adventure, exploring and learning while she sits still and lives in the pause.
