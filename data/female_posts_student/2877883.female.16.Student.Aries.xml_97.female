Four more days.        Hopefully I shall be malling with the Sar-dog at the Rockingham Mall at this time tomorrow. Exciting. H=major wootage.        This weekend= Maine with the Sar dog aussi. I am super psyched for that because we have to work on our tans sooo badly.        I really really need to start working on my AP US History stuff. Maybe. I think I shall go clean instead.
