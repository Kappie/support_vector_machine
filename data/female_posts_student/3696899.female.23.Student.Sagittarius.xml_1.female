Phone calls back and forth to the case manager that is working with my dad, and calls back and forth with medical records, along with the lawyers office.  Not to mention all of the calls recieved from my sister today!!  Good Lord help me! Well all of this mess and still feel like nothing is being accomplished.  I am afraid that I am going to have to take power of attorney over his finances and this is a very big deal.  I dont know if I am ready but now I have to be.  If this is the one thing that I do for my father I want to do this right and I will need alot of support and will be getting all of it from my wise and beautiful mother.  Not to mention my second mother Cathy and my best friend Mandy.  You guys I am going to need alot of help.  I hope I am not bald in two weeks. Well that was my day, have the lawyers appointment tomorrow!?!? Letcha know, see ya.
