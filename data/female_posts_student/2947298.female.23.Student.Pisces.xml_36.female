In order of most Liked:  urlLink Reel Big Fish ,  urlLink Street Light Manifesto , and  urlLink BadFish  (a Sublime Tribute band) I was so happy Reel Big Fish played my fav songs!!!  urlLink  Take On Me  ,  urlLink  Beer   and  urlLink  Where have you Been?   they have most excellent break up songs! And I had a very exhausting weekend and had tons of friggin work to do, but u know me I manage.... and on a side note (song lyrics): You say you need me more than anyone else well go to hell- where have you been? No way! You wish! I don't need this! What makes you think I'd ever want you again? Yeah right! As if! I don't need this What makes you think I'd ever want you again? - Reel Big Fish  to the only break up I have to be bitter about, Dave to you the only guy who ever broke up w/ me EVER, and you did it twice w/ in a month dude! It's good to be ur friend again... Hopefully the only too.... No matter what getting broken up with sucks and feels like a huge rejection ick...
