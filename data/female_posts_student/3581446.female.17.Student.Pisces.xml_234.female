While I let my cheese sauce bubble a bit, I slowly sidled up to my new little buddy to inspect it more closely.   "Why, hello there, little friend!" I said with a chuckle. I tried to pet it, but when I brought my finger closer to him, he backed off and cringed in fear. "Don't be afraid!" I whined rather pathetically, "I'm your friend! Please let me be your friend. plz." But to no avail; my pleading fell on deaf ears. I sighed softly and tried once more, fully expecting my new little pal to walk away or die instantly of fright because I'm so scary looking and stuff, instead it did something completely unexpected: it jumped!   Even though that scared the living shit out of me, I usually go out of my way not to kill any bugs, and try to give them freedom. This is not because their smeared carcasses are just really disgusting, but it's because I have a healthy amount of respect for all things living. I believe that every animal, no matter how small, should have the right to get married and live a good life without me trying to destroy it because they frighten or disgust me, which is why I wish someone else would just kill the fucking bastard and get it over with.
