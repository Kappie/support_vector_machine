The mind produces happiness thoughts, excitement and encouragement. But it is also a dangerous thing. It’s the place where sinful desires are thought up, coaxed to come in.   Anyway, I had better jot down and think through what I’ve learned last week at conference before I lose it all and it’ll just be another conference which I went to during the holidays.  It was Ps Ross Parsley who spoke on Thursday’s morning session. He spoke on worship, naturally, since he’s the worship pastor of his church. I even went up to the pastor after the session and said thank you, which is so totally not my self to do that. Strange, God is changing me. Serious, although I see it all the time- people going up to my dad after the service to ask him stuff or just thank him for the sermon, I have never in my life thought of going up to thank the preacher who had just given a good sermon.  Just the night before, I was talking to Rachel bout worship and how I struggle, in a sense. Mainly because I’ve too much influence from everyone- family, friends, preachers. My family especially, they warn me that I should never just absorb anything like that. I should always think and check through whether its from God or not.   And yes, I must say that its totally my fault, but lately over the months and years, I’ve let that awareness become a hindrance. Hindrance in the way like I cannot worship God whole heartedly because my mind is distracted on whether the lyrics and everything happening around me… whether its from God or not. Yes. For the past few years, that’s been what its been. Ask my close friends, they know. I have not been able to settle this issue of mine until last Thursday.   Hmm. Its 3.30 am. I think I’ll continue later on today cos’ if my dad or mom walks thru the door now, I am officially a dead person. Night.  Back. It’s 2.30 pm now. I woke up at a quarter to noon after sleeping at 4 early this morn. Weird.   Yes, back to where we originally came from: worship, doubts, hindrances, and God.  Mmm yeah the pastor used the passage of Luke 7, Jesus anointed by the sinful woman. The one with the alabaster jar.    And then he read out verse 47, “herefore, I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven-for she loved much. But he who has been forgiven little loves little” What immediately flashed through my head was me. That you know, I was brought up in a Christian family, dad as pastor and all. And yeah I had been thinking of that thing that week. I remember a friend telling me ‘those who were brought up in a Christian family aren’t true Christians because they don’t know what it really feels like to be without God since they have known God ever since they were born.’ I was pretty hurt by that, considering I looked up to him as a leader and wah, he is so obviously talking bout me, bout my friends.  Anyways, after Ps Ross had read that passage out, and after all those things in the paragraph above had flashed through my mind, which probably took like 3 secs, Ps Ross said something that totally tallied with what I was thinking.   It doesn’t mean that we have to have a real horrible life and then repent to mean you have been forgiven much and therefore love much.  -Whoa, really? It’s about your judgment towards forgiveness/repentance. It’s about whether you’re willing to repent and not judge others being more sinful than yourself.  -Woohoo.  We can’t prove by our actions that we’re more godly than others. Its not about our own actions/deeds. Like Simon (the Pharisee Jesus was having dinner with), he trusted his actions to save him. But no, you gotta come and be yourself before God.  Simon needed Jesus as much as the woman did.   Another thing, sometimes we seem to spend the first few songs repenting and confessing to God because we feel like we need to feel worthy before God before we start worshipping Him. But instead of doing that, we should face the facts that no matter what, we are still memangpun unworthy to worship God. We should never God that we are never worthy. But it’s because Jesus has died on the cross for us that we are able (able, not worthy) to come to God and worship Him.  So we should come prepared to worship God. Not saying that you aren’t supposed to repent. You are, you should.   That was like yeah, cos I usually spend my time thinking on blah ah I don’t feel worthy to worship God today. Fact is I never will be. But since I’m given the chance, seize and worship la. Adoi. Never dawned on me till that day.   Back to Simon not realizing he need Jesus as much as the woman did, sometimes we tend to feel that way too. Like we have everything at our feet, how do I feel like I need God desperately? (Note- the band is called Desperation so through out all the workshops, the word ‘desperate’ was used a lot.) Well, once again, God works through brokenness. So we gotta be desperate all the time as if we have a crisis. That’s what the pastor said.   Here’s what I make of it, we shouldn’t take things for granted when everything is fine, when the storm has passed. We should be thankful that we’re alive but always live as though the storm will come tomorrow. And therefore, always be grateful. And in a sense, we can function out of that gratitude and be erm, desperate for God.   Of course, of course, we worship God because He deserves it and we wanna glorify God. Hehe, just a clarification there.  And sometimes you know you get the feeling (hah, its all about feelings, ain’t it?) where you don’t feel like worshipping? But you know you should be so you open your mouth and sing but inside you’re feeling all depressed and all that.  Is that hypocrisy? I always thought so you know.  But the pastor said that many a time people misinterpret that is being a hypocrite- when your actions aren’t lining up with what you’re feeling inside.  He said that hypocrisy is when your actions don’t line up with your convictions, what you believe is true and right.  That totally makes sense to me. Gotta go read up some more though.   Oh you want a gist of my notes on how you should worship? I know you don’t. But read on, please.  1.	be purposeful- if you draw near to Him, He will draw near to you.  2.	personal- make it intimate and personal, not general stuff 3.	passionate- we should engage our feelings/emotions when we worship 4.	priceless- the woman gave all she had, her perfume, her maruah diri.   Are you willing to risk it all?  Are you, Mary-Ruth?
