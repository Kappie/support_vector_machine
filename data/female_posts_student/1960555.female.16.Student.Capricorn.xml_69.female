I love this movie, and this version is all superiffic with all its deleted scenes and such.  "But Joe, that's a lie.  The money's in Atlantic City.  Really."  "Who knows where thoughts come from, they just appear.  Mmmhmm."  Oh dear, I hate Cory.... she's very annoying.  But Mark... Awww, I love him... along with Berko.  They rock my white socks.  "Joe, I can categorically say that you are not a bigger bananna head."  This movie is freaking hysterical.  My mother is deaf.  I told her 3 times that I was going to Amy's house, yet she still had no idea where I was.  Oh dear.  Last night I told her, this morning I told her as I made my PB sandwich and as I got out of the car I told her that I was coming here and that Dad was picking me up.  OI VAY!!!  Ahhh, this is grand.  How I love it all!  Woot.  DAMN THE MAN!  "Mitchel's the man, I"m the idiot and you're the screw up."  "Let's not fight, let's just rip." "Well mines with a..... 'K', so I was thinking with a 'C'... lol yea..." "Isn't it customary to leave the scene of a crime?  -- What an amature."    Video DID kill the radio star. Mmhmm.
