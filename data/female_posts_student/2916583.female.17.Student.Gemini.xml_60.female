When school lets out, I'll be hostessing almost full time.  I love him.  Not literally cuz I barely know him, but I certainly like him very much.  Actually, I don't love all that many people.  I love my friends, my best friends, some of my acquaintances, some of the ppl I work with, some of my teachers (this year, Boswell, Davis, Knight, Young and Gill...Eyre's ok), some of the ppl I go to church with, all my Keyette girls, my journalism girls (and some of the guys), my yearbook girls and guys, and, of course, my family.  It sounds like a lot, but it's no more than like 100 ppl.  Out of 6.4 billion, that's miniscule, and still a small number compared to the 2194 ppl who attend TD.  Speaking of my family, I'm very angry with my dad, and I need a good boxing match.  We have those frequently cuz we're both secret hotheads.  Anyway I had to work today and I was supposed to get off at 8, givin my parents plenty of time to go to Garden Ridge.  However, they told too many ppl to come in for salad bar, so I volunteered to go home, partly cuz i was the least experienced person there, partly cuz i wanted to talk to my friends, but mostly because The Simpsons comes on tonite.  So I call my Papa (grandfather) so he can pick me up at 6.  Then I learn I'm gettin off at 5, not 6.  I then call my parents to let them know.  I CLEARLY said that Papa was gonna pick me up at six.  So my dad shows up at 5:30 (the lady was late in comin in) and gets mad at me cuz he said that I asked for a ride.  He jus would not let it go!  Finally I jus said some choice words and walked away.  Anyway, we screamed at each other for 10 minutes (I'm not exaggerating in the least).  Ah well, he'll get over it. I'm tryin to do so much rite now its not even funny.  I'm listenin to music, writin in this, talkin to shaheen, kortny, maisie (jenni's sister) and kayla (another one of jenni's girls...i'm like their big friends), making out my to do list, readin annie's mailbox (Ann Landers), ponderin jus how mad my mom would be if i pulled out all the photo albums out to find a baby picture for the baby spread (i want to get it in before school ends so I dont worry about it), tryin to remember who I've forgotten to invite on Saturday (to avoid sum hurt feelings) and watchin my dogs howl (my mom and sister are havin a howling match with them - they howl, then my mom and sister howl...it's funny).  My dogs are so beautiful.  I'm not being conceited, it's a fact.  They're Huskies.  The whiny one, Rocky, is black and white (think of wolves...he scares everyone cuz evry1 thinks hes a wolf), and my dog, Rascal, is the beauty queen of dogs - she's snow white, except for some rust colored fur on her back, has one blue eye, one green eye, long legs and the sweetest personality.  They're the best listeners, and they lick my hand when I'm done...plz don't get any ideas from them.  I love to talk to them...they're just more understanding than my cat, who's ready to scratch me by the time I finish talkin to her.  Don't think I'm crazy for talkin to my pets, I have plenty of awesome ppl I can go to for advice or unloading, but I know that they won't gossip or get offended by something I say.  Now that I'm finished creepin u out lol... What was I gonna talk about?  Oh yea, my habit I'm tryin to break, and the fact that my cousin (Xiomara, not Stephanie - Xiomara is pronounced see-oh-mahra) is a moronic rock hater.  In addition to tryin not to curse anymore (judging from my blog entries, I'm doin a GREAT job...not), I'm tryin not to say the s-word so much.  Wait, doesn't the s-word fall under cuss words?  No, I'm tryin to limit the amount of times I say sorry.  My manager says I say it waaaay too much, and so does Shaheen and sum other ppl.  It's simply automatic.  Bump into someone - I'm sorry.  Someone's had a bad day - I'm sorry.  Screw up something - I'm sorry.  Insult someone accidentally - I'm sorry.  Anyway, I'm really tryin to keep it down.  As for my cousin, here's the gist of why my cousin's musical tastes deeply disturb me: TDMonMon875: i got a song 4 u TDMonMon875: i promise u'll like it LaBebeBoricua375: ok? TDMonMon875: go on radio at aol LaBebeBoricua375: i dont have AOL no more! TDMonMon875: o sry TDMonMon875: its a rock song...foo fighters, low TDMonMon875: its an awesome song LaBebeBoricua375: eeeeewwww rock TDMonMon875: u r a cultural moron TDMonMon875: y dont u like rock LaBebeBoricua375: the same reason u dont like rap hip hop an r TDMonMon875: whys that TDMonMon875: i like sum rap TDMonMon875: and r LaBebeBoricua375: i like one rock song so oooooo LaBebeBoricua375: lol TDMonMon875: what song LaBebeBoricua375: the reason...hoobastank LaBebeBoricua375: that's it lol TDMonMon875: i love u TDMonMon875: thats my favorite song LaBebeBoricua375: exactly! TDMonMon875: i like 50 n G-unit, Sean Paul, Jay-Z, Slim and D12, and sum other ppl TDMonMon875: name an artist and ill tell u if i like them LaBebeBoricua375: ugh iunno! TDMonMon875: mk TDMonMon875: do u like jam bands LaBebeBoricua375: no TDMonMon875: WHAT?? TDMonMon875: you poor, culturally misguided child LaBebeBoricua375: lol TDMonMon875: u dont like DMB? TDMonMon875: or phish? TDMonMon875: or john mayer> TDMonMon875: mayer?** LaBebeBoricua375: no TDMonMon875: or all those awesome singers TDMonMon875: plz tell me u SOMEWHAT like DMB TDMonMon875: cuz otherwise ur hopeless TDMonMon875: wait what about weezer?  I'm not sure if they would fall under "jam band" but still LaBebeBoricua375: who are they? TDMonMon875: WHAT??? TDMonMon875: u dont kno who WEEZER is? TDMonMon875: again, poor misguided child LaBebeBoricua375: no i dont..stry LaBebeBoricua375: sry* TDMonMon875: you sadden me LaBebeBoricua375: lol sry  To clarify, my cousin is from Maryland, namely a suburb of DC, where they constantly tune into rap and all the genres associated.  I respect pplz rights to listen to whatever they want, but I'm personally all about rock, jam bands, some Top 40, more rock, and country.  The poor misguided child even said she doesn't know who NIRVANA is!!!!  I miss Jessica K.; she could recite Nirvana's bio by heart, especially Kurt Cobain (RIP).  Actually, I'm in the mood for Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Right now I'm listenin to my other favorite song (besides The Reason) - Finger Eleven's One Thing.  Check it out sometime, promise u'll like it.   My sister wants to dish and take sum more drama, so I g2g.  One quote before I go - "Why do parents try to teach us how to walk n talk for the first 3 years of our lives but for the rest they tell us to sit down and shut up?"  Truly a thought to ponder sometime.  Later.
