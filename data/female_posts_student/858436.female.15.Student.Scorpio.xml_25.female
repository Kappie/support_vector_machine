These are impressions that I've found to be completely the opposite of what the person is really like, or ones that are completely the same.    Samantha Brandon :   I thought she was shy. Maybe because when she sat behind me in Physics and Mr. G called on her, she was all quiet and stuff. I would be too if I had just moved here.   Sara Richter :  I knew she was wild and crazy all along! Lol. At the lock-in when she just would not stop laughing, I knew that we were going to have an interesting lunch shift.   Haley Bohnert :  I just didn't see how someone could be so  nice  all the time. I was really quiet and shy at the beginning of school, and one day in Physics, she just looked at me and smiled. I wasn't sure if she was smiling at me or at someone behind me, so I just kind of looked away. But she did it again, so I smiled back. Then at the car wash, I found out how sweet and fun she is.   Jack Wedemeier :  We have a ton of classes together, so he was really nice and said hi and stuff on the first day. Then at the lock-in his sporty competitiveness came out and I thought he was pretty cocky. But I found out that he really isn't, and that a lot of times he's just joking around being Jack.   Matt Rosenquist :  I thought Matt was kind of stand-offish. Like he really didn't want to be around anybody. Lol, because on the first day our lunch shift was walking around the school building, and some teacher kept asking him if he wanted somebody to hold his planner since he was on crutches. I felt really sorry for him. He kept refusing, saying that he'd carry it himself. I didn't know quite what to think of him. But I guess I'd be pissed off too if I had to start school on crutches. But then at the lock-in we were next to each other for a few of the games, and I found out that he is kind of quiet at first, but once you get talking, he's so nice.    Allison Bode :  At first I thougt Allie was going to be shy, uptight, not really wanting to have fun. Her jewelry all matched her outfit, her nails were perfect, and her hair never looks bad. Geeze was I wrong! Allie is crazy, and I love her to death!   Myself :  People usually think that I am quiet and too serious. Trust me, I'm definitely not! Once you get talking to me, I'm really a nice person. Trust me. Sometimes I am shy until I get talking.  If anyone is reading this, what was your first impression of me? Be honest. It would be interesting to hear.
