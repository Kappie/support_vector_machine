Just got finished playing DDR  (AKA Dance Dance Revolution)  for the  second  time today, and I feel grrrrrrrrrrreat! :D  I mean, like, this morning... er... more like late afternoon, I did workout mode for 45 minutes at least. Then after dinner (we went to Martinez's. Yumm... ^_^) I went and practiced driving, and even drove myself home! =-O Yes, yes, I was very shocked as well, but praise God I'm getting better n better! And then I came home a little pumped after the whole "parkway" and "turn lane" incident, lol! Go ahead and  urlLink ask me about it , if ya DARE! ;P  And... umm... I really really really want to go out and DO something with some friends, even if it's just as silly as going to the park or riding bikes or hanging out at  Time for Tea  or  SOMETHING ! You know how that is? I've been stuck in this house for soooooo long just reading and reading and reading and reading THE AGONY and I seem to never be able to read enough! It's frustrating! GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!! I can't StAND SuMMER ReADING AsSIGNMENTS! There's a humungo  urlLink list   urlLink of   urlLink books   urlLink that   urlLink I   urlLink would   urlLink like   urlLink to   urlLink read!  YEESH!  *stares off into space, day dreaming and sighing...* Anyway, as much as I love to devour books on subjects of great worth and enjoyment on my part, I'd better stop this blog and go talk to some friends. Sounds like fun! YAY! So if you want  urlLink talk to me,  lemme know, and please please please please please don't be afraid to  CALL ME!  It's so lonely and boring being the only child! (Well, practically, since my brother just graduated. -_-`) Latah!
