The free time I do have, I use to eat and sleep. Heh. Good use of free time I suppose.  Then again, sometimes I get the eating thing done while I'm busy.  Busy day tomorrow. Eye doctor, lesson, getting my hair done, and taking my mom to the doctor...followed by the band pre-camp thing. Mike Klos brought up an amazingly eye-opening point. Our first performance is in three weeks. THREE! Un fricking believable...  Another thing just occurred to me thanks to Chris. Only one more week I'll be able to see him and he'll be gone. So will Peter. Two of my best friends in the world. Gone. I just don't know what to think. Time has snuck up on me so fast this summer.  It's just slipping away so fast and Brandon will be home already on Tuesday...  I'm so excited to see him. I really, really miss him. I'm glad he isn't going away this year.  South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut was good though...heh, that's my lighter note....  I wish things had been a little better between me and Chris this summer, but things change with friends, and I don't think we'll stop being friends really. I just kind of wish he could have gone away and we could have been even close to as close as we were before.  I need to stop thinking. I need to sleep. I need to take my brain out and let all the bad stuff get hammered out...  Good night.
