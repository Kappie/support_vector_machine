She just moved here this year and she is such an awesome girl and we have so many memorys together!    Here is the song to Friends are friends forever by Michael W. Smith, this is me and breda's song!  urlLink Click Here To Listen     ~ As we go on We remember All the times we Had together And as our lives change Come whatever We will still be Friends Forever~  ~And friends are friends forever  If the Lord's the Lord of them  And a friend will not say "Never"  'Cause the welcome will not end  Though it's hard to let you go  In the Father's hands we know  That a lifetime's not too long  To live as friends   With the faith and love God's given  Springing from the hope we know  We will pray the joy you'll live in  Is the strength that now you show  But we'll keep you close as always  It won't even seem you've gone  'Cause our hearts in big and small ways  Will keep the love that keeps us strong ~                BREDA=BFF!!
