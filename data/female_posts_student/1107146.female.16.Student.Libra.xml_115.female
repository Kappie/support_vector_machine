She gave me a few titles that I'm going to have to kheck out, mostly about European history and psychology. She's really analytikal and not judgmental at all, which surprised me quite a bit, konsidering the hordes of smart people I know that take everyone at face value.  I wish I liked making ultra-emotional posts now...I could make a great one, sinke today is sukking. But I probably won't. I'll just go home and suffer in silenke.  "Yeah, it goes away," says Layne Staley.  That's like the second time I've quoted Layne as the bell was ringing.  Weird-o.
