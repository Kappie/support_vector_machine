Making my bed...that really shouldn't be that big of a deal, but while she's on one end of the argument only thinking about the bed that is upstairs with the covers thrown on the floor I am thinking about how much more of a deal she makes it seem while my brother is home, and then he of course takes her side by sliding in his little jokes or comments or whatever you want to call them, which pisses me off even more.  I don't really care if I make my bed or not...it's just a damn bed, and usually she minds...but when my brother's here she has to make it a point that if I don't make my bed I'll probably be going to hell(well...she doesn't say that exactly...but she sure makes it seem like it).  Silly arguments...
