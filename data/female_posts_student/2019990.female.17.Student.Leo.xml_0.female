Balin has set up his seat in the chamber of Mazarbul.  Balin is now Lord of Moria.    Yesterday being the tenth of november Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale.  He went alone to look in mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone.  We slew the orc , but many more came up from east up the Silverode.  We have barred the gates, they can't hold them long.  We cannot get out.  We cannot get out.  They have taken the bridge and the second hall.  Frar and Loin and Nali fell there.  The pool is up to the wall at Westgate.  The watcher in the water took Oin.  We cannot get out.  The end comes, drums, drums in the deep.  They are coming.  I'm just kididng I didn't write that, J.R.R. Tolkein actually wrote it in The fellowship of the Ring.  I just thought it would make a cool blog entry.  Good day to you all. (excitement level obviously down a few points, irritation level up a whole heap however.)
