It was boring, boring, boring, but it wasn't going so badly until the end. I finished all possible Calculus extra credit, and that was a yay. Upon my return to Chemistry, I discovered that the class was viewing  Lorenzo's Oil , and, though I'd seen the movie a million times, I paid attention to it anyways... It's a depressing movie, so I guess the odd feelings started there.   Today was a general intentional or unintentional Francesca-bashing day, for whichever unexplicable or logical reason. Nearly every person I spoke to said something not nice to me, and, when that happens time after time after time in a short span, one starts to be irritated or maybe even a bit depressed.   The worst was choir, of course. Ms. Bizarth called the usual All-State auditioners up for a conference and started blabbering that she had looked up in the rule book that, in order to be able to audition, a student who is only in choir one term would have to do every single mere performance with the choir during the term he/she/it was skipping. Why, I wonder, did she have to go look it up? Likely because she's Bizarth, and her favourite hobby lies in complicating peoples' lives.   Anyhow, she successfully talked Mary Anna into dropping AP Psychology for Choir and Grayson into something similar. When it came to my turn to be spoken to, she bellowed, "Well, you already know what I've got to say to you." She rambled on and eventually articulated, "Even if you were not to change your schedule, your schedule is insane! You're going to kill yourself! I mean, I don't... I don't know. You've become a basket case, and I feel sorry for you..." and then she continued. Although I know I shouldn't care what the old, fat witch says, that still hurt and partly angered me. I realize that I've had my downs and, indeed, barely circumvented a breakdown, but I did make it. Not only did I make it, but I learned a lot in the process--more than any single year so far, actually. I feel as though I can handle let downs and the typical hectic life a bit better now, and I dare claim added maturity.   I finally felt like I had things together, and she just sort of put me down for no reason... and it hurt. Her belief that she knew just how my entire life was going based on the one and only time that I burst into a million tears because she was being her old, mean, witchy self to me also aggravated me. Just who does this woman think she is?  She yapped something about worrying about my mental health, but I can't say I believe her in that respect (not that I really do believe her in any). If she were sincerely worried about me, wouldn't she be a bit more nice and understanding? And wouldn't she try not to put me down every occasion she had? Wouldn't she stop telling me I'm crazy?  Well, I'm not crazy, for the record. I just really need to graduate.    Bleh. I'd better study a bit for the Calculus exam tomorrow.
