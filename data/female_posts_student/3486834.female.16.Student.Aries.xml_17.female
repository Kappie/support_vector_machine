Me and him fought.. like a lot, but I am soooooooo happy that he did that. I think he made a lot of ppl happy. So yeah, he was really cool for doing that.  Cayli Perry's 10 year old cuz told me that Cayli doesn't like me.. I am mean to her or something. Thats gay cause like I don't even know her. That just sorta makes me mad, when ppl just hate me for no reason,  they say it's cause I am a prep. wtf... I am one, why are preps so bad?? LOL. Anyways. Dude I am so freaking lame, this is my 3rd time writing in this blog.. today. whatever. I am still not at the point of writing a story or reading a book.  Well reading a book well help me get to sleep. I should try to learn something. nahh. I will stick to the magazines.. hehe. I am getting lamer and lamer each minute. Is lamer a word?? I think it is more lame.. hmm.. I should look that up.   haha lamer is a word.. lam·er, lam·est 1. Disabled so that movement, especially walking, is difficult or impossible: Lame from the accident, he walked with a cane. A lame wing kept the bird from flying. 2. Marked by pain or rigidness: a lame back. 3. Weak and ineffectual; unsatisfactory: a lame attempt to apologize; lame excuses for not arriving on time.  i really did not understand that..  i think i am definition 3. coooolll.. lol perfecterest is like the coolest word ever. so is duuuude and icky! lol. i really should go. i am getting to excited thinking of words. how weird.
