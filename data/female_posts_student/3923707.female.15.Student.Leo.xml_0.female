Oh ok yeah, that song because of you, cool This is a song called because of you...written because of you...here we go   Verse 1: ...oh yah, oh yah... If ever you wondered if you touched my soul yes you do Since I met you I'm not the same  You bring life to everything I do Just the way you say hello  With one touch I can't let go Never thought I'd fall in love with you...   Chorus: Because of you, my life has changed, thank you for the love and joy you bring Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you  Verse 2: Sometimes I get lonely and all I gotta do is think of you You captured something inside of me  You make all of my dreams come true It's not enough that you love me for me  You reached inside and touched me eternally I love you best explains how I feel for you...   Chorus:  Because of you, my life has changed, thank you for the love and the joy you bring Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you   Bridge: The magic in your eyes  True love I can't deny When you hold me I just lose control I want you to know that I'm never letting go You mean so much to me I want the world to see, It's because of you   Chorus: Because of you, my life has changed, thank you for the love and the joy you bring Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you My life has changed thank you for the love and the joy you bring  Because of you, I feel no shame, I'll tell the world it's because of you...   Spoken:   Because of you
