Am I compensating for all the lucky girls who only date nice guys? Apparently. He decided to crash my buds Uno card game downstairs. He decided the whole time was appropriate to add little tacky, about-our-now-extinct-relationship comments in front of everyone. One move I made I was like, "Its all part of my game plan." He was like ,"Yeah like everything else you do. I was scared to touch anything in your house with a post it note on it." I said, "No you weren't." The stupid ass would eat my meals I had made for school the next day or my tubs of pre-made central market food so I could make it through the hectic week without cooking. Then he was like, "Yeah, you're right." Oh and the postits were because not only did I have a boyfriend then who would appear at my house to eat for free, DAILY, but my roomate's brother was living there eating everything too. It got ridiculous, I was paying but never got the benefit of what I bought. This is becoming a common theme around him. What a pig. Totally. And just last night he was like, "You could always date me again." No thanks, really, I don't have any kids and for the moment don't need any.
