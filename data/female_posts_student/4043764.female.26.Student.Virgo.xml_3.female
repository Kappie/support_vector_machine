I bought that size because a queen sized would not fit the staircase to the basement apartment I lived in. [the sketchiest salesman in the world tried to sell me the bigger bed: "can i ask you something? will it really make a difference in space - 4 inches this way, 3 inches that way? i wanna get you into a bigger bed today... can i get you into a bigger bed?" he used my name a lot too, which really creeped me out...] Anyway, I slept in the smaller bed for less than 8 months.  I moved back to ATL to be with the boy. I put it in his guest bedroom. And I went to Sierra Leone.  I planned take it up to school this fall, but decided it would be best to move with less, especially since I'll be living in an attic space and have NO idea whether it would fit the staircase. I have asked and been re-assured by my new roommates. I do not trust anyone's spatial judgment, however.  One of my friends offered to buy it if she likes the looks of it. I am sure that she will. When I broached this topic with boy, he did not care. He told me that the bed could go - he did not need it. This morning, he asks if he can match the price. I tell him that she gets first dibs -   As I write, I realize that this is so stupid. Scratch this off of any list of important things.
