I also got an e-mail from Neopets, apparantly I lost my password and was trying to find it out - in English some one tried to hack me. What a dumb ass, that's a dumb way to hack, hell that's not even hacking! Learn how to hack guys! Yeay I'm playing games! (Well that's a change.) Heeey! It's fun! Hehe, I'll talk about today later, this is kind of pointless and it might ruin that!
