Why do I have to be so dumb?! After my mom picked me up, we went to the driving place so I can sign up! Woo-Hoo...one step closer to driving! Well, everything has been so weir for me! I don't know what to do with myself! I have been so out of it...I don't even have the friends I used to! I have lost so much of my friends and I don't even know how I did that! Like I mean, I have lost touch with Krysten, Michelle, and Krista! I feel like I have lost my friends..even though I knew deep down inside Krista and Michelle didn't like me! I don't know what was up with that! It's like I went to a church where I no longer had friends. I felt so left out in everything I did! It was sad! Now, if go to church I end up going in Lytle or when I am with my dad! I miss everyone at church but like I mean, if they missed me too...they would call! I wonder what will happen with my mom and step-dad, Doug, and the whole divorce thing! I can't wait until something actually happens! Something need to happens now! I mean like, I get so tired of wondering what is going to happen! I can't stand any of my step-sisters! I mean like everything they have done has been so wrong. None of them are even the same anymore! They are all liars. Farrin is a two-faced idiot! Cassidy has a horrible attitude and Brandy is a WITCH! I wanna get away from them all! I wanna leave here. Get away forever! I hate where I am and I wish I could just go away-FAR AWAY!! But anyways- I have been pretty happy when I am able to go spend time with my brother and his gf's Family all in Lytle. I mean, it is so small over there, but I love it for some reason! I like being over there and it is just so fun! That's probaly where I will be the rest of the summer cause that's where I like to be! I wish I could move out of here! I wanna graduate and leave here! I wish I could drive! I wish I had a job! I wish I had money! My life has been screwed over because my stupid and wicked step-sisters! I need to get away! But I don't know- I have to stop whining and try to face what's happening now! I have to go for right now anyways! Bye and love you!
