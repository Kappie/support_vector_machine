Granted, they are novel little things (label makers PWN BIOTCH) but really, ratchet sets get old. My mom and Glen gave me two when I got my car, and I was like..."Uh...yeah, great," when I got the second one. And kind of the same reaction on the first one, to be honest.  Quilts are nice! Well, I enjoy them.  And really, females seem to have better taste in clothing than men, so if you all want to buy the ties and socks....that's great. But no pink. NUH-UNH, NO. Pinks socks are fine cuz no one's  really  going to see them. But that's only if there isn't another color. And really, who's going to say no to a bathrobe? They're awesome. O no, let's wear jockey shorts and be real men. Real men=the biggest damn babies you've ever seen, they'll be in a bathrobe faster than you can think a short phrase.  But remote controls are very cool, and replacements...ahhh.   Alcohol is alcohol. A real man would drink whatever the hell is there. And no, this does NOT make real men alcoholics...well at least that much.  Hahaha. No, no rope. Get us a rope making KIT, we would go apeshit (rhyme) over it (rhyme again, both of those were really unintentional, but I had to go back after typing them and point this out). It instills a certain sense of pride, procuring the grass, weaving the grass, pulling the grass, using the grass. And really, wheelbarrows are for gardeners. And no real man is a gardener. Absolutely no logical fallacies on that last statement, a'tall. Stepladders just don't reek of that thrill of danger so much, and so now you all know why.  Hey look at me! I'm bored!!!!
