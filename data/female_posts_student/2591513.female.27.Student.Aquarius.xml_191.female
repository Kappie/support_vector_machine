Anyhow, I haven't heard from Tim and Keiko and figure that this is they way it will be.  Just let go.  So I am growing increasingly anxious with Ed leaving in a few hours.  I know that it is just for training, but for him being gone that long after being home for a year...it just doesn't feel normal.  I have to get used to it though because he will be gone for over 7 months and that is the reality of it all.  Why do things like this have to happen?  You know, why do men and women have to go away from their family for so long?  Why aren't people more grateful for the things that they do, the sacrifices they make so that we can enjoy fireworks and celebrate our independence...I guess I just answered my own question.  Well I should head off because I have to take him to work tomorrow.  I am going to miss Ed.
