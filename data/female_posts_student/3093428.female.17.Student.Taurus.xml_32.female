On account of it being the 25th anniversary of his ordination as a minister. He was so fooled, lol, it was great. It was so amazing to see how many people really love my dad. I guess I take for granted how amazing he is, so much appreciation. I'm so glad it happened, my dad really has been needing some encouragement lately. But it just really reminded me how cool my dad is, and how much I love him.
