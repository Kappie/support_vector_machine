We're gonna have tons of fun and hopefully we'll actually make it there without getting TOO lost. So I won't be here for a few days. I'll be back Tuesday sometime. So hope everyone has a good time whatever you're doing!        Yes, this is the shortest blog in my history of being here.        Oh and I  FINALLY  saw Dan today at Best Buy. Of course I saw him whenI was feeling quite frumpy, but oh well!        Goodnight.
