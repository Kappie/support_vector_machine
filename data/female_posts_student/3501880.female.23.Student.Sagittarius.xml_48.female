I am endeared toward this ant, cause they usually live in colonies and hang out with other ants, but this one seems to have said, "Fuck it! I want to  live alone and write the Great American Novel".  Every day, the ant ventures out from behind some boxes to visit me. He usually scurries around my chair for a little while or sometimes he likes to sit on the top of my foot for ahwhile, until I shoo him away. He keeps me entertained and I provide the occassional companionship that he needs. I suspect it might be the perfect relationship.  ******** At the grocery store, I ran into a guy that I go to school with. I offered the requisite pleasantries, and in turn, he ended up telling me about how his wife had just walked out on him. I felt bad. He is eyes were obviously bloodshot, and he had a distinc air of dejection about him. Which brings home the fact that law school has managed to destroy all relationships that I know of, and this makes me a little bit sad.
