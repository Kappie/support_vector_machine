We have too much freaking fun together!!      Movie #11 of the summer:  The Village    ****    The Village was really good!! It is definitely a thinking movie. It is scary, but more suspenseful than anything. If you really don't like thinking, then don't see it. LeeAnne and I loved it though!! (Try not to scream....   AHHHHHHHHHHHH! oh..)    Yeah, LeeAnne and I went to see that. We were freaked out right at the beginning. We made sure we did not wear red because that would be bad. But I brought a red sweatshirt with a hood so we could try to freak people out in the middle of the movie. But I think we ended up freaking ourselves out more. Man, is there a twist at the end though. Afterwards we went to the Meijer's (sp??) gas station because I really needed gas and we were pulling up and there was this scary guy and we were like "AH!" and then we pulled up a litle more and there was a cute guy and we were like "Ooh?!" lol It was funny. Then I went 2 cents over what I wanted ("Aw, man!").  Then later, well actually earlier, we saw this little thing running on the road at a stoplight. It was like a mouse-sized pig. It was bizaare. (Okay, I really think my caffeine from yesterday is finally kicking in.) ANYWAYS! We went to Denny's afterwards to get ice cream. It was so good. We got the brownie a la mode. It was so yummy!! And we didn't have any money so we left the waitress two Sacagawea coins. lmao. Sorry. Now I will describe the scene that followed out in the parking lot in a "Jeepers Creepers" fashion:    LeeAnne and I are walking out in the dark, eerie parking lot. There is a fog lingering and something just doesn't feel right. We're walking towards my car and we can hear a car creeping up behind us. I keep walking as I see a van out of the corner of my eye. LeeAnne looks over to see a cute guy sitting in the front seat. But I sense something is wrong in the air. I can almost smell it. I finally look over at the van and then it happens.....  A HEAD POPS OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW....  WITH A HALLOWEEN MASK ON!!!!!!   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! I freak out and walk frantically towards my car when I hear a voice come from the mask...  "How do you.....get to route 30?"        That's when I know we're DOOMED! So I run to my car and am fumbling with my keys to get in away from these "kidnappers" who are pretending to be "lost." And then I hear LeeAnne say, "Well just turn right out of here..." As I'm still struggling to grab the one key on my keychain to unlock my car. Meanwhile, the creeps in the van are steadily driving closer. I can feel them sensing my fear. LeeAnne is being drawn to them. She's about ready to invite them over for tea when I finally unlock my car and jump in. And that's when they drive off. LeeAnne hops in the car and I don't grind the gears as I pull out of the parking lot.   Talk about traumatic events! We went over her house for a while after that and just hung out. Saturday, I worked from 9-3, came home, slept for 3 hours, ate dinner, went to clean the office my mom and I clean every week, stopped at the coffee shop in Mifflin, came home, LeeAnne picked me up, went to bonfire at Morgan's house (where we witnessed flame-blowing people, whores, etc.), came back home, watched TV until 3 in the morning.      Whoops! Sorry, Craig!! (LOL)    Today: Brooke, Mom, and I went to the Columbus zoo. Then we went to Fazoli's, then came home. Brooke and I competed to see who could count the most of a certain type of vehicle. I was counting Hondas (HONDA!) and Brooke was counting sports cars. He gave up when I reached 152.  Oh... such fun!
