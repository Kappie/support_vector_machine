I was half-heartedly invited to go to a thrift store to look for something crazy to wear for Halloween, so I'm going to take up the offer, even though I may not really be welcome.    I got bitched at today for claiming I had nothing pressing to do.  Reminds me a bit of senior year of college.  I can't help it if I have my shit together and no one else does.  Ah well.  I just realized that the ol' blog is probably not going to make it through my 8-9 months away.  Guess it depends on what my internet access is like.  Hmmm...  Well, I should go track down the thrift store expedition....
