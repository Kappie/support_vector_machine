After months of travelling, everyone else is going far far away and I have a chance to be stupid and run around Salzburg singing my fav Sound of Music tunes. C. was in my room looking for her memory card for her camera, while R. was uploading her pics onto my comp. Then K. walked in and it took me a minute to register what her shirt said: it had three pics on it showing a few of my favorite things and at the bottom is said Salzburg. That was all it took I was sold!     Oh and my Int'l Crim Law reading was ridiculous. RI-DI-CU-LOUS. Everyone else went to the Hofgarten or the casino last night, but NOOOO, RACHEL didn't. I ran around Karwendel reloading on diet cokes, in my yoga pants, trying the wade through the 80 odd pgs for Int'l Crim Law.Hello we have other classes to read for too!She must really resent this being a 1 hr class. So, I managed with much effort to get through it. In class today, half were gone, apparently there had been a mass hiatus after the announcement of readings day 1. She seemed surprised nobody was there. Then she asked about the readings, I almost snickered aloud, those that had shownto class were at the Hofgarten until some time shortly before the beginning of class and were not in good shape. Its Thursday dude, whaddya expect?
