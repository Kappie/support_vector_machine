RIGHT. (single and ready to mingle)" which i thought was very funny. this other guy chad whom we quickly bonded with decided to change his name from whatever it was to, "MR. WRONG.(scary, hairy, and ready to marry)" it was hilarious!!!! so ben and i hung out with our new friends stef and chad all night and had a blast, though we were all disappointed that i wouldn't be at the festival on saturday to watch them play, because i couldn't afford to go. :( it was $30 just to get in the door (but you ate and drank for free all day!)... and seeing as though i had to work at 6pm, i didn't think i should spend the money i don't really have on that. so saturday morning i was ben's ride to the festival, since he'd be drinking all day i said i'd drive him there and pick him up so that he wouldn't have to worry about calling a taxi or whatever. but when we woke up he sort of pouted and said "i really want you to be there today, it won't be the same if you're not." he offered to pay for half my ticket, which initially i felt really weird about, but he insisted! so- yay, i went to the 10 ugly men festival. weird name i know, but damn it was fun!!! the kickball tournament was a blast, their team did really well... even though the last several games, they were all drunk! there were people everywhere, bands playing, and lots of great free beer and food. i have this super hot professor that's in a band, and they happened to be playing at the festival saturday... yay! it was cool to see "dr. hernandez" all jammin' out with his band... soooo hot! :)   great times, great friends, great party........... i'm off to work.
