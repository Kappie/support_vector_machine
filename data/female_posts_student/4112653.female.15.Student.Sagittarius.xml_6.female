     
      Dear Lord,  I pray for those of us who are having trouble at school, pray that you'll help them concentrate on their work and most importantly on YOU. Help us to do everything we do for your glory. Help us not get distracted by MSN, this blog and others, tv, stuff... I pray that as we get older, and have more work, that our focus in life will never change.  in Jesus' most precious name,  Amen
