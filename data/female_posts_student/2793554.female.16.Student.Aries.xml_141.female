I have so much good food!! like burritos and chinese food and ice cream and smoothies and all this REALLY good food and im so full but i just want to eat all of it!!!!! ::explodes::  bleh. and then my mom wanted me to go to louisville to get a fishtank lamp, and they went out of business, ao we drove into boulder but that place was closed, so we drove into DENVER and got a lamp. and then my dad made me drive him around and run errands adn then we went back INTO boulder to get burritos... which was cool cause they gave me an extra free burrito because it took them like 20 minutes to make my dads burrito...but then we had to drive home and then i came home and now im so stuffed full of food i cant even move and i can barely think. Poof.    burrito madness!  uh. thats it, i guess.
