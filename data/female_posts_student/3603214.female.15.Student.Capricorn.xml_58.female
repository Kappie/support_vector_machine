This is for my parents and to piss Amber off because she doesn't like Maroon 5...I still love u, cracker!   "Not Coming Home"  When you refuse me You confuse me What makes you think I'll let you in again Think again my friend Go on misuse me and abuse me I'll come out stronger in the end  And does it make you sad To find yourself alone And does it make you mad To find that I have grown I'll bet it hurts so bad To see the strength that I have shown  When you answer the door pick up the phone You wont find me cause I'm not coming home  You do not know how much this hurts me To say these things that I don't want to say But have to say them anyway I would do anything to end your suffering But you would rather walk away  And does it make you sad To find yourself alone And does it make you mad To find that I have grown I'll bet it hurts so bad To see the strength that I have shown  When you answer the door pick up the phone You wont find me cause I'M NOT COMING HOME
