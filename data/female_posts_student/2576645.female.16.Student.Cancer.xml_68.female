I am loyal to the faithful and steadfast blogger, and yet I have the nagging feeling to start my own livejournal. After all, you can have a 'friends list'. Basically, that is the only thing that is appealing to me right now.       But a more pressing matter is at hand: Today was the first day of  August .      And being the procrastinator I so dutifully am, I have still not sarted on the three books I have to read for english.  Not that I haven't had time . I certainly have. But between the new TV in my room, waking up at noon, and being my normal lazy self, Mark Twain can't seem to squeeze himself in. Yup.... sorry to break this to yah Mr. Huck Finn, my schedule is  booked .      I think it may be a subconcious thing. Maybe I am not starting those books because I know I have to take notes on them. And if I have to take notes on a book, I always end up hating the book.       Yes, thats what it is: a irrepressable subconcious attempt by my mind to destract my waking body to not read those American literature classics, as to not hurt my relationship (and future relationship) with them.      Or....      (In a simpler version)      I don't feel like doing work until I possibly have too.
