B works today so all afternoon I rehearsed what I would say and started sweating and shaking. I dialed her number; she was there. I started by saying something about how I was sorry about being distant and not talkative and getting my noise out of joint, when she interrupted me by saying she had to go eat supper. Oh, ok. She'd phone me back. I paced around waiting for the phone to ring. pace pace. Ring. We talked as if nothing had ever happened, like it was last summer all over again...well not really. We were both nervous and a little weirded out and nothing was really the same. We hadn't phoned since November. Us who had spent everyday together last summer. I tried explaining how much it hurt seeing her ride by everyday, on a new horse, on the seventh horse she's had while I had my one, with that look that cowgirls in calendars and magazines have, where everything looks just right, that I have envied all my horse owning years. I didn't tell her all that of course, I don't know if she even understands what I did tell her. I asked her if maybe she could take me for a ride sometime; it would be the most important thing she could do for me ever. I mean I haven't even touched a horse since He died. Except for that pony in November which I reluctantley scratched for 2 seconds which doesn't count. I  cannot  describe the pain that I feel about this whole horse, dead Horse, pain, grief, thing. The only person that I have tried to explain it to is M. I feel so vulnerable. Laying my heart open to her and leaving it up to someone else to decide if they will break it or not. Anyway she said taht she would have to ride Mirage some more, becuase she is pretty green and wild lately. So there is some hope. But I was thinking today...no don't be disapointed. I refuse to be. Just now that I've made this step I want to go all the way with it, not wait around. I am scared. I am hopeful. I am mournful. And the only thing in my mind is a beautiful bay gelding galloping free of any arthritis or shortness of breath, or back pain and I know that I made the best choice.                             tear       urlLink ">Link
