I took my new carbon fiber bow over to his house.  I was just very proud of it until realized he has a new carbon twice as nice (and expensive).  But in any case, we played that fiddle medley thing for few hours.  I had my technique corrected multiple times.  We watched a Sean Connery movie though, which was less than brilliant.  xxXXxxxxXXxxOOoOOoOo
