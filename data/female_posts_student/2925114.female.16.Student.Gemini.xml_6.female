There's this performance tonight...Wax Manequien (can't spell..tooo sick) Anyways I'm going to miss the season finale of FRICKEN FRIENDS!! Grrr...the things I do for my boyfriend. Anyways.. Im sick, going to a concert to watch my boyfriend open for this guy and I should be cozy at home watching Friends being nursed back to health. Grrr I must die right now, I feel so shitty. No school for me tomorrow. And I skipped gym today because I'm way to sick to go biking. And the fact that I'm not going to school tomorrow means I'm going to miss my detention, which will result in 4 more detentions. YAY 7 DETENTIONS. just what I'm gonna need on a Monday morning. Meh... SO party tomorrow. Should be fun. Gonna be quite happy. If I'm not sick. Meh again. Aw I love parties so much. Great times. AnYwHO. Best be off. Scott says hi, he's cool. NOT. lol bye...gotta listen to trip-out stories from Holly, Scott M, and Bram. Peace from the middle east.
