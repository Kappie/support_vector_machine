But as for the driver's testing lady...you have to understand, she's an underpaid and hated state employee. Which, of course, gives you all the right to do as you did, but also makes her all the more pissy. Kill her next time, no one will care. Heh.  And now, the illustrious songlist....at least, what's being put into consideration.......for Abby's party. This is really rich, guys, I have to post it or I will blow up.  Beatles Stuff    Michelle    Help    Strawberry Fields Forever    Yesterday    Here Comes The Sun    Day Tripper    Can't Buy Me Love (I guess that's the name? The phone got a bit garbled at that point, so I wrote what I heard)                 ....and more to come as it is suggested  Freedom by RATM  Down With The Sickness by Disturbed  The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson  Helpless by Metallica  Master of Puppets by Metallica                   ................hopefully, more Metallica?!?!?!?!?! Not off of  St. Anger  cuz it SUXXX, tho............ I Enjoy Being A Girl.....yes, that one. With all the extremely girly lyrics.  Honeybun....because this is Abby's song.  Put You Down by Alice in Chains  Many, MANY School House Roxxx Songs...including, but not limited to:    Tale of Mr. Morton    Interjections    Lolly Lolly Lolly                           ......and more!  Many of our songs.....    The DIE Song......new! Especially for some guests of the party, and some that are not guest but are wished by the lead singer to be guests so he could laugh at them and  throw dangerous and pointy things at them.    My Solution.....the real version, no acoustics....altho we might do a lil of the acoustic version in DIE    Little Rhyme    Broken Me    Let Me Go......new!    Close My Eyes.......new! And extremely cool!    Goodbye My Friend........notice there's a "me" or "my" in every one of these songs?    Captain Coodukx.....................first of the trilogy!    EBAMahickey...........the midway of the trilogy!    Captain Coodukx VS. EBAMahickey......last of the trilogy!                             .............perhaps....more?!?!  There's No "I" In Team By Taking Back Sunday  Timberwolves At New Jersey by Taking Back Sunday  Lots of GC............    The Anthem    Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous    Golden Days    Wondering    Bloody Valentine                      ............more upon suggestion!  Two Sentenced songs!    Noose    I'll Throw The First Rock                 ....................I don't think we're going to do too many of these, they're just too good....and we can't play the other ones, but that's asides the point.  Dark and Endless Void by Old Man's Child  Still Fighting It by Ben Folds Five  And a thousand other songs! Because at practice today (because it's past 12, so I can say that) we're going to do every frickin' song we know how, and more! BONUS! This'll be the most trykk'd out parté ever, even without the band. TEE-TOTALLY AWESOME. Woot.  Time to get some sleep if I want to get up at 5 and go to work just to steal my mom's car tomorrow morning.
