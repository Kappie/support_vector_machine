Nearly cracked the first 100 pages of a new book, set in London, and found myself missing the city, that experience and 2003 intensely.  The year mark always changes things.  The realization that something truly is over, passed hits home in a new way.  The trip was such a great catalyst for the year in waiting and last night found me pouting over the fact that it's over.  Clearly nothing could top such a great year, especially not a new year making its debut in the snow incased fortress in Pocatello.  But a hot buttered rum at 2 in the morning always helps.  The fact that I haven't written pages in more than a few days may have something to do with it, as well.  They're all upstairs making noodles in the kitchen.  I'm sure they miss my presence immensely.  The countdown to the return back to school mirrors last year's countdown to the return back to the States.  Feels like I have a lot of time left to enjoy the break until I remember how fast the 10 days in London went by.  Tomorrow's the anniversary of the drive of harsh beauty.  Stupid January, anyway!  And then there's this girl.  I knew things would be different when the Age of Silence had passed, but I didn't think they'd be so similar.  Guess I didn't expect to feel this different.  Feel her trying to make everything okay, back to the way it used to be, at least in terms of our friendship-connection.  But the few times we've spoken I've felt like I've returned to something I worked to leave behind.  Something I don't need anymore, and have no intention of returning to.  And I feel like I'm the only one in that place, only one ready to see where the new places in each other's lives are rather than trying to fit into  the old ones in different ways.  Find myself getting sad, frustrated and then relieved because I remember that I don't need or want to figure it out.  Have to write about it, sure.  But am done worrying.  This will turn into something neither of us expected, for better or worse, without any pushing or pulling from me.    Sigh.  What can I say?   She's my wonderwall.
