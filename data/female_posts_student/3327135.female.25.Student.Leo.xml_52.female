Luckily, I had some other interesting things to do. Yesterday, I finally bought the Family Man VCD set, which I had been eye-ing long ago. Only managed to watch till episode 6 yesterday night as we spent two hours watching the new Channel U series Witness to Prosecution II. Watching FM again, just rekindled the feeling I have for Flora.
