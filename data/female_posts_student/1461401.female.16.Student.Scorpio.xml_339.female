       
      This is a poem I wrote a few weeks ago. I just found it again today, so I figured I would lay it down here. The begining sounds kinda like a part from "A Knight's Tale" but Heath Ledger is hot so it doesn't matter.  I miss you Like the earth misses the sun In the bitter winter Like the flowers miss the rain In the horrid drought Like the fish misses water Suddenly thrown to where It shouldn't be. I miss you Like a poets misses paper Endlessly scribbling on walls Like an actor misses the stage While plays turn into monologues Like a girl who lost a boy Like me Like you Like me Missing you  I miss you.
