As far as I know we'll just be doing the same thing as last time (feeding, watering, etc). There was supposed to be an adopt-a-rabbit tomorrow (today, actually, I guess) but there are still some problems being sorted out. I don't care though, anything I get to do there is fun. Hehe. I just love volunteering, even when it's as unglamourous as cleaning cages and changing the water. All the rabbits are so cute that it really makes up for any hard work we have to do.  I saw 50 First Dates today, it's really good. I was cracking up almost the entire movie, although when I stopped to think about it, it was really sad that she had to be reminded every day that she was married, and that she was a mother, and even that she had to be reminded of these things. I would hate to be involved with somebody like that. Love should be effortless.  Well I need to be getting to bed, so good-night.    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  itchy, hmm...  listening to/watching ::  The Cable Guy  eating/drinking ::  tortilla chips  craving ::  chocolate  talking to ::  chelsea  thinking about ::    wishing ::  hehe  wearing ::  stuff  random ::  I have light brown eyes.
