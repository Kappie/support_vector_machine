I was angry this morning because i had to take all three of my youngest sibnlings to swin lessons, and sit in the hot sun. I was also wearing jeans and a black t-shirt, which was stupid. When i got home i had the biggest headache, and i felt so tired. I laid down o my bed, feeling thouroughly ticked, and was soon asleep. I woke up to my grandma pounding on my door, asking me to help her make lunch for the little people. My mom, dad, and older siblings were gone, so i had to help. That turned into a fiasco that i won't even describe. This afternoon my older brother left for eugene, oregon. My parents got home, and 3 hours later left for the same place. Tomorrow they are going to all watch my older sister and her cohorts perform at drum major camp. Then they are bringing her home. In the meantime, i am the oldest child left at home, but both my granbdparents are here too. For some reason i don't see eye-to-eye with either of them. they think they are right in everything, and though they may be, they don't have to force their ways and opinions on me. Tonight i have to watch ove the little people, getting their dinner, giving them baths, getting them to bed, and in between all that keeping them entertained. I'm feeling realy put upon right now and i don't like it. Tomorrow i have to get them all ready for the day, keep them entertained, and find some way to get down to the high school at 1 for our drum line rehearsal. I don't understand, whats going on?! This day s seeming to last forever, and i'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I just wish i could see, or at least talk to, one of my friends. I haven't seen any of them in a long time. I know i saw my boyfriend just last night, but i haven't talked to him at all today, and i wish i could. I can't seem to stop being sad, and it's driving me nuts. I have this desire to be happy, like everyone else seems to be, i just can't seem make it.
