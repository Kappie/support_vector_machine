Em...just a little weird...;)   I live in Australia, a very nice place, it is, but also very hot! I'm 15, female, and enjoy watching Galic Football (international rules), but I'm not really sure why...anyway! I love all things funny, such as Ali G and Billy Connelly,   I am a bookworm, I love reading! Specially Harry Potter, so don't be surprised if I throw in a few things from HP along the way. But I'm not absolutely obsessed either...like those other freaks you see plastering HP all over the internet! ;) And all british comedy shows crack me up too...and Tony Blaire's accent...and, well, just about anything british...   You will also soon come to realise that a girl with broardband internet connection and too much time on her hands is not a good combination...muhahaha!!!   Some day I would like to take over the world, but thats on the back burner whilst I finish school...and i still havent' recuited enough henchmen yet...*note to self: make henchmen fliers*   Well...thats really all I have to say for now...    but I must add...cajun!
