The interviewer was very nice and understanding about why I wanted their help even though I'm not legally blind ("and that's a good thing!", as I keep saying.)  She offered many suggestions that I had never thought of since this situation is relatively new.  As I have a bad habit of falling off curbs at night because I can't see where the sidewalk ends, one suggestion that I balked at was using a white cane only at night to help me assess depth perception.  She thought my reaction was completely normal for someone my age and suggested a big golfing umbrella might help also and no one had to know what I was using it for.    She's going to refer me to a Visual Rehabilitation Worker who will help me go through all of the various options for reading (magnifiers, lighting, etc.) in the beginning of August or so.  She is also going to look into whether or not I am eligible for ODSP (the Ontario Disability Support Program), which could help a lot since I will have no income (only lovely student loan debts) as of September.  She also was very pleased I applied to the Canada Study Grant program and she's sure I will get that funding.   She suggested I consider getting either a laptop with large-print magnification on it for school with my funding, or a large monitor to replace my itty-bitty 15 inch monitor in residence.  Both are very appealing ideas.  Lots of helpful services should I decide I don't feel safe enough returning to driving and if I lose more of my vision and become legally blind.  Speaking of driving, I was intrigued to learn that the doctor will pull your license at 20/40.  I'm 20/35 so I'm still legal (wiping brow).  She said they would probably be reluctant to pull a young person's license anyway since most young people want to use their license for I.D. purposes whether or not they get behind the wheel.  I said I know my limits and if the lighting is too bright or it is nighttime, I would never, ever drive.    Even when I finish school there are lots of employment benefits like Workopolis which would allow me to post my resume and employers who are looking for equity requirements, she said, would LOVE me with three degrees and such an adaptive disability.  I am not eligible for many of CNIB's services since I am not legally blind, but many more I am eligible for now.  So, lots of good news!   More to come...
