RainingDownBlue: how was the beach? res0nation: approvable RainingDownBlue: that's nice res0nation: it was rock-awesome RainingDownBlue: who all went? res0nation: joe asbridge, joe broders, eric, josh moore, corey moore, daniel, josh wakemen and brandon and me RainingDownBlue: cool RainingDownBlue: man fest res0nation: yes. res0nation: I played axis and allies on friday res0nation: from 1 pm res0nation: to 7am RainingDownBlue: gosh res0nation: it was pretty intense RainingDownBlue: i am gettin that res0nation: you know who people truely are when you are driven to the frayed ends of maddness RainingDownBlue: hm res0nation: under those conditions res0nation: it was obvious who were friends, and who were little bastards RainingDownBlue: uh huh res0nation: whiney little people who blame everything on the dive res0nation: *dice res0nation: rather then give people named dave an ounce of intellectual credit OR merely cease to snivel long enough for me to complete my fricken turn RainingDownBlue: lol RainingDownBlue: i'm sorry, dav-id res0nation: don't be res0nation: I drove them into the ground RainingDownBlue: oh you heartless bastard! res0nation: 18 hours of their lives wasted because they would not learn from their mistakes res0nation: rather then adapt their tactics, they would blame helpless circumstance res0nation: when the UK launches a beach landing on Japan, you know things are out of hand RainingDownBlue: hm res0nation: no amount of dice rolls could cause something that perverted to happen res0nation: thats pure genius at work RainingDownBlue: i guess so RainingDownBlue: wow  there you go folks a snippet of my beach trip. there are other moments in which we all find ourselves just meditating on how ingenius we are. one such moment manifested itself when Eric came running up the stairs like a giddy little woman, barely containing his glee. he hopped off each foot and clapped his hands near his face to hide his secretive joy. he then whispered "we are taking all the marshmellows out of joe's lucky charms!!" and tryed to hide his giggless by shoving them to the deep parts of his throat. Joe was in the next room. they put all of his marshmellows into a zip lock bag and hid it in secret place.   this is ironic due to the fact that joe was earlier commenting on the cereal to marshmellow ratio, and how it favored those little sugar covered pieces of sugar, rather then the fluffed dyed sugar which is SO much better.  so when joe found them, he drew a picture of a hand sticking its middle finger out and replaced it with the zip lock bag. Later on, Eric and the other Joe found an insulting suprise when they checked on their project. That friends... is genius
