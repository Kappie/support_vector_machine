I know, it was so good, and my skin is nutso! I also bought shoes, like the comfy ones my mommy threw away, and a shirt, and I went kyaking for the first time EVER! I also met a lot of Eva's family, I met her aunt Jane, who was so nice, and I am to go with Eva to her place for labor day weekend. I think it will be fun if it falls into place! A girl can dream! ha ha! Well I have to unpack and do laundry and such so I will write more later, but before I go I will critique Jackalope, a new Canadian band from the BC area, I believe. They are heavily influenced by Trent Resnor on NIN, and I for one think it is obvious, he even played on a few tracks, which is cool. The lead singer has an amazing voice, she is like a Shirly Manson, for the new generation, she really sounds like her actually. But ya out of 5 i give them a 3 and a half. That's good. P.S. I have noticed that I am a horrible speller, so any incorrect spelling of words and such, please overlook that, it would be much apreciated! Hoccha Author:Eve
