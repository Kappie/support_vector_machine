She's also a drama student at my school whereas I'm a creative writer. We had Lang. Arts (adv.), World Hist. (adv.)  the gym class we had for a semester  the health for one quarter  the study skills for one quarter. I also have other friends. I have Ryann who i think I men - speak of the devil she just came online.
