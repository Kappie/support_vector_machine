Wahahaah... First day back at work... Was really fucking bad at first... The staff there treated us as tho' we're non-existent... Full of shit i swear... BUt hack them ah... Plus this morning, my mother actually scolded me for bringing maggi me to work cos i got no more money... Early in the morning at 5am...  this is wat she does.. *speechless* I can't wait for my money to come in... Then again, half of it will b gone... WHY?? Cos my hp bill is 244... plus my piano fees is 250... VONDERFUL!!! ahhaah... *GOSH! I'm acually laughin' abt this... wat a mad ass* Hahhahaha... oh well, Music is my only Cure... *La la la...*
