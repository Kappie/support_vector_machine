This show was a fascinating look at race, class and gender and how they intersect. The previous sentence is about as academic as this gets...  As a budding anthropologist, I could not help but read this as an unabashed look at race and class in America. A synopsis: working class African-American mommy (Mela) is switched with upper-class white American mommy (Tammy). Mela gets new, rich Japanese American cosmetic surgeon as her partner (and it's a two-fer because his mother, Nana, does *all* the housework and cooking - we later learn that Nana sets the coffee pot at night so that Tammy does not have to do it herself AND so that she can have a sleep-in...)  Tammy's new partner is the talkative, low-key (and cost-conscious) medical suppply supervisor, Anthony.  The contrast between the families' neighborhoods and lifestyles is so stark that Tammy, gazing out her window at her new lower-middle class neighborhood, wonders: "Is there even a place for me to work-out here?"  Okay - a little aside. I cracked up when Tammy said that she brings  urlLink positivism  to the relationship - maybe it's because I've only heard this used in academics. Somehow, I don't think Tammy is a hardcore Comte fan.  I am focusing a great deal on Tammy because she really is the most interesting character to me in this episode - she is demanding, condescending, pampered - and she wants to "meet every person in the world." This is her way of telling Anthony that she was excited about being part of a black family and committed to promoting diversity by shaking lots of colored people's hands. Perhaps the phrase that best summarizes her outlook on "racial understanding" is: "You know, my husband is Japanese." Yes, Tammy, you are a pioneer, well before your time.  For most of the show, I was thinking - is it some coincidence that the working-class black woman is represented as nurturer, not only to her own children but to Tammy's children as well? [There is a scene where Mela is seen putting together one of those thousand-piece puzzles with Niko (Tammy's son) and Niko says: "My mother would never do this with me..." America's heart breaks for the child who has everything except the love and affection of his mother. Tear.    BOY NEWS - VENOM ENSUES  Still dealing with the aftermath of the "big break up with boy". The new catchphrase with he who spent the last four years of his life convincing me that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me (*SCARY*): "I am not trying to replace you." Which I translate to: "I AM trying to replace you and it's fucking hard as dick." He is dating the lite, calorie free version of me - a physical similar but not nearly as good as the original. (I go from self-hating to self-adoring when I talk about this guy, please bear with me.)  Anyway, as he was dating said downgraded version, he visited my apartment a few times to drop off mail and whatnots, did the whole clingy sideways hug thing (hiding a very erect penis, no doubt). Let it be said: I can be quite the source of arousal.  For some reason, this turned into weekly ritual and I had to end it ("don't touch me anymore, boy"). This, of course, created more longing on both our sides... The next thing I know, he was bringing over an installation disk and bam, his hands are under my shirt, in my pants, he tells me that he can't resist me blah blah...   "Oh, yes... this is so wrong... [grind] You aren't going to tell anyone, are you?"  "Who would I tell?" "I don't know. My girlfriend?" "How can I tell? I'm not even sure who she is." "But you're really smart. I'm sure you'll figure it out..."  The next day... I don't know why he came over this time, but I guess it doesn't really matter. I actually walked away at first and he - to use a trite phrase - was practically begging for it. I tried to do dishes (he knew I was feigning disinterest because I HATE washing dishes), the penis made an appearance, the rest is between him and me and, like, 10 other friends who've been hearing me agonize about this punk. Does a man who claims to be readjusting to a new relationship (with a person he claims to like) make the same "mistake" with the ex two days in a row? Does our little indiscretion mean anything other than he gets to have his cake and eat it too?   I wanted him pretty badly and contributed to his little fall from grace in little princess kristin's head (apparently he told her, and since he doesn't lie unless it's by omission, she knows that *something* happened). We have a lot of unresolved issues, and I think this MIGHT have something to do with my clitoral confusion. But I am wondering... who am I to think that I am going to get some resolution by playing professor hookup j. horndog?   Sadly, at the end of the whole thing, he was all pissed off about how he might be perceived as an asshole by princess kristin - and did not seem to care about her feelings too much. (I call her princess because I fantasize that she, his same cubicle/co-worker, is this whiny - i've heard her voicemails, I would not be surprised to hear her saying "mister... have you seen my puppeeeeeee?" - high-maintenance buppie who sleeps on a mattress with a pea underneath and stuffed bunnies on top.) But boy has never been really good about communicating so maybe he didn't mean it that way...  He used to be so nice.
