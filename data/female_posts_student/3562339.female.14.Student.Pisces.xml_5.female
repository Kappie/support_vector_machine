It's about these girl at a Christian school, who was very religious until she found out that her boyfriend was gay and she tried having sex to "cure him" and she got pregnant.  Mandy Moore plays one of her friends that becomes an enemy after the girl loses her religion.  "I'm filled with Christ love!"  Heh heh.  I saw it with the sis/Liz and with Dot.  Dot's sister, Nora, was supposed to come too, but she had work which sucks.  It was to be the Dellapennas and the Goldbergers reunited!  Because when we were young, Dot and I were best friends, and Liz and Nora were best friends.  But eh, it was still fun.  After the movie Liz and I went over to Dot's house, and Mix Master Dot is currently making us both CD mixes.  :D.  Then Liz and I both had dermatologist appointments, and while my mother and I were at Tepper Pharmacy, where we happened to see Nora working, it started raining like no other.  It was like a hurricane outside.  And the storm only lasted for like 20 minutes.  Craaaaazzzzy.  That's about it for the day.  ...la Gu
