Maybe on El Di'a de los Muertos I'll whip out some Spanish.... Maybe....  ...I don't understand why people outside of Mexico celebrate this day? ...It's sort of like the Germans celebrating our victory at Yorktown. It seems kind of silly to me....  As much as I am glad to have Lucky back, I don't think I am going to continue to wear him daily. After not wearing a watch for over 2 months it just feels weird. Like right now, it's rubbing against the edge of the keyboard and is just bothering me... Plus, it's bright red and blue look so silly.  Ugh, I hate saying that... I don't like something because it is overly silly?... What's becoming of me?       Mrs Eisenhart, my drawing teacher, after my asking to use her "skizzors" : Aw, Isn't she cute?  Andrew : Yes, Ashley Reedy is the cutest of the cute!   Hehe, Goofy stuff makes my day....  Oh, and Happy Birthday to Heidi!
