Lets see I have been a little busy. More like stressed. The heat is insane so i am having a ton of trouble sleeping at night. That then affects my morning workouts:@. To Top it off i am having insane dreams and they are all about having sex with outher people and yes i am still dating shawn:s. Oh well. I am doing this insane new workout schedule and i am in fucking pain. This better give me the results i want!!!!! btw now i am listening to it's like that and that's the way it is ( run dmc) i love this song cause it is so old school.(just the type of sound it is).SO i need to go tan outside again. and start running of course:P. I am starting school again on the 7th of September. Exactly three months before my birthday:S. I am getting so old:'(. Mckayla is not sleeping well at all she is over exahusted. I am officially going off coffee this week:( welcome to my personal hell).I am so happy to i got the jenna jamison book:D.Yesterday some guy was checking me out in the gym it felt kinda good except for the fact i get mad at shawn when he is all like cool she was checking me out so i felt really guilty.I think i am going to need to make a new running tape the other one is getting a little old. I still would love to be in playboy.How pathetic but not. Oh i want this in writing to cause i will do it.... If shawn has a stripper for his bachelor party I will be doing amature night and he can't go:D...It is equal and fair. Alot of guys i know have told me how attractve i am ..but it is like how come i was only hit on in a club like mabey 5 times or rarley asked out. It is like how attractive am I really?:s iIguess I over doubt my potential in a way. oh well. i am starting to feel a better when i look in the mirror. and i miss my nightly chats with matt:(. he harrasses me and i do it back. Shawn is doing so well at work i am to proud for words. I tell him all the time how talented he is and he just doesn't get it. So i have my fingers crossed for this next opportunity. shawn and i have been talking about the pics and i have a few ideas of what i want taken. I am working out again tonight then tmw i am going to try and run and i am bike riding about 8 to 10k. I have also decide when mckayla gets older i am going into rowing .It has been a huge desire for years. Plus i am looking into dance classes for her and I . it looks like fun.But to be honest pathetically enough i still really want to learn swing dancing but i might do celtic or hip hop just for the hell of it:D. Btw everyone i talk to online you are all a blast. There was a raging party last night by my house. totally reminded me of my party days(fall down drunk).I find that i am a funny mix cause i am obbsessed with pornography type of display of sexuality as i would love to do some of it . But a huge romantic at heart. Boys remeber that girls love to be wooed all the time. My philosphy is any place or anywhere can be made romantic. Just a matter of trying.But please don't be cheesy. I dated someone like that and couldn't stand him. When guys are fall over crazy for you will be your puppy yeah annoying. Been there done that HATE it.Just rember the little tilts to the chin to give a kiss. or the pining against the wall kissing with meaning they stick in your head. well i gotta go i am going for a walk. kisses to all and carmen electra i am so going to look like you:P or lets see daisy fuentes. but gotta love pams chest ..   HOLY fuck is this wordy :s
