And tommorow and I just want to be nice, happy, good, all of the above.  Usually in the world of Vanessa that isn't possible, but I am going to make it possible.  I am going to be the new me tommorow - confident me, proud me, happy me.  I have wasted so much time being so unhappy just because I only looked on the negative side of things.  Tommorow is going to be different.  For the past couple days that I haven't wrote in my blog I can't remember what I did.  Stuff.  That describes it.  Today I went to go see The Perfect Score and yesterday night a watched a movie.  Of course that isn't all - it's just the rest of the stuff that I did - I can't exactly remember.
