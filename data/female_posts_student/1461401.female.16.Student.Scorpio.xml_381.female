After that we went to matt and dan's and hung out there for a while. I felt kinda bad for dan, just because he was just kinda hangin out when we all came over and crashed, and I think by the end he was really getting pissed off. And as weird as this may sound, I also felt kinda bad for maggie. Yeah, she was listening in and yeah she has done things just to get attention from us, but still. If she's going through all this trouble, doesn't that mean that she's been hurt pretty bad? I also think that a lot of things that's been done to her have been unprovoked, and purly to get a reaction. Yes, she's been really really annoying at times, but then, a lot of us are being worse right now. Oh well, after a while Steven and George came and that was totally awesome. We were driving around with the spice girls blasting and it was just really fun. I didn't end up going to big boy's though, even though amber was there. I was just starting to feel kind of uncomfortable with the whole... situation... so I figured it was best that I made my exit. Oh well. Now I'm sleepy, so I think I'll go take a nap. Have a good day/night/evening/afternoon/whatever.
