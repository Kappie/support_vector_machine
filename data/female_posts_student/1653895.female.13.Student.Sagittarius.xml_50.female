WE SEE SETH REEKER AND SONG!    well see they were walking to ben and jerry's and rosies all "omfg! and jumped on them" and so they're all "woah!" and we're all "yaye!" and life was happy and we went to B twas a partay. so we're gunna get some sleep and tomorrow we're goin to the beach/chicago/ shopping/ to the pool and it will be grand! oh i almost forgot---WE GOT MATZO BALL SOUP!!! i heart it so bad.    the end.
