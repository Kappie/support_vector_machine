I love the way you make me smile thats why i hate the weeks where i have to wait so long till i see you again so i may feel the smile seep across my face.   I love the way you comfort me when im down or had a rough day in a way you could say your my pot of gold at the end of this ever so long rainbow which seem'd so dark in the begining   I love how your so perfect in my eyes i would never change a thing about you and i really i hope i can make you as happy as you do for me.   I feel as if i would die without you but maybe thats just the fear of being alone?  But i know i need you i can feel it in the pit of my soul as it screams for your touch  .   I look into the mirror and watch the tears go by while i gaze at the clock every so often watching time fly and trying to remember your warmth I think thats the only thing keeping me sain while your away   I want so badly to reach for the razor but i know i mus'nt knowing nothing good will come of it..   all i can do is wait for is the pain to end and for you to return to me.
