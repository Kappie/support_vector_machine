This guy who is  a CYT parent owns a haircutting place bye esther short park and this girl was like "can you cut my hair to make it match with the era?" So he was like "Sure!!!!" So she got a bob then this other girl was like "Cut mine tooo!" It went on ;) It was SO coool! Haha.  so then we went home and I changed and then we went to church. So Matt and I went to the servcie together and he was like  "Lets sit over there." So I looked over there and I was like "Holy smack" The twins were sitting right there. AH!!!   So I was like..how about we sit in the far corner? So he was like okay whatever.  So the whole time I waas like oh my goodness, what are they doing here?   Haha.  So I talked to them afterwards and they said they were visiting our church to decide if they wanted to go here (or is it there?) and how they have a soccer game in seattle tomorrow. So I was like "Oh...interesting.." tehn I ran away to hang out with my cooler friends ;)  The end.
