And while Bill's not home...well...let's just say we know why his kid's half-human.  Anyway, now that I've finished freaking everyone out, comes the self-depreciating section of my post.  I tried to rollerblade today, b/c Dollface and Summer managed to confuse me...and it was the last mistake I will ever make. Couldn't you girls have gone your whole lives without seeing me fall SO many times? I personally would much prefer to keep my incompetence well-hidden, or at least show it, in a not-so-painfully-embarrasing manner. Yeah, complain all you want that you've already trained me to try not to be embarassed in front of girls, but I can't help but,...I fell NINE TIMES...COME ON! I could've gone with out that!...I SUCK!  I'm Deadinside and that's my stupid complaint for today.  "I'm a human being, not a piece of meat! Love me for my MIND!"
