Um, so um...Oh yeah today I get to ...CLEAN OUT MY CLOSET!...fasinating, eh? It will take me forever though cause...I hate my closet. And it's small. With stuff bursting out of it. Then around 5, I am going to Panera's and meet up with Nicole...I haven't seen her all summer, so that should be good. Then we may go see a movie but we don't know what or which or when, we are just going to show up at the movie place and see what's playing at the time we get there. Sounds like a solid plan, huh?
