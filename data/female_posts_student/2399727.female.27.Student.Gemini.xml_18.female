       
      Today has been uneventful.  I set up a dessert/coffee evening with the old friend who is now in town for Thursday.  I am seeing a friend from Winnipeg tomorrow night, and going to my priest-friend's funeral tomorrow morning at 10am.  I'm not looking forward to it but I want to be there all the same.  More to come...
