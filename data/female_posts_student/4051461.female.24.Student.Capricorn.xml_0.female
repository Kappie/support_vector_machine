Not that I ever go to bed at an even close to reasonable hour, but when I do finally crash...it's pretty fuckin wierd.  Besides the flailing and wandering about...I have the craziest dreams EVER.  Sometimes I even think they're real.  This can be fairly cool...if I have a good dream...but Murphy's law insists that the only time my dreams are vivid and confused with real life events is when they are either horrificly violent, retardedly scary, or just messed up.  Sometimes the messed up ones can be kind of fun...but usually just a bit of a pain in the ass.  But either way it usally takes me awhile to decifer when something didn't actually occur and was just my subconscious being trixie.  So...a friendly warning...if I ever start rambling nonsense or accuse you of performing outrageous acts...remember...narco meds are not 100% effective!
