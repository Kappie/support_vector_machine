Kay so Latin today was certainly...an experience, here is how it started and my quote of the day.  Mrs Greaves: The birthrate was quite low in the Roman upper classes and we must assume that they had some from of affective contraception...(Bramwell mumbles something)...as it wasn't through abstaination. You were going to say something Luke? Luke: I was going to say maybe they spent all their time at the baths instead. (We all burst out laughing) Mrs Greaves (also laughing): And what are you insinuating that they did at the baths? Luke:...healthy exercise (more laughing) you know three sided ball games. Tom: Let's not get into that. Mrs Greaves: I agree  Me, Shannon, Vicky, Elenor, Kelly and Fallows were all in fits of laughter by the end of that one...perhaps you had to be there. We then went on to talk about chinese yang symbols drawn insterad of Â£, and then there was a stirring rendition of 'Turning Japanese by the Vapours', just to round off an incredibly weird weird lesson. And then I went into the hall to waitfor my mum, and Mr Fitton and Mr Grey were dancing on the stage (it's really funny!), and then Mr Wyton sand mustang sally, trust him singing 'come on baby' is a rather disturbing thing to say the least!!!!  Anyway I'm home to the relative safety of My grandma's, that is if you don't count the fact that she is (quite literally) force feeding me apple pie, I'm not even hungry!!!!!!! or skinny!!!! I'm just normal sized!  Anyway I'm gonna go now Coz i'm bored  Dani
