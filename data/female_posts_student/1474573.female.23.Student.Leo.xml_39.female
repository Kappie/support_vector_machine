Well for starters I have an actual 9-5 (on top of my 6pm to 8 AM gig) and this one actually pays money and then again i also get to live on 13th st which works. So now that I'm in a corporate job (well not THAT corporate, it's with the University.) I do have to maintain hours that definately impede on my humanity. The work day should be no more then 4 or 5 hours long.....they REALLY don't need us there that long....they're just trying to break us iknow it. Anyway....in an attempt to LOOK like i'm doing work...feverishly typing away....I can maintain this blog AND my job and you can get to investigate into my life and basically poke around.Sooo...what am I working on? Well I'm still not fighting...I have to get physical therapy on my toe so i have no way getting rid of my agression...I'm going to see 28 days later wit Fish...Stay tuned for my review of it..Live long....prosper
