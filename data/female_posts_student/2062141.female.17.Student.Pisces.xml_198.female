I've been sitting in front of my computer for 2 hours listening to Billy Joel, my dad was playing it on the piano and I had to go listen to the real thing. It's pouring rain. I like it. I like rain. When I'm in the mood for it... and I am. I'm home all alone and it's cozy in my house and it's raining. Unfortunately it's also Friday, and I don't have any plans at all. Oh well. The weekend awaits.
