Aight, I'm subscribed to this email service that emails me whenever  urlLink Whitetail  is going to get snow.  I got one today. No biggie; I knew snow was in the forecast. But what grabbed my attention was the amount of snow...   urlLink Have a lookie..  (sorry about the size)  ...Read that again... 13 inches tonight! 13 INCHES! Wheee!  ...Yes, I do know that forecast is for Whitetail which is about 30 minutes to an hour away, depending on the driver, but there cannot be too great of a difference for the weather here.
