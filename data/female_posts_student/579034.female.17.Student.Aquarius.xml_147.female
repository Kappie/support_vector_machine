No, wait, I went to the mall with Debra and Jenn and then at night I went to my aunt and uncles 25th wedding anniversery party which was a blast and a half. It was nice to see the whole family. I haven't seen Jenna, James, and Alec for the longest time so it was nice and no waves were made which meant smooth sailing. I didn't get back till about like 2 though so I was mad tired. Then, Saturday I took my senior pictures that I'm sure I blinked for every single one of them. My dad picked me up and took me to my cousins birthday party which was fun cause it was at an ice skating rink. Then back at my aunt and uncles house I took a 2 hour power nap and then I got home around... oh... 11. Track meet today which was like, awesome, besides the fact that we didn't get home early enough for me to go to the mall but like I said I went tanning so F the mall. Yeah so anyways, like I was saying, the track meet was good. We placed 4th in the 4x100 meter relay and then Alysen broke the school record by jumping 5'5. Jesse won the 400 and 800 meter, Morg ran the 1500, Christie ran the 3000, then Melissa, Carolin, Roquel, and Alysen won the 4x400 meter relay and then came my race! The 4x200!  I don't know what happened, all I know is that once Mari Rose gave me that stick, I just went. After the first 100 of it, I was like "Okay, doing this I should hit 29 if I keep it up." then I hear Melissa screaming "LAUREN SHE'S RIGHT ON YOUR TAIL!! MOVE LAUREN, MOVE!!!!!!!!!!" at the top her of lungs.  So now I'm freakin out like "OMG this girls gonna pass me and I'm gonna loose points... no can't let that happen" so I just like made myself go faster all the while straining my ears to see if that girl was about the pass me and then it was done and I was like "Yeah, deff 29, maybe 29.1 or 29 flat but I don't think it was anything spectacular."  Then Melissa comes up to me and goes "You are  insane  and I go, "Why?" and she goes " 27.9 " I was like WHAT!!!!!!! I was so happy I almost started to cry I was like jumpin up and down and laughin and like I said, I almost cried I was soooo happy. I was like finally thank God I'm starting to produce something from the nothing that I have been running lately. I mean, I've been trying to step it up and work harder but going into that race I was just not expecting that. And I mean to jump those two seconds it was crazy! Like I basicly said F you to 28 and Hello There to 27. The awesomeness was unbelieveable. Then I treated myself to an ice cream and a snow cone and a few sips of a Pepsi but then it made my tummy hurt so I stopped drinking it. So after the meet everyone was pretty happy cause we got thrid over all and thats VERY cool considering and Islands we got 4th. I went home and took Morgan and Melissa tanning. It wasn't too bad I like it. It makes you feel all warm. My ass felt a little hotter then I thought it should but o well. Who doesn't want a tanned ass? And that was my weekend. Yay for being happy and laughing again! x0x
