Phew. he didn't bring the discs he needs though. No good. Oh well. Yesterday was alright. I had to do concessions though. that was actually pretty tiring. It was cool though because Ari was working with me and she's awesome so...good times. Then, i hung out with Bryan afterward. We just drove around for like two hours and talked. It was fun. I mean, I was really tired but I'm glad I went out. I complained to him a lot about liking number 3...again. Or...never stopping actually. Heh. I'm an idiot. I really am. He told me to just start spending less time with the person but that's...really difficult when all I want to do is spend time with that person. I don't spend much time with him to begin with anyway so, eh.   Anyway, this afternoon should be pretty fun. I'm going to the mall. i always love going to the mall. It's good fun times. I want to go to Hollister. I didn't know they had one in the mall until the last time I went and I didn't have enough time to look at anything before I had to go. So, YaY! that'll be fun.. Then, tonight, I'm either going to see LOTR, Return of the King since I didn't get to see the last 20 minutes of it the last time i went or going out dancing. i'm not positive we're going dancing though so...who knows? I may just do something else with them. I didn't get to hang out with them last night though so, i'm thinking i should probably go do something with them. Fun times. I do really want to go dancing. We'd go to this club that Diane told us about. I guess it's really really fun.   And in other news...heh, heh, what a nerdy thing to say....I got a call from Jewel last night and I guess I'm having an interview next friday. Whoo? I think I still might apply to either Hollywood or Blockbuster too, because I'm not positive I want to work at Jewel.   Wow, the shift key on this keyboard is truly awful. It's really annoying. i'm using my mom's computer since mine obviously is demonic and wants to kill me.   Anyway, gotta go take a shower. I'll write more later. Ta ta...
