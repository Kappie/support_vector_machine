Has anyone ever heard them? If you have please tell me what you think of them. From the lyrics I'm reading they seem pretty good. And I would like to give a congrats to Jon for getting a scholarship to RIT and being in the paper! lol  Well, right now I'm talking to Eric, Josh, Jon, and Molly and reading lyrics from Get Up Kids. I'll give ya a sample of the stuff that I like so far:   Keep the light on in the window For the time that I am gone And when this all is over You will never be alone Keep your head up So you know When you wake up  I'll be home  -All That I Know-   i'm watching you fall from grace  breaking a heart of gold  don't ever try saving face  run with your heart of stone  don't keep waiting up for me  don't keep hoping i'll come home   -Fall From Grace-   This isn't what i wished for This isn't what i knew What can waiting do?  -Let The Reigns Go Loose-   Do hope I won't  Learn to make  The same mistakes,  That you would  Make me aware  That only fear,  My only hope,  Is letting go.  -Overdue-   Just wait till tomorrow.  I guess that's what they all say  just before they fall apart.  -Regret-  More later when I find out if I actually like them or not...
