I went to the store and bought a new carafe for the coffee pot because I shattered the other one in an explosion of day-old drip and glass shards. There are still bits of glass on the floor even though I mopped the whole thing... I suppose I'll just have to get Devon to walk around in there barefoot to catch any leftovers.  just when I thought I was free to throw life away on the computer/vegetate/jam the folks called, and I babysat for five hours, which is a bit more than usual. While sitting I encountered the hamburger affair, which is actually just a series of phone calls following the delivery of my dinner, a burger and coke.   -10 minutes after starting my burger- "caitlin, don't eat... Have you eaten?" "yeah" "all of it?" "nope" "well I don't think the meat is good, it tastes a bit funky"   -after 10 minutes of reveling the impending food poisoning- "caitlin, I think the burgers are alright, your mother just put an entire bottle of worcestershire sauce in the meat and probably some other seasoning shit" "that's good, 'cause I ate it anyway"  once that was over, i proceeded to put the kids to bed, resulting in a screaming, crying, wailing symphony, which lasted until the folks came home.
