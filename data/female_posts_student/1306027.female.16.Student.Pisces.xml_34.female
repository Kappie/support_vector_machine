I'd rather not catch you up because, well, that would take forever. I could go on and on about my commitment issues, but that could get really boring, really quickly. So what was the whole point off this post? Well I can tell you that- the purpose of this post it to tell you that I'm back blogging and I have some stories to tell. I also have a trusty sidekick this time... Mista Jiggyfly my barnes and nobles teddy. Why the name? Have you seen that geico commercial where the white dude is rapping and he's like "Don't use bad words this ain't no puppet shoew, Always use good manners when ya eatin a sloppy joahhheee, Go ohn and ohn and ohn and ohn, PEACE". *ahem, the misspelling is due to his white boy rapping accent* Well I was so moved by the commercial, that I named my bear Mista Jiggyfly. That's better than naming him Trunk Monkey so stop laughing!     Since when did soul jam appear on Dick Clark's Rocking New Years Eve?  I don't understand it. So I'm going to go contemplate the concept.
