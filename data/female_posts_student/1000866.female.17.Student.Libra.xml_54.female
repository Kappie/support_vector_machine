It was so nice of him, and I just...I don't know, I can't handle ANYTHING right now. I really can't. I'm going to crack at someone...probably the next person to crack a joke about me or tease me. I'm SO FRICKING SICK OF IT. Yeah, it's funny sometimes, but today...it really got to me. Sometimes it really bothers me. I hate having people hate me for no reason when I've done nothing to them. What the heck did I do to him that's so terrible? Does he hate me because he's better at trumpet than me, because I suck at trumpet? Heh, probably. Gosh, why are some people such jerks too? "Yeah, he doesn't like you." I don't mean like like as a girlfriend, but just like as a person. That really really ticks me off. He has NO RIGHT to hate me. None. I've said maybe four true words to him in the time I've known him. Four words that actually mean something. Four words that aren't me joking around with him.  Why do people tell you that other people don't like you? What business is it of theirs? NONE! That's right...NONE! Absolutely possitively zip, zero, negative, nada, whatever! Just...none!! ARGH! I don't even know why I care so much, I barely know the kid, but, I guess it just bothers me that someone can dislike me when they don't know me at all.   No one knows me though.  There's no one like me....I wish I had a clone. I know I could tell everything to it, and have it not tell anyone. I'm listening to Reflections of Earth. It was our show for marching band my freshman year. It makes me incredibly sad every time I hear it. It  makes me want to cry, but...heh, a lot's been doing that today. What's scary though, is I know I'm actually upset and not just PMS'ing. I wish I were PMS'ing. It would explain a lot, but....no. I'm just plain mad, and I don't think there's anything anyone can do about it.   Man, this bites so bad. I don't like people right now. Not even myself. Maybe my mommy and daddy. I like my mom and dad.   I do like everyone, I'm just annoyed, and frustrated, and angry, and so many other things right now. I miss Disney world.   I don't like when people call me Norkus, I don't like when people poke fun at me all the time. Maybe that's why I don't trust anyone. Maybe that's why I feel like I can't tell anyone anything. Heh, I don't like not being able to tell anyone anything. I don't like waking up and realize the first class I have, I have to sit between two people who I don't particularily care for. I don't like that that person hates me. I don't like a lot of things.  This isn't anger toward anyone in particular, well...a few people, but only Nathan, and the person who hates me. But, that's it.  Man, abyss of nothingness, here I come.  I'm out.
