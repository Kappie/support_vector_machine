We did the whole cake and present thing and just kind of...sat around and played games/talked. Haha...passion fruit. YaY! This weekend has been so much fun. Plus...it's snowing and that's really cool. Hah...snow...cool...get it? OK...this is where I shut my mouth and go sleep. YaY sleep. Gotta love it.
