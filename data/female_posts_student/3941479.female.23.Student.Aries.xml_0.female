Not because I feel that I have to but because it's really pretty logical no that's the wrong word to use but I'm not going to think of another one... because if you jump straight into bed with each other everything gets complicated and there isn't really any surprises anymore. If im honest with myself I'd have to say that sex changes everything, if I sleep with someone straight away I'm usually less inclined to really get to know them. Where as if your not going to sleep with them you can actually get to know a lot more... like the little stuff that I never really bothered to find out about my ex, just stuff that you find out when you are talking with a person till all hours of the night rather than getting hot and sweaty. Don't get me wrong I did still have a heart to hearts with my previous partner but the information I found out I should have already known. That's just my thoughts on the subject.       But back to the tempting bit, I guess I'm finding it hard to resist going back to the oh this'll be fun kind of attitude, it's not as easy as it sounds to just not get together with someone you actually have to work at it :-) I mean I figured I would but just not this hard. Why do you males out there make it so difficult?       Ah well guess I'll just have to come up with some new strategies any ideas?
