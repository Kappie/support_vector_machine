Me and madeline had a doughnut war and madeline had doughnut all over her nose, and i had it in my hair. Anna just laughed at us incessantly, but even caked in doughnut some random black guys outside dunkin' donuts hit on us. They were like "look at you lookin' like an angel, mmhmm" we're like "walk faster!" good times, good times, also me and anna stayed up until 3 o'clock watching hot foreign guys... Shakespeare in love (joseph fiennes), Brassed Off (ewan mcgreggor), Someone Like You (hugh jackman) YUM!
