I usually only tidy my bedroom on command of my parents, but this time, I started it alone, and it only took me one hour to get around half of it done. By ten, I was in my nice neat bed, watching Big Brother. (which I was laughing my head off at. Michelle is getting all possessive over Stu, because he is now attached at the waist to Shell. What fun!)  There is one person in this world, who I wish I was attached at the waist to. I think it would be quite fun, as a school project, for girls to be attached to boys, according to their weight. Knowing my luck, I would be attached to Umar (as he is really light); but it would make us all socialise more, and it would be pretty fun to see who cracked first. Of course, it wouldn't be possible, because of different subject and sets and all that, bu oh well...I think it would be funny.  What am I doing today? Probably tidying my bedroom more. Goodbye, or as Sara says, Ciao.
