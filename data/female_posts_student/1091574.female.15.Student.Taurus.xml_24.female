EURO2004!!!!  here goes: crazy abt euro2004 but the irony of me having the inability to catch any of the soccer mania. How frustrating!!! oh ofcourse i have to admit part of the desire of watching it is to fulfill every girl's satisfaction.  the HUNK APPETITE! hahaha... i mean, face it. a girl will always be a girl at heart. you see a suave-looking guy, u get a bit a tipsy. isn't true?? uless you're abnormal swooning over the wrong gender. oh don't u fid euro200 a reality show for choosing the most all rounded perfect model guy for choices of husband. awesome looks! deeeeep pockets for you enjoy the exqusite treasures and pleasures of the world (pls be reminded these articles are to taken lightly. Christian value: store our treasures in heaven not earth hor...) and lastly a stable income. if you're jobless, no fear. you have a huge bank acct behind you. and with your hubby's excellent soccer skills (i.e ronaldino), you don't have to further frown over your boy's future.  Just ask him to hone the skills from his father and wa-la u've produced a line a of superb soccer players. this applies for any marriage between you and a famous sport personnel hor... but euro2004 isn't only abt the hotties. it is also abt enjoying the thilling action and the intense anticipation of the heart-pounding football matches.  Once a striker is on fire, you start to slowly lift your butt of the couch and cheer and chant"goal goal goal" but usually 85% of the time its a false alarm.  Then let's say that Owen scores for England, the crowd automatically makes a joyful din. you'll hear things like" YES!" "GOAL Ah!! or the most annoying " YAY!! Money Come..." hahahaha.. don't you quite agree with me? especially the ah jeks, always say " ai seh! sui sui sia!" "hao qiu! da de hao! lai he jiu he jiu!" i have then termed euro2004 a hypertension-giver, heart-atacker-starter and a world of fantasies.  euro2004 makes people go boloney!! However i have to strongly reccomend euro2004. if u're looking for some good clean action-packed enjoyment, switch on the tv late at night tune to channel 5 and pumpthe adreline.  and a word of unholy advice, place your bets on any england germany and france and germany matches, they play well.  soak into the fever of euro2004 dears!!!  editor, cowwie
