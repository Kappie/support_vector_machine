Typically, Simpsons quotes reflect my mood...sometimes, I'm giggly, sometimes sarcastic, sometimes (a lot of the time) angry, but right now I'm happy.  I did go to the painting thing, and it was actually a lot of fun.  I learned how to make stencils for six foot cards; how to use a roller to paint; how to paint giant hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades; and how to best soak the juice from your cellular phone.  I left it in the sun, which zapped the battery.  I was left in the sun too long too...I have a bit of color to my face (anyone can tell you I'm scary pale in the wintertime), but I got a terrible side effect.  I have the dreaded...drum roll please, along with scary duh duh duh dun DUN...redneck t-shirt tan.  If it were up to me, I would have worn a cute almost sleeveless shirt with skirt and high heels, but my mom made me change into a bleach stained polo with sweat pants.   Well I really need to write my rough draft, cause it's due monday and I lost my disk that had the entire thing, so I have to rewrite ten pages.  Later.
