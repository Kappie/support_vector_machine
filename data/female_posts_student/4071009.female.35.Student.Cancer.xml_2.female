I honestly have nothing to share with the outside world, and this is purely to give myself something else to play with on the computer. I'm a dork.    So what can I put on this silly blog? Pictures of my lovely children and dogs, so I can be perceived as a weirdo dog lover and one of those people who foists photos of their children on other people. Info about my other time waster-knitting. Lists of favorite yarns and free patterns, photos of finished projects (ha!), etc. More pictures of my dogs. Honestly. Like I said, time waster.
