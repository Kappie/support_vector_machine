I used to complain a lot, but at the same time I guess that's what bloggers are used for in the teenage world.   So maybe I should go on tell you about recent events. Last night was great... I mean really great and not what I expected at all. After hanging out with Max in downtown A2 I went back to Ypsi and called the most random people. I ended up hanging out with Joce and we talked for it seemed like minutes but in all reality it was about 2 hours. It was wonderful. Just reminds me of the old times with her and James in her old room, smoking out, listening to great music, spinning in her chair, and thinking that life couldn't get any better. And unfortunately it didn't, after our trip to Mackinaw Island a couple of years ago we lost touch because we basically got annoyed with eachother. We were only freshman... So last night she invited me to Rocky Horror with her at midnight tonight, I'm excited. I might have to ditch B though, I love you B.  I really can't wait until summer, or spring break for that matter. Being able to stay out later will definately be a plus.  *Sigh* I'm getting sort of lazy so I'll continue my entry about good times later... love you all.
