FireDancyr7: so if you had dated this guy... say Josh or Jeff or someone and you broke up with them and then your friend started dating them behind your back because they were really into it, what would you do? toeknee5987: i'd be pissed FireDancyr7: really? FireDancyr7: I am torn toeknee5987: and probably really hurt-  toeknee5987: it depends on how serious the relationship was toeknee5987: why do you ask? FireDancyr7: my friend is dealing with telling her friend she's dating this guy and she wants to know what I think FireDancyr7: I'm not good with the question cause I think it would clearly depend on the situation toeknee5987: this guy dated her friend?  how serious was it FireDancyr7: she really likes him FireDancyr7: but from what she says I am kind of under the impression she's getting played FireDancyr7: I don't know toeknee5987: wait- shes dating a friends boyfriend?
