Pausing in between school and dentist again, and I'm again starting to stress out horribly over everything. Where shall we start? The beginning is good, but, then You would be here for infinity and a day.  Tomorrow I walk across the stage and recieve my Diploma saying I'm somewhat educated. Hooray? I think... Its nerve racking to say the least. I have 2 exams tomorrow, one in Math and another in Spanish. Wrote a Verb exam in Spanish today (I completely blanked out on Future Tense!!) and tomorrow is on Vocabulary. Math is on Statistics, so hoping that since I'm doing so good understanding the homework I'll do okay on the test.  I still have to do a test run of my grad outfit for Friday. Stress.. stress stress!!!! Not to mention I need to memorize quotes for my English Pt.A Diploma, and study for my Social Pt.A Diploma, both of which are next week, and then my Creative Writing Portfolio is due on Friday, AH! I don't have my 10 pages done yet.  - - - -   ~We were strangers, starting out on a journey. Never dreaming what we'd have to go through. Now here we are and I'm suddenly standing, at the beginning with You. No one told me I was going to find You, unexpected what You did to my heart, when I lost hope, You were there to remind me, this is the start.~   - - - -  Had to pause in between there to go to the Dentist... woohoo for never having to see her again....... for another 6 months. So now I'm numb and in a pissy mood because of it. Oh well.  20 minutes before I write the second half of my English test. Blah. Boringness. Come home to some more stress, but eh.. well..  Did I mention I'm sick of being emotionally blackmailed? Yes well, I am, and those of you who do it to me, stop before it spins around and bites you back harder. You know it will.
