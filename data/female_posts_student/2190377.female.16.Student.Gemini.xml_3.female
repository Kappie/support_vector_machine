Who the hell actually reads this? REALLY?  Oh well.  So far, I've: lost best friend of five years, screwed relationship with boyfriend of six months to point of no return--via aforementioned lost friend (messy situation, I've probably already told you anyways), single-handedly destroyed my academic career, been told my recent ADD test scores were so bad I scored lower than 99.5% of people that took it, been told I'm not going to be medicated yet because my brain waves are abnormal and medication may f*** me up even more, gotten seriously ill, played basketball with 100 fever, lost voice to the point where my sexuality would be questioned by strangers, blown off at least half a dozen friends, lost seven pounds, and had three close friends tell me they would jump my bones were retarded boyfriend not to exist.    You try and swallow all that when you're so weak you can barely walk up the stairs.     Not that I'm bitter or resentful of anything.  Heavens forbid.  So, tell me about your life. Oh, you feel as if I've been ignoring you? I'm so sorry, I'm such a selfish person, how could I have put my needs before yours? Next time my life falls to pieces I'll drop everything so I can support you.  I realize what a sensitive person you are.  And your life is just so tough. You poor thing...  Wow.  I'm a regular basketcase.  Just so you know, that wasn't directed at anyone that actually reads this, except maybe Jeremy. haha. hahahahahaha.  I hate my life.  Die bitches.   Happy Thanksgiving!!  -_-
