IN LOVE. i missed so many people when i was away. one of which.. my brother, but i saw him and gave him clothes i bought him. by the way i have so many new clothes. kind of sad really. but amazingly cool. and i miss andrea. and i miss heather. and i miss rachelle. and now i miss kristin, but not as much as others... well maybe as much as rachelle, lol. and i miss brianne. and eric, i've written to you and i'm on my second page! hah! ... i miss tennis and soccer. maybe i'll go play some now before heather comes over. oh my god do i miss her. and i can't wait to see andrea. i came back a couple days early. but i think i'm going to my grandparents for a couple of days to help my brother deal with their retardedness. oh yea.. i have a pretty good tan for me. it's not like, sexellent or anything. but it's alright. thanks for the emails guys. see you soon guys. love, *bekah*
