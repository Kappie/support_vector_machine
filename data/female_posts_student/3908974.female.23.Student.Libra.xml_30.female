Dreamed the other night that I went fishing in this runoff ditch under an overpass.  The water was sick and black with purple lights in it.  I was bobber fishing from a raft made out of a tire.  Trash floated by--shoes, oil cans, used rubbers.  There was a Roman bath with pillars on one end, and a levee with a dilapidated dock on the other.  Old fisherman drinking coffee from a Thermos sat on the dock.  Punk rock boys hung off the marble staircase of the bath.  I drifted to and fro, then I was eaten by a diseased orange catfish the size of a man.  (4:20) Saw a strange crimson moon while out driving in the fields near the lake.  My old country cruising grounds.  How full of memories those roads are!  I remember how I used to ride next to my husband with my head on his shoulder and our fingers laced.  Back when it was good.  Sunsets so pretty they about killed me to see them, then.   And that summer of torrential rains, catfishing in the dark in our matching overalls, muddy and smiling.  I also remember driving those roads alone, sick with grief, wanting so bad just to keep on driving so I wouldn't have to go home to him.  Sleeping out at Lonestar Lake with my Taj Mahal and my chardonnay.  How ironic, Lonely Star.  Part of the reason I wanted to leave this place is that it's pregnant with memories.  I have worn it out like an old shoe, and traces of the past cling to it.  I hope these next couple of years cover up the worst and replace the bad with goodness.  The crimson moon bodes well.  The last two nights have been insomnia nights, which are frustrated and exhausting.  My mind just turns over and over on itself, a broken record.  I finally took a sleeping pill last night.  I hallucinated briefly before conking out like I'd been hit on the head with a mallet.  My man decided to stick around and not run for state rep, which is a great deal on all counts.  It's not just that he'll be here, finishing college and of course hanging out a lot with me.  It's also the heightened respect I have for him now that he's decided to stand up to his dad.   Not that I didn't respect him already, but I feel like staying and finishing school was the adult choice.    So I was thinking of asking him to move in with me, but I keep stopping myself.  I remember how quickly I got domestic with my husband, and there's really a lot of charm in waiting.  I enjoy having my own space and I like the concept of dating instead of living together.  What's the hurry?  Sometimes a tight budget and other extraneous factors can encourage a couple move too fast.  So I have resisted the impulse.  I think this is a good thing.  I have to at least seem aloof.  (I need to practice that.)  I think I am getting better at learning from my mistakes.    I think.
