It's just one of those words that makes me laugh.    So, anyways.  Today was kind of boring again, but I did watch  Freaky Friday  and  My Big Fat Greek Wedding , which I must say I never thought lead up to all the hype it got.  My favorite part was with the pimple and the Windex and the part where Niko and Angelo make Ian say "I have three testicles" in Greek.  And, of course, Freaky Friday is just cool and I really really want to see  Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen  soon, it comes out on Friday I believe.  I actually read the book like years ago or something, but I totally forgot about it until I read a thing that the movie was based on a book, so now I sort of remember.    Also, I ate a turkey roll-up with some cranberry sauce in it.  Lovely.  And I put some more birdseed out so the little birdies don't starve to death (or maybe more because my mom wanted me to do it).  I packed for going to Connecticut this morning.  We are leaving tomorrow morning and staying over until Friday and visiting some colleges and stuff.  I think it shall be good, especially just to get out of the house, because I haven't really left the house for a along period of time for a few days.    I really want to see  Ten Things I Hate About You  again.  It is such qual-i-tay.  I must say that I absolutely detest Gran on Gilmore Girls.  She is just so aggravating and I didn't miss her.  I would never even be able to think of responses like she gives.  I am super excited to here about Seth's flopping around like a fish out of water with Summer on the O.C. because we all know how incredibly cool Adam Brody is.
