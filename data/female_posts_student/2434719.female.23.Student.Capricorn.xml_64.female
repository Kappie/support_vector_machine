"later i'll regret this, later this could leave a stain, later this could be bad, later i might wish i chose the other, later i could be hurt."  is it being silly, or is this being smart?  i say smart. i stick with smart. cause i have regretted, and i have left stains, and it has been bad, and i did wish for hte other, and i have been hurt.  prevention, my friends, is the best medicine :)
