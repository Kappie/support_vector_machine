Then went to school,I handed the chocolate to Ting and Lay yen.I also chat with Shan Lei about the IU day(but mostly got class tambahan).I don't think I'll be going to the IU day.   Then when back to class,I threathen Bryan to delete the pic with his cow.We two start a fight but i managed to get the cow.But then,he used the teacher to threathen me.....sigh....a bit angry with him,but then he got said sorry,so everything alright.I felt very sleepy at the Science period and become energitic when History period.   When recess,I listen to Fhei Fhen mumbling about Weetat.Weetat just sometimes not that gentle to girls lar.Too bad for that.....When Chinese period,I and Emma kept on talking and talking.Quite a nice day to chat.   At last,it's Math period.Puan Katinah was sick but she still insist to teach and gave lots homework.Today was my turn to call people clean up the class but they just didn't listen to me and making fun on me.I'm very irritated to that.Luckily Taufiq got helped me do some work.Thanks him a lot.   Hope my luck will turn better soon ^-^
