I kinda feel like I'm losing alot, but in the end, maybe I'll end up gaining more.  I think that all in all, the good and the bad in our lives can be justified in some way. I think that the bad we have to endure in life will only make us truly appreciate the good, that, in my case, is yet to come. I actually feel bad for people who never have to deal with pain and suffering. Because life will never be as wonderful and prized to them as it is to the people who know what it's like to lose. So, I guess that that makes me luckier than all of those people I've envied so much. I mean, sometimes I just ask myself how much more of this I can take before I'll break. The funny thing is that I'm growing a stronger independence. I'm just waiting for the big turn around. The one I just wish would happen.  Well, g'night crazies.
