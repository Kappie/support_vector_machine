I went with my mum so I actually got some stuff! :O :O :O I now, shock horror style! Oh if you're wondering why I'm here it's cause the 'support staff' are on strike! Yeay! Go them! They set up a picket line outside of school apparantly! Woohoo! We just get a day off of school. Aaah, I love our school. Oh, and Izzy I am doing that model animation (darn still can't spell) course at Backwell! Yeay! We can do really dumb stuff and freak every one out! Ahh I love being me some times, although other times I really hate it... Mmm... but that's the same with every one, isnt' it cause no one's perfect. Uhuh, so seriously... people...? Any way, scary thing I have to do my piano exam soon eeeeek! I mean aural HELP! (Yeah, yeah, I need a dictionary!) Bet that's spelt wrong any way! Hey I'm gonna go freak people out and then curl up into a ball, bye.
