After lunch we went back to her house and chilled there for a while. We wanted to go somewhere, but there was nowhere to go plus it was like 5PM and I had to be home. We decided that we would have our outing tomorrow. We're getting our nails done and getting a waxing tomorrow after noon, then going to lunch, then we're going back to her house to watch Old School because shes never seen it before. I hope all our plans go ok because usually when I make plans ahead of time they never turn out on how I expect them to go.  Tomorrow Friday the 13th...me and ALyssa just realized that,lol.  My dad's mad because I refuse to go up to our vacatiion home in Tahoe this weekend. I dont wanna go because theres gonna be way too many people there. I'm not a people person,lol. My aunts,uncles,and cousins all bundled up in a house...greeeaat. no thanks. i need my space.
