I feel like my resources have been completely depleted because I was so anxious about this test, but it went better than I could have guessed.  I only had to pause and really think about a few of the multiple choice questions, and there were maybe only two I didn't know the answers to.  I should know my grade on the m/c part by Wednesday if I am able to obtain my copy of the question booklet by then.  Shouldn't be a problem, but I'm curious to know how I did.  Obviously. :-)  Now I might be able to return to life as normal for a couple of weeks before the mass cramming starts again for the midterm on June 28! :-)  More to come... maybe more frequent blogging to come, too...
