Afterwards, I read  Gatsby  outside, and then Nick and I went for a hike at the beach.  We got this great idea for the cover of litmag, and I guess the plan is to pursue it tomorrow at 9 with Mela.  So I came home tired and screwed around for a bit, then I went and met Heather and Insha at the beach with some Persian dudes and some people from school and Leela, who is the best.  Waited around for the hookah to arrive, and it was pretty worth it.  It was like orange flavored and very mellow.  Well anyway, now it's tomorrow and I need to sleep for all the work I've got to do tomorrow.  Later.
