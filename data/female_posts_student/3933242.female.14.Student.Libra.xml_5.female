I was so tired out today that hope I juz can shut my eyes and let me float in the outspace in my mind.  Things are getting so stress up recently  .My class performed in Talent quest which I think that they done their best. THe dance was beautiful.I was so proud of my class.. hehex..i am not really implying that i am boasting.. i juz wantmy classmate who perform to know that i apreciate their affort...a little lame through... Haiz.. but i was so shattered apart on our class's internal- conflict-- it was definely scary and not worth talking about.GEez.. caNt say much.On monday is our 2.4 , and also our NAPFA test which means physical fitness test.. i hope tht i can pass and improve.Futhermore, tml is my chinese focus test, i haven study YET and after .. it would be a inter-cca-captain ball... i Hope band win.. BAND must win.. we wil not let others despise band tht we cant make it.. we have to show others about wat we are capable of.. even though we are not strong in fitness, but i believe as long as we are  strong in unity ... we are to be sure to beat the rest!
