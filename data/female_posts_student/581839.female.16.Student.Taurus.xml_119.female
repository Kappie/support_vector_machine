It is this dance/ party sort of thing that a few private schools join together to do. We have it 3 times a year, and its only 8th grade. this time, its a western theme. i thought i would be wearing a jean skirt and boots, but i didn't know my shirt. danielle informed me that the boots the was going to let me borrow, were getting repaired, so now i don't know what i'm going to do. i don't know what i'll wear i mean. it should be really fun. It's 937, and i haven't done my homework yet. i'm too lazy... not good. oh well, it doesn't matter, because tommorow is FRIDAY. friday friday friday, that beautiful word, that means the end of the week. the last day of the week. NO SCHOOL THE DAY AFTER. that is why fridays are so glorious. I'd better go. i'm sure i should be doing more productive things.
