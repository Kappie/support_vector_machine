But, apparently it's in for Wednesday *but we have a lesson on Monday!* My other friend thinks it's supposed to be in on Tuesday *... don't know what's going on there* Heheee my brother's wearing a kaftan to the wedding in June! *i get a bridesmaid dress!* It's really cool though... *note to self: nick kaftan* Ahh... so tempting to make a bad joke... must fight it! Aww... Mango's sitting here with me! He's sooo cute, he's orange *not ginger! damn that Spanish test...* and he has orange eyes! And he's pretending to be asleep so I'll hug him more... *sneaky cat* Him and Brodie *his brother* have cute posing competitions on the lawn.
