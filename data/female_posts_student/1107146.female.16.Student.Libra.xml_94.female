My hair is really weird, too...for some reason it got ULTRA long all of a sudden. Well, to me, anyway. It's everywhere and out of control. I have chronic hair stickage uppage disease (CHSU for short, say), it makes life hell with long hair.  Anyone notice that Black History Month is the one with the least amount of days? It's like saying "Ok, have a month and shut the fuck up," Heh, so what if it's prejudicial, there's no limited White History Month. I can bitch all I want at that blatant act of racism.  I'm not going to have a computer at home for a few weeks, so be not expecting any updates any time soon until fourth. Even these are gonna be short, because I'm really not as interested anymore, and I don't have much time, we actually  do  things in here, versus Mrs. Mallard's class, where we did JACK  SHIT .  Lonely old Badvision, once we knew you so well.  Fare ye well.
