Of course it's cause I studied til' my brain was wired to tap into my stored Biology information hiding somewhere in my mind.  Strangely enough we had a sub for Bio today even though our actual teacher was there.  Some meeting or something she had to go to, but like they should seriously make these meetings outside of class time.  Obviously I don't like substitutes, though the lady we had today wasn't bad.  She was actually pretty nice.  In Drama, since Megz did her warm-up yesterday she got to choose who got to go today.  Megz chose me, so I did my warm-up and everyone liked it and found it really fun.  And once again, everyone applauded to ME!     I am beginning to really think I like a lot of attention, of course being a Leo that is understandable.   In Active Living we just played basketball, which I find kind of boring.  I can't wait til' we get to new units.  I think on Monday though we are going off campus again, at least that is what I have heard.  Apparently we are suppose to be going bowling, so that should be really fun!  In English we didn't do much, and right now we are doing novel study and reading Ethan Frome.
