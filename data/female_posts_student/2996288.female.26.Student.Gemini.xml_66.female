And we have room for 9 patients.  That's after being fully-capped for like 3 weeks.  Ugh.  Well, at least my last call night on gen med won't be boring.  Oh, I would tell you why  The ocean's near the shore  I could think of things I never thunk before  And then I'd sit   and think some more...  I would not be just a nuffin'  My head all full of stuffin'  My heart all full of pain  I would dance and be merry  Life would be a ding-a-derry  If I only had a brain    IF ONLY!!!
