I got back from my grandfather's funeral just in time for the end of the school semester, and one of my interns who was supposed to be continuing on in the spring for about 30 hours a week quit on me, so I had to "hire"/recruit/interview/arrange for background checks to replace her.  Now I'm going to have 5 new interns to train in January.  Joy.  Training aside, I'm excited about this new group of interns.  They all seem very enthusiastic about working at Teen Court and it will be nice to have a good energy around the office.  Then a week ago it was off to South Florida to "Meet the Parents" which was an adventure and a half.  FYI, don't ever EVER fly on a one way ticket unless you want to feel completely and totally violated.  Not only did they search me, they searched everything in my luggage and I mean EVERYTHING.  It was not a pleasant experience.    Got back the day before Chrismtas Eve, having done basically none of my Christmas shopping done, and ended up doing all of my mom's Christmas shopping, too.  4 hours at the mall on Christmas Eve was not my idea of a good time, I assure you.  Christmas was nice and quiet this year.  Bruce came up the day after Christmas for a couple hours and we exchanged gifts and had dinner with my parents.  He's my sweetie, and I love him lots.  We spoiled each other and now I have lots of toys that I will play with as soon as I get over this bastard of a sinus infection that I somehow contracted right before he arrived in Orlando.    The New Year's Eve party is still planned for this year and hopefully I'll be able to participate.  It would be nice to be able to hear and smell by then.  We'll see.  Until the next time I'm able to focus for more than 4 minutes...take care of yourselves.  Mwah!
