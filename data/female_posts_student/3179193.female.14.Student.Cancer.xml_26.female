Whatever.  The dance was okay. The food was okay. Didn't like the bus rides... uncomfortable. Got to know Sari better. Too bad. Only 3 days. She's pretty cool. The guy from INCO was weird. He kept talking on and on and on. I payed attention and responded to his talking and followed him off the bus to look at the smelter thing just so he won't be that embarrassed with no one but Oberoi paying attention. Sometimes, it's good to do that for people... so they won't be as "yu" aka bruised (in chinese).  Lots of stuff happened. Big. Nima... Erica... both I had problems with. Are they gone? I don't know. Erica... there's so much more to say but I won't say anything. Nima... no comment.   Just gonna get on with life and leave this behind. Whatever. One sentence can sum this all up: I don't wanna try no more... Just giving up. Whatever.  God said that if you knock, the door will be opened. Seek, and you shall find. Ask, and you'll get the answer. This can apply to somebody. But just not me. 'Cos I've knocked, seeked, and asked. Tired of knocking, seeking, and asking. Not gonna do it anymore. Giving it up.  Long story. Don't wanna tell. It's elsewhere but I'm sending it to Ingrid only. She's the person I can trust most... This is my  HONEST  ranking of trust with each friend I have:  1. GOD 2. Ingrid 3. Zoe/Lisa 4. Brian N/Alice 5. Will Ng 6. Felis/Moca/Kryss/Vivo 7. Candace  Probably the people I'm closest to and people I trust most. I have reasons. Go figure.
