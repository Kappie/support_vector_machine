Edit...    However, after a very troubling piano lesson, I've got some unpleasant questions....... T.T   Why do kids die? Adults, they've lived their life, they've done it all, they've had a chance to make the world a better place, they're no longer innocent and they've lived it up. Kids haven't. It's painfully unfair to the kid, and almost, even more to the parents. If there is some sort of God up there, why would he let that happen? How could he let a child feel more pain than any human being deserves to feel, die before he/she has had the chance to experience life, or live their life in a hospital? How could he deny anyone these basic human rights, these necessities? How could he not let a person fall in love?   I like to think that Earth is as much heaven as we're ever going to get, that we can and will make it here ourselves, that it's our decision and our responsibility to make this place 'paradise.' That, in fact, it's the very imperfections that make this world so precious. But the way things have been going lately, in fact, the way things have been going for as long as humans remember... I'm getting serious doubts. We may be able to stop war, curb hatred, re-teach the generations that everyone is equal and worthy of love, but who will cure the little girl with leukemia, or the boy with AIDS? Everyone has to die, I'm all for it, it's the way Earth balances itself, if people ever stopped dying, it'd be The End.   Sometimes I just wonder about the way and the how of it, though.
