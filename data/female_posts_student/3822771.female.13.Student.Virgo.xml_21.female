Oh Sourbean wont you get away from me get get get get geeettt away from me! I walked on over and asked her to dance thinkin' maybe later of makin' romance but every guy there was thinkin'; like meI had to stand in line to get away from Sourbean!  (chorus repeat)  I finally got to whisper rude words in her ear convinced that we oughta get away from there we took a little walk I held her close to me and underneath the stars I said to Sourbean! Oh Sourbean I hate you can't you see Hate you Hate you Hate you can't you see! Oh Sourbean get away from me get get get get geeettt away from me!   Thanks I love you Greg! ;)
