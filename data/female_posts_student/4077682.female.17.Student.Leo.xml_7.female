Then I would perhaps listen to music while I got ready. Some happy music. The one thing that alters my mood like nothing else, is music. Then I guess if I had to choose what we did, it would be the river. I LOVE THE RIVER. Its the best place you can go. The only thing that would make it better, is if we brought music there... Then after the river, we would perhaps go to someone house and chill for a bit, umm I dunno know what we'd do, but maybe make A FORT!!!!!! But the rules would be: if youre in a bad mood, you have to leave till ur happy (or talk to someone if ur upset.. wtv), and as soon as someone gets bored, we have to change what we're doing. Then we would pack up a huge, yummy dinner picnick and take it to Ambleside or sumwhere like that (with music) and eat, swim, and hangout. Then when it got darker.... SKINNYDIPPING! yup. and then maybe walk around. Cuz I love walking around at night.  So... anywho.. that is my perfect day. :D
