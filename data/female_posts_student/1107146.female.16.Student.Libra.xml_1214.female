He should be glad that the 7th commandment is thous shalt not kill and that I didn't have a loaded gun with me. BTW, Josh if Alex does that again...he's in the same pit with Philip. Guys are jerks. They don't know when to stop. Really, when Rosie looks like she's going to kill you....it's time to stop.
