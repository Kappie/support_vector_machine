I mean, sure, if you have a whole bone, but even when there's a whole bone, I need to be able to side it, which I can't do as of yet, and, the quiz will pretty much just be fragments, and for each, you must identify the bone, which side, and which element of that particular bone is pointed to.  Suckity suck suck.  This is why I should have gone into the lab today to study.  I guess what I may need to do is go in tomorrow morning at 8.  But ugh, that's so damn early.  Maybe I'll just head over at 11 after my seminar gets out.
