But I still believe that you turn a blind eye towards some of the holes that lie within movies such as  Adaptation  and  Eternal Sunshine . But that is an argument we should probably save for later.   Moving on, Hannibal Lector is without a doubt a splendidly detestable villain, but there are flaws in him(as a villain). You stated that you felt Lector could take on any villain in the history of cinema and come out on top. This is where I will show you beyond a reasonable doubt that he in fact could not. Now if you threw him up against a run of the mill villain like Max Cady( Cape Fear ) Lector's far superior intellect would absolutely dominate the battle. There in lies the first problem, put him up against someone of a superior intellect, ie. Agent Smith, Darth Vader, Verbal Kint aka Kaiser Soze, and he has lost his one advantage. The second glaring weakness Lector has is the fact that he is insane, but not in the way it helps most villains. He is insane because he is a cannibal, but he is refined, kind(for the most part), and well mannered. Put him up against a villain who is truly insane like Alex De Large( A Clockwork Orange  ) and I believe De Large's sociopathic behavior, his lack of conscience, his pure desire to be evil would overcome anything that Lector could throw at him. In case you are wondering the reason that De Large and Kint didn't make my top five, it is because I saw a few flaws in each character. In short, Kint runs into the same problems as Lector(his mind is his only weapon) and De Large because he would pose no threat to a hero that could go on the offensive against him, a la Jason Bourne from the Bourne Identity.  As for  The Matrix , I think on this one we will have to agree to disagree. I feel that if a movie can stand on it's own, and be separate from it's sequels, can live as a finished story without it's sequels, then it can be a vision within a vision.  The Matrix  is a phenomenal movie. As for the sequels, I wouldn't say they were horrendous, I would say they were a let down. The Wachowski Brothers in my opinion, got to wrapped up in attempting to tread on the magic of the first film and not creating a new magic with the sequels. I own the whole trilogy on DVD. I have watched the films many times, I can find enjoyment in all three movies. Although the flaws are much more apparent in the second and third installment(second film is the worst of the three). And it's not that I am overlooking the second two films in my choosing of Agent Smith, It's just that I am focusing on the first film as it's own movie, kinda like Darth Vader in  The Empire Strikes Back .  Now onto your critique/bashing of my final choice, Commodus. You stated "To me a great villain terrifies by exposing the evil that lurks in the hearts of all man." Well, I saw a lot of evil lurking in the heart of Commodus(see my last post for examples). Maximus would definitely make my top five heroes list. You need a great villain if you are to have a great hero. For instance, Sean Archer had Castor Troy, Neo had Agent Smith, Batman had The Joker, and the exception that proves the rule is Alonzo Harris. Commodus is an incredible villain because of the hero he created, Maximus was the savior of Rome. The General who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator that defied an empire. The struggle between Commodus and Maximus gave us an outcome we rarely have the opportunity to see, they kill each other. Yeah Maximus wins the fight between the two of them, but by stabbing our hero in the back Commodus ultimately killed Maximus.  I hope my retort is everything you were hoping it was and I look forward to hearing what your response will be. I have a question for you though. Now this is just a spin off of the current topic we are on and I am not looking to start more arguments(I think this topic has provided enough). In your opinion what hero/villain combination is the best of all time? I will think about this question as well and I will answer it in my next post.   Until next time, this is Nick signing out.
