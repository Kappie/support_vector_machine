Yes, today was my first day of my Junior year, and I don't really have too much to complain about. School, is well ... school - nothing more and nothing less. We all have to go through it; we all have to learn to deal with it. My friend even asked called me today after school and asked me if I was nervous about going back Monday, and I was like, "Nervous? No ... But do I want to? No way!" I really want this year to be awesome because well, for starters, last semester of Sophomore year really really sucked! And plus, I'm a Junior now, I've only got 2 more years of high school left, and I don't want to look back on these days and be all bitter about being a teenager. I mean, yeah sometimes it totally sucks, but I'm really working on being more outgoing and being content with who I am and all of that. Yeah, I'm a nerd, I know ... but I'm okay with that! LOL See, I'm making progress already! haha  I actually like my schedule a lot this semester which is awesome! I have Chemistry first period, and although it seems like it's going to be really hard; I think I'll live through it. I mean, if I can live through Mrs. Crain's biology class, I can live through anything! Plus, I have a few friends in there like Megan and the two Nansi's so that's cool. 2nd period I have SAT Prep with Bekah and Nansi (the one who's supposed to be in my homeroom, but ::cries:: they moved her) ... it seems like it won't be too bad, but half of the football team is in the class! 3rd period I have American Lit with the same teacher that I had last year, and I love her! I mean, when I was in her class, I didn't like her too much, but once I was out of it, I just loved her! LOL Bekah's in there too and so are a few other people that I'm friends with so I'm happy. I have "D" lunch! Last year we only had 3 lunches, but they added one this year, and of course, I get the very last one. It sucks too because I don't go to lunch until 1:30, and the class that I have for 3rd period is right across the hall from my 4th period class so I was all like yay, that's awesome, but NO! I have to go from the lunchroom to 4th period which is on the other end of the school! That's just my luck! But 4th period seems like it's going to be fun. I have yearbook that period with people like Juan, Nansi, Heather ... and well, the list of names could go on and on. I don't have any classes with Casey or Cindy, and that's really sad because they are like my two BESTEST friends (don't worry, I love all of the rest of you too).  Anyway, I'm gonna go now. It's been a long day. Hopefully this school year will be fun, awesome and amazing! JKM - OUT!
