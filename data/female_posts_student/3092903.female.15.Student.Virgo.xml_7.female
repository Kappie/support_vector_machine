We dressed all sassy and wore stilettos. Fun, fun. Sara said I was mean to her today. I don't know how she came to that conclusion, I just didnt very much time to talk in between practice and babysitting..Babysitting which I did not get paid for. That made me so mad. I spent my whole afternoon there and she didnt even mention paying me. I really just havent been having a good week I dont guess. We have been choreographing the show, and that's fun even though I screw it up most of the time. You know, sometimes I cant stand the summer. It annoys me that I cant be doing something productive with a larger portion of my day. I hate just being by myself at the house. This is going to have to change.
