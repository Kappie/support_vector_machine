You'd have to be on our team to understand how amazing that is.  I wish I was good at basketball, but no.  No more basketball for me after Feb. 13, kinda sad.  Maybe if I MAGICALLY become good over the summer I'll play next year but I seriously doubt it.  My brother thinks I should do winter track next year.  My brother is the coolest person ever.  However, I don't think I'll heed his advice.  If I'm this bonkers during sophomore year... next year could result in institutionalization.    Today I bought a CD at Mckay's, along with 4 or so gruesome vampire and/or  rampant infectious disease books.  CD = The Police - Every Breath you Take- "The Singles" *sigh* so good.  I find myself listening to a lot of singer song writer hooha lately, as well as waaay too much of The Cure, this band called Spoon that was on Rachel's mix for me, and random Christian music as introduced to me by Kelly.  The maturity level of my conversations recently seems to have increased ten-fold.  Change is good.  I thought I was one of those people that never changed but... thinking about it I'm a little bit different every year.  You can tell a lot about the way I am at a given time (haha sounds like the existential question) by a) what clothes I wear, and b) what is written in my yearbook  7th grade: lots of icky random preppy t-shirts with big blaring TOMMY or DKNY on the front, comments about being nice but pale 8th grade: juxtaposition of cutesy floof and skankier fare leaning more towards the alternative spectrum of stereotypes, probably in hopes of fitting in with Ed's friends.  yearbook comments revolved around this unsaid conviction of everyone i knew that i was indeed on drugs 9th grade: lots and lots of cartoony shirts cute, nauseating, brightly colored (oh how i love it), everything in my yrbook was written by a boy and about me being a lesbian slut 10th grade: weird matchy matchy shtuff, with a penchant for anything off beat and/or striped, yr book comments will probably mention seizures and speshul pills  anyways, the point of all this is, I really want things to change.  a lot.  and i think they will.  will post more later  bye... heres my old profile    etiquette9 23: D is for the dagger i am going to stick in your heart etiquette9 23: I is for ill people, and you are going to be one if you piss me off some more etiquette9 23: and E is for every single fucking thing you have done that has sent my life downhill etiquette9 23: i hate you etiquette9 23: so just die  LedZeppelin1292: It just occured to me that almost all of the sports I've done involve spandex  imnochewtoy: like on a scale of 1 to cute youre ashleigh   evilkennyoo 7: ive never had someone hop up on my shoulders and start rubbing her tounge in my hair  JerMan144: who else are you talking to? JerMan144: oh ... your project
