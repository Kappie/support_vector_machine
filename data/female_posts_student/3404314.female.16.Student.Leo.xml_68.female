(hindi maganda ung paulit-ulit na lng..) i didnt like the chocolate cake.. it was dry!! (sayang chocolate lover pa naman ako..)  i asked redgie to help me with our algebra assignment (my fave subject? yah ryt!!).. and he said, "sure.. cge..".... i also asked him to come a little bit early tomorrow for that!! you know, he's really good in math! he got a perfect score on our first quiz, same with richard.. while i got one problem wrong! *sighs*  krishna went to our house this afternoon to borrow a book for her book report.. she borrowed both the count of monte cristo and the breakup diaries.. she still has to present the book to her english teacher for approval.. we went to alvin's house to give the eco book that april needed, saw krizia there.. ate at brgy. 407, then went to dotcom to research for her project.. i missed her a lot.. i also missed camille specially now that she lives at q.c.!!  when i got home.. i reviewed for zoology!! hope that i pass this quiz.. i really need to..  i hope it doesnt rain tomorrow.. its the only thing that might ruin my day.. well except for my zoo lab.. tsk tsk tsk!!!
