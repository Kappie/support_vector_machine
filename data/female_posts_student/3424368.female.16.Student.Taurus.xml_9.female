I want to see him tomorrow, but I really don't know if I'll be able to...  *sigh* .... I haven't done anything today either... I was just with my parents and brother in the garage,... we chased out this giant mouse.. SOOOO gross! haha,... anyways... it's a nice day out, and I'm not gonna waste it inside... so I'm heading out back to try and tan my legs... haha, stupid white legs.  DON'T WASTE YOUR DAY! It's GORGEOUS! =)
