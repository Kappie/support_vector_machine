There were some terrible actor(ess)s that got call-backs.  I didn't but I wasn't expecting one.  I was hoping to have nothing to do this spring... But, Beth somehow got me to do sound for it... But, thank goodness, I'll be doing it alone, so no one will be there to annoy me... ...I think that's why I despise  Wings  so much... Angie (the other sound tech) annoys me...  .......a lot....  I'm still sick...   The ability to breathe through the nose is taken for granted way too often...
