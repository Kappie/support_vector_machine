Hehe, well I'm glad she found somebody.  "Malpreet!"  Perhaps I shouldn't have said that so loud. Disturbed her maybe. Ripped her away from this new guy she's found.  Malpreet and the guy pull away from each other, and turn to look at who called out Malpreet's name.   Wait, I know him. Where's he from?  "Jane..." the guy says.  He knows me. I must know him too. Oh my God, it can't be...  "Adam."  Of course it is. Who else looks so sexay in that way? This isn't funny. I'm gonna kill Malpreet.  ---- The door of the Ladies' opens.  Great, I'm making out in the women's loos. Oh well, who cares who sees me?  "Malpreet!" somebody says.  Well this is just great. Her friend's come in to do the whole "ooh who is this/can you introduce me/ooh how is he/tell me all the details" thing. Or exchanging lipsticks or something like that.  Adam and Malpreet pull away and look at the person.  Oh my God, that's...  "Jane..."  It's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her it's her. What the hell am I even doing here??  He thinks suddenly.  This is not funny.  "Adam." Jane stands there.  Frozen.  ---- The door of the Ladies' opens.  Hmm, I guess some people do actually come in here. I hope it's not one of those weirdos that just come in here to cry. That would completely ruin me and Alan's lil thing we got going on here.  "Malpreet!"  What? Who is it? OK, we're pulling apart to stare at the new girl. Oh, it's...  "Jane..." says Alan.  Wait a minute, how do they know each other? Oh well, doesn't matter. Wait, am I missing something here? What's going on? Why is Janey looking so..  "Adam."  Who? Is this guy called  Adam ?? Why did he not tell me that? I've been calling him Alan all night! Oh my God. OK, something is definitely going on here. They are just staring at each other like mad. This can't be good.
