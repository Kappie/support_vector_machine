My whole biology class was deadgone, there were about thirteen people in there today...out of about twenty-nine.  Plus, the teachers are keeping us in the rooms, under STRICT command to let none of us go during class for any reason.  It's like a prison...well it always is, we were always wondering when they'd take the next step, anyway.  Fell asleep a billion times during geometry, gonna go home and take a nap, if European History isn't too bad...and I hear it is, fucking DBQ writing schtick.   Although I probly won't take a nap, I'll get a Coke or something during lunch.  Damn am I stupid.  And nobody answer that either.
