(( Bridge ))  :: Mya stood staring out at the wormhole thought the main viewer. Her eyes scanned its depths as if she was looking to find something and her mind rested for the time. Taking one last glance around the room at all of the officers she had served with aboard the Yashida she sighed inwardly, how could they possibly know or understand what was coming? They couldn't, there was no way in this universe that they would know why this was happening or it greater significance.  So be it...  the thought had come and gone and she began to bask in the dim red lights the bulkheads provided as she prepared herself for the pleasure of contact.  :: It had been so long, too long. She had heard the calling of her mother's beautiful mind within hers for all of these years, pushing her forward with the promise of great things to come. She had been away from her family and her home and had not the mental ecstasy she so desired, to initiate the intimacy and the feeling of utter control it brought her and the intimacy of its touch. The touch she would soon initiate, the mind of her brother opening up to her, allowing her touch, her search. The thought of it, the promise of its feeling made her shiver with anticipation.::   Soon my mother, soon. As I have promised you, soon.   :: The time had nearly come, she was nearly ready and she was unsure whether she could take the waiting any longer when she felt the presence of Hunter beside her. Turning her gaze on him unhappily, then apathetically,  stay calm, he could not possibly know what he has interrupted  she waited for him to speak, to make his purpose clear to her.::  Hunter: "You sure you're okay with this?"   How could I not be, how tired I am of that QUESTION!!!   Mya: ::Calmly:: "I am" ::nodding::  Hunter: "I'm not to sure if I'd feel the same way if I were in your position."   ::She turned her gaze on him squarely, this was his idea and she considered reminding him of that,  Stay calm  would he do the same? She was pretty sure he would, however foolish.::  Mya: ::Calmly:: "Do I have any other choice? Would you do the same if you were the telepath and this were my idea, to risk your life?"  Hunter: "I can't really reply in anyway to that. I know what you have to do and that it has to be done. But still. I can't help feeling that this might do more harm than good."  Mya: ::Anger flashing then calm:: "The decisions have been made, weather harmful or beneficial, you shall see soon enough."  :: Silently she shamed herself for using a singular, she knew what she should have said was "we" would all know soon enough. Still the moment had passed and Hunter didn't seem to catch it, she glanced at Adler then, who looked on the exchange and on her with that same look of strange curiosity. She was fairly sure in that moment that he had caught it, even if Hunter and the others had not.  :: Enough of this, it was time to do what she had come here to do. Stepping only a half step away from Hunter she turned her full attention back on the monitor. She took a deep breath and began, began to fulfill her destiny.  :: Her eyes fell on its vision with eager anticipation and she closed them for the briefest of moments, her mind reaching out with all of its mental capability to find the mind which promised to bring her closer to that which she searched for. Her eyes sprang open in that moment of contact, the blue flames consuming any black in her eyes. To anyone looking on her brilliant orbs in that moment, they would find blue fires like nothing they had seen before, blue fires that threatened to spring forth and consume them all. Blue flames which could light the bridge and then some with their intensity.  :: Hey eyes never narrowed and she only blinked and kept them turned on the main viewer. His mind was so refreshing to her and she could feel his pleasure at her touch, as it should be. The mind of a male, his warrior pleasures, carnal and raw, pleased her. She searched the mind that had been open to her, the plans for their actions spilled out before her like wet, warm blood pouring forth and she nearly smiled, nearly cried out from the memory of it all so long ago.  :: To M'uri, to Mya there was no feeling like anticipation, yet this reunion threatened to over come her. How could she feign pain, how could she pretend to be anything other then what she was for any longer. In the intense pleasure of it all she had reached out an grasped the arm of someone, of Hunter.::  Hunter: Are they contacting you. What are they saying...  :: She heard his words and for the first time since she had initiated contact with them did she frown. Hunter's words threatened to interrupt her pleasure and the unraveling of his plans. Her frown carried to him and the light, the blue light in her eyes flared ever brighter as she continued her mental search through the mind of her brother. Hunter didn't go on, he didn't speak again and releasing him she continued her mental link, to touch the mind of a male, the thrill. So mentally weak were their male counterparts, so physically powerful.  :: She could hear what was happening around her and her mind took it all in as a secondary response as she concentrated on what she was accomplishing and her mind did the rest, deciphering the goings on around her. She knew in her mind, somewhere, that Adler was on the bridge, and a smile suddenly widened on her face then was gone nearly as quickly. Suddenly she felt him beside her and she turned her head, exposing the blue flames of her heritage to the man. Her eyes wide, never blinking. It would look to any one who didn't understand almost as a possession.  ::Then her eyes narrowed and she spoke in a whisper, her tone sounding like something from the depths of a horror novel in its spine tingling softness.::  Mya: ::in a nearly inaudible whisper meant for Adler and perhaps Hunter: "I feel him, called to him, our minds one."  Hunter: "What do you mean "Feel him?" Who's him?"  Mya: "He's coming" ::she whispered again nearly inaudibly, a small forewarning, a forewarning they would never be able to prepare for.::  ~ Dr. Mya Aaryn, Medical Officer, USS Yashida ~     ~Kristyn
