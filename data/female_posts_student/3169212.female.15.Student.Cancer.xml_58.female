The first  Sparrow Anger teatment  is to get the smell of rum so that you do not get sick.  I've had expiriance with Demons and rum before and, lets just say, it dosent sit well, savvy?  That Inuyasha couldnt stand the taste of it let alone the smell so "he settled for no less than total abstanence from the demon rum".  I say "demon rum" because of the effect it had on him.  If, demon-boy, you do not believe that i have met Inuyasha   you can go on Fanfiction.net and find the story called Pirates of the Carribean meets Inuyasha where  i am writing my adventures with this half-demon-dog-boy, savvy?  CJ, beer is  one  of the alcohalic agents in rum.  you also have the whiskey, burbon, and the vodca.  Your a military man no doubt, defenatly not a pirate because our rankings only go up to captain, but you should be able to handle some fine carribean rum.  And if you can't, mate, its pathetic, it truely is.
