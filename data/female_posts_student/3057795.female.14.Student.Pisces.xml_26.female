Naiinis ako sa sarili ko kc everything that had happened today was a lie….i now what he was trying to do a while ago..he wanted to say that he was sorry…and I completely ruined it…argh!..@#?!%?.............................................during the first few weeks of last summer, I was angry at him..as in kinimkim ko talaga lahat ng galit ko sa kanya dahil nga dun sa sinabi (or tinext?) niya..i told myself that I had to forget him..i had to move on…I had to stop thinking about him…I was confident that I would be able to do this….but as weeks passed, I proved myself wrong….i don’t know how and why but it seemed that the more I tried to forget...the more  the memories came back….it is just so weird because, there is just something about this person that never makes me stop thinking about him…pero I was completely sure at that time that I had to do whatever it takes para makalimutan ko siya....kaya....ang inisip ko ay magkunwaring galit sa kanya para matatak ko sa isipan ko na di ko siya kilala …at dahil di ko siya kilala di ko rin siya kakausapin…SORRY talaga *a*!!!....sorry sa lahat….believe me..hirap ako gawin to kc ikaw talaga ang tanging taong di ko maaway…...pero ang reason ko lang para gawin to was para din na ako makahahadlang sa inyo ni L***e... i did this for you …ewan ko nga ba sayo kung bakit gusto mo pa mag-sorry sakin..ayaw mo ba nun????..wala nang magte-text sayo ng kung anu-anu...wala ka nang problema…wala na kayong proproblemahin ni L***e..WALA NA AKO....  ………..pero kahit ganito,,nasasaktan parin ako…dahil there’s still a part of me that belongs to you….there will always be…   but I know that I’ll be fine……just as long that I know you are HAPPY with her..  and by the looks of it I think you are.............................
