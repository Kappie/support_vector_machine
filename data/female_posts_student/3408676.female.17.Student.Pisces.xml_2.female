The seniors and leaving and in a few weeks we will be taking over their role as the the rulers of the school...I like that part :P  We have only 8 more days left and three are finals, I love having those b/c we can leave so early...Its awesome. I'm in web page design again and am supposed to be working on my final project but I just cant...You can call it ADD or just laziness but im not doing it...I just don't want to be around when Mr.Silverstien finds out, hes going to be really disappointed and thats sad b/c hes like one of the only teachers I like, almost my favorite :( OH well... I smoked for the 1st time in a long time lastnight...well and this morning on the way to school but lastnight it kicked my ass...everyone at home knew and were giving me a hard time while I laughed hysterically while they judged, good thing I don't care huh??...This day has been such a big blur, high till lunch then right after taking some vikiden in team meetings (thanks Steven) (and David) the wonder of free drugs...its awwwesome. I didn't talk to mike lastnight and I am finally feeling a little guilty for what I said to Nick, just b/c of all the trouble it has caused with Mike and Shane and Car I think so...I know it was wrong and all, and I shouldn't have done it and everything but I did and there isn't anything I can do to fix it now, especially now that Nick  hates  me whatever man...Good think I don't care...But I would still like to fix things with shame just so that it doesn't fuck things up between us, like his opinion of me, I think it was good up to that point. I think he thinks of me as a little girl, a cute one and all, but still he takes the role of more mature older mentor or something, sometimes I wish he could just relax and let me be 17...car thinks so too, just mainly about the drinking and driving thing, but whatever, its like Car said: we have soo much more time to party and do whatever we want, we just have to make the best of being 17 now.
