(from me to Bret after discussing who has it worse, him over in Corporate or me over in Herndon.)  "jeff and pandy are so far away...im stuck down here in 200.  i say we run away to....i dont know, but somewhere where it doesnt rain as much. perhaps seattle"  (from Bret to me)  "Haha.  St. Louis had good food :-)  Other than that... I got nothing.  OH!  I have it.  Let's go buy a little shack on the beach in Hawaii and  eventually you'll become a world renowned surfer and I'll sing in the  band that plays in our kick ass parties at night and we'll be the most  popular people on earth.  Then you'll take off and fall into drugs and  drinking and I'll marry some abusive guy and eventually when I get the  strength to get out I'll come find you, as you are obviously still  living in the shack, and I'll build your confidence and you'll quit  boozing and the drugs and go on to win the greatest SURFING TITLE EVER! " (from me to Bret)  "hahaha...that sounds like a deLIGHTful plan.  can i bring my car to  hawaii?  im gonna need somewhere to sleep in case i have to temporarily  rent out the shack to buy drugs "  (from bret to me)  "Haha!  Of course.  But eventually you'll sell the car when you are in  your darkest moments for some crack.  But secretly I will buy it back  for you when you start to progress in our own version of rehab.  But I  will not give it to you until after you win the championship.  Then  we'll all be walking back to the parking lot to take my new BMW which I  bought from the money I inherited when my ex-husband mysteriously died.  You will begin to head for my car and we'll all be laughing and some  random ass freak will offer you a beer and you'll smile and say "DON'T  DO DRUGS!" with a thumbs up sign cause you are THAT cool.  Then you'll  see the car.  You'll cry.  I'll cry.  Everyone within a hundred miles  will cry.  :-) "  (from me to Bret)  "wow, you need to option this script to a production company and turn  this bitch into a movie.  i want jeff to be there as the old washed up  surfer who teaches me some important life lesson. "  (from Bret to me)  "Like the Karate Kid mentor?   I have to admit this would be THE BEST  MOVIE EVER! " (from me to Bret, copying Jeff this time)  "ahh yes...i think jeff would like the mr. miyagi role.  you have learned well young grasshopper"  (from Bret to me)  "I will gladly play an americanized, hunk of a Mr. Miagi.  I picture the  movie starting off with a meeting between me and bret as he is waking up  on the beach at 4 am after a 4 day coke spree and I am out surfing on my  own, getting all spiritual and sh*t and I take bret back to my house on  the beach (that in real life would be a 2 million dollar property but  somehow the lonely old man can afford it) and nurse him back to health.  Midway through the movie Bret gets too cocky and tells me he doesn't  need me anymore blah blah blah falls for the wrong woman blah blah blah  blah.  Then at the end of the movie bret is coming to terms with the  fact that he is a coked out a-hole and I find him in some parking lot  and tell somehting along the lines of "you had happiness all along but  couldn't see because of your blind fury to be the best.  Surfing is  about you and nature not the speed, not the rush.  Then I pound his face  into hamburger meat and we get his traps all hulked up and wins the big  meet in the end.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. "  (from Jeff to Bret and I)  "Whoa.  First of all you just basically exited me out of this story and since it’s my story that’s not an option.  Bret has to succeed in the end for it to be the perfect 80’s surf story"  (from me to Bret and Jeff)  "i dont quite understand how the pounding my face into hamburger meat  really helps the plot here...but other than that i think we have  something here.  except that i want to fall asleep with my crack pipe  being really hot and burn jeff's house down...twice.  i think that will  add a certain element to the story "  (from Bret to Jeff and I)  "Now that I can work in.  :-) "  (From me to Jeff and Bret)  "I pound your face because you and Erin split up and you fall asleep with  a burning hot crackpipe in your hand and wake up next to Ben on the  beach with an empty jar of ranch dressing laying next to the 2 of you.  So I need to smack you back to reality and then you get back together  with erin and win the big meet.  The movie ends with us surfing together  at dusk so you can barely make out our images as the sun sets with Erin  singing her hit song 'wind beneath my rings.'"  (from Jeff to Bret and I)  "right, but as we surf off into the sunset, someone comments that it  appears 4 mountains are floating way too close to shore...then they  realize that those are just our traps seated atop two massive  individuals who then surf to shore and eat them because they need some  quick protein "  (from Bret to Jeff and I)  "STOP IT BRET! You had me mountains.  You had me at moutains." (from Jeff to Bret and I)  "Um, Bret broke up with me sometime last year and I feel it would be too difficult for me to work with him in a romantic situation.  It’s too much of life imitating art.  So I feel I need to just step back out of respect of the new friendship Fret and I have finally been able to form after all the tears that were spilled and direct the picture.  Maybe I’ll cast Pandy in my place.  She’ll have to lip synch to my voice at the end." (from Erin to Jeff and Bret, copying Pandy)  "And of course there will have to be an 80s montage of Jeff bringing Fret back to competitive status."  (from me to Jeff, Bret and Pandy)  "Pandy will now be referred to as peaceful-booty.  She gets it."  (from Jeff to the rest)  "I’m sure she does.  Will there be a piano scene involved?"  (from me)  "the only piano scene will be one where jeff and i take a break from surfing and smash a piano to pass some time...then pandy will of course be so excited by this that she will not be able to control herself... "  (from Bret)  "And start tying up hippies with the piano cords as we round them up and take them off to our Island of Arnold for reprogramming.  From there they will be fed raw meet and gunpowder as we mold our army of Trap soldiers TO RULE THE EARTH! The only thing that can stop us now are those lousy kids."  (from Jeff)  "Yes and that's where the "happy strong booty" comes into play.  I will rip my clothes off right then  there and scream "do me because I love violence"." (from Pandy)  "Very good happy-strong-booty.  I see you are finally becoming one of us."  (from Jeff)
