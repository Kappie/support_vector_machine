Icy tarmac in the shade from December till your birthday, but still... always wearing the wrong shoes for slippery.  Always.  Dodging tears, dropping like flavored kisses onto lips stained white from biting teeth and Chinook,  fingers brushing and grazing over the knots and chasms of swollen wood-- decorated with crossmyhearts just as weathered.  Whispering something about apertures. Open wide, and ready to click.  All flash and dazzle, but now-- time to find home.  Chinook bites harder and joints stiffen as you wrap me up in a jersey of the team I hate.  Melting from the inside out.  New warmth is immortal.
