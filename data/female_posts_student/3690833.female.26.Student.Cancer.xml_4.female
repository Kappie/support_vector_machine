When the voicemail alert goes off, I jump up run to the phone, why, gee, it must be important if they left a message! Hell. I'd use telemarketers as a conversation outlet to get out of doing math, (" A cheaper phone bill! Tell me ALL about it! ") I don't recognize the number that called me, so I called to check my voicemail. Dontcha know it? it's work. When did bosses finally understand call screening? Mine will call from another number to trick you into answering:   "Uh yeah, its (insert boss'name here). We just fired (ridiculously unreliable co-worker's name here). So now the bartender is the only useful employee that we have besides the cook. Can you come in a few hours early? And,(alternate waitress name here) will be in later. ( strange pleading enters Mr. Boss guy's voice )um, call me if you get this. or you know, just come in, uh, ok? i'll try to call you again shortly." So here is where my dilemma begins... I could:         a)pretend I never got the message (and continue with math..)        b)call, lie, say I am 542 miles away, but I can still get there           on time for  my  shift (unlikely to be believed}        c)just go already.  So I went. Here is where the circus begins.  I get there. a party of six comes in. six more join them. another 10. before I know it I have a party of fifty people. I am the only waitress. other tables wander in, looking annoyed that i dont jump all over them. can they not see all those people over there? "can I have some tea, and water?" "can i have another thing of ranch?" um, let me see no no and, no. my closing waitress comes in about an hour early. THank God! but... she is too wasted to carry a tray. she screws up a few tables. the boss sends her home. now, not only did I go in early- I will now be staying late.  So this madness continues until 2:30am. We kick everyone out and i sink to the floor delirious, and exhausted. I made money though, which is the important thing. I came home to tell you all this and barely made it, so this post is late sorry.  I hope everyone shows up tonight,  sober . I mean really, what's it take?? remind me to bitch slap that other waitress when I see her again.
