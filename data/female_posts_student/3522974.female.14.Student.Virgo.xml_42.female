Eh-xcellent...   Wednesday   I didn't do much during the day, but at night i went to the Quarantine Station for a ghost tour. It was kinda scary. The tour guide was blabbering on about something in the showers, then he said "...And it sounded a bit like this..." and with a 'bang!' he knocked on the tin shower walls, which made a huge sound, and the second he did it, me n rach were in each others arms screaming. It was funny, in hindsight n e way. Just before going in there [the showers] tho, it was really dark and he was talking outside and everyone in the back row, simultaneously turned their heads. We [ i was in the back row] all heard footsteps running down the path we had just followed! We all looked at each other and then at everyone else that hadnt heard, sketch, eh? Two other scary things happened. 1) Glenda was walking up some stairs in the dark, following everyone else, and she felt someone tap her on her back, and when she turned, she saw that she was the last person, no-one was behind her. 2) Also my friend Rach has hardly ever got a nosebleed before and the second she entered the hospital wing, blood just came trickling out of her nose. The tour man was saying, "...The people often had really bad flues aswell, some were coughing up blood...", coincidence or not?   Thursday  I honestly can't remember....talk to beth, she knows all about my memory skills.   Friday  I can't remember what i did during the day, but at night, our family friends came over for dinner. Karlie and her family had just come back from China, and they brought me a Louis Vuitton bag, Shrek 2 (DVD), a kimono dressing gown and a toothbrush. (lol). Great Fun. Joods came over aswell.   Saturday  I had a fairly bummy day, i just kept Nanna company and read my book. How fun. Good book. Ne way, in the evening Dan and Rach came over to sleep. Pop gave us a lift up to Glenrose and back to buy supplies for the night, yum. We had 8 DVDs ready for us to watch, in order and everything. We watched Charlie's Angels, Legally Blonde and School of Rock, and decided to go to sleep anyway. So much for the movie marathon.    Sunday  Sunday i had my dad's special pancakes for brekky, then dan rach and i just mucked around for a bit, 'till their mum came. Once they left, i decided to watch Honey, great movie that. Yeh so, later on i went to church, then maccas, then home. Fun.   Monday  On monday i went to the movies and saw NY min. It was surprisingly really good, i liked it.  And finally...   TODAY!!!  Today was great! My family is thinkin' 'bout getting a dog, and my fave dogs r chiwouwa's and pug's. So i decided to go with the Humphrises and Karen Atkins (soon to be mega famous artist, hehe) to a little house about 1 and a half hours drive from sydney, where they bred adorable pug's! It was so cool. When we first arrived, around 30 dogs (pugs) were at the gate jumping up trying to get through. They were soooo qte. The black ones were too, they were like lil demons. We knocked at the door, and eventually an old lady came out and told us to come in. As we entered, we saw two black pugs playing together and a cream one. As we followed her further into her house, we went in a room where on the gound was a basket full of 5-day-old pugs! They were the qtest things i had ever seen. They were smaller than my cupped hand and soo soft. As we crept in further we saw another litter of about 12 little week old pugs, curled up with their chubby mummy. After patting them all, she led us into another room where we saw 3 more extremely qte lil pugs. All cream in colour. After all picking them up and playing with them for a while, Karen was told which one hers was. Although they were adorable, i don't think i am gonna get a pug. They r way too expensive and i don't think my family wants a pug. Dad thinks they're ugly. Neway, while Karen filled out the paperwork, the rest of us, climbed over the barrier to the backyard, where there were 30 pugs and 1 chiwouwa. As we climbed over all the pugs came and jumped up it was so overwhelming, but qte. I have said qte so many times, i guess it is the only way to describe it. After another hour or so playing with the pug babies, we finally were in the car. We stopped at a park for lunch where we had hamburgers n chips. Karen didn't have anything, she was just carressing over her new little baby, who was looking qter than ever, wrapped up in a towel, like a REAL baby. After a long drive home, we finally arrived. It was a great day! I have decided what sort of puppy i want. My couz has it. It is half chiwouwa and half [cant remember] something else. Yay, i cant wait, mum wants the same.  LOluv, kc.
