The doctors are liking to be lazy. But that's ok because...well I dunno why, but it's alright. I can't have any caffeine (sadness! not that I drink it, but sadness!) until the barium gets processed, else it hardens in my intestines and I die! W00t!  And also...I'm getting sick! And that's never a good sign! At least now it's reasonably safe to assume that I can drink peach tea again. And eat chocolate chip cookies...that's the staple food around here for the day. Hoo-ah! Altho I lost another couple o' pounds overnight pretty much. I was 156 with all of my clothes on...that's about 153 in reality. So today, with shorts on today I weighed in at 152.5...shoes and all. That works out to 151, about.   But enough about all that. I'll probably be getting the reports back on Tuesday, that way all of you can determine when to make fun of me for eating nothing rabbit food for three weeks!  Here's lookin' at you, kids.
