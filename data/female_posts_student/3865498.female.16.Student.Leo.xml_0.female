He has orientation from 9-11. Tonight was our last summernight together. The day didn't start off so good. I came home from Foss (I also found a dog leash in the backseat of the car...hmmmm....) and I wanted to spend most of the day out with Max. But as it turns out, Mom always has something up her sleeve. Tammy (Erickson) said I could try Boris today for my retest of the C2 rating (since I didn't pass the jumping on Onyx). And it could only be today. So that made things difficult. When I got home, I called Max and told him about Boris. He asked about a movie early afternoon, so I went downstairs to ask my parents, and they (of course) said no. I begged, I pleaded, I did everything to make them change their mind. So instead of going to the movies, we went mini-golfing instead. And Max wasn't very happy about that. So we didn't talk for the whole time we played. He was of course disappointed. He wanted to spend some quality alone time with me. I did too, but I worked out the best thing I could. He really has no clue how difficult it is to talk to my parents and compromise with them. He thinks he knows, but he has no idea. Both of my parents are mules. Anyways, after mini-golfing, he dropped me off at home so I could go ride 2 horses (Slick and Boris). I felt like sobbing cuz I didn't want this day to happen like this. After I rode Slick and Boris (Slick I took out for a leisurely trail ride and trotted for a couple of minutes; Boris I need help with he's sooo lazy!), I came home and got ready for Max's farewell gathering (he invited friends over and we had pizza and watched  John Q , sad movie with somewhat happy ending). When Max picked me up, he was back to being his loving self. He apologized for being a jackass earlier and asked if I liked my bday present (he bought me a silver chain bracelet with a small heart pendent, its really pretty and I love it). The gathering was a lot of fun. Its sad to see all my senior friends to go off and become college freshmen (ah to be a freshman again). Especially Max. After everyone left, we had 15 minutes to spare, so we went down to his bedroom and talked. I think I was ready to cry, and it looked like he was too, cuz when we were leaving we had to clean his glasses and wash his face. I'm going to really miss him. I guess thats an understatement. I won't be able to see him everday, to see him at school, for him to comfort me or vice versa. No more trips to Salernos or Mickey D's or Dunkin Donuts or even Michelle's house. No more driving along with windows fully down and Cold's "Suffocate" blaring. No more red Mazda Protege...its probably being killed as we speak... Though I did recieve its awesome CD player for my own car when I get one. God I miss him already. This is going to be tough. But I'll stick with it. We can do this, we can do this.       Ahhh more memories, yes only memories those are... but they are good, good to remember and keep forever.       *you know you love me*
