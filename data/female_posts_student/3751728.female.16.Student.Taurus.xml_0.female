"I love you" came often, they'd been through a lot, He always thought that things got hot. He had her heart, it bled in his hand, He's just a boy, who thinks he's a man. Not that simple, not that right, This is the last moment they'd spend tonight. A kiss goodbye, she'd melt like butter, He's a prince of destruction, not just a lover. The next day, he went to the same spot, Another girl was there, and her, he forgot. He hugged her tightly, he couldn't let go, Who thought that I would ever stoop that low. The next day there were three girls in his room, They never did think, they'd always asume. How does this boy sleep at night, Why do wrong, when he could have had right. Little thoughts would wander to be, He loved those girls, he just liked me. People would tell her, what he would do, But she couldn't believe, that these words were true. He's way too hard to figure out, But he'll never stop without a doubt.
