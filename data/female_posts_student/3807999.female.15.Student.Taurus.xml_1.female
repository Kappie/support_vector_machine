Man followed, quickly adapting to tools and embracing it like a fish to water. I believe that when man went beyond simple tools and started up agriculture and industry, ah, now that was the great mistake.  Look at the world today. We may be living in the lap of luxury, survival of the fittest not even making sense anymore. Instead it's survival of the stress of behaving well, keeping fit, getting education, a job, a family, a retirement plan! The simplistic life of the wild we forfeited for this? We were fit, healthy, happy and almost stress-free before man created the wheel, the farm, the computer. And even better, there was no world starvation, ecocide, crime, or nucular wars.  I look at the natives of North America and wonder if they would have reached the same fate, even if the Europeans didn't interfere. If they were left alone, would they have evolved past their lifestyles too? I know a bit about their culture and I think that I would have rather lived in a tepee a thousand years ago than lived in a stone manor a thousand years ago. They lived off the land, nothing was wasted, not food, not water, not land, not people, for goodness' sakes. They were happy embracing on who they were, what they did, while on the other side we were always plagued with the words "It's never good enough," or "I hope my cheque* went through."   *check, for you american types.  Another thing. Was there suicide, terrorist attacks, world wars or pollution a thousand years ago where canada would be? Naw, just woods, rivers and peace as far as the eye could see. I know the tribes did war on each other sometimes, but did it affect the groud they battled on? Was the land unsutible for life for four hundred years after? Nope. All the plants grew back next spring. We were adapted to the land. We did not adapt the land to us.  So I am still wondering if it was an advantage, technology. Did it really give us good? In my eyes, it gave us overpopulation, world hunger, political warfare and lazy, obese, diabetic families who feed off our money because they can't be bothered to take care of themselves. But that's just my pessimistic views.  Solieus signing off.
