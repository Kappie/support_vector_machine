If I remember correctly -   Woman: SOmetimes I get really bored and lonely on Sundays. Other Woman: Oh, yeah, I know how you feel. (murmurs of agreement) Lisa: Oh, ok. Well, what I like to do is sit on my bed and draw myself into my favorite Cathy cartoons. (murmurs of appreciation) Other other woman: Um, I just want to say that I think that's really sad. Lisa: What? I'm single and Lovin' it!  and then the entire show deteriorates into needy women begging for men..... or soemthing to that effect.  ..... and...... point?...... oh yes.  SO I burned my very first CD today. Must be some rite of passage..... but I got a blank cd and used ti to make sure i could download onto and then burn cds on my computer. and i can! WOOHOO for that.  My plan is to take this playlist of "friend" songs i have and burn a CD to copy for all my girlfriends for valentine's day. Basically, I've got 2 friends who aren't single.... girls i mean. so yeah. i think it'll be good.  but then there's this leeeeeeetle voice in my head going "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? YOU'RE SEVENTEEN!!!! WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT DATING AT SEVENTEEN! THIS ISN'T HEALTHY!!!! YOU HAVE TO START DIETING BEFORE YOU DO THAT!!!!"  uuuuuuuuuuuuuuunh. I don't want to feel guy-less. I want him to notice me, dammit! alas, alack.  I went on a blind date a few nights ago. Well, my friend Vix persuaded me it was a blind just-friends but she meant it as a date. luckily, judging from both our reactions, we're off the hook as far as dating goes.   Why are there so few smart guys out there, and why don't they want to date me?  Playlist = soak up the sun, diamond road(sheryl crow); up from under, birdcage, baby bird (wallflowers); something to believe in (shawn mullins); answer, perfect girl (sarah mclachlan); everybody hurts (rem); and some other stuff. God, i don't remember. Whatever.  Much love.   And by that I mean Love, as in the Form. The Platonic form. Wait. Is all love striving to be Platonic "Love" or "platonic love"?  Damn Plato and his suspect sexuality.
