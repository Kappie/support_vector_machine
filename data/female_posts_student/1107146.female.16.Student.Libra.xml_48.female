Anywho, Josh, if you feel that way so badly why don't you just tell Leigh? *I* know she can be an ass sometimes, and I know how much you like her, I know she likes you too, she just has this problem of showing her actual feelings, I suggest for you to hold on a while longer, if she doesn't turn then I think you should forget her, I know how much you've tried and they'll pay off one day. She  REALLY  likes you, she just doesn't know how to show it. You've been pretending thw holw time? Josh, that's not very nice. I mean, I tell you the problems I have with Kenzie because I can't talk to anyone else about it, just let me in on a few things! I don't want you to pretend to me. Anywho, Erm..... I can tell Hua likes you to the point that she'll admit she loves you. She's just really secretive. Yeah, all girls/women are fickle. She'll turn around someday, but it's your choice if you want to hang on to her or not. I'm about to have a serious talk with Leigh. See you people around Later! Oh, and Joshies, I'll call you in a little while!  Lily the psycho powered one
