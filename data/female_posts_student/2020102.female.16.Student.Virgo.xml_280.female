She's losing control, she's coming down fast,  the heart that I stole, I'm not giving back, never giving back. -Starsailor, "Some of Us"  Silence is easy, it just becomes me,  you don't even know me, why lie about me? Silence is easy, it just becomes me,  you don't even know me. Why do you hate me? -Starsailor, "Silence is Easy"  A long December, and there's reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last I can't remember the last thing that you said as you were leavin' Now the days go by so fast... I can't remember all the times I tried to tell myself To hold on to these moments as they pass... -Counting Crows, "A Long December"
