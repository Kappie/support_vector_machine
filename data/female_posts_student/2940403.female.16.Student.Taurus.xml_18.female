I've been lucky that she's been in almost half of my classes all three trimesters this year.  We decided that we're both more mature than other students at school... anyone could have agreed with that, though.  English was kind of disgusting today... since Amanda was gone, the only people there to talk to were the kids behind us, and all they like to talk about is giving each other blow-jobs and drawing dicks on each others hands.  That got boring quick.  Mr. Pellant assigned a somewhat-cool speech, we have to give one on a special occasion.  I think I'll choose a eulogy, since everyone thinks I'm good with death anyway.  I'm going to give one on my kaputt cat Sammy, since I kinda feel bad that I've never really given her a proper farewell.  I hope she's listening.  Razz is doing well, she's still got a horrible cold and has sneezing fits every few minutes, but she's getting her appetite back and is starting to explore my mom's closet.  She still isn't quite used to the barking of the dogs, or Oscar, but Oscar watched her a little more today.  Every day is another step.  I stayed after to work on my art project that I need to get caught up on, and I talked with Mr. Mittelstedt about Mrs. Waller, and how she emails everyone but him, he assumes she doesn't email him because she didn't get his job when he was supposed to retire last spring.  So I helped him write an email to her, asking how she's doing, etc etc.   Mr. M is pretty cool, he liked the dredlocks I made on my little statue made out of plaster.  I'm excited to see if my "Lonely Disease" piece gets into the Top 100 Show, I'm still pretty proud of actually doing something that looks that great.  My dad was angry with me earlier this evening, because of some crazy shit that's been going on with my sister and I regarding the Gummi Bears that Jess gave me for a Christmas present... since she was the last person I saw eating them, when I found the bag open and all of the Gummi's rotten, I assumed it was her, and I asked her to replace the bag... of course she said no, so we got in an argument, to find out later that it was my mother that ate the gummi's.  ::sigh::  I laughed when I was explaining it to my sister, she yelled of course.  Today was very (otherwise) relaxing.  I played some BFV (as usual), played with Razz and Oscar, and that's about it.  I had a good piece of ice cream cake.   I love cake.
