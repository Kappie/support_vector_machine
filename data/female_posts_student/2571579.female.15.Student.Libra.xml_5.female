I have to make sure i dont bring anything on the "Do not bring" list .. like a watch god-forbid i know what time it is. But the second week is Seaside Park with eileen! So i have to packpractically all of my clothes for our hott nights up on the boardwalk meeting as many people as possible. Keeping the seperate suitcases will be diffucult cause i am deffinately not the most organized one. Now on to my day..  The park was insane today. Matt's still mad at me and since it rained the wholee day the kids were all under the pavilloin and by 12 they just we're crazy. The volume level was so loud. I think cassie just left for a while cause she couldnt take it. The consulers ordered food.. and mine was forgotten =\ So me and erin went up to Dino's and i had to pay for it again..grr. But after the crazy day i decided to go for a nice run. Of course it started pouring but whatever.. i like the rain so i kept going. I was actually went on Drakes Lane and on Bridge St then around pignatti so it was a lil different. Then since i was completly soaked i jumped in my pool and layed on a raft while it was raining haha. I got on the trampoline and bounced for like a minute and then i pulled my neck so I got off. I had to fight for the shower which i'm not used to. Steven won. Tonight i wanted to do something but i just started getting all my clothes together cause i realized i dont have much time for that. So here's to the rest of my week in Old Forge and a good Xmas in July (yea a little late) at the park tomorrow.
