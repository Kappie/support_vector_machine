I found a star that looked like it could be a variable because of its unusual light curve, but later determined that this was just due to experimental error. Dr. Richmond taught me a little about CCDsand how with really bright stars, the measurements can some times get skewed because there is an overflow of photons. This was probably the source of the irregularity of my graph for this particular star.
