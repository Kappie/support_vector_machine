And it is  a bit embarrasing too.  Fine, no more suspense, we ended up in PVR Vikaspuri, (dont ask me why) to see Spiderman 2. A new place( atleast for us South Delhiites) but with lots of eating joints. I will start off with the (mis)happenings which took place( with me around usually nothing right happens)- 1. While watching this very intense scene in the movie, I tried to take some popcorn for Palsy who was sitting right next to me, and unknowingly dipped my fingers into the coffee (ouch!) which he was holding( while reading this plz do not hold up ur nose coz whats going to follow is more dirty). But the best part was that he actually drank the coffee after that. Immediately after this, Sinha advised Palsy to get some injections for rabies, tetanus, etc.  2. After the movie ended ( which was quite a relief for the other ppl watching, as there were some frequent comments.), we went to McDs and there Sinha ordered an icecream. I had just helped myself to some when Palsy butted his head in between, in short resulting in some cold icecream on Palsy's hair. I will not elucidate further and let ur imaginations take u through this very weird scene. But the outcome of this has been that Palsy has vowed that he will stay some miles away from me while eating and watching any movie.  3. The thing which this point shows that we are BIG GLUTTONS ( yeah, we cant still beat Nisheeth at it, i agree). We decided to have our lateish luch at Pizza Hut ( do not think we starved till then, nachos, hotdogs, cold coffee, coke, of course we do not consider them as food but thats a diff issue). I decided to serve and lo and behold the pizza toppled over inside the pan itself) and the waiter just kept staring at us. I think he had never seen a crowd like this before.  Will not go into the finer details of this magnificent day, but by this time u must have understood what happened to the pockets of Kanika and Soumya, who took the undaunting task of treating us.  A final word, with almost everybody opening up a blog now,  I do hope there is some creativity left in each of us , to attract our few viewers.  I also sympathise with Bhavya for the Columban Quiz.
