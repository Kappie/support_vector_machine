My uncle john brought this guy Josh.....I know I've seen him before, but still........OMG he is so fucking hot!!!! And he is bi! I love gay and bi guys, they are hot and cool. On the other hand today is also kinda a downer...people dont stick to their word. I had two friends tell me that they would call me today, one when he got up and the other when he got home. I haven't gotten any calls today. Oh well, I didn't really expect the first to call, he never does when he says he will. The other I did expect to call, but I'll live. Also I've had Nicky all day without anyone to really help me with him. Its a  fight to find someone willing to take him so that I can go to the bathroom. Hell, my biggest help was Josh and he ain't even family.
