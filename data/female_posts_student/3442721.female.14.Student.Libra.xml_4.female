I was part of a team. Team 3!!!!!!! Sorry bout breaking the egg buddy!!!!!! We had fun at compition (sory uboat speelin' lol) Our team got 3rd place in the whole thing. We won best skit though. (HA HA DREW!) I really wonder what people have on their minds cause everybody at school has been giving me dirty looks.  Oh well i'm tired of their crap. I'll see ya later!   Love the princess of darkness, Jessica
