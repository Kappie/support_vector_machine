They're in no particular order, because I am an indecisive person and to choose one song that is my favourite would be very difficult for me :) This may also turn into a list longer than 20. heh.   1. Kiss From a Rose, by Seal 2. Lateralus, by Tool 3. Magdalena, by A Perfect Circle 4. Rose, by A Perfect Circle 5. Aenima, by Tool 6. Give It Away, by Zero 7 7. Song for Olabi, by Bliss 8. Suite Pee, by System of a Down 9. Mr. Jack, by System of a Down 10. Awakening, by Damning Well and a few other people that I forget 11. 22:20, by Danny Lohner, Maynard James Keenan (w00t) and Puscifer 12. Everyone's A Junkie, by Our Lady Peace 13. Alone in the Universe, by David Usher 14. Butterfly, by David Usher 15. I'm No Angel, by Dido 16. All You Want, by Dido 17. PVC IV, by the Blue Man Group 18. Mandelgroove, by the Blue Man Groop 19. Mosquito Song, by Queens of the Stone Age 20. Optimissed, by Skinny Puppy   Okay, only 20, aren't you lucky :) And what can I say? I'm a house music kinda person :D hehe. Actually, even the techno type music in there is  good  music. It's better than most of the junk on the radio these days, at least. And sorry for putting artists down more than once a few times... I woulda put even more songs by them, but ya know. That would have looked slightly pathetic.   So, that's about it. I'm angry at A and A for not saying thank you for the cookies on my chatterbox :) And BTW, for some reason I can't post on chatterboxes right now, so imagine that on A's chatterbox, it says "YAYAYAYAYA TOOL!!!!!! LATERALUS IS A BETTER SONG THOUGH!!!!!", and on A's chatterbox it says "YAYAYAYAYAYA MAYNARD!!!!!!!!! GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!"   Thank you. :)
