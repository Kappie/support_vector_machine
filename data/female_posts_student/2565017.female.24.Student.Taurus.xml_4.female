My name is Mari Annika (those are first names, no last name given here), and I'm a 24-year-old girl from Finland. I currently study nursing in a public polytechnic, and I'm coming to the half point of my 2nd year. So that means, 2 and half years to go before throwing myself into working life. My hobbies are.... I do some sports, hang out with friends, I love to cook myself (no wonder if you saw let alone tasted the food in our cafeteria) and music is my life... I have to do all this, and housework, with the little time I have left after all the schoolwork and studying. (whining, lol)  Everyone's welcome to ask more about me, if you're so curious....  easiest way is to post your questions to the comment section.  Untill later!
