I've only ever been once before, so I'm begging people, please don't dessert me tomorrow!" I'll probably spend most of the day flat on my back, but hey! It's all fun really. I#'ve even bought a little disposable camera to capture everyone making prats of themselves, he he! Anyway! Nicki, that song is probably by Good Charlotte? If not, I'm guessing that's it's Drops of Jupiter, by Train? But it's probably the first one! lol. Anyway, busy day at work today, insane people wanteing to buy the most bizarro things meant I was up and down a ladder all day. Anyway, too knackered to talk and my fingers are all bleeding, I must go and bandage them up, till tomorrow peoples!
