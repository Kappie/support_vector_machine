Anyways, my stepmonster totally went off the deep end yesterday. She went NUTS! Long story, but anyways, I ended up leaving at like 10 because she was acting so weird. And then today in algebra, Mr. Zizzo brought up the whole kissing thing again. Now hes started asking questions like "Is he taller than you?" and crazy stuff like that. Ugh. Yuck. Leave me alone. Tomorrow is sure to be interesting because I have the honor roll assembly 1st period. I don't really know where I have to go because I don't have a 1st period at east campus. So yeah, I'll have to figure that one out. Luckily, east ensemble is officially over for the year, so all I have now is one acts, and anything goes starting friday. Oh boy. So solo  ensemble contest is on saturday. And then I'm babysitting saturday night, and I spending the night at their house or something. They better be paying me well. Hehe.
