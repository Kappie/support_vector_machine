Been hanging at the Grind for the last few hours, perfecting the Property outline and feel pretty damn good about it, if not just a bit exhausted.  Still not quite sure I grasp the intricacies of real covenants as opposed to equitable servitudes, but the foundation's there and the gaps will be filled in due time.  Get to spend the weekend organizing the house of cards called Contracts, which actually feels like a break from the recent history of brief-writing and emotional gauntlet-running Saturdays and Sundays.    But I thought I'd take a minute and fill in some holes from the week, because I know I left you hanging:  The oral argument went well, just as everybody tried to assure me.  Yes, I froze on the first question, just as I'd feared.  But, just as promised, I warmed up and kicked ass thereafter.  Didn't quite get onto the second issue as quickly as I should have, but overall, I did very well.  Must have been the zipper.  Celebrated the week's major anniversary with a hot Girlie Exam.  You know, the one we all hate, dread and try to put off as long as we possibly can.  But at least I was finally getting some action...even if it was in a paper-thin cotton gown with a flashlight-equipped-speculum.  It was over pretty quick, to my relief (and dismay??), and I was left wondering whether I still have a "cervix they use to draw anatomy books."  That's what Gloria told me during my first exam and I've always been proud; no such luck this time, but I still like the idea of having a Textbook Cervix, so I'm gonna keep it around.
