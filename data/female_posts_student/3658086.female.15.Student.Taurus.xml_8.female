I just feel as though she is trying to get inside my brain, which admittedly is what she's meant to do. but i dont want her there. I feel as though she only wants to talk to me so that she can nose into my life... I kno thats not true because she is just doing her job. i dont like her asking me personal questions about my life.. she doesnt need to kno. i just want to forget about most of it, unless i'm thinking about it and then i just talk it through with one of my freinds (i love you guys) and then its fine... i mean, these sesions make me think about it when i dont want to. i hate it.. at the moment i feel as though mrs marshall is actually my mum, i mean, i dont have a good relationship with my mum, partly because she's normally to pissed to talk to me, but i cant talk to her at all... mrs marshall is always there, she gives me hugs, great advise, which is exactly what i need, but dont seem to be able to get... does anyone else have a shit relationship with their parents... how do you deal with it??? to add to it i've lost one of my best friends... henry, for those who dont know about that, he sent me an email saying that I wave my arm around for attention.. on the contrary (i threw that in for you jen!) i cut myself on my upper arms or on my leg so that noone can see.... dont really understand how that is attention seeking.. one of his other points was that apparently I'm saying that I am a lesbian for attention aswell... He thinks i should tell every guy i fancy about that... I mean we are talking little crushes... or more like, I'm pretending to like them to cover up my true sexuality... I'm not gonna bloody marry them for fucks sake!!! so i got really pissed off by him and now we are no longer friends.. bit silly if you ask me to throw away a friendship that has been going on for years... oh well. i guess its kinda his loss not mine. couldn't give a shit about anything anymore.. i wanna curl up and die.. maybe thats a bit extreme but thats how it feels at the moment... gtg save christie from wierdos in the computer centre  laterz xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
