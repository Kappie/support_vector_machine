I had my sister and my family on the phone two days ago: Maud (sister) seems very excited but also scared to spend one year with kangaroos, Bernadette (Mum) seems sad but also excited because she will have the appartment with Dad for them only...hum...I wonder what will happen... not another sister or brother please!!! ;-)  Anyway, lets get back to US...Our holidays are going very well, we spent most of our time together walking in the city, shopping (bad for our wallets) and doing some sport (besides the time spent in bed!!). Well, fortunatly we are going to travel a bit, I think we need to escape for  a week...In fact we are looking forward to welcome my sister and celebrate her arrival...with aussie beers of course!!
