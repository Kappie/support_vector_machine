Taking counsel from God and committed Christians, though, will provide an entirely different perspective- the right one. Choose to follow God's counsel-He is perfect and has laid out clear instructions to obey in His Word, the Bible. He'll also use other Christians to help guide you in the decisions that you must take-and you'll have plenty.  Courage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are oftened stiffened. -Billy Graham   When we are down, who do we turn to? Friends that is equally having the amount of problems that you have? Or friends that will spread your problems like wildfire to the whole world? Or will you turn to God, whom you trust? The decision lies in you. Therefore, seek counsel from God...from our Father..because He is the one that really knows how you feel, how you are struggling and stuff. He will be there for you always and therefore, seek Him and you will be able to seek comfort from Him. Therefore, who are you gonna turned to? -Abigail
