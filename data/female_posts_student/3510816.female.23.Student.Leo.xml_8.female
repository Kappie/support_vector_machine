With my life being so insane right now, I needed something quick and painless. A lot of the stuff I post there is well...complicated and not anything I'd want my close, personal friends to read or anything I'd want a number of other people to read. It also takes a lot of time to force that kind of crap out. I've went weeks and months without a post there because I've set it up as a place to purge. So, now, I have this nice friendlier place to post. It even has a spell check! Whee! I'm not saying I won't be honest and if bad shit is happening to me I'm gonna talk about it. However, if you want deep and probing; try my d-x account. If you really want it (heck if you didn't start out reading me there), I'm likely to give you the address unless you happen to know me IRL. Off to play with the new toy!
