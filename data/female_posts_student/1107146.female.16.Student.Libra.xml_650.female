Josh go talk to her NOW...ok well not now and prolly not with some of Linds' language but you do need to talk to her. To make her understand that you are really versatile in your writing...not even mentioning your personality. Also show her that she's only read two of your essay's at most so she can't possibly know your completely style. Also the Aristotle essay can't hope personality...it was very dry. SO...don't her write that on all you papers.
