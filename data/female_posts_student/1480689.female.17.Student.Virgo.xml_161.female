HOW!  i think it may hurt more that it was a lie this entire time....because i was getting over the situation....but i guess there was nothing to get over.  this is.. sick.  and yet, i want to hold.....again.   i cant do this.   consider me written out of your life.   because, thats how i feel. i feel if you can lie about something so fucking huge and hurtful...i didn't matter in the first place.
