Now, I didn't take many (40 maybe) and they're all just the same group of people in different poses sooo I'm only gonna post a couple and maybe give a hint as to who I am in them all if you don't already know! (-coughs- gold dress)            I promise I'll have a -lot- more after the Wagner grad... lot lot lot more, but there ya have it, my fond memories of my own McNally Class of 2004 Grad.  What else did I promise? Ooh.. hah.. pictures from England... unfortunately I've lost most of them, in fact, any of the Wedding ones will have to be scanned in now, but I do have a picture of my new cousin William (8 months old)... hehe.. yes.. its beer he's trying to drink (my cousin John is the one giving it to him).
