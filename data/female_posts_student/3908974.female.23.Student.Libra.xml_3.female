I am just so ready to move on to the next part of my life that college has lost its magic.  Please let lady luck smile on me and let me get accepted to grad school somewhere far away.  Got my first rejection letter from Montana yesterday, the same day my roommate got her acceptance letter from Yale.  It was hard to smile at her good fortune when I felt like drowning myself in the toilet.    Went to visit my parents this weekend in Manhattan.  It's funny how much I enjoy their company now that I'm older.  When I was living with them, and even for a few years after, our visits felt forced and uncomfortable.  I looked forward to seeing them about as much as I'd look forward to getting a root canal.  But now it's like we've gotten past all the horror of me being a teenager, and everything's fine.  Especially now that I'm not married anymore.  They thought John was an asshole from the beginning, and he thought they were highbrow professors out to make so-called normal folks feel inadequate.    I call my dad a rock and roll dad.  He's of the baby boom generation, and he came of age in the sixties in that golden time when the youth felt like they could actually fight against the tide of assholism and change the world for the good.  He's a smoker and a drinker, and he teaches Walt Whitman and Human Rights Literature.  Around Christmas, little kids approach him because he looks like Santa Claus, then their parents drag thjem away because they can see that my dad is a bearded old hippie with bifocals on.  Manhattan is the epitome of a Bible Belt Kansas town.  Guys with beards are generally seen as the fringe element, even if they do work at KSU.  I wonder sometimes why my parents wanted to live there.  My mom died when I was in second grade.  What I remember is that she was alternately shy and over the top.  She had this pained expression she wore all the time, and her brow would be knit up in concern.  People tell me I have inherited this look, though I couldn't tell you for sure.  She was, as I said, shy and self effacing, but she had a hidden strength and a surprising temper.  She was an artist, and she could knead a piece of clay as big as an infant.  And when she was mad, she might calmly walk out of a door, then slam it so hard she dragged the whole frame down with it.  I still have some of her art, and I think she was gifted at what she did.  I wonder what she'd have done if she'd lived past 35.  My stepmom is cool, too, and she's been around for ten years.  I didn't take to her in a hurry, though.  It was a rough gig seeing her with my dad, especially since I was 13 at the time.  She was born in the Republic of Congo, back when it was Zaire.  Her parents are heavy into the Coventant Church, and they were in Africa to help save the heathens.  Naomi's the Black Sheep of the family, even though she has a Ph.D. from Duke and teaches Children's Literature.  Her and my dad make a strange pair.    No brothers or sisters, just me and my folks.  I have an aunt somewhere in Iowa, and a cousin here in Lawrence.  He's a vagrant and he looks like the old Jim Morisson, when he stopped being the hottest man alive and started being a hairy alcoholic who exposed himself.  Last time I saw him, I went to a coffee house and he was sitting there, hunched over a cup of coffee.  I tried to talk to him, but he made no sense.  Said he was living in a tent at Pamona Lake, but who knows?  I thought I saw him slouching around the Salvation Army Soup Kitchen a time or two.  I wanted to make friends, because family is important and all, but I kept thinking about how he'd been chased out of Iowa because he beat his girlfriend and how he borrowed money all the time.  I haven't seen him, but I know I will someday.  That's one thing I do know about family--They keep turning up.
