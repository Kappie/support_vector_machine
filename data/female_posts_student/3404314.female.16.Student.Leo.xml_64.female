PROMISE!! after eating my lunch.. i planned to sleep for three hours but beacuse my body begged for more.. i overslept.. haii..   so that i can sleep, i started reading sophie's world by jostein gaarder.. actually it was an old copy.. it's owned by my cousin, kuya jerome.. i saw it at kuya jingo's bookshelf.. i was so happy upon seeing it coz there's no need to buy a new one.. i became interested at this book because of my blockmate, grace!!  i cant wait for tomorrow coz prince and me will be shown.. but i dont know when im gonna watch it..
