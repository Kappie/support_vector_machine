If killing your father and demanding that your sister bare your child isn't evil I don't know what is. Pheonix's portrayal is one for the ages, in one of my favorite movies of the last five years. When he screams "Am I not merciful" to his sister, I got chills down my spine. That alone is enough for me to place him on my list. Come to think of it I am kind of suprised you didn't like my final pick, with your known love of Joaquin I thought you would totally agree with it. But I guess you are just full of suprises.  As for the hero/villain question I posed in Part Eight, I have a couple answers to it. It may seem a little unoriginal but I still feel that Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader gave us one of the most intriguing hero/villain relationship. The struggle was between a father and a son, bitter enemies that are related to each other is something you don't find in many movies. My other choice would have to be John McClane(Bruce Willis) and Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman). Gruber was a relentless businessman whose lethal tactics achieve his goals. Unlike most 1980s film villains who committed globally dangerous acts for liberty, genocide, or world domination,  DIE HARD 's Gruber uses guns, explosives and cunning to storm the Takagi Corporation's Christmas party and heist millions of dollars form the company. I would classify McClane as a bad luck hero, wrong place at the wrong time who chooses to intervene, and against incredible odds succeeds in foiling Gruber's plans.  Well folks, there you have it. This post ends our first discussion, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. Now the topic is your choice, I look foward to wrapping my head around it. Until next time, this Nick signing off.
