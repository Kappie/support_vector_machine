I went camping last night in my friend's backyard with a bunch of giiiirls..Although it was monstious fun, i was sharing an air mattress with my friend. huge thing, double, or queen or something. But it was slowly losing air, and we didn't know how. And when we woke up in the morning, there was no air at all. And now my back is all stiff, there's a muscle pulled in there and my shoulder acccche...I'm sucker to a good masage right now, but there's no one around. It's sad. So I am.  But I have the best tan..I'm so brown...rawr...break out the white shirts baby.
