Mainly because I am SICK TO DEATH of this topic.  First off, I have seen the movie, and like everybody has said it is pure propaganda. And that's okay. That was a given.  I found the movie to be funny, and surprisingly, boring. In my opinion it seriously lagged. And at times, it got me angry. I hated that he made the soldiers in Iraq look like fools.   They are kids!  18 and 19 years old. What do you expect. And not only that, it's not their fault that they are there. It's the governments fault. Blame Bush, I do. But don't blame the kids fighting. That really irritates me. And I can see how some would think that to be anti-American.   Now here is where I am conflicted. To say you hate the movie, or Michael Moore, is then like saying you are a Bush fan. However, I do NOT like Michael Moore, and I am NOT a Bush fan.   See the conflict?   Moore is a liar. He straight out lies in F-9/11, just like he did in BFC. Bush is liar. Where  are  those WMD?   Therefore, I don't believe one, anymore then I believe the other.   And now, I am done talking about Michael Moore.   Fin.   (Of course I reserve the right to bring up this topic again, whenever the fancy strikes me. Heh)
