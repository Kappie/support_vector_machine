They were in the process of asking me whether or not I'm beginning to feel safe at my apartment again (I was mugged not long ago outside my building in broad daylight... in one of the safest areas in Montreal, too!)and at one point they suddenly became very distracted and were having trouble following what I was saying.  I knew there was cleavage in the area.    I turned around and... yowza, there it was.  A woman perhaps a couple of years my senior was wearing this tight faux-suede one-piece with a zipper down the front... except her (what would the most lady-like word be?) breasts (there we go) were so (ladylike...) large (ok) that she couldn't even zip her swimsuit up all the way.  She had it zipped up as much as possible in a way that gave her that bubbly plate-of-boobs kind of cleavage... Why do women do that?  Do their heads get tired, so they need to rest their chins on their breasts?  Are they narcoleptic and need to take frequent naps on their cleavage?    Hmm... I'm not jealous.... I'm just concerned for the.... umm.. children.  Yikes!  I'm considering swallowing my pride and asking that senior editor to let me re-take the editing test.  Is that pathetic?  I have to spend less time writing in this blog and more time editing my script.  Cheers for now!
