THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. This coming week I will report to the Congress and the American people on the state of our union. Over the past few years, America has been confronted with great challenges, and the American people have responded with strength and compassion and confidence. This nation is meeting its priorities, both at home and abroad.  Today I (the president) shall give the state of the Union (by the way I'm not sure, but did this air 8am or 8pm... I remember the Columbia Spectator saying somehing about this being at 8pm)... me as the president again... I have put America in some deep shit homie.  America continues to wage a relentless campaign against terrorists who threaten our country. We're fighting this war on the offensive, denying terrorists refuge, identifying and seizing their secret finances, and holding terrorists and their sponsors to account. These terrorists are still dangerous, and we will stay on the hunt until they are destroyed.  Your country? dude do you know that they attack other counrties? I mean you got hit once, Irsarel, India, those guys get hit everyday. Why would terrorists asking you for refuge in the first place? I mean your the big guy with a shot gun who is running after them. How do you tell a terrorist from a non terrorist? Destroyed? You're actually going to after every single one? For all that don't know, terrorists are like grey hairs, pull one out and two grow in. I mean all you're doing now is spreading the hate.   Across the greater Middle East, America is confronting dangers and promoting democracy and hope, as the alternative to terror and violence. Afghanistan, once ruled by the brutal Taliban regime, has adopted a new constitution and is following the path of democracy, including providing fundamental rights to women.  By confronting dangers, you mean the terrorists who are running into Iraq now cause there is no Saddam and his harsh methods to set them straight. Now these terrorists are going to get the people against you. "look, you're gonna let your ass be conquered by these bitches? Sure they got rid of Saddam, but look at that mofo and look at fact that its worse now without Saddam... I say we hit back..." This the mentality that the terrorists are now going to use against you. Fundemental rights to women? Dude, you are making it seem like women had  no  influence in the middle east. Just off on a tangent: This is what the europeans said about the American Indians, they too used the women arguement to conquer America. Women might not vote, but they are not considered slaves, it's quite the opposite.  The leader of Libya has now pledged to disclose and dismantle all of his weapons of mass destruction programs. And in Iraq, the enemies of freedom are being systematically routed from their holes and rounded up. Iraqis are assuming greater responsibility for their own security and future government. American troops in that country are performing their duty with skill and courage, and we're proud of them all.  The only reason he cooperating is cause he doesn't want a bomb shoved up his fat ass.  Here at home, we continue to build prosperity and economic security for our people. Tax relief has helped turn our economy around. We've doubled the child tax credit, cut taxes for everyone who pays income taxes, and increased incentives for small businesses to invest in new equipment and create jobs.  That kinda sounds kewl... now when am I going to see a check for this?  The results are clear. Our economy grew at its fastest pace in two decades in the third quarter of 2003. Manufacturers are seeing a rebound in new orders in factory activity. And more than a quarter-million new jobs have been created since August.  That's funny cause it's not true....LOL   Our government has also acted to strengthen our Medicare system. To keep our commitment to America's senior citizens, we're adding better preventative care and a prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Many thought these reforms were impossible; yet members of both parties put old debates behind them and fulfilled our promise to America's seniors. On Tuesday night I will outline the steps we must take to meet the goals of this nation. We will work to expand opportunities for all Americans to own their own business. We'll press forward on an agenda of economic growth so that everyone who wants to work can find a job. We'll take steps to help families and small businesses deal with the rising cost of health care. We will continue to help schools and students meet the high standards we've set so no child in America is left behind. We will encourage the good work of faith-based groups that bring hope to those in need. For the sake of our own freedom and security, we will continue to fight the war on terror.  This is the kinda shit I am talking about. Good shit, now I can finally go see that damn doctor and get this racoon off my ass....no i am serious get it off.  With all these actions, we will continue to confront the challenges of our time, and we will continue to make America a more secure, more prosperous, and more hopeful place. Thank you for listening.  Bullshit Well this is all I could find for now, I think I have the full version in my hotmail account, will add it on later. Enjoy
