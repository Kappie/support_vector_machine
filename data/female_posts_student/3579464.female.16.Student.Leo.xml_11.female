My chef, Julio, amde me the most amazing dinner. And 3 cappucinos. haha. Worst part of working at restaurant = working at restaurant.) Anyway i spent those 12 hours flirting and figuring it out. I guess I'm just a flirty person...like, seriously, today I flirted with three puppies- an 8-week old rottweiler to DIE for, and some othher drop kick pups...and this little baby girl who looked like Amelie, pint-sized, and another one with huge blue eyes...and I always flirt with the tiny boys. They're so fun,a nd crayons are like candy in a restaurant. And then I flirt with the parents, you know, like, "Your baby is adorable!" And it's not even sucking up because I didn't waitress, so it's not my tip. (I bussed...it sucked.) Of course, there's the conventional flirting, i.e., Arch Boy, etc., and those jackasses 23-year olds tonight fromt eh city ("Are you taking any pizza home tonight? "Only if you're pizza!" No joke. Ew.) but I mean, flirting is just kind of... a way of living. I like to flirt with life. Forgive me, those I love, You do still have my full attention.
