Ms. Rowley and Ms. Matis weren't in the media center today so I decided to steal two honor society roses (even though I didn't make national honor society) and some hall passes. Might need those later. Michelle, Gareth, and I left after 4th hour. Went to Pinball Pete's, had some fun. "Well, that's not half as bad as when he tried to fit his dick in the bottle." "No, I think deep throating the bottle was worse." lmfao. "He was pretty good at that." Damn, Ned's so fucked up.  I want to throw my towel in on this life, move away and just start over. I know I'd miss a lot of people but maybe that would give me a chance to start again. Get all this shit out of my head. Back when James and I were still messing around (yeah, I know you remember this, Josh and Mike both know what I'm talking about... perhaps Michelle and Tiki) he told me that I can't run from my problems. lol. I just said, "I just did." And hung up. I haven't talked with him since. I ran away, back to my middle school / high school life and he ran away to the ROTC, he's in South Korea now. And the cursor just blinks... not much to say...  Don't rescue me When I play with with fire Don't need to know Is this desire We hold back words Our eyes are giving away Deny the past We've come to radiate In need of some substance In need of some substance A little's less than nothing In need of some substance The sun might set Tonight could be the night And if that's the case You'll get on all right But there's no point In spoiling for a fight Because we're blinded by The darkest ray of light  I look at my life. Just high school in general, and I realize I'll never stand up to what my brother has accomplished. I'm such a family fuck up.
