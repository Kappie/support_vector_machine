Too soon to comprehend---therefore I am writing about it...thinking about it....even if not exactly believing it. This is going to be my "college journal." I have gotten a warning from a close family member advising me not to bring a paper journal into my dorm room; I find that advice especially worth taking for the simple reason that I do not know who my roomate is. I know her name, that she is bringing a refrigorater, tv, and a dvd player with surround sound. That is the extent of how well I know her. College life is going to be interesting.  I get to quit my job in exactly one week. That is way too long, but comforting just the same. Then I will pack pack pack and do more packing and probably unpacking and repacking until I have everything I need and want to be with me in my new college life. I am sure that will take a week, but knowing me (I think I know myself....15% in all but about 100% in all regarding my packing habits) I will leave it till the day before I leave, wake up early, and pack all day until probably early in the next day and get to college exhaused and nauseated from nervousness. Not a very good combination.  At the moment I am wearing a stolen watch. My six year old sister found it while we were at the beach---2 minutes later I am alone and see a man with two young girls walking along the shoreline looking for something... I keep my mouth shut. Today my sister gave the watch to me as a present. How sweet.  At work today over the loudspeaker I said "Glen, pl--pla--plua--pl-plac-PACK please!" It was a very nauseating situation that I could not bear to think about but did probably for the entire half hour following it. I tried to make it funny when Glen came to pack the groceries. I said smiling, "Glen, plack please" as a joke and he smiled but I think he could see through my words into the deep pit of embarassment I was drowning in. By the way, Glen is the handsome boss' son.  A guy at work has feelings for me I think. I don't know if they're friendly or romantic. No one else at work has either for me and the sudden holding of the door for me, looking deeply into my eyes, joking (flirting?) with me makes me feel like his feelings are leaning a little more towards romantic. In a week I will be leaving and whatever his feelings are, they will probably remain unsaid. That makes the blushing and the lovely feeling that occured in my stomach seem like blank, depressing nothingness. I wish I knew his name... it would make me feel less of the blank & more of the less confusing: whatever that is.  I will write again when I arrive in my new life and all the mumbo jumbo of being seventeen years old and unable to ring up alcohol at work and no one saying hi to me at work and calling packers on the loudspeaker for everyone in the entire store (people sitting on the toilet, in the breakroom, meatroom, everywhere) can hear (a little too) loud and clear---will be over.
