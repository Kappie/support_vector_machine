When I first got up my jaw was locked, which happens a lot when I get up so I just thought it'd go away after a few minutes. But I went to go eat breakfast and it wouldn't move. Everyone knows I have a  huge  mouth and that I can stick my fist in it. But this morning I could hardly stick a spoon in there! And I had a huge bowl of some cinnamon things that I really liked. So I was pissed that I couldn't stick the fucking spoon in my mouth. I was on the verge of tears, seriously. And then Margaret was pissing me off. So I was doing the best I could of yelling at her for being a bitch.Then she was making fun of my for the way I was talking...ah, stress.So I had to go get my new inhaler (the one I have is a tester but this is a  *true*  inhaler now so wow! go me!) and I found out my doctor changed my prescription from 2 puffs 20 minutes before exercise to 2 puffs 2 times a day. Which is screwed up because I only need it for sports! Then I bunched into my mom's friendly and very pregnant friend who's a teacher and she's like, "Is this the writer?" Referring to me, which was weird because I'd never think my mom to tell people I write. Then I came home @ around 11 and watched the  Price Is Right  for the first time this summer! That show kicks some serious ass! And the one guy played Plinko! I love that game! But I kept falling asleep during commercials so I turned off the TV and switched positions. I had my head at the foot of the bed and I wanted to lay under my covers. But I forgot I had taken my glasses off and placed them on the bed so when I went to go under the covers, you hear my glasses go hit the wall and fall some place. So it took me like 3 minutes to hide them and in the end, I had to crawl under my damn bad.  So then I took a nap til 2 pm.  That was nice. OMG! I have to tell you about my crazy ass dream! So I was at my cousin's house. My cousin Chris was there and the other kid was suppose to be my cousin Tim but he didn't look like him and he called himself Dan. Dan was trying to lock me in some stone cave with stone bleachers but I wouldn't let him because I have a fear of small spaces. Then he was trying to get me to eat some soup crap  with eye balls.  I took a big bite and ended up spitting it out. I spit one of the eye balls like 20 feet across the room into a mug. Next, Chris gave me a purring seal,   yes, a purring seal,   on a leash to hold and it was soo cute. And he added, "You'llhave so much fun babysitting tomorrow." I was like, WHOA! WTF?Suddenly, I was at some amusement park. I was on some ride with Maura, my mom, and a bunch of other people. We were about to go up the big hill to go down at like a 90 degree angle when I realized I  wasn't  buckled in so I freaked out and jumped out of my seat. At this point Maura started screaming her head off because she was sitting next to me. But little did I know the ride was so close to the ground. So as the ride went up the hill,  I was nearly killed by feet!  That's how close it was to the ground. Then I was in a car with my cousin going to his house to babysit the little seal.So I get out of the car and I'm in my sister's awesome black pants with my huge red Gap shirt and my Sesame Street socks!  I didn't even have shoes on!  So I get in the house and it's all crazy. My cousin Matt looked just like my friend Chris and he was making breakfast for his girlfriend and a bunch of her friends. Then my Aunt Sue was like HUGE! And she kept giving me hugs which is strange because she pretty much hates me. And there was a garage in the back of the house with no door separating the rooms. And my dad was in there working on a car. And then my mom was there and they saw each other and were like, yeah? Then the dream ended. Oh! I'm getting my  own  celly finally. I had to kinda give mine up to Eddie when he could drive and he nevers lets me use it other than soccer so yeah. I'm excited. So later Eddie asked me if I wanted to go to some stores to look for his lights that he wanted for his cars. I agreed and we went. None of the stores had them so he was bummed. Then I was talking about Dairy Queen and he's like, "Wanna go get some ice cream?" "Uh, I've been trying to cut down on all that..." "Party pooper!" So we ended up going to Dunkin Donuts for some fruit smoothies, which were really good. I got a strawberry banana one and he got peach.  It was really nice of him to hang out with me.  Earlier, he was like talking to me about one of his friends and I thought it was really cool how he was telling me stuff. We've been getting along really good lately and I'm super happy about that. Then I got a letter from Gretchen today and that always cheers me up! But it's really weird b/c I check my bro's blog every day to see if he updates it and I read everything. It's like I know a new side of him. And he wrote about me in his posttonight. He said said he's been trying to hang out with me more because I've been fighting with my friends and he talked about the smoothies. I don't know, it's just strange for him to be acting like this now. He never cared before like to hang out with me before. But I'm glad he did...Ah, tears are forming... Sorry, you guys will have to wait for a poem til tomorrow...
