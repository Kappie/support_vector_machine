I finally really and trully got up the guts to leave the guy and his mom says..."don't do this now... i can't take anymore stress... at least wait until after the holidays... you haven't even given him a chance..." blah blah blah  where the hell has SHE been the last 21/2 years??? all i've done is give chance after chance after chance, and i am tired of it... i am tired of being treated like shit when every damn thing doesn't go his way...  here's an example of the crap he gets mad about...  the other day, our friend was supposed to watch the baby so we could go out it turned out she had to work, plus our other friend didn't show to pick us up anyway... so the asshole i call a husband got pissed and tore my shirt, grabbing me by the collar...  over something that insignifigant...  it's stupid.
