So i waited for abt 5 minits for him to finish reading it. After a while, he called me and we reviewd the essay together and guess again what happend? he said MY WRITING SUCKS!!!  he qoute" your writing is bad, ur conclusion n introducation dont flow, u use really bad wordS, ur reading make me confuse, u use repetition, u cannot put present, past n future in one essay, u have a bad structure of essay and blah2" i was like "f--k u man!. who do u think you are? u are not even suppose to say those things. those things are mean man!". While he was saying that, I felt like I want to slap his face and say "well buddy at least i did mine u didnt even do ur homework". Stupid Russian!!!! u were suppose to correct my grammar or some shit like that not gave a bad comment on it...or u can say something bad but not as bad as that!! thats mean, horrible, despise and bad bad opinion..damn those people..i really hate him even tho i only spoke to him once and i will not speak to him nor seat next to him again..  oh well shit stuffs happen but u gotta overcome it then..arghh tomoro is my seminar presentation day and i havnt done anything abt it..and i am totally totally going to die..what am i gonna do it. the presentaion is 20 minute..what am i gonna say what am i gonna do damn damn..*sigh* arghhhhhh tidakkkkkkkkkkkkkk!!
