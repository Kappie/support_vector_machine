He's seen the films like 9 times..at least...he's gotta know all there is to know about it!       True. And then we could nail them and bring the bastards down for illegal gun running.      Anytime there's a party there's cake too. We can use your money for the cake if you're really that bothered....      Ooooh, Don Maclean and Weird Al...two of teh greatest singers around. Unless Don died...I think he was old enough...but still great.   Y'Know weird Al's got a video for that?!      Hey, Church. Gotta say i can't blame you for getting antsy about the death thing; it gives me the wiggins too, and i've been there  way  too many times. Still, you weren't here at the time so...      Beer doesn't exactly rot your gut at quite the same rate. Not uless you drink a whole keg to yourself. Daily. And i don't drink it all the time...just most of the time. Ooooh, see, Reeses agrees with me! 'Cept she said it first so technically - we both agree on the point. Listen to your elders.      Uhhh....*yells* DANIEL!!! Dammit he's not here. I can do spanish or portuguese and maybe a little arabic. Certain phrases in "Ancient Egyptian". "Ancient Latin". Not...whatever taht was. Ah.      Cool. I know a guy who was kinda like that once. Threw my shoe through him once, while he was tryig to convince me taht i wasn't hallucinating,in between deaths.      Ah...Halo....'kay, so i've never heard of it. I can relate on the war part though. Only the really big, official ones get names...the others are jsut "The war with [insert name of opposing force]".      YYH?....?      Give me Mary Steinburgen any day.         "By the right, quick Bleah!!"- Cpl Mike, Fran, and Me      		    urlLink    Yahoo!
