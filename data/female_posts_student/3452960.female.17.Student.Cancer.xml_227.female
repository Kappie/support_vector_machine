I need to show off about my recent holiday to both Egypt and Cyprus and ask about Dave and Rob smelling each other? My holiday was ammmaaazing! We went to Egypt on a cruise firstly, then we spent a day in Egypt, visited 3 pyramids, The Sphinx, The Egyptian Museum and some real live(?) Mummies. Then we spent the rest week and a half causing chaos in Cyprus (we = me and Kirsten). In Egypt I got my first wedding proposal. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting but jus as I was happily buying some papyrus some boring Egyptian dude came up to me like a schoolgirl and asked if I wanted to be his friends wife. When I said no he asked if I would wave at him, or marry his other friend. It was oh so romantic...damn Egyptians and they're vast amount of wives!! I also rode a camel (life dream succeeded...), went paragliding and snorkelling. In fact, I did loads. This meant no time for tanning (well, thats my excuse). Oh oh and we got beaten up by young german kids who thought it'd be funny to pull at our bikini strings. It really wasn't funny. Oh God...(typical Germans!) Anyway, I don't care if this is really long because I've been blog-deprived for three  WHOLE  weeks! So now I'm back I'm going to learn to play the guitar and go bodyboarding as much as possible :-D Anyway, I'll shush and post photos because I'm silly like that. Oh, and going on holiday means I must be forgotten? I'd like an ode (maybe a shorter one, we don't have many private jokes :-( ) Oh and decision time should I take either politics or history for A Levels?
