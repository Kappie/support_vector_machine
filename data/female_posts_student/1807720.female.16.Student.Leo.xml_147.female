Then we fed each other a strawberry sundae.  Ok so it's HARD to loose weight though I have done it before.  And I am thinking that maybe genetically I am just not meant to be super thin.  So maybe instead of trying to loose weight I think I will try to maintain it instead.  And you know, be healthy.  Ok I confess I had dessert last night and some chocolate tonight, but it's not like I eat that everyday.  I also eat tons of fruit so yeah that makes up for it.  I didn't get over 80% on the Bio test, but I got 72%.  Even though it's not what I wanted, I don't feel bad for getting a 72% because I know that I did my very best.  I'm thinking that I may have ruined my chances of getting nominated by Swain for habits of mind cause last class before today I feel pressure to not participate a lot because none of the girls wanted to.  I know it was STUPID to not and I realize now, and I got an 85% in the unit instead of a possible 100%.  That is my fault though, my mistake and I have learned from it.  That is what counts.  So for now on I am going to try make it up, because I know that one day can't outweigh all of the other days.  I just pray SOMEONE nominates me.  PLEEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSSEEEEE!!!!!  Sometimes I feel like yelling that so freakin' loud.  Arg, someone needs to see that I WORK MY ASS OFF, in ALL that I do.  Ok so call me crazy, maybe I am.  However, I feel different.  I know everyone feels different and yes being different is good, but just different in how I learn and understand things.  I know I don't fail my classes, or hardly ever assignments (Chem is an exception) but what I don't think people realize is how stressful and frustrating it is trying to finish them, or even trying to understand.  I don't think I am stupid, that's not it, and the reason why my marks are maybe average or higher is because I work so hard.  I am no expert in this area, but I honestly think that I might have like a learning disability or something along those lines.  I've only told that to two people, one thought I was crazy, and then other one didn't but I don't know if I am paranoid of if maybe my instincts are right.  I was reading up on a lot of stuff about it and like a lot I can totally see in myself, except for the underachiement, but I need 120% effort just to do "ok" on things.  Like sometimes I will miss numbers or reverse letters, though it's not a very common occurrence.  However, when I copy from the board and then go back to my notes later I realize that I have either missing words, a sentence, or wrote the same thing twice.  I can read good, but when I finish reading I have no idea what I read, which makes novel study and Shakespeare really difficult.  I usually fail reading comprehension and not on purpose.  The harder I try to pass those tests, the worse I seem to fail, which explains why I am so scared for the English 30 diploma.  I have a hard time understanding directions, and that is especially evident when we do labs.  I hate labs because I never understand how to do them.  I struggle with understanding concepts in just about every area and it usually takes me longer to grasp a concept.  Sometimes I never understand the concept and we just keep going on.  I excel at Drama, and I'm pretty good at sports, but Math, English, Social, and Sciences are difficult.  I do manage to do good in most of them, but firstly it's cause of my hard work.  More then half of the content in social I didn't understand and still don't.  I would do poorly on the M.C. tests, and for the long answers I would not be able to understand the content.  What I had to do was write out the answers previous to the test and then memorize them.  When I would do the long answer I would write what I memorized, but then shortly after I would just forget.  I have this bad habit of forgetting names on things, but I think a lot of people do that.  Often when someone tells me something, shortly after I forget what they just said and I feel bad having to ask them again.    In Elementary I did very poorly and even then Math was especially hard and everyone blamed me for not trying hard enough.  I strongly remember that I couldn't tell time, but I of course can do that now and I recall trying to copy off of people during a math test on money because I didn't know how to count it.  Junior High was also a struggle but somehow I managed to do "ok."  I can do some simple math in my head now, but not a lot, and I still used my fingers to count certain numbers sometimes, but I don't make it very apparent cause if people saw me counting fingers they might look at me a little strange and think I am dumb.  Also it's not that big of a deal because we use calculators for practically everything nowadays.  I don't remember exactly why, but I remember working one-on-one with some lady when I was in grade 2 on math, and I think on math again in gr. 3.  In Elementary they have the resource room, which is were often I would go.  As far as I know I don't have a learning disability, and I think if I told someone else that I thought there was maybe something wrong they might think I am crazy or out of my mind.  I also don't like to admit it, but sometimes on quizzes and stuff I do need extra time.  I mean it takes me longer to do unit tests then most people, and well when someone asks "do you need more time" I usually say "no" because I don't want to admit it.  I like structured things, lessons, just structured ways of doing and learning things.  I think that is just more of my learning preferences though, and well when I color code my notes and underline stuff in my text I seem to to better.  I think forever this is like always going to puzzle me, just wondering about everything.  If I am right or wrong.  Last year I actually used to think I had some kind of brain disorder or something, but then I realized that IS crazy and like totally stupid, and I came to my senses.  Thinking that I have like learning differences or a learning disability I really don't think is stupid.
