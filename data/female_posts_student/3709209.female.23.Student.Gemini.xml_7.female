All ready for some super size this tonight?  okay, so how creepy was our phone call last night? that was R, and I, high on mint oreo blizzards and pecan parfaits, and in anticipation of the coco loco evening ahead of us. needless to say, yesterday was about as much fun I've had fixing my computer in a long time.   It's all smooth sailing from herrre though. Zether II is such a sweet machine - I think I might be in love. def potential marriage material. off the richta!  Although, it took all night. R went home around 8, but then was helping over the phone until 10. My fav convers between reboots:  R: Done loading already!! I still can't get over how lightning speed awesome your machine is. Amazing, it's (bachelor jessie) unbelievable. J:  Yeah, well the high speed internet helps. I don't know how life existed before... R: I don't get high speed out here. (R recently moved to rockland or something for a family-sized home for his wife and 1+1/2 yr old). J: (knowning R likes the comp world/internet/gaming probably just as much as life itself) Wha? Are you serious? Did you know that before you moved out there?! R: yeah J: (shocked) i'm in shock!! Dude, THAT's a tough decision: raising a family or high speed internet. I can't say that I would have come to the same conclusion... R: yeah, well... J: (epiphanied) actually, I guess I've made that decision, and the family-raising lost.   Huh, computers can teach you a lil something abo0t yourself after all.  la, la, la, la, la  Just jamma.  p.s. REEEEWIIIIINNDDDD....Cutie, cutie make sure you move your booty...
