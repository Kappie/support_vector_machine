I’ve never had any problems like cavities or anything.  I just don’t like the dentist office.  You can call me an anti-dentite.  But today’s check-up was like all the others.  I went and laid in the chair.  The hygienists talks to me, while cleaning my teeth.  I answer her w/ a few gargles.  The dentist comes in, checks my teeth, and tells me they look great.  I get my toothbrush and leave.    On another note.  I just got my car back w/ new tires.  My dad is the best dad in the whole world.  He went and got the tires put on for me b/c I didn’t have time to do it myself due to classes all day yesterday.  Plus, I told him to just get me 2 b/c that’s all I needed.  However, when I got my car back today, it had 4 new tires on it.  Meaning, my dad helped me out and paid for the other 2 tires.  Plus, it helped that we were able to get a rebate that was the price of about one tire.   Anyway, today’s been a good day…..no cavities and new tires.  Now I get to go take a nap in class, then off to cook at the DBH.
