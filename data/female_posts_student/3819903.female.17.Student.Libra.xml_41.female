The fact that I had to drag myself out of bed at 6:15 in the first place, was enough alone for complaint! So, this tournament consists of members, who are all over 50 or 60, inviting 3 guests to play a best ball. So these ladies, are the socialite elite! The snobby, trophy wives who didn't know what golf was until they married the rich man and said..."oh! I will play golf there honey...can you teach me?!" Oh man its a scene right out of The Stepford Wives... they are the worlds perfect, non-working, bimbos! So... then round in general, was pretty damn good! The whole round I was staying around even or bogeying a couple here and there. It was a good day, shot 89, and thats a pretty damn good score for Bluemound! The greens are horribly fast, and the bunkers are reminiscent to those of St. Andrews in Scotland! So, I had a couple of bad sand shots, but otherwise was hitting the ball straight the whole day! On the 6th hole, there was a  long drive contest  and the marker was pretty far, but I knew I could probably pass it.  So I tee up and smack, and the wind takes it left, and was clearly farther than the length to surpass the "record," but because I wasnt in the fairway, it doesn't count.  So, at the beginning of the round, the group was given a "One Mulligan Pass," that only One person could use, so my aunts and grandma said I could use it to try and beat it.  So I head back to the tee, and take my time, line up right, and smack the ball... it goes straight down the fairway and stops...  one YARD behind the marking stick!!!  and I'm not being sarcastic, it was literally one yard right behind the divot of the first lady!  ugh! So....the weather... was beautiful for golf! Sunny, around70, a bit of wind... I couldn't complain! It was a great day!  So the lunch that followed the 18 holes, was horrible, no joke! It was a chilled peach soup (who the fuck eats peach soup? And wouldn't a chilled soup be equivilent to yogurt?!), Salmon Salad (which I didn't like so I asked for the Chicken Salad instead, which is easy for them, cause they always have it! The Salmon got bad reviews from everyone at our table!), and the dessert kicked Boo-tay! It was Brownie-Ala-Mode...damn good! So, 1x3 isn't bad.  So...after my ridiculously long day on the greens, I headed over the the grandma's to take a dip in the pool.  Stayed for a while and came home to play some Slow-Pitch...I actually made the game this week!  So the game went well, and I played some First Base, and batted pretty hard; ailed one right a Bridget, and was safe!!!  So, we are 2 time League Champions!  Pretty Cool!  But, some of us play in the All-Star game next week, and then we play in a Championship game!  Fun Stuff!  Well, I have been up since 6 o' clock-ish, and I am sooo damn tired that I am off to beddy bye... Plans for tomorrow: Unknown!  I'm Outie Like a Belly Button everyone... G'nite!
