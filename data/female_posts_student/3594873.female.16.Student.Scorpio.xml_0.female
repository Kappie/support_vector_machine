Speaking of living, you know, I’m sure you’re all aware of the fact that there are seven characteristics an organism has to have/ perform in order to be considered alive. They are: responding to stimuli in the environment, …………….(skip the other 5 characteristics), and breathing. Now, you know those people who are on respirators? Are they considered to be alive; because in reality, they are not the ones actually performing the function of breathing. I feel really horrible for all their relatives who have to go through so much pain, but I’m just curious. Are they considered living? And now for our little story about life…  The story takes place in nowhere. A place very familiar to lots of persons- especially nobody. Nobody who does nothing all the time in this nowhere. Night and day- nothing.  But this is the story the way I heard it straight from somebody’s mouth, and I can’t change one bit of it.   The story begins with crying and ends with crying. The middle is laughter. Like life: the first moment we breathe, we cry because of the world we have just entered and the one that we have just left. And when we are dead, our relatives cry. But in the middle, we laugh.   If I have gotten your attention now, if I have sucked it from you, inspired you, then nothing. I don’t care. Because if I told you, well then, it would be a something, and this story- this story is a nothing.   Now for some serious thoughts: Those people at the airport. You know who I’m talking about, right? Those serious men who stand and take your passport from you, like it’s a bomb, those men. They open up to your picture and begin to stare at it. They have to concentrate very hard- their head turns from the picture on the passport to your face and back. Like a dog whose shaking its head to get rid of water. Now, these people bother me. They irritate me. I mean, do they have some kind of make up/ disguise education? Are they very talented artistic people or something? I mean, somebody trying to escape or use a different passport isn’t going to be stupid. He/ she is going to transform themselves so that they look exactly like the picture. And these people are dressed up like police officers…(over here, at least). What’s with that? What kind of a police officer gets stuck with that job? Looking at pictures all the day. “Oh, look!! I found a criminal!” “I swear its me. I swear, I just got a pimple attack, but that is me.” “Get out here, and have a good, safe trip.” Who needs these stupid police officers?!  Oh! Since I wrote that the police officers look like dogs, I just wanted to say, that all of you people are dogs. Yes, you are my dogs….seriously, since everyone goes like “dogs are so lovable. They’re a man’s best friend. They are loyal and sweet. They are so affectionate”, if they are all that, then why do people get insulted when someone says “hey b****?” Shouldn’t we think of it as a compliment? And, why is it the female dog is an insult? What’s so bad about a female dog? Why is their name taken to mean something horrible?   Speaking of weird language and stuff: What is with the expression: time on your hands: if I had time on my hands,  I would go and wash my hands, rinse off all the bad times, cleanse off all the embarrassing times…..erase all the times that when I think about them, I shiver and can feel waves heaving and rolling in my stomach.  Times that if I think too much about, I feel regret that matures into a full grown tree, and I wish that I could just go back and change it… yeah, if I had time on my hands, then I would wash it off, so I wouldn’t have time on my hands anymore.  Oh hey, if you guys have some time on your hands, comment on the post :P :P.   What I just wrote reminded me of something else I thought about before. You know how I wrote I would erase all the bad times. Well, I wouldn’t really because I don’t know how an eraser works. I truly have no clue to the mysterious functional capabilities of an eraser……..i don’t even want to think about how an ATM machine works. No wait, I do. How does it give us money back? How does it know how much to give? I know it has to do with electronics. That scary world! I don’t want to know anymore...natasha, cut the engineering lecture. I said I don’t want to know.   Natasha is my imaginary friend. She thinks you guyz have some mental issues. :D But I’ll tell you who has  real, major problems… a dentist. They have major issues. I mean, who grows up wanting to stick their head in somebody’s mouth and look at all the disgusting stuff stuck there. That’s if they even make it there…someone’s bad breath might just be a toxic chemical that surrounds the dentist chocking him/ her and preventing him/ her from breathing until the dentist turns red and finally departs from this world. Then to look at all of those brilliant white teeth that have been stained by coffee, soda, and everything else a dentist hates until they have become yellow. Next, the cavities. You see where I’m getting at?   And dentists are the biggest liars. They all say, “Open up your mouth. It’s not going to hurt you a bit.” Excuse me, if it looks like a drill, sounds like a drill…well than it is a drill that’s going into my mouth. But hey, yeah, it doesn’t hurt…actually you can’t feel anything if you get those shots that don’t let you feel; (I can’t seem to spell it) But oh my jumping, sprouting, spinach balls. Have you ever gotten one of those? Those shots are the most painful thing, ever. I swear, it feels like somebody is pushing something down into your mouth and the pain just goes directly to your brain.   That is if you have a brain? Gotta go…its time to save the world/ or maybe it was take over the (Hey, don’t tell them!!)
