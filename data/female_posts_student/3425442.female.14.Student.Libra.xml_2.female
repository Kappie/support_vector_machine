But anyway we got to know each other a bit better ^_^ he was a pretty cool guy and he was in love with my friend. He really liked her but whenever she would try to go up to him with his friends near by he would run away. ^^; it was funny tho. But one day I was comming from school and since...be back g2g somehwere really quick. alrighty I'm back ..hehehe sorry oh and since my house was in front of the school I would just cross over and go home but one time I was crossing over my nieghbor and his friend which is nickname is Gohan ^^ and my nieghbors name is Wolfy...they wouold go all the way around and take the sidewalk were the lady with the orange vest would tell you to stop and go but any way he lives to the left of me meaning he was was walking towards my way..and I was getting down from the hill thingy ^^ and then I here my name being called out it was Gohan ^^ and so I turned to see what they wanted and hen they each point at each other and say he likes you. I was just suprised I mean who wouldn't be ^^ and so I was so nervous and shy back then that I juist smiled and walked into my house...I didn't know what to do. Later I kinda got the impression that they liked me. He would be home before I was and by he I mean Goten ^^  Goten would be home already and I would be walking home everyday and he would play this song and sing it and he would just look at me and smile ^^ I'm a cheerful happy girl so I would smile too but he would play that song by simple plan " addicted" and "I'll do anything" ^^ I laer started liking Gohan every since that one time comming home from school made me think about if it was true or not.Now I'm in the 9th grade and still have that crush and I'm not as shy anymore Yeah I mean I have had other little crushes but I keep getting back to Gohan. I try not to think about him as much coz he has a gf and I dun't want to screw things up for him but he's always saying that he and his gf are having problems and it's hard to please  her and when he does it's not him. I hardly talked to him but now through my friend I see him now and then but I still...*gasp* I'm using this as a way to let out my feeligs inside. I finally revealed my crush to one of my friends since I needed to talk to someone about it...she's helping me figure out things..She also thinks that he still likes me coz he's always looking at me and smiles everytime he sees me and things that you can notice. but I guess that most of my story but I'll post up later whats been going on latley...Untill then  BYE ^_^
