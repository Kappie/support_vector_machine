Ok, ok. I know. I've been wretched about posting. The problem is  (aside from my obsession with the kittens)  there's really just been too much going on. I get started on a post and then real life intrudes and I have to go take care of things. The good news is that we got two more boxes unpacked last night, courtesy of an ex-neighbor and new friend Cynthia, along with 3  (big, they were really  big , ok???)  blue bins of stuff. Which leaves only 5 boxes left, ignoring the insane number of boxes of books that I have. But those will be easy to unpack. And the cat stuff got moved from what will be the permanent spots to our bedroom because, according to the lady who's keeping them, they have an easier transition if they start out in a small room and then get to go to a bigger room before they have free run of the house. Which makes sense because it's going to be a big change to go from 17 other kittens in the room to just the two of them for our whole apartment. So they start in a small room with us which means all their stuff (food, litter box, water...) are in our bedroom, too. Then they can go back to what will be their normal spots.  (This is massively boring to everyone else, isn't it? Sorry...)  Anyway, the point of all that is, real life intrudes, yet again. I have at least 7 different posts started, things I want to think about, talk about, write out, and figure out... But they'll likely be put on hold for another week or so as we get used to having kittens and they get used to having us. :)
