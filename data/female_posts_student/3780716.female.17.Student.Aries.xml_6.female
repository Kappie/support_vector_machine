I can't wait until school is over. 1 MORE DAY! Thank goodness! Well, yesterday I went with Nessa to Panda's Express and then to Old Navy. I saw the cutest shorts. I had to get them and I did! They are super cute. They aren't short...they come up to my knees I think, but when you see them, they are ugly, but I guess it's when you put them on they look adorable! I like them! I dont know what I am gonna do for 4th yet! I probaly will go with Naomi! I don't want her to go alone to Sea World. I really don't wanna be with my mom! I hope I am not stuck with her either! I have no idea of what I am gonna do when this week is over. I don't know whether to go back to Lytle or to go with my dad. I still need to decide! But all I know is that I am NOT gonna be here with my mom! Definitely not! I wanna go out and fun right now! I have some cute outfits that I feel like showing off right now! But I can't do it when I am under this roof!! Haha! Anyways-I wanna see all my old friends. I miss everyone! Man-I cannot believe that Lindsay's mom died last Saturday! I mean like everyone was kinda expecting it, but wow! I mean she is really not here now! It is so sad and I am going to the funeral on Saturday! I wonder how she is taking it! I hate going to funerals because they are just so sad! But, I feel that I need to go! I was close to them and I have known them for a long itme. I think it would only be right if I went! So, yah-I got to talk to Krysten the other day. I hadn't talked to her in forever and I was just so scared that she was mad at me! Thank goodness she wasn't! I really can't stand my step sis either. I mean she is so fake! I am glad I haven't seen them. I get mad when I think about them and everything! So yuppers- I feel like going to see "White Chicks". I wonder if that was a good movie or not. Man-o-Man...I wanna go shopping! Haha-I always want to though, so it really isn't a big deal. I need a job so that I can get money and go get some really cute clothes! It's on the to-do list! I wanna learn to play my guitar too! That would be so exciting! Maybe I should trying doing that soon! Okay so yah-I have to go...sorry this may be boring to whoever is reading this...I promise that my life will get interesting...haha! Luv ya MUCHO!   M  x  U  o  A  x  H  o
