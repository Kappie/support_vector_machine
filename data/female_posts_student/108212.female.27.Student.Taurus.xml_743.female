I think you need to find another R___T movie...  Spooky story about the White Lady.  My son Andy, when he was two or three, saw "blue ghosts" in our old house in Detroit.  They didn't scare him, and they were around all the time.  We did some research, and found out the first owner died there.  His wife sold it and moved out, but may have died by the time Andy said he saw them (she sold in '79, we bought in '83, Andy turned 2 in '86).  He tried to point out the ghosts to Kim, but she couldn't see them.  We sold the house in '87.
