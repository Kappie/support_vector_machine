I'm going to have a massive paycheck this week except, I wont be there to pick it up because of Washington D.C. Anyway, after I got home, I went out shopping with my mom and we picked up my brother so he could be here for Easter. I got a new cell phone which is aweeeesssooommmeee! :)  I also got these really cool pants, a cute little backpack thing, headphones, and a new phone for my room since my old one broke. Good times. :)  Then, today I had to work too so...um, woo? Easter dinner was nice and now, I'm going to go home with my mom and brother so I can see my brother's  kitty. Plus, I want to get myself some starbucks on the way home. Some hot chocolate. Don't ask me why I want hot chocolate, I just have a hankerin'. Heh. Funny word. Anyway, I'm off. Lots to do.
