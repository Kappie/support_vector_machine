( espescially with his shirt off ;-) )today i went to the lake, wasn't to eventful. the pool at the country club opened! i didn't go, but everyone was there so that sucks.  uh well i'm pretty sure that's bout it.. oh and when i was at the lake, i got a stain on my new skirt, i guess i should be used to it. i am so freaking clumsy! sucks for me!
