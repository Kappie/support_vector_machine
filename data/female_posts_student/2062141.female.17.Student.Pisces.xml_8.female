I don't have a car. My dad has to take it cause his car will explode, or some silly excuse like that. Silly dad. Be a man and drive the smoky explody car. :P Hopefully I'll get it back soon, but for now I'll just enjoy it, and catch up with Cara on the bus. YAAAY tomorrow is a half-day!!! I'm so happy, cause you know why? We're goin' to Seattle, which we haven't done since the last day of school.   But yeah it'll be a fun filled afternoon of getting lost on buses and getting our socks laughed at by black people (LOL). And lying on the floor of the bus station. We rock. Lol we're such dorks. I love it. I love you! I JUST FREAKING LOVE EVERYTHING! Today I felt like I walked around with a smile on my face all day. Why am I in a good mood? I don't even know. Maybe you know. I think it's time for song lyrics! Josh you still have my Train CD! I miss it! I love it! I'm gonna give ya excerpts of my favorite lyrics from it... (btw the one up top is one too)  Your Every Color  I can see the red, white and free in you You light the night up like the moon And underneath your clouds, I see the blue   You're hopeless 'cause you tell the truth The stars are jealous of your shine If you were mine There's not a thing I wouldn't do   OOO- I love your every color OOO- I love your everything You wear the day around you Like it's yours to stay around you Maybe I could stay around you too If that's alright with you   All American Girl (LOVE IT)  Tell me what it's like to be the house on the hill The number one diet pill And tell me what it's like to be the one and only All American Girl   Now I bet you won't say you get crazy Or that you don't shave your legs When you're lazy Or that you're just like everybody else in the world You just got lucky, that's all
