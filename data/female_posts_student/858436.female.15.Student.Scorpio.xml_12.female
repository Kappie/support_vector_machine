Ate really good hamburgers. Hehe. Chilled most of the night. Her mom has the best dip ever. I ate so much food I think I gained ten pounds. Haha. We can't wait to get our nails done. :-)  I love Red Fusion. :-D  Came home. Did homework. Chilled. My breath smells like Doritos. Haha. I still have Theology. Better go do that.
