I have to admit, I was afraid that things were going to be really ackward, but that's completely normal, right?! Haha. But yeah, my parents like him and he things my family is cool, so everything's all good.  Then, on Sunday, I mustered enough courage to call him. And finally yesterday he sat at my lunch table. So, basically, I feel a lot more comfortable with things. Yeah.   Tennis sectionals were today, and in a way I am glad that the tennis season is done and over with, because the whole match thing was frustrating (my record ended up being 10-6.... not bad). I am pretty sure that I am playing through the winter at the fairgrounds, and that starts mid-October and goes all the way through April, which if you ask me, is AWESOME. I'm going to be further skilled by next summer, and hopefully will be able to play 2nd singles well.  I got home today, and saw that Marie called and left a message on my machine. Do I want to call her back? Because I know all I am going to hear about is how wonderful of a friend Jessie is. And that drives me up a freaking wall, because I have totally lost her. She has gotten so darn full of herself, that it drives me crazy! How does anybody honestly expect me to listen to her rantings and ravings every day. FOR ONCE, just for once, I'd love to have her ask me "How was your day, Jennica?"
