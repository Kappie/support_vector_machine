Mom won't be coming home tonight, mother's day has been ruined for the both of them, yet they still argue. I just sat there soaking it up, not sure how anyone could fight over dinner like that and thanking myself for being the type of person who would rather be slapped in the face than fight with someone I love. I watched this lizard crawl across the brick and stop. He fanned out his coral colored neck and bobbed his head up and down, hoping his performance in pink will be enough to attract a mate. I wish life was as simple as the lizards', that all I had to do were follow my instincts and hope for the best, that i could expect certain things. But people are not like lizards, we have forgotten how to follow our instincts and that they're always right. We run willy-nilly all over the place, unsure of what we'll do next and truly, not worried about it or what we hurt in the process. We don't do what's right, nobody agrees on anything, we are worse than animals.   We simply cannot live.  Happy goddamn Mother's Day.
