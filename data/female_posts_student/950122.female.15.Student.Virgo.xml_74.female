I dunno, just feeling a bit tense right now.  Anyway, my parents brought my MP3 player to some shops, and it can't be fixed. Here at least. Ergh.. At least I told them about it. I haven't told them about my wallet tho. I'm still hoping I'll find it. >_> Plus I don't want to get in trouble.  Meh, not much has happened lately.  Mirodo>> Eeek! It's taking so long for us to reply your to letter! x_x I hope you'll start feeling better soon...
