If babies could talk at birth, what do you think would be the first thing they say?  "OMG COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE IT EASY!! THAT'S MY HEAD AND I INTEND ON KEEPING IT!   2. If you could read minds, would you enjoy knowing what people were thinking, or would breaching their privacy bother you? Would you consider it a burden to know everyone's innermost thoughts?  Ahh blackmail material.... Actually, yes it would bother me.   3. Do you think you could survive in the Middle Ages?  I could adapt yeah. But if you see a picture of a girl drawing a picture of a cell phone in the sand you will know that I got there...   4. If you knew as a little kid what you know now, what one situation would you choose to do differently?  I would choose to keep all my real friends instead of settling with the crap friends I have had in the past 3 years. (This does not include most ppl, so don't have a cow...)   5. If you were given the choice to know exactly when, how, and where you would die, would you choose to know?  And if you did choose to know, would you try and cheat death? I would be like "Tell me, tell me" and then I'd be like "Nah, I was just playing.."   6. If you got pregnant (guys, just play along) before you were ready, what would you do? Would you ask your parents for help, or keep it from them?  I don't play with my life like that. I know what I want to do with my life and I'm not going to get pregnant until Im done. I don't want my kids to grow up thinking that I don't love them because I didn't get to finish my life. It's not a cool thing to do.   7. Do you think you would enjoy being the opposite sex for the rest of your life? Being a dude for the rest of my life?!  Ugh.. I love dudes.. but I could not be them.   8. If someone came up with an elixir that made you immortal, would you take it? If you would, what would you do with all the extra time? if you wouldn't, well, why not?  I wouldn't because you would have to see everyone that you loved, die. And everyone that you will come to love, will die, And so your ultimately alone for the rest of you immortal life.   9. Does the thought of being a vampire appeal to or disgust you?  I already get my daily dose of iron yo.   10. If you were given magical powers to do just one thing, what would you do (besides giving yourself unlimited magickal powers)?  One thing? I think I would make someone smile. I'd make sure there was no more hurt in their life ever again.    11. If you could go back into history and change one thing only, what would you change? What do you think the repercussions of the change will be?  I wouldn't be able to change it. I would know that.. even if I tried, something would happen so it either happened or something equally as bad happend to compensate.  Well, that was informing wasn't it?? I hope this answers all of anyone's questions. If you have anymore just let me know.    I don't mind spending everyday, out on your corner in the pouring rain.
