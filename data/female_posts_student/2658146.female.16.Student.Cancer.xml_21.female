She does so much for me, and even though the things she does may seem small or take little effort, they mean a lot to me, and she has really changed my life on many occasions.  Take for instance, anime. Even though it was Abby who introduced me to this genre of entertainment, Monica was the one who really inspired me to draw. If it weren't for her drawing alongside me, I probably wouldn't be as good as I am. Heck, I probably would have given up on drawing completely.  Then there's me and Dave. She was the one who got us together (Nick gets no credit whatsoever, he got us to meet but he never followed through, so no biscut for him). She was the one who beat the true feelings out of me, then beat them into Dave so he'd ask me out. She's lectured him a lot for me too. If it weren't for her, I don't think we would have lasted this long.  Not convinced yet? How about the time she rand a mile and a half to my house just to give me a hug? We've had some good times together, and for that I'm grateful. I really appreciate her being there for me, and for being my friend. Thank you Monica, for everything you've done for me. You're like a sister to me, even when you're at school trying to strangle me. I love you Monica, don't you ever leave me.  (For all you perverts out there, I'm straight, so don't get any wise ideas)   Current Mood:  Loved
