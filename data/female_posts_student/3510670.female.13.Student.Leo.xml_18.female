My favorite part there is when Harry figured out that Serious Black wasn't the man who traidored his father, cause it was Peter (The mouse of Ron) So, he decided to free Serious from the jail.. And save him from the penalty that the councilor gave him! So, at the end Harry found the answers to his question!
