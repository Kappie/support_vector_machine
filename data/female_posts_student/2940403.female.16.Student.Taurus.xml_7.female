    
       Want to vegetate.  Want to meditate. "Time to feed the monster."  Girls with their tacky hair.  Gross highlights.  Showing how truly shallow they are.  Painted faces.  Orange, dried complexions in the middle of winter, see how much time they have to spend in the tanning beds.  Colored contacts, hiding their true depth perception.  Underweight... or overweight.  Fake.  Why the disguise?  What are they hiding from?  What's the point when everyone knows it's not the true 'them'?  Shallow, attention craving whores.   You're a stranger So what do I care? You vanish today Not the first time I hear All the lies  -perfect circle, A Stranger
