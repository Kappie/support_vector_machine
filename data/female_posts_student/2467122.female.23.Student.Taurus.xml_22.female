I am incredibly stressed out, but that's okay- only 2 more days until Spring Break.  Wonderful- Spring Break, or another reason to mope because I have no money to do something fun (or someone fun who is willing to spend time and money with me).  Life is so sucky right now... Just when you think things can't get any crappier... SURPRISE!!!    If I don't figure out what the cause of all of my stomach aches are, even if it isn't good news, I am seriously going to freak out!!!  I would rather know something bad than not know anything at all.  I can't say that I would be shocked if it was stress related...   Only a few more days until I can just take it easy.  I will be counting down the hours.  Maybe I'll even do something fun (if I can scrounge up the cash) to celebrate my successful completion of half of this semester.  Or I will just sleep, that's equally as good at this point.  Well, wish me luck on my history test.  Lord knows that I am incapable of doing well without luck and plenty of prayers!   *me*
