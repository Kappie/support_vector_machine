So what if they put him on the top of their list, a great performance is a great performance.  The fact that this elderly, incarcerated character is so scary is a testimate to Hopkins performance.  Few villains could last matched up to this remorseless, super id of a character who revels in his evilness.  Much of what I have to say about Catwoman/The Joker will be addressed in comments I’m saving until we’ve both posted our villains, but let me make a few points.  One, that Catwomans flirtation with turning good makes her a more compelling villain.  We want good to overcome evil and nothing is more tragic than seeing a character, particularly one as intriguing as Catwoman, come so close only to stay bad.  Secondly Darth Vader is too great to put on your list, but doesn’t he ultimately go good by killing the emperor and saving the galaxy.  If renouncing your evil ways (or even considering it) knocks you down on the villain spectrum, shouldn’t Darth be held to the same standard as Catwoman?  Finally Jack Nicholson’s performance was hammy over acting.  Tim Burton’s dark, moody adaptation of the comic book was full of somber themes on loneliness and loss and the Joker was nothing more than an circus size distraction.  They say there’s an exception to every rule, so if the villain is always the more interesting character to play, than  Face/Off  is the anomaly.  Yes I appreciated the performances and felt they complemented each other, but the villain seemed one dimensional in comparison to the more fleshed out protagonist.  Nicolas Cage brought a great soulfulness and sense of melancholy to the role, so the film lagged every time he was off screen.  Bill the Butcher is a good guess, but wrong.  When formalizing my villain list I thought of Bill but immediately crossed him off.  There is no straight line between good and evil in Scorsese’s underapprecitated masterpiece.  Bill is shown to be a bad guy, a very bad guy, but he’s not the villain.  Scorsese is too brilliant of a director to have a simple hero-villain relationship, which is why he creates individual characters rather than plugging in typical or traditional roles.  I’ll let you chew on that and give you one more guess before I reveal my number one.
