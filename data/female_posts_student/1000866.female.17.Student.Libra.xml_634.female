I think my head's going to spin off into another dimension. Although that'd probably be pretty cool looking, I wouldn't be able to see it since it'd be my head.   The musical itself was really good too. It was very funny and I loved the music. I think it's my favorite one in the three I've been to. I liked it better than Man of La Mancha  definitely.   Today, work was ok. I got my review and they just basically said, "good job." It was like, three minutes. no big thing. I'm not fired.  Is that really a good thing though...?  Anyway, I'm off to do some stuff and work on my W.E.W. paper and then later on I'm going over to Bryan's to work on our final project for W.E.W.. Good times.
