So glad I can nap in the privacy of the cubicle even if the desk is hard and the chair causes me to sit with unnaturally good posture. Ow, sniffle, whine, cough. I'm seriously worried about driving home today. I'm on a combo of Dayquil and Advil Cold and Sinus. I don't feel very non-drowsy, as a matter of fact, I'm leaning toward hallucinating.
