As I was preparing to leave, I saw a Maroon5 truck parked in front of my house. I saw Adam Levine walk out with spotlights hovering onto him. I think I shouted... "I love you ADAM!"        I still have it with the Maroon 5 fevah...         Then, as I was leaving, I was sitting in a cocoon. It was supposed to be my cabin. I ouldn't quite understand what was under my cocoon... sand or cement. It felt like cement but it was supposed to be sand. Then the cocoon flipped. I went out and told my mom, while holding the cocoon in my hands... THIS SIMPLY CAN'T work. Then I woke up realizing that I'm late.        Now, it's free cut again. hehehe. I can't just quite imagine why our teacher won't teach us... I think he's on extended vacation... He earned it anyway handling little demons like us...grin again.     Anyway, I want to tell about my new installation on my write-on journal. Extremely random thoughts, fiction writing using a first person's POV... a story of my future self... my future rich self to be exact. grin    I'll type it down when I have time... If I get at it... (wink wink)
