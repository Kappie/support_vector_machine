Both studying for history test. >O  Like I said, I can't wait until Friday~ I can't wait until tomorrow when I get to see him again! Yayness! Hee hee~   I can honestly say I love everything about him! I don't know what in particular, but he's just... iunno~ Indescribable. The best things in this world are indescribable. Ever heard that? Like... sunsets... the Grand Canyon... you can never fully describe it... the best way is to experience it. The best thing that's ever happened to me is my alien~ I can't describe just what I love about Nima, but I know I do. [don't you forget either]   Ahh~ Freaking out 'cos of History Test~ Ooh, I wanna get on Dragon Fire when we get to Wonderland! It's right by the door and crap... ^^ Hee heezZ~!   Hmm... bringing back memories about last year. I went to Wonderland with Brian Kim, Jae, and Rachel last year. It was a lot of fun. Jae and BK had to pick me up and put me onto the rollercoaster 'cos I was so chicken! I'm glad they did though. 'Cos now, I'm not scared of 'em! Hee heezZ~! Yayness! We spent an awful lot of time in the arcade 'cos of Jae and BK last year. -__-" Haha! That's where Rach and I got out blue sticky spikey things too! They're a lot of fun. I have a mark on my wall 'cos of it. -__-" Blahness~  I should be careful at Wonderland... the U on my bracelet is coming off a bit so yeah... always getting caught on stuff. Blahhh~ The important thing is that I've got Nima~ "If I've got everything but not you, then it all means nothing to me." Trueness~   I love you.
