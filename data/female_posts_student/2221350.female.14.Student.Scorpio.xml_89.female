Maybe.  checked out of school on Thursday and went and ate the best crawfish I've ever eaten in my entire life, which is saying something since I've eaten quite a few. The whole eating-of-the-crawfish I find very... Carnal. Something about ripping in half and sucking the meat out of an animal makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. Since they were so good I had more for dinner that night and then more for dinner Friday night. W00t!  after the crawfish lunch we went to mimi's to finish work on her yard. Mom made me saw all the limbs off of the trees, which wouldn't have bothered me had I been wearing a helmet! Yeah, that's right! I went up to start sawing and the whole fucking limb fell on my head! Although it kinda hurt at the time, it's pretty funny now.  on Friday I didn't have to go to school. So what exactly did I do all day? I don't really remember. I know I played grotesque amounts of Sims((which is great by the way)) and then I errr...  Saturday is also an unimportant blur ASIDE FROM my dearest darling fluffy. Oh fluffy, how I miss thee! How, you, in short-lived glory, changed us all! My favorite squamate! Ok so here's the story: mom went over to beau's house and he had had a party and as a joke some of his friends put this snake in his bedroom and he was like freaking out so mom called me and was like what do we do and I was like get him to the light and she was like ok and then Saturday morning she brought the snake to the house and she said his name was fluffy and I was like he's not very fluffy and she was like I know it's irony and then we decided he was a Louisiana pine snake so we let him go in the woods and I was like noooo I love him and I wanna keep him and mom was like nooo he's a wild animal so I was like fine. So ends the story of fluffy, snake o' the woods and friend to us all.   so now it's Sunday, and believe me, I've got plenty to bitch about.   we can start with this morning. I was dragged out of bed, forced into nice clothes and soon we were on our way to... You know it's coming... CHURCH. BAPTIST NAZI HORRIBLE CHURCH! HOLY HELL!   before I launch into that, has anyone besides me ever kind of let their mind wander while they were listening to music and come up with really strange stuff? And then once you associate that image with that song you can't think about anything else when you hear that song? And then you tell someone else about it and they have the same image in their heads as you do when you hear that song? Today I was listening to Maroon 5 in the car and I was half asleep and all I saw was this lady in a wedding dress flying on  broom. And then I heard 7 nation army and all I could think about was alligators! And so then I asked mom about the song and she was like "all I ever think about when this comes on is alligators!" it was weird!  another thing I saw on the way to CHURCH((which was an hour away from the house)) was an actual church that had been turned into a gas station. I thought it was really... Odd.   so we get to CHURCH and it's just as fucked up as usual. All bleach blondes dressed like newscasters and everyone looking like they are watching a pleasant TV show, not really caring but not hating it. So first we sing, and sing and sing and sing and pray and pray and pray and then this preacher launches into this stupid sermon. Now I may have said this already but I'll say it again, if ANYBODY has the GOD thing wrong, it's the Baptist Nazis. Throughout his entire spew((which just happened to be accompanied by a brochure)) I felt like someone was trying to sell me a used car. The only thing I learned by wasting four hours of my life is that preachers talk in small circles and I just really hate that church. First he pissed me off by calling the Muslims ignorant, which is really sad and although I'm not a Muslim it was crappy of him to claim his religion superior to all the others and pitying their stupidity. Then the second thing he did was end his "sermon" by saying, and I quote, "even if you don't believe, you should come to church anyway and not risk going to hell"  perhaps I am being a hypocrite by bashing this particular religion, but when I'm dragged into that establishment by the hair, I will bash until their heads spin. How could anyone with any sense believe some of the bullshit that's in the bible?!?! I think all these people interpret the book as horribly as they can.   yes boys and girls, a man did get swallowed by a whale and then spit up! Cough/you're all going to hell/cough. fuck!  on the way home from CHURCH we passed a giant can of beer. It was funny.  once we escaped the religious crowd I took all my frustrations out on a box of peeps. I loooove peeps, I mean, really loooove them. So I spent the rest of the afternoon at uncle mike's house, I love uncle mike, he's the best.   "When you have a fat friend there's no such thing as a seesaw.
