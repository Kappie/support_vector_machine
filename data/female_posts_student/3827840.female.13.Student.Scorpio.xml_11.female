If you have a crush on him, why dont you try talking to him and getting to know him betterif all goes well you two will form a friendship, and who knows where things could go from there!?! If you are already friends with the guy you should tell him how you feel, however before you do that you need to decide whats more important to you, a friendship with this guy or a relationship. Sometimes when you take a friendship to the next level things between you two are never the same again, but if you have one of those friendships that survive though anything then go for it!      urlLink Does He Like You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
