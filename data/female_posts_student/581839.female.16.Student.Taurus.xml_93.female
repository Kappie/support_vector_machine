Margaret is out having lunch. i asked if she was taking the missionaries and she said no, but i don't believe her. i then asked her if she was lying to me and she said no, and she said that she had never lied to me. HA thats a joke. Antoinette called today to see how i was doing, and i thought that was very nice of her. She wanted to know why i wasn't at school, and i explained that i was sick. i still don't know if i should go tommorow. i'm very torn.  margaret=confusing Mary just told me she called all depressed like. i never know with her, because she won't talk to me, and she hides too often to find out if anything is wrong. for all i know, she's in her room listening to creepy music, lighting candles, and writing poetry. creepy www.capitalistmafia.blogspot.com=cool just talked to mary again. she's like my physciatrist, without a day to day talking/emailing with her, it's hard. she knows lots of stuff, so i try and listen. this time i was complaining about being a doormat. i used to like a lot of people, and the longer their gone, the more i realize how mean they've been to me, and how many bloody favours i do for them but don't get in return, and how rude they can be, and how they disregard rules, and how they don't realize how their words affect people. you know? i'm bloody sick of talking about them, i'm bloody sick of putting up with the junk they tell me, and how RUDE they are to me a lot of the times. sure it's great when i get a day when theyre nice, but 89% of the time, they treat my like a load of rubbish. ah, the beauty of realizing this, is such a great thing. thank goodness for breaks.
