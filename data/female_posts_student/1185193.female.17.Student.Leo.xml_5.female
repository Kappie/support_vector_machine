I mean, like what set off fireworks in Jack's head when she said it?  When Marshall recovered the tape recorder from Sark's airplane transport, they picked up a transmission of Sark making a phone towards the end.  And he said the same words-- "Not if I see you first, love."  I am literally jumping up and down in my seat and clapping my hands right now!!  Do you know what this means?  Jack suspects Lauren as being the mole working for the Covenant.  Which means she will be caught...which means Vaughn will break up with her...which means Sydney and Vaughn will finally be reunited!!!!!!  Don't you love how it all works out in the end?!  Oh, the excitement!  *sigh of relief*  Anyways, for a drastic change of subject, this afternoon I had an uncontrollable hunger for Jelly Belly Sours.  Have you ever eaten them?  My mouth is watering just thinking about them!  So I made a trip down to Long's just to get a little bag of them.  Mmmm...sweetness for the soul.  Those little glossy, colorful, sweet melons are incredibly delicious, and everyone should try them.  Once again, they're called Jelly Belly Sours--at Long's--in the candy aisle--for $1.99 (or .89, I was too overcome by their juicy goodness that price doesn't matter :)
