I got my first par at Royal Park on the third hole (the rock one) which was very exciting, although it wasn't my first par ever because I got that on one of the holes in the back nine at Fitzroy Gardens last sunday.  Then we got to the U-turn hole, hole seven I think, and John hit the base of the sign between the two compulsories, which means you take one shot from your score, and he got an albatross at that hole.  Two holes later, at the short one where there's a choice to go left, right or through the trees, everyone got a birdie - even me, my very first birdie!  Everyone even did pretty well on the next hole, the zig zag one.  Hole 12 and its the hero hole.  I tried to play it safe but got stuck on the wrong side of the garden.  My first hammer hit a tree and fell into the garden, so I dropped a shot, but I got my second one over the garden and only got a bogie.  At this stage I was only on +11, and since my PB was +20 I was feeling pretty good at this stage.  Second last hole and I missed the lamppost so I went to take my mulligan.  At five I had go to my disc, but my foot slipped and I fell on my arse and was laughing way to hard to get back to the tee by ten, so I dropped a shot and got a double bogie on the hole.  I was still feeling good because I figured I could throw my disc in the water 4 times and still beat my personal best.  I tried to play it safe, but my throw was wayward and rolled back into the garden behind the tree of the first hole.  My next throw was as bad, rolling into the lake.  A putt that was close but not close enough, and a spot on follow up put had me on +15, beating my PB by 5!  But the honours go to Luke who got -7, beating the previous course record by 2 (I'm still dubious about Jim's -6 because he had no witnesses) and John who got -11.  Apparently Alex was a little dirty that he didn't come out and take advantage of the awseome conditions.  John couldn't come to training this morning, so he sent a message with Barrie to brag about his score :)  Along the lines of big reduction, here is the first fully published accound of my weight loss:   weight		-16.7kg  neck			-2cm  upper arms	-3.5cm  chest			-11cm (d'oh)  waist			-17cm  abdomen		-19.5cm  hips			-11cm  upper leg		-9cm  calf			-3.5cm
