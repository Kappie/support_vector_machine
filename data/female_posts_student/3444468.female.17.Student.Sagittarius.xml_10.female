Then I would review problems for both Geo and Acc on Monday (Victoria Day so no school -- whoohoo!)  It's Monday. I haven't done anything. I have two tests in less than 8 hours and what have I done? Both tests are important too! Well, ever since I got accepted, I have become this lazy ass. I haven't done any work since midterms. I'm surprised I got good on most of my tests. It's because I'm so smart ...     I'm not even going to prom. I don't really care but at least if I was going to prom, I would have an excuse as to why I haven't been doing any of my work.  I'm screwed? Yeah. Do I care? Not even a little bit. I need somebody to come to my room and slap the hell out of me. Man I suck.
