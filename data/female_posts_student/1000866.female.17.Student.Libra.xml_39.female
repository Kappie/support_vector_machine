When I first walked out the door, I felt kind of good (except for the fact that I was shaking like no other) and then Mr. Rogers told me I did well, and so did my parents. I hope they weren't lying. I don't know why, I just have this sinking feeling that I didn't make Wind Ensemble. I feel like I need to for some reason, like there's no way I could feel good in any other band. Even though Peter/Dan/Don/Dave/Matt all make fun of me, I stil can't imagine myself in another band.  I heard Dan did really well on his audition. I know it's a terrible thought, but...that makes me so mad. It's terrible, but I wanted him to fail, and do horribly. Jeez. I really wish he had. I guess that makes me a bad person, or does it? I mean, everyone in some small way hopes their competition does badly.   Wow, that's not helping, I'm still feeling guilty.  I'm so worried about this audition. It's all I think about! Seriously. I can't think of anything else. It's horrible. I need to start thinking of something else.  I wish I could have gone to variety show with Jim, but my parents got home too late. It would have been good to get it off my mind. Plus, everyone is so busy with their German exchange students. I'm excited to meet them though. Haha, we'll have four of them in band Monday morning.  There's another thing that reminds me of making Wind Ensemble again. If I don't make Wind Ensemble again, it'll seem incredibly weird sitting next to everyone who has for the rest of this year.  ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want TO THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN THIS AUDITION!!!!  Why didn't I break my leg and end up in the hospital last night? I could have made a tape..and it all would have been good. Maybe.I would have made WE.  Wow, I do. I really have this sinking feeling that I didn't make it. I want this weekend to be over. I want to find out either way. I HAVE TO KNOW either way. I'll probably be devastated if I didn't make it, but hey.  Why does this mean so much to me? It's not even what I'm going to do when I, "grow up."  I'm a loser.  OK, I'm going to type about something NOT RELATED TO THIS STUPID AUDITION!!! I promise I wont mention it. Sorry...anyway, yeah. I went to Nikki's birthday party last night, and it was...interesting. It was fun, and I met a lot of new people, but...everyone from Benet was so......perky. They were nice, just...perky. Usually it'd be ok, but...I had a headache, and I was flipping out about...ahhh! I promised I wouldn't talk about it, so yeah. I came home and went right to bed pretty much. I was tired.  I can't get my mind of this thing no matter what I do. I tried checking the website to see if they posted it or anything, but...they didn't.   I feel like I'm going to cry, and I don't know why. I think it's the sinking feeling. Like, the feeling that if I don't make Wind Ensemble, I'll dissapear into an abyss of nothingness, and probably be incredibly sad. The feeling that I'll be a failure at the one thing people say I'm pretty good at. I'm really scared. Really scared, and I don't like it. The fear that I'll dissapoint my parents, and bonny, and...myself. I will be so incredibly dissapointed in myself if I don't do well on this audition. I already am dissapointed in myself for not working on it more. Oh jeez...I'm starting to cry. This is terrible.  On a completely different note...Heh, I realized the other day how few people I truly trust. It takes me a long long time to trust people. I don't know. I feel kind of guilty because people tell me so much. I think I should tell them stuff too, but...I can't bring myself to do that. It's like I can't be open and honest, like it's not possible for me except in a few cases. Like I have these big metal bars in front of me that I can't get past, like I'm a prisoner in a cage that I could easily escape from.  I've tried to be more trustworthy, but...it's impossible.  Why the heck am I so depressed right now?? I hate it!!! I hate being the snobby Naperville kid who's depressed over nothing, who's got good food, shelter, friends, and a family that's awesome.  What do I have to be depressed over?  Absolutely nothing. Wow, I dislike being pessimistic so much. I wish I could just stop, but I tried and I can't.  I'm really on a role at this failing stuff thing. Heh, I wonder if I failed the A audition too.   I think I'll stop typing now before I upset myself anymore.  Yeah, you know who it is, I'm not gonna sign it.
