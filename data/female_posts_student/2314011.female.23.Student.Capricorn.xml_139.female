Finally eradicated the sneaky Trojan viruses from my computer, thanks to the law school's very own Computer Guy.  My search bar is back to normal and no pop-ups as far as the eye can see.  Sweeet.  Saw the cute, hot-in-a-let's-go-home-and-cuddle-way, gas station cashier at lunch with the gals yesterday.  She was with a large, burly manly man, and somehow didn't seem quite as hot.  Maybe the world looked a bit sweeter Sunday evening when I asked her for change as the fog of the Appellate Brief lifted.    And THEN!  (In the very same day!)  A fellow yoga-ite seemed especially friendly before my class last night, which follows hers.  We bonded over our mutual inability to focus on anything other than what we each have to do for the rest of the night during our deep relaxation, meditative time, she as a biology grad student, me as a brilliant law student.  "What is it with me and all these attorneys in my life?"  she asked, genuinely looking for an answer.  Apparently, a good number of her circle of friends from high school ended up being attorneys and now here I am!  Suddenly I'm "in her life"??...interesting.  And she managed to throw in that she's going to be visiting one such friend in San Francisco at the end of the month as she bore her mid-drift tying her yoga pants.  Interesting.  And there was more than one "have a good night/good luck with all your stuff!", as though she wasn't ready to leave just yet, but had no choice because I was headed to class.  Interesting.  Or all figments and exaggerations of my imagination.  Became Vice President of SODA (Sexual Orientation Diversity Alliance) today, finally fulfilling my year-long dream to be beneath Miss Q.  The fact that Dan's our Secretary/Bitch is a bonus.
