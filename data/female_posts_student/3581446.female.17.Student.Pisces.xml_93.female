For future reference, children, the elderly, those who are ill or pregnant, Whitty, possibly some housepets of higher-level intelligence, and any human being who values the unspoilt purity of their own minds should by all means refrain with the most resolute discipline from viewing the image  under any circumstances.   Thank you for your time. -Ian
