Don't get me wrong, I love my 102.5 and NPR, but you just can't beat 97.1 The Eagle's Mandatory Metallica and lots of classic Pantera in the morning.  97.1 also provides a great place to hear the local bands and find out about upcoming events.    Imagine my surprise when I tuned into my favorite station on Tuesday morning.  They were playing Elton John's song about his blind brother Daniel, and I assumed it was part of a morning show joke.  I flipped the station a few times, returned to Preset #4 and was greeted with Billie Myers' "Kiss the Rain".  What the hell?  With no warning,  urlLink Clear Channel Communications  changed the only real rock station in the greater Metroplex area to crappy lite muzak.  They should have gone ahead and changed the call letters to KSUK, or KGAY, or KRAP, I could go on.    I have nothing against lite rock.  I just want an alternative (pun intended).    Damn you, Clear Channel!  Check out  urlLink this  link.  It rocks.
