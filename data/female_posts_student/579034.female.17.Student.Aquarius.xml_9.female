I might just take 1 or 3 Nyquill gell caps or something. I just wanna knock myself out cause I really don't want to fly. I hate it so much. Well... pray for me. Last time I was on a plane I cried hystericaly cause it kept on dipping. If you hear that a plane crashed tomorrow, I am leaving from Newark I think at 7a.m. to Orlando, Florida. Well... I love you all. Peace xoxox
