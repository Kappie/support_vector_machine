The concert didn't start until like 9:45, but the ticket said 8:00. So we sat on the floor for an hour or something after they ripped our tickets cause they wouldn't let us in the bar where the seats were. Nevertheless it was cool. The first band was The Natural History. They really rocked some sausage. Uh, then "The Vells" played, but their name should've been "the Help We're Still Stuck in the early 70ies British-Pop-Rock Pyschedelic Scene(s)" and/or the "Our Singer is having a Sex Identity Crisis". He sang like he thought he was a women, but deep down inside he knew he was a man.   SPOON ROCKED OFF THE HIZZY. I was singing along with Britt, and he kept looking at me... probably cause im really tall and I was sticking out of the crowd, but also because I was screaming at him and doing rapid-fire directional tumbs-ups at him while they were setting up. So towards the end of the show while they were playing Paper Tiger, he walks over to the Bassist and I swear he says "that guy in the front row is singing our words". Of course I didn't HEAR that, but I read his lips. TRUE STORY. I'm not joking at all! I had an impact on Britt Daniels. BRITT DANIELS ladies and gentlemen. That was pretty cool. I'm listening to him right now. He's like the brother I never had.  So our parking ended at 12:00, and the concert got out at 1:15... see a problem? yeah... so we had to pay a 25 dollar fine. Kinda sucked, but mostly for Connie.. cause she was the only one with cash! Ahaahhaha! So then we got lost looking for gas. I turned on the car and the gas light was on. We ended up in Bellvue. THen we stopped at a Walgreens. Then we got lost trying to find Connie's house. We didn't even decide to drive home until 3:30am, we were debating whether we should stay at my friend Tom's house. So we drove home. Me and Eric kept each other awake with a Spoon cd and a will to live. I've never had a deep discussion when I was that tired, but it provoked thought.   The band is getting ancy. We need to finish recording. Then everyone will be happy and welled mannered. We just need to record. I would die with peace if we'd just record.    I'm going hiking next week. Uh what else... My summer plans went to hell. I don't particularly care, just an observation. I guess im going to Palm Springs (don't have a choice), and to a family campout (don't have a choice)... and then to Seattle for a few days (choice? no.) and then a Wedding... and still my dad lays a guilt trip for not having a job. LOGICAL? no.    All my creativity is starting to evoke itself in a side project of mine, a recording project. I wish I had a more serious sounding keyboard... mine is from the 80ies... everything I've recorded with it sounds like a parody for a real song. I will find a way to work this into my style. Or maybe a way to digitally alter it. I kind've wish I had access to a huge Lord of the Rings style choir. And I wish I knew how to use one of those Conducter sticks.
