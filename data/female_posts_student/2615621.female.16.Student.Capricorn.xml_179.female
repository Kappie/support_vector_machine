Me and kaela are ridding bikes through the woods, like on a trail type thing..but we're going really fast cuz we're like running away from something i think..idk but we're trying to either get somewhere real fast or get away from something real fast. anyways, theres a lil creek type thing between where we are and this field where we wanna be. She rides right over it, she must have found like a shallow place to ride through, so i think i see a shallow place, and its just mud and a little big of water. So im ridding through the little bit of water but all the sudden its really deep! so of course i jump off my bike and my bike is floating and im screaming for kaela and she comes and helps me and im like "omg omg omg my guitar!!" and i look down in the water and my guitar is at the bottom. i tell her im gonna go get it. i start swimming down and down and down and i open my eyes under water and the water is clear, and i can see the muddy bottom and then theres this dog, like a mean looking dog..rot riler or whatever they are, and hes swimming from the bottom up towards me and i get scared and start swimming up and up and up and hes coming ater me and i hit the surface and i scream "OMG OMG GET ME OUT!" and kaela helps me out of the water. Then we call the police to come and get my guitar and help us out. They're standing around and tell me to go back in the water and get it cuz they can see it and they dont see a dog. i go back..and the dog is there. They're all like "dogs cant swim underwater julia, go get ur guitar" but i wont go near it beacuse the mean looking dog. I get out of the water and sit on the bank and look at my guitar laying at the muddy bottom of the now deep creek and wishing i could over come my fear to go get it. and the feeling that people who are suppose to help me "the police", "kaela" arent helping me do what i really want to do, which is get my guitar.   Now..what a weird dream, but i must mean something cuz of the things it deals with..lol im not gonna sit here and anyalize it. lol   i take that back..i think my guitar symbolized something that i loved in life, and it was out of my reach..and i feared trying to get it back. did i just have a deep moment?! no way!   *much love and broken sea shells*
