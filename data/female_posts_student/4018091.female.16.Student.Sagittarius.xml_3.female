Haha, cuties. Jordan was real drunk. It was too funny. "Let me see your face!!" Haha, great. Then, yesterday I went to Yoga with Brittany and her mom. Wow, it was too much fun! My mom wants to start doing it now!! Except, I'm like really randomly sore today?? Haha, then this morning I had to go to the dentist! :-\ I HATE THE DENTIST! Then, me, my mom and Kyle ((My little bro)) went out to eat at this place called Fara's Hacienda. It was actually pretty good considering I don't like Mexican food besides Taco Cabana.
