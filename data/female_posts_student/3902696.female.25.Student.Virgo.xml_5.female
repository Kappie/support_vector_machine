       
      His toes wiggle in the current The water flows gently over his feet His beautiful face Smiles up at me.  A delicate little giggle Comes from his being He places his hands in the stream Grabbing everything he is seeing.  His eyes shine like topaz His smile beams I love looking into his face How happy he seems.  His skin is like silk Delicate fingers touch me His hugs fill my heart As his little body clings.
