I'm so sad without my iPod... it was all the music I love ready at the touch of a button. And I had it everywhere I went, it was like the best present I ever got. My dad is still playing the guilt trip on me, saying things like, "I spent so long thinking of the quote to put on the back", and "You must not have locked your car, you forget everything else". Sigh.  Hm I'm listening to one of Billy Joel's piano albums, I never listened to it all the way through. He's so talented, holy shit.  I kind of miss playing the piano, I was pretty good when I stopped but I didnt' have the time to practice once I got to highschool and was doing soccer and stuff. Well and I really don't need to be playing two instruments right now. I'm glad I did it though, they say that if you are a musician you should always have a background in piano because it develops your ear and your sense for music, which I've obviously retained.. that could just be genes though. My dad keeps saying he's going to get me vocal lessons and guitar lessons and bass guitar lessons. I could teach myself if I had the time. Or patience. I want a cookie.
