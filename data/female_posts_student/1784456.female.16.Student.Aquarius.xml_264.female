I don't get to see every one I see at school and we can't make fun of Mr. Kelly! (Our teacher) But hey I'm going to see a film today! It's either gonna be Monsters Inc or Rat Race. Hey, no one's too old for a U! Mmm I think the stuff in my ear's gone hard! Yikes! Oh well. Oh another thing some how we've got Fox Kids and Fox Kids +1hr! But hey, I'm not complaining! It's got Spiderman and Inspector Gadget on it! Hey I'm a little kid at heart and I love those cartoons! It's also got Flint the Time Detective which Izzy will be soooo happy about. (She's obsessed with it) So I might actually get to see it! If you're as bored as me check out  urlLink Monsters, Inc!  I'll be doing a review on it probably! (I'm that bored!) Actually it's because my science hw is too hard and I lost my big expensive revision book!
