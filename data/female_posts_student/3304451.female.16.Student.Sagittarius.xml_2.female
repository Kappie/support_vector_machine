(didn't mean to listen to their conversation) they were talking about going for a tour in beijing. CHINA - a place i wish i can visit :D at this point of time, i'm thinking, when am i able to go china, i don't wish to go after i have retire but who knows :p they have reached the age of retirement and i have not even step into the society. i'm still in the education stage. how will my future be? i have been asking myself this question for like..a few years? when will i have an answer? a satisfying answer? dream is dream. my dream future can't be reality so what's my real dream in this real world? in primary six, i study to score. sec one, i study because i do not want to lose out. sec two, i study so that i can promote to sec three? sec three, i study in order to do better. sec four, i study so that i can pass with fairly well results? now that i have received my o level results and waiting to enter SP BIT this course, why am i studying this course? why? i really wish to put SP multimedia tech as my 1st choice in the JAE form...but...tis course dun really provide the stuffs i wanna learn..like tins related to music producing etc etc..because my dream can't become reality...i can't fulfil my dream, can't make my dream become reality. i can't hear myself. Mayday 'Wu Zhuang' fill my room and me. music is my dream, a never ending dream, an endless dream. my future is in mist.
