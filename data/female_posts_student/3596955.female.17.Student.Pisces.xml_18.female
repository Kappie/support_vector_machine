And this weekend - seemed to surpass all of my expectations as well as time. Where does that lovely bloke go? Especially when you want more of it! But you cant have it. But you wish you did anyway.  Friday Night - hahaha I swear. Those girls bring tickles to me without touching me! And I absolutely love synthetic tickles due to my finger phobia  all haha. As Ingrid arrived, she looked passed Grace  Kathy who were already here, ran straight to who else.. gave me the hug! hahaha. And then Kristine came. And then MONICA! Oh boy I was excited to see that she had made it! Toothbrushes, quilts, pillows  all - these gurls were well-equipped for what we had yearned for so long.  Tomato faced, tomato sauced, disordered  spiced up - there we were having our messiest dinner ever. Probably ravaged through at least 50 tissues hahaha *kathy* And guess who showed up at that moment? John Lennon! I love him! He's probably the most gorgeous uncle existant! And he's only 2.   I brought down probably my family's supply of toys  stuffed animals for that little fella. And what did he do? Hit everyone. hahahah hes the best! Learnt from the best ;p I made everyone tolerate   'Bring it on Again'   which is far by the most nastiest sequel ever made. Trust me, its beyond nasty! So geh! Then we endured bout 30min of football. But with much thanks to Grace my dear. hahahaha oh she supplies the best entertainment. Don't think nasty! Oh she's adorable.  After pressurizing Kristine to sleep over, we turned to the karaoke - as always. This lasted bout 2 hours? Singing to such sweet melodies, old school tunes  all-time favourites. Highlight? Grace  her vulgar *sex bomb* haha, we even attempted to call Elton. We even managed to finish bout 5 songs all up hahah. But then..nothing but a bit of chocolate cake  milk at 3am! Heheh. We were having so much fun! Especially with the UNO where their TRUE COLOURS came out. hahahah. The boys? Were half dead. haha. But oh well. We'll see them in the morning for breakfast. Maybe we could've *spiced up their lives* hahahaha in a completely plutonic innocent way thankyou very much!  Much Ado About Nothing.   Heh some random quote hahaha. Alright - after a bathroom intermission, we settled into sleep mode. But I insisted, the night was still young. And nothing but a good chit chat or *honesty forum* i'd like to call it. What did we talk bout? hrmmm..friends? boyfriends? boys? girls? hahahaha?! They couldn't stop scouting! From my yearbook! particularly page 153 hahahahahahah we couldn't get over it. Oh sigh* I miss them already.  Grace's CD..maatee..hahah..I listened intently to my song for that somebody. And no its not love. hahaha all that mushy gurly lovey stuff. Then after bout a wholesome 3 hour chat? Kathy, Kristine  Monica drifted off. Grace! oh my. I gave her an ultimatum. TO STAY QUIET FOR 10 MINS? For me to get some shut eye. But no. So there we are at 5:30am in the morning playing Monopoly. I so won that game! And then! With about two hours to go before we had to make breakfast..we insisted that the other girls play PANTS w. us. And I won that aswell! hahah..it was slack. We woke them up to play pants.   Grace went to sleep. at last! then Kathy  I had a bit of a chat. Before we knew it, the sun was up  it was time to make breakfast! Elton came over. Monica was still in bed. hahah the pancakes  eggs were devoured. And abit of UNO was played again. Before they all headed for their abodes =(.  The rest of the weekend was consumed by taking out John, having no sleep for at least 57 hours  dancing by myself in the summer rain hahaha. I went out with cousins to keep myself readily alert  occupied during the no-sleep era. My, the weekend was not so bad after all. In fact, it was probably what I needed. A break from the usual. A break from everyone. A break from myself. It was very much nourishing  pleasureable I must admit.  We haven't changed abit.   And at that thought, I'm at ease.   -- my prozac come back! --
