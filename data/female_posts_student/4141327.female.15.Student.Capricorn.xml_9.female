"ok now repeat after me.... fuuuuuck.... very good!" anyway... yeah today i woke up at like 1, made myself toast and eggs. i think eggs are nasty but i need them for protein so i eat them anyway. then i watched the last half of mission to mars with my brother. worse movie ever. "look a giant face is making noise! lets turn the noise into pictures so that we can solve the puzzle and go inside the giant face! yay!" then i started reading my spanish summer reading. el burlador de sevilla. apparently its about this guy who goes around tricking girls into fucking him and then he leaves. sounds fun. i probably would be done by now seeing as its only like 50 pgs if i didnt have to stop every 2 seconds and look every word up. im gonna fail spanish. y am i in 4h?? i dono but im gonna fail. oh well its still summer :-D im thinking about going to the beach tomorrow, but its been raining soo much lately. ian and aless and rojo came over yesterday. it was cool to see ppl. we went to see the village, yea bad movie. shamalan, im disapointed in u. then we walked back 2 my house in the rain. somehow we ended up throwing jenga pieces everywhere and my dads pissed at me cuz my dog ate one. hell shit it out in a few days anyway... so thats been my last couple of days..... interesting huh? call me so i can get off my ass and actually do something for a change. much love.
