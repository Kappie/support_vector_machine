I need some distraction,  Oh, beautiful release.  Memories seep from my veins.   Let me be empty,  Oh, and weightless,  And maybe I'll find some peace tonight.    Sarah McLachlan     Thats how I feel, first i will be happy then I will feel guilty that ive done something wrong and that everything is my fault...its something i just cannot help. i just have this horrible feeling that i dont deserve to be living. Have you all ever felt that way? That everything you do is wrong and you think you arent normal? Just because you arent the prettiest or arent as skinny as some people you see? Do you ever ask god "Why couldnt you just make everything and everyone beautiful"?      "I'm so tired but I can't sleep  Standin' on the edge of something much to deep  It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word  We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard   But I will remember you, will you remember me?  Don't let your life pass you by  Weep not for the memories"     Sarah McLachlan    Dear God  Hope you got the letter and...  I pray you can make it better down here  I don't mean a big reduction in the price of beer  But all the people that you made in your image  See them starving on their feet  Cause they don't get enough to eat  From God  I can't believe in you  Dear God  Sorry to disturb you but...  I feel that I should be hear loud and clear  We all need a big reduction  In the amount of tears  And all the people that you made in your image  See them fighting in the street  Cause they can't make opinions meet about God  I can't believe in you  Did you make disease  and the diamond blue?  Did you make mankind  after we made you?  And the devil too?  Dear God,  Don't know if you noticed but...  Your name is on a lot of quotes in this book  And as crazy humans wrote it  you should take a look  And all the people that you made in your image  Still believeing that junk is true  Well I know it ain't and so do you, dear God  I can't believe in  I don't believe in  I won't believe in heaven and hell  no saints no sinners no devil as well  no pearly gate no thorny crown  you're always letting us humans down  the wars you bring  the babes you drown  those lost at sea and never found  and it's all the same the whole world round  the hurt I see helps to compound  That Father, Son, and Holy Ghost  is just somebody's unholy hoax  And if you're up there you'd perceive  That my heart's here upon my sleeve  If there's one thing I don't believe in...  It's you, dear God.    Sarah McLachlan
