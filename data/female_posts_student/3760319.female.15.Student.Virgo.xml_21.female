Wet n wild wasnt all that bad. we got 3 free tickets so katie only had to pay for hers but i paid for her tube and all that. OMG they had a males finest body contest!!! =0 wow haha there were 2 guys that just had my eyes locked on them. and even victor knew it but shiit i didnt care. one goes to canutillo i guess cuz david and victor knew him and he came in 2nd place and another was sum guy in blue shorts. i swear if i wasnt there with victor i soo would have gotten his number. oh yea and i saw sum punk like when we got there to the crowd and he reminded me and looked soo much like jacob my ex. i was like aaw cuz like i was there with jacob a couple of summers ago and i just thought about him. I'll call him up later on tonite. but anyways yea and i saw some people i had gone to school with in las cruces. jus saw old and new people. always the same cuties that work there. im tellin ya one day ima go with a whole buncha girls n get numbers n shiit lol. oh well one day.. but hey at least today's plans went right. afterward we went to taco bell and got food came back and ate here at my house. we dropped off katie at vanessa's house then came back to my house well stupid ass me left my keys inside lol so we had to wait for my mom n aaron to get home so they could open the door so i could give victor his money. but yea we just sat there listening to music. *memories* but yea they already left so i guess im outyz..
