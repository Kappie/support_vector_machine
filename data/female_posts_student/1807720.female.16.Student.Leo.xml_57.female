And well I sorta studied my chem this morning but I did most studying last night but I am going to wait for later tonight to do some more stuff.  I think I am starting to understand the stuff and there are just a couple things that I really can't get the hang of that I should probably ask about on monday before the quiz.  Me and my mom went to our hair dressers house for this open house she was having for all her clients and we had a huge lunch.  And then later tonight my dad is flying back to Vancouver so my parents will be gone and it will actually be QUIET.  So I can actually study alot better.  I need to do good on this chem quiz tommorow.  I NEED to, and of course the unit test coming up is certainly important.  I haven't done the review questions from the end of the chapter yet but I might start on some tonight and well I will probably be done by tommorow night.  If I don't do good on these tests I don't know what I will do.  I don't know what else I can do really.  I'm so scared for the future.  I wish I could understand chem.  If I want to be a Biology Teacher I will probably have to do chem stuff in university and I can't even understand the stuff that is suppose to be easy now.  But that is my dream, I have dreamed days and nights thinking about how much I want to teach something related to science and I am pretty certain it will be biology.  It is my passion, afterall I love science but not when it is frustrating.  Why can't I be good at the things I like?!?!?    Wouldn't it make more sense if God made me talented in the areas I am actually interested in?  I mean everything that has to do with science is LITERALLY my dream, I can picture myself infront of a class teaching too.  I can just "see" it, it is sooo clear.  But I am soooo afraid for the future, I NEED to understand Chem now, if I don't then when will I understand???...I mean I think I am getting a little bit more of the unit now that I have gone through the stuff over the weekend, but lots of times I feel I know the stuff and then I just get soooo confused on the tests and quizzes cause I need know what they want you to do or what they are asking.  I just hoep everything turns out alright.  I hope University still accepts me cause I don't know what my chem mark is going to be.  I am trying to get it higher but I don't think failing all the quizzes is going to raise it by any means.  I just worry soooo much, I wish I could stop.  CHEM, CHEM, CHEM, that is alllllll I can think about.  It's annoying and it ALWAYS on my mind.  I just want to score like at least an 80% on something.  I want a mark that actually reflects my effort for once, I hope that I do good on that quiz on monday and especially good on that test on Wednesday.
