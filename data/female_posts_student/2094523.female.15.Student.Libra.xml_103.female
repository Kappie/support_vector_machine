Actually im kinda bored at the moment.   Oh well I do not wish to go to the malls any time soon. i hate it when ppl walk too damn slow in the already crowded malls.   anyways.. go johnny rzeznik u sexy sexy man   jessica simpson is the biggest ditz ever. like have u seen her on "newlyweds nick and jessica"? i didnt think anyone cud be THAT ditzy till i saw her. paris hilton is kinda a ditz too...but shes rich and has awesome clothes and shes pretty and i use the same lip gloss as her.. haha people hate her so much but i think theyre just jealous like me! i hate paris hilton!   Geeks are really damn cute.. i never really thot bout that.. every time i see soemone that appears real geeky looking i used to be so shallow and im like..ewww.. Well i mean dont get me wrong.. the calculator obsessed geek arent the ones im talkiin  bout.. just the ones that look geeky but prolly isnt. geeks are cute.. id tap em.. well it depends. but i think they are so fucking cute indeed they make me smile just thinking of em  In love? could be.   No such thing as love? possibly  Hopelessly in love? Always.
