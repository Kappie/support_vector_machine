It is about a surgery center, the Florida Center for Comestic Surgery, undergoing an investigation because they are allowing nonlicensed assistants to perform surgery. Can somebody please explain to me how anybody working in that office can even consider that as even being ethical? They are putting their patients in a dangerous situation by not having a physician operate on them. I would not want anybody operating on me that is not a board certified physician. Since 2000, there have been 14 malpractice suits and 2 patients have already died since their operation in November. After hearing this, who would want to go to a surgery center with all of this bad publicity? In addition, surgeons are leaving blank prescription slips that the employees could use to hand out medication. The assistant simply needs to write in the name of the patient and what drug they are supposed to receive. Since these prescriptions are not forged, any body could get a hold of these and have a field day writing out any kind of prescription. Are the surgeons really that busy that they have to sign these slips in advance? By doing this, the assistant could make an error in writing the prescription or they could be stolen. The wrong prescription could cause adverse effects to the patient and could possibly lead to death.   This is supposed to be one of the busiest plastic surgery practices. They claim that they hired additional physicians and nurses, but they were foreigners who didn't have a license to practice in Florida. You need to have competent staff in the operating room who knows what is occurring. Is the organization not aware that under Florida law you cannot have medical assistants performing any surgical duties? Did these physicians purchase their medical degree off the Internet? They must not have been paying too much attention in medical school if they have the audacity to endanger their patients' lives.
