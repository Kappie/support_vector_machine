Im actually off work today, so I'll be going to go look at some apartments with Steph.  Thank god I'm done with school for a while (feh...it's back to school in a few weeks).    I got a speeding ticket yesterday.  And I think its funny.  I was going down Interstate 270, maybe about 5 miles from work, going about 85.  I saw a cop in the distance parked on the side of the road, but I wasn't going to put on the brakes.  If the cop saw that, that would probably piss him off.  I opted to just take my foot off the accelerator, but my car didn't decelerate fast enough.  I passed him a few seconds later, he pulled out behind me, and pulled me over.  He busted me going 77 in a 65 zone.  So what...shit happens.  The humorous part of this situation is that my radar detector didn't go off.  Maybe it didn't detect it if he was radaring me as he followed me instead of as I passed him parked on the side of the road?  Hmm.  Anyways, I was expecting this situation to piss me off and I was expecting the cop to be a dick.  But neither happened.  I actually had a positive experience getting a speeding ticket.  I even thanked the nice cop for my $100 ticket.  Heh...  Mom and Dad are going to be pissed when I tell them.  Other than that, life's decent, I guess.  Been slacking on the guitar playing, because I've been feeling oh so not inspired to write anything.   Maybe I'll work some more on a song that I've been working on.  And, of course, I'll be working a gazillion hours a week, working doubles on Saturdays and Sundays.  I know I'm stupid for doing nothing  but working, but oh well.  Money is good!  Well, thats the current adventures of Jen for a while.  Talk to you later.
