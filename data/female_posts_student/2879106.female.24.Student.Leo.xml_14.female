Well The other day I E-mailed Alek saying that I wanted to separate for a while in order to work on things that are going on in my life. I asked him to E-mail me back by Friday in order for me to know how he feels about my decision. Friday came and all I received was a two line E-mail saying that he was busy and his response would have to wait till the next day. I was completely fine with that and was grateful for a notice on when he would respond. Then on Saturday I received nothing at all. I was so pissed off that he was such a jerk that I wrote him back and broke everything off. I informed him that I wanted to get my things back and I would make plans to come and get them after work on Sunday. So he called my phone and said that he would have my things in his car at the elementary school down the street and I would be able to come get them without having to come to his house. He was playing Basketball while Amber got my things out of his car. I tried to not look at him but I couldn't help it. I just stared wondering what he was thinking about as we drove away. I was told that he looked our way as we pulled away and Amber flipped him the bird, but I am not sure about that because I was too busy trying to get away as fast as possible. I just wish things didn't have to end this way. I love him so much and I can't stand to be away from him. I just wish I understood why he is acting this way. Why is he so insensitive? Why can't he just tell me how he is feeling? Why does he not have the courage to leave me himself? Why does he push me away so much that he forces me to make the decisions? Why can't he just be a MAN about this? I have decided that men of my generation have been raised to be spineless, week, jellyfish and that there are no good, strong, Marlboro men left in the world.   All I know is that I don't want to feel this way anymore. I am just a shell of a person wondering around from one of my jobs to another. I am going through the movements of my day and not feeling a damn thing. It is a real shame that I have to do this but if I don't just cut myself off from my emotions, I break down and cry. (while you are standing at a table taking orders, crying isn't the best way to get a big tip) So I just put on my fake smile and get through the day. I hate feeling this way so much and I wish I could just flip a switch and be back to normal. I guess I have gone through this before. I have dealt with men who can never seem to give you the answers you need. So I guess I am strong enough to get through this too. I just hope I get over it soon.  For some reason I am looking forward to being alone for a while. I am not going to jump into another relationship any time soon. I haven't been alone for about six years and I can't even remember what it is like to be a single woman. Maybe this time I will learn how to be strong and secure with myself without a man in my life.  One last thing, Dad is still in the Hospital. I hope he gets well soon and comes home. I feel really bad because I haven't been able to go and see him in the hospital. I have been working so much that I am either at work or asleep. Also yesterday I went to get my things. I told day what I was doing and why I couldn't come to see him. I think he understood. At least I hope he understood. He should be coming home today but we are still not sure. I guess I will keep you updated as things evolve.
