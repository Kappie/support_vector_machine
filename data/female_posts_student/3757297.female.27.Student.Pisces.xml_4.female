I wish that there was a "perfect" mix of liberalism and conservatism in a candidate that actually had a chance of winning in our 2 party system:)  I wish that people would stop saying "grass roots."  I wish that fat free mayonaise tasted more like actual food.  I wish my Mother In Law were sentient.  I wish that my husband had the day off work:)  I wish Law and Order were on every second of every day...7 times a day is not really enough for me.  I wish I knew Kim Possible.  I wish for more wishes.
