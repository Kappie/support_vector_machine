Until my great-grandfather threw a sack over her head and carried her off. Just like that. As if she were a fancy chandelier. That's the way he did it. And the story goes she never forgave him. She looked out the window her whole life. The way so many women sit their sadness on an elbow. I wonder if she made the best with what she got or was she sorry because she couldn't be all the things she wanted to be. I have inherited her name, but I DON'T want to inherit her place by the window. - Sandra Cisneros, from "The House On Mango Street"
