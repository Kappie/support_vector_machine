I can't wait for summer, but I still have to drag myself through the last week of school ( which is next week!) I'm a bit worried tho. Like one of our teachers said, "You guys feel like it's summer already, and end up neglecting the last weeks of school." I don't want to end up getting stuck in summer classes!! >
