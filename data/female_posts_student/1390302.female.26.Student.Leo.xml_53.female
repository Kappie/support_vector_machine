I have been wondering if simply knowing someone constitutes a friendship, or is there a deeper level of involvement in a “friendship”?  I know a good deal of people, yet I have been wondering how many of those I would call friend.  If just knowing someone constitutes a friendship than what is there to keep that friendship alive other than to continue knowing someone?  If there is a deeper level of involvement, what does that involve?  While I realize that every person’s definition of a friendship is different, the matter can be addressed none the less. Dictionary.com defines a friend as: “A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.”  Likewise, Friendship is defined as: “The quality or condition of being friends.”  Now that I have gotten that out of the way, it’s on with the topic.  If all that is required for a friendship is to simply know someone-which is a contradiction to the definition given above- then what is an acquaintance?  I know several people who believe that a friendship is a simple state of knowing someone.  I personally believe that a friendship is a relationship like any other and needs to be nurtured and cared for and given attention to, to exist.   Take for example a friend of mine.  I have this friend who would call himself or herself friend of mine, yet does not wish to do anything to nurture that friendship any further than the simple act of knowing me.  While I find this unacceptable, what can be done?  I have tried to give this friendship attention and yet it fails to rouse the other party.  A friendship, like any other relationship, takes two –or more.    I suppose this topic has come from my frustration with the state of many of my friendships of late.  I wonder sometimes if I really have many friends, and weather or not I should care.  I do care yet I don’t have the first clue in figuring out what to do about that!  The entirety of the situations just irks me to no end, and puzzles me at the same time.    My husband has a friend who has been his friend since he was a child.  Yet this friend doesn’t come by, and Matt doesn’t go to visit him most of the time.  They talk on the phone very rarely, yet call themselves “best friends!”  It is so frustrating to me.  How can this be a “best friendship”?  I consider a “best friend” to be something greater than a friendship, something far more lasting and complete.  Something without bounds and ultimately understanding.    It just seems to me that once a friend is made, that friendship is tried and stretched and lost over time.  The single exception to that is Mindy, whom moved to Seattle when we were in the tenth grade and we are still friends to this very day.  Yet all others fail to meet the standards of friendship before long and I loose what could have been a good friend, or what had been a good friend.  It’s all so aggravating to me!  As I look back on many friendships I have shared over the span of my life, I just feel that I am lacking when it comes to understanding most of them.  When I lived in California, I had a lot of what I thought were friends –they all turned out not to be when put to the test- yet I believed they were friends and when they all turned their backs on me and called me names, it hurt to no end.  I wonder how someone can be so two faced?  Or a group of someone’s for that matter!  So now, I look behind me as often as forward in looking at the overall worth of a friendship.  Still, in all of the trouble I have had in the past, I continue to look for friends wherever they may be found.  Most of which fail for one reason or another.    So yes, I do believe that it takes more than the simple act of knowing someone to make them your friend…   ~ Kristyn
