I'm going to see my brother for the first time in at least a year and a half...  I'm excited, for now...  I finally got new contacts tonight... They're the extended wear kind.. ..They are a lot stiffer than my old ones, but my eyes are getting used to them very well. Actually, aside from being able to see, I can't tell that I am wearing them. :D  Tomorrow is the last day of school. We go for 2 exams and leave...  ...It doesn't seem like the last day yet.. Well, at least to me...       [Amy and Harold are talking about their feet or something..]   me : (pointing at their feet) Ahahahah! You guys have feet! Hahahah!  [Geoff gives me a weird/dumb look.]   Geoff : HAHA! You have feet!...  me : Hey! I just said that, and you gave me a weird look!  [Geoff gives me a dumb look.]   Geoff : Haha! Feet! Feetsies! You guys are feetsies!  Man, I'm going to miss having lunch at school with all the loons that I sit with...  I really hope that all of us have lunch together next year..  Today I had my US 2 History Exam, and I could not remember Mikhail Gorbachev's name (I completely blanked on it :/ ), so instead I drew a (stick-figure) picture of him emphasizing his red birthmark.. Hopefully, Ramsey will see the humor in it and give me partial credit... Highly unlikey, but, hey!, I can dream, right?...
