I came down to the breakfast table felt like I could die Tried so hard but wasn't able  to look you in the eye .........................................................  For i'm feeling so much shame yes i have brought disgrace i can tell i've soiled my good name by the look upon your face ...........................................................  Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad If you could just forgive me and talk to me, dad talk to me dad ..............................................................  I didn't hear ya enter, no I didn't hear the door with my hand upon my member and my pants upon the floor Now burnt into your brain is an image you dispise like blood and guts and starvin kids and Stevie Wonder's eyes ............................................................... . Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad but I wouldn't use those tissues They've already been had Talk to me dad ..............................................................  The look upon your face made my swollen gland diminish So I said, "Could ya close the door? I really wanna finish" Now daddy I'm ashamed and I'd completely understand If you never wanna hug again or even shake my hand .............................................................  Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad Just because it was your bed  It's not that bad ...............................................................  When I was only seventeen, you told me it was dirty, so it must be really creepy when your kid is pushin thirty But you cannot tell me dad that you have never had a whack At the thing that hangs below your belt and bumps into your sack ................................................................  Well it seems last night you caught me spankin it No use denyin it I was really crankin it Well Dry your eyes don't be so sad But I wouldn't use those tissues they've already been- just because it was your bed it's not that-  now daddy daddy please forgive me and talk to me dad talk to me dad
