Yes, I resisted as long as I could because I thought Ms. Rowling was a shameless hack of an author who pieced together her story using the best bits of all the great classic epics of our time.  I was determined to resist the furor and hype with every dignified elitist bone in my body.  I was Eric Cartman in the Lord of the Rings episode where the boys are traipsing off to return the One Video Tape to The Video Store and come across a band of fellow youngsters.  "I shall put a spell on you!" said one in a fake British accent.  "What are you kids doing?"  one of the four asked.  "We're playing Harry Potter!"  "HA!!" Eric laughed condescendingly.  "FAGS!"  But the universe saw fit to let me read the series and so I have.  And for the most part, I've been pleasantly surprised.  I'm about 200 pages into the third book and I'm finally getting invested in more than just the novelty (yes, I said novelty) of it.  But the more I read, the more I realize I was right:  she is a shameless hack.    Dobby IS Gollum.  The Dementors ARE the Ringwraiths.  Dumbledore IS Gandalf AND Obi-Wan (from the original trilogy).  But I'm still hooked.  And I still can't wait to get home and keep reading.  Stupid hacks, anyway.
