Every being that knows how to love Wondering if they’re blessed from above One thing I know for sure Longing, beating, loving heart’s pure.  Many times we take for granted Life’s heartbeat often tainted With reality’s monstrosity And human curiosity.  We often like to play God, Making, creating, Zeus-like rod Destroying life’s natural flow As we continue to learn and know.  One, small life’s heartbeat Is like a morning treat To embrace the celebration of life Forgetting for a second, earth’s hunger and strife.  As we continue to experience pain Our heartbeat’s stucco sound like the rain Yet, smile amidst the sorrow For our heartbeats beat tomorrow.  Now, who among us here? Who suffered more but persevere? A heartbeat is the life we hold so dear. Wait, the beat of love is but near.
