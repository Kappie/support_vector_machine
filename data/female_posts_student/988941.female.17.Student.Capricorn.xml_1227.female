You don't know what goes on in my life behind the name of  » Max « eMac Fund: £322 of £756 - November Rain (http://www.maxpayne.co.uk)  so please don't have a go at me. Nicki knows the reasons why im not blogging why I should. I've told her and I've requested something to be done about it. It isnt my fault.  Other than I have blisters on the back of both feet from walking home all the time, i'm whoop-de-doo. Seriosuly.  The parents have stolen the computer room, meaning I am downgraded to the 400Mhz laptop. Pathetic. I need my own PC for my room. One that I can modify and build to my own specification without anybody hindering me in the process.
