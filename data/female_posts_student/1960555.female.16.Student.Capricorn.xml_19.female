I'm good with all my friends now, I'm still a struggling lover, seeing as I have no one to love as of right now, and at this point I could care less if I'm with someone.  I finally know what I'm getting my sister for Christmas (a Far Side calendar amongst some other things) and I got 68% on my Socials exam, and I don't know what I got on my English exam, but on my huge project worth like 15% of my grade, I got a freaking 96%!!  Yep, nearly peed my pants there!  So essentally I've cured myself as always, and I'm in the process of straighting out the lives of several of my friends.  I'm the Guru and everyone knows it.  I think they might be abusing the fact that I'll help just about anyone.  But I don't really care, aslong as they get the help, I'm glad to do it. Let's just let life take a vacation.  Take a break and we can all relax in our Soap Opera free worlds.  Yea, that'd be real nice.
