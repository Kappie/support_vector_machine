Total face plant on the stairs. It's a tough day. I hate the grade 9s. Stop complaining, you're so small. Sooo young frosh.. I didn't get to pitch. Even though I practiced. SS pitched well, CS wasn't as good, she is really inexperienced. Needs to lose the windmill so she can get her accuracy I think. If she's lucky she'll get a strike if the ball drops but after walking 5 for 2 innings, she still got put back in. So frustrating? I mean, if you're not going to let me pitch, fine. Put SS back in then, but that is just plain ridiculous. AGGGGHHHH. I think I pulled a muscle. That really isn't good. I hope it's okay. Ack. I want back up. Back Up! Back Up! ....nothing.
