I even turned a lil brown...wow, im shocked and amazed.   I was sitting in front of the tv watching TRL and hopeing i could catch the new episode of The Real World, where Frankie is gone, because i missed it last nite. I watched Blink 182 new video show for the first time, rocked ass, i love them! Anyways, i was sitting there all by myself eating a grilled chicken bagel sandwhich (yum..instead of bread i use bagels for everything) and i hear the screen door open...and it doesnt shut...and then i hear it shut. and im like HOLY SHIT what was that?! i mean, someone just opened the door, waited for like a minute and then closed it. I was in the same room as the door, but theres a wooden door in front of the screen door so i couldnt see anything. After the blink video i got up and carefully opened the door to find a menu for the new chinese restruant down the road. haha i felt like such an idiot. I was scard a whole 3 minutes over just someone putting a menu in the door. I looked through it, there is actually something called the Pu Pu Plater. I wanetd to call them up and order it and have it delievered but their lunch hours ended at 3:00 and it was already like 4:30. dammit. So i looked through it and decided i might ask dad for something from there for dinner. Right now hes at the dentist.   I called lizzie today and we talked a while. nothing too much was going on. lol   I also read some other peoples blogs. I wonder if other people just browse through blogs like i do. I dont read them completely, just skim them, jumping from month to over other month. Some are stupid, lame, and about some kind of japanese animation-anime. i think that stuff is stupid. I wonder if anyone other than lauren ever reads my blog..i doubt it..haha im not very intresting.   People think its cool here that i go to andy griffths church and school and live in the same town his home as a kid is in. They think its cool that his show is based on my town. Well people...that creek in the begining isnt really in mount airy, its in LA, Cali. And its not like any of the show was actually filmed here..i was even asked if i know Ron Howard. of course not.
