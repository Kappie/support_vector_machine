The restaurant played all my favourite songs too.. *Laadeedaaa* We took 2 sticker prints, unfortunately, I can't scan them out because my scanner is stuffed up, so I can only upload them when Nora comes online tonight. On our way home, we thought of a brilliant idea to swop mobile phones so now, I am a proud owner of a white  urlLink SGH-S200 ! :) It's sucha nifty phone and I'm in love with it! Nora hearts my pink nokia 2100 too! By the way, Ignatious, we do not belong to the  sorority sluts  okie.. how mean of you to think that we belong to that group. *Sniffles* :,( Ahaha ok kidding lar little boy :P I just found it rather amusing when Nora told me about it. Huhur.  I miss my classmates.. Jeremy, Jason, Jessica, Amily, Dingling, Geetha, Jiax, Amelia, Karen, Simon, Ruth, Eileen, Gerry, Siti, Zu, Fiona, Narin, and everybody else. Can't wait for school to re-open! But I haven't completed my homework. Geez.
