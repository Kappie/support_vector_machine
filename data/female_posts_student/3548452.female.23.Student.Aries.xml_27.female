Right now I really feel like I need a shoulder to cry on or one of his awesome bear hugs and I know I cant because we ruined our friendship with sex. Because of it, our whole friendship has been reduced to whether or not I'm going to sleep with him. I'm no longer viewed as a friend, and I was always viewed as a girl, so I guess our friendship wasnt ever really a friendship at all. I always made all the effort to see him, and it was never reciprocated- so I guess he means more to me than I mean to him. It's a little late to get upset about it- I love him. Yes, I said the awful "love" word. I'm not scared to say it- even though most people are. Most people confuse love for lust, but not me. I've been in love- only once, but I have. So why do I need a shoulder to cry on? My home life sucks. I finally got some sleep this weekend, but before that I maybe got 48 hours sleep in two weeks, between the nightmares and stressing myself out over my roommate being stressed out. I was stressed so much I just now got my stomach to behave once in a while so I could eat a whole meal... I'm slowly becoming a drunk- only because there are things beyond my control that I cant help to feel hurt by. Like Friday, I knew something was coming that was going to hurt, but I just tried to stay out and have a good time. I'm in the middle of a song when I see this druggie that I know pregant for the umpteenth time. 8 months pregnant- and who knows who the daddy is or where he is, but I know she's not going to be able to keep the baby. My heart broke in a million pieces just looking at her. How can God allow somebody like that to keep having kids and not allow me to have any at all. I love kids, I've worked my whole life to support my brothers and all my older brother's kids, making sure those babies have what they needed and it breaks my heart when they miss me. I cant tell you how many other people's kids I've adoped as my nieces and nephews and how much it makes me cry when I dont see them. It already depresses me when I see all my friends having babies and starting families and knowing I cant, but the topping on the cake is when I see somebody like that, who will never straighten out her life, continuing to have kids. So to numb out the pain I decided to get drunk... even commandeered money from my brother Steve to drink even more- made sure I got myself completely plastered. Most people (including Jay) think there's no way I could miss him like I say I do- especially since I wont make any extra effort anymore, but how do you stay happy when you know that you're being used? I'm not even saying I want to be with him, even though he thinks I do. Maybe I shouldnt tell my whole life story here, but if I dont, how will anybody know me? Maybe I wouldnt miss him anywhere near as much if I had other distractions, but nobody distracts me enough. How can you be distracted from someone who makes you feel totally completely safe and comfortable. I never worry about anything around him. I worry about him, but not about myself. There is a song that perfectly depicts how I'm feeling called "I Miss My Friend" by Darryl Worley Maybe one day he'll hear it and see it's not about the physical feelings or me wanting to be with him (I could never do it anyway) It's about my friend. I miss you.
