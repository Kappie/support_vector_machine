Anyways, we went down to China Town for Dim Sum.  For all of you ethnicly chalenged people, Dim Sum is a Chinese type of meal.  People come around to your table with small portions of food.  Then they ask you if you want some.  If you say yes, they give you a plate for your table, and stamp a card on your table.  Usally they serve things like dumplings, Egg roles, Shrimp/chicken/pork/beef pot stickers, oysters, toasts, and of course, my favorite: chicken feet!  YUMMY!!!  So we racked up a pretty hefty bill at our table this morning, gouging ourselves full of food.  Then we walked around China town for a while.  Just getting off the subway is an amazing thing.  One second you're above ground in Times Square.  You go down, and when you emerge again, It's like you're in another world!  And you practiclaly are!  Everything is written in Chinese, and hardly anyone there speaks English.  It always helps if your with a bilingual person when u go down there.  Mari for instance is great, cause she spent 2 years in China durring college.  She's my brother's ex also, but extreamly nice and outgoing.   Anyways, we shoped around in China town.  Slowly, we started moving from one neighbor hood to another: Soho.  The preppy, trendy, upscale shopping district!    OMG, you should have seen some of the stores that we went into.  They were so fancy.  The dresses cost a couple thousand $ each!  And the ppl who worked their were all so profesional.  It was kinda cool.  We also saw alot of outside cafes packed with little tables and chairs.  Everyone walking on the street was wearing something colorful and original, completely unlike downtown NYC where everyone is in black.  Soho totally reminded me of shoping in Paris on Grande Ave.  Every store was upscale and the culture and ppl were so intresting.  Soho leads right into Tribahcah.  Another neighborhood full of wonderful shopping.  Although, in Tribahcah, it's not so much just clothes shoping anymore.  Their's everything.  Everything upscale and classy that is.  This is where you would come to buy a $5,000 leather sofa for your loft.  The stores were so little and cute, but still had that sophisticated flare that I love so much...  Anyways, when we were done with all that shopping, we decided to go to a bar and have a few drinks.  Now of course I can't drink, and I ordered a Margerita, thinking that the bartender would know to make it a virgen, but that's not what I got...  The thing tasted sortta bitter, and most definantly not like any of the margarita's that I am used to back in Appleton.  But I figured that the hell with it, so I drank it all, and asked for another one.  Judging by how fast I inhaled the first one, the bartender must have thought that I could hold my liquer or something, because I think he made my second one a doubble.  About half way through my second Margerita, that familiar feeling hit me.  I was getting a major buzz.  Shit, this can't be good, I never told my brother that it had alchohol in it, and now here I am, on the verge of getting drunk.  I suggested that we go to a restruant now, and get something to eat, because my stomach was starting to feel funny.  He agreed, and we went down the street to Supper.  It was an Italian restruant with an outdoor cafe.  We sat inside though, because we had a big group.  Everyone ordered, and the apatizers came.  Mike ordered like a $100 bottle of wine, and the waiter came and poured it for him to taste.  It was all so elegant with the napkin wraped around the bottle and everything.  Then he poured it for everyone, including me.  Mike noticed, but didn't say anything untill the waiter was gone.  He said that I could have one glass, after all, it was vacation and all.  So we were eating and filling up with appitizers, and everyone just kept ordering more bottles of wine.  After the first $100 bottle, they decided to stick to the lower 30's, but that still got expensive after 2 more bottles.  When our food finally came, everyone was getting thirsty again, and our waiter suggested that we get a few pitchers of Sangrea.  That's like wine, mixed with fruit juices, and other stuff.  The good stuff also has fruit chunks and peices floating around in it.  I guess Mike thought that was a good idea, because he ordered like 3 pitchers.  The waiter brought them, and with all the noise, laughter, and eating going on, no one seemed to mind me taking a sip every  now and then...  Anyways, after eating, drinking, laughing, talking, and sitting for about 4 hours there, we decided that it was time to leave.  Everyone was quite drunk by now, and no one noticed that I was tipsey as well.  It was about midnight, too early to go home, but to late do really do anything else.  So we decided to hit a Starbucks for some coffee, and head off to the Virgin Mega Store.  The Virgin Mega Store is in Union Square in the center of downtown.  It's a huge media store.  the whole first floor is full of music.  Punk, Pop, Rap, Rock, Jazz, Bluegrass, Oldies, and everything else that u can think of.  As far as you can see, it's all music.  Then their the downstairs floor.  This one is split in half, but it's also about twice the size of the upstairs.  Their's this one huge section just for DVD's.  I think they have every DVD ever made their.  And if you can't find it, they have everything computerized, so you can search by whatever catagory you want.  If by some fluke, they don't have what you want, you can order it, and have it shiped to your house with in 24 hours, free of charge.  I'm telling you, I could have spent hours in this store, but unfortauntly it was a Sunday night, so they closed around 1am.  Or at least that's when they stoped letting people in.  I don't think they ever really close, because the employies praticlaly live their.    After we were done at Virgin, we decided to call it a night and head home.  I said good bye to Mike's friends, and we headed off to the subway.  It took us about an hour to get home, just because we had to wait so long for the train, and we also had 100 blocks uptown to go!   As soon as we got home, I checked my messages.  I'm am really starting to miss all of my friends.  It sucks.  I can't get a hold of anyone.  Taylor has had the same away message for 2 days, and no one is answering his phone, I'm not home early enough to call Sami or Mel, Sami's never online, and Dave said that Mel is going to be offline for like a week or something.  So here I am, stuck talking to Dave, Ben, Adam, Kristina, and Keyan.  What fun.  Just kidding guys, you know I love you, but I still wanna talk to more people!!!!!   How about Chris actually getting his ass online for a second, or Amanda actually picking up her cell?  And as for Nicole checking her messages, that'll be a mericle.  Alex, I miss him too.  I don't know why, but he always knows just what to say to make me smile, and always know's when to back off me if I'm pissed.  He's such a sweetie.  And u know who else I really wanna talk too?  Jake.  J/K.  I know Jake isn't the meanest guy in the world, but he's easy to forget about for a while.  I need a break from him.  I still love him too though!!!  I feel so out of touch with my friends, even though I've only been gone like 2 days!!!  I don't know what I'm gonna do tomarrow, or for the rest of the week, cause I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to get online!!!!  What a horror that would be!!!!  I just need to keep talking to people, cause I know it sounds crazy and stupid, but what if they actually forget about me?  Or what if no one misses me, and everyone could care less that I am gone?  I feel like I have to remind everyone that I still exist, and that life is really better with  me in it...  I Donno, maybe I'm just being paranoid, but I still would hate for that to happen.  Their's one person in paticular that I dont' want to forget about me.  They will remain nameless for the sake of secrecy, but I miss them like crazy.  If they were here with me, I don't think that anything would be so bad.  I mean, I wouldn' miss everyone as much.  But as I'm sitting here typing at 3am, I'm wondering if they even miss me.  I don't think so.  Their probally just sleeping, dreaming about someone else, not even caring that we havent talked in a while.  It really hurts just to think of that.  The unknown.  Not knowing what they think about me.  Not knowing if my feelings for them will ever be returned.  The worst feeling in the world is loving someone, and not having them return it.  Looking into their eyes every day, knowing that they will never feel the way you do.  It tears me apart just thinking about it.  I want to cry everytime I think about them with someone other then me.  I don't know what to do, don't know how to act, don't know how to feel.  Do I tell them how I feel?  Will they even care?  No.  I already know that answer.  They don't care how I feel about them, because they already have their mind made up.  Even if anything ever changes between us, it'll still suck because I'll be the consolation prize.  Second, third, fourth, or even the hundreth runner up.  I keep giving, giving, giving.  Not asking for anything, hoping with all  my heart to get just something, and nothing happens.  I know that I should just move on and forget, but I've tried, and I can't.  I can't overpower my heart.  I don't know why.  I can't choose who I like, who I have a crush on, and I hate it.  It pisses me off, but I can't control a damn thing.   My rant's getting long, and I'm tired.  I'll try to write again when I can, but I don't know when I'll be around a computer, let alone internet...    Untill them, maybe that certin person from above will change how they feel about me...  Hey, I can hope and dream, can't I?  ~Ani
