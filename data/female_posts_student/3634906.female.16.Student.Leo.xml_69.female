I mean there has been some rough moments and many more to come but I will be okay and I think we all will... everyone has a point in time like we feel like there is no way out and now is one but I also feel like more than anything I should be there for everyone else and that is what I am trying to do... I am trying to be a good support for everyone else...    I miss Max so much... I really dont know what has come over me... like no offense to him but I mean we have been friends for a long time now but never really best friends... like he never considered me really a best friend... but lately I dont know I just miss him... like I never realized how much he means to me and how much of my life involves him... I dont know but its nice that he emails me everyday it really makes me feel ten times better... It makes me happier knowing that Hey maybe he does consider me one of his good friends... I consider him right up there with Mandy and Britt... like he is my best friend that is a boy... I love him to pieces and I dont know what I would do without him... I dont know... Its like I cant wait for him to email tomorrow just to know that he was thinking about me and you know caring at least enough to tell me about his day and about life conclusions!!! haha... I dont know I am sure that he knows pretty well now that I love him and care about him and miss him a ton... and he also knows it is not like I want him or anything but hes my friend... and I think he knows that... well I need to sleep I have a long day in front of me tomorrow and I didnt sleep well last night   nighty night   -gabby
