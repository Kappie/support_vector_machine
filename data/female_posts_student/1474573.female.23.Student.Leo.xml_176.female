He kept it majorly real, staying true to himself and original     through out the whole slam. I wish I had lost to him, instead of losing to yet another shitty male poet prettier than I am. He finished out the 3rd round in a BUNNY SUIT doing a parody of Saul Williams screaming    I am that bunny! I am that bunny! I am that bunny! I am that TIMELESS BUNNY!    All I have to say is "Sha clack clack , doc"  2. Celena Glenn is hot. I want to have her babies and it's not cause I like her poetry.  3. I lost to yet ANOTHER pretty black man.  4. It was a fun night. Had a lot on my mind. My girls from Queens, Tamz, Lissette, and Bridgette came out. It Bridgette's first time seeing me read and Lissette's second. I grew with these girls and it's so weird, I feel like I lead a double life. They found out alot about me through my work, stuff I never said...........it just wasn't important, somethings don't want to be articulated. It's weird, i get so nervous in front of them, but last night was different, I felt proud and loved. It was a good night.I can't write any more.
