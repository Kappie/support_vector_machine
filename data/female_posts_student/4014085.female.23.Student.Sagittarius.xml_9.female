That and there's this shirt at the Mall at Millenia that I want like burning. So come payday (Friday) I will be off to buy me some goodies and feel pretty. The new position at work rocks and I really like what I'm doing now. The stress has gone down to a minimum and my skin is already clearing up. I wrote about two pages last night for the book and will try to work on some more tonight. At the moment, I have the script to finish, this blog to update (and I will update it damn it), the book to work on, and maybe a poem or two just for good measure. I need to get back in the swing of things as far as writing goes and I'm coming a long way in this past week to my goal. Won't be able to afford school this semester but that's ok. This way I can focus on my body and mind and not worry about passing exams and grades. That and I've managed to mess up my checkbook again so I'm rethinking the whole "major in accounting" path. I'm going to try to talk Lindsey in walking six miles tonight. I'm on a roll and I will have some of the ickiness on my thighs gone by Friday. You might think this is impossible, but not so. With conditioning I can achieve anything.  I would also like to congratulate myself for showing restraint last night at the Sanrio store. They have the coolest  urlLink Chococat  and  urlLink Badtz Maru  bags ever. But I will not be buying them. I am to prioritize and have decided that I already have cool bags and I need clothes more. Which I do.  Thinking more on it I might change my mind by Friday and buy one of the bags. Whatever.  Sidenote - Hopefully I can bribe Anthony with lots of food to get my new site up soon. That would be sweet.
