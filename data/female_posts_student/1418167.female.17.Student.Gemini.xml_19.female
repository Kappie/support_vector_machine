So here ladies and gentlemen, are the top ten reasons why this weekend has been bizarre and beautiful all at the same time.  10. Going back to soup kitchen and seeing everyone after a few weeks. Such as lovely Leila, and Rick, who is unrecognizable without his hat.   9. Baking cookies, which I haven't gotten to do in a while. Man they turned out well too. (I still say they're not good for me at all.  Nya .) They now reside at the Murrell residence, and I even got a thank you from Cody.  Yay!   8. Getting things for the puppies- I am now a Pet Pals member at PetCo, which is basically a Kroger Plus Card, only for the dogs who are currently ripping each other to pieces.  7. Four goats got sold away to really good homes. It's sad and happy at the same time. In other words,  it's sappy.  haha!  6. Watching the old videos Randi and I made over the last couple of years. We are truly bizarre kids. The stories we have to tell are pretty good too. " Why is a fork in the middle of the road ?"  5. I am currently suffering from the sniffles, as well as a major sunburn which I managed to hit today in McAllisters', to add insult to injury.  Yow.  It really stings.  4. TCBY and other sweet things. Need I say more? Cleaning out one's closet is also good, as well as realizing that because of avoiding sweet things, I can now fit into other clothes.   Woo hoo!    3. Movies! God, how I love them. For example,  13 Going on 30  is very cute, and  Napoleon Dynamite , though it lacks plot, is totally hilarious. I'm beginning to think any movie by Focus Features, such as  Napoleon Dynamite  and  Lost in Translation , are just randomly good.  2. Friends and Miles' birthday celebration-  soo much fun . Roemer ended up taking me home, which ended up being a blessing and a curse seeing as we got lost down by Studio on the Square. Friends are so much damn fun... regardless of direction. Miles got a map and cookies and a night out to the movie. Yay squared!  1. It's been a week. Ah,  glorious . And hopefully many more good ones to come.  Well, as I sit here falling asleep in front of my computer, I would like to bid a  "break a leg!"  to all the WSHS kids starting tomorrow- have an excellent first day, and be prepared for the best year of our lives. Senior year is a week away-   wow.       Thought for the day: " You can't date everyone in the world- there are ugly people !"- Alexander Fones
