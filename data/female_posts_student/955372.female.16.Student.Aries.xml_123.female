Madeline made us go all the way over the the other side of the hill cuz she was scared of the "big kids" hahahaha. ohh that madeline. Yeah anyway so we're sledding and then we get to the bottom of the hill and we dont feel like walking back up the hill so we go down to the pond. And I'm like "I bet we could throw one of these sleds across the pond, try" so madeline throws a sled and it only goes like seven feet and i'm like NO. So madeline goes and breaks off this huge branch of a tree and is like here use this so i try to use it but on top of the ice there is all this mushy slush stuff so its kinda stuck. And i'm like oh great I gata go walk out on this. So i walk out a little into the pond, where i was it wasn't ice it was just slush and then dirt, so i went about ankle + deep in that and then i hit ice and my feet are like freezing, so i get the sled and madeline's like "wow i can't help thinking this is my fault" I'm like "yeah it is" so then we look at the waterfall for a while and then we're like "yeah i'm cold" so we walk back to her house and we put our clothes in the dryer then we watched labrynth. That movie with David Bowie as the goblin king (i know i know) anyway but these goblins were like running around or something and like talking in goblin talk and then one of them yells "oh my aching pussy!" only like in a japanese accent so more like (spelled phenetically) "awe, my aching-a poo-sy" but it was like really loud and i'm like omg what did he just say and we rewind it and we're like OMG, so we watched that part like fifty times, it was amazing. yeah and then i'm like "look at david bowie, standin there thinkin he's god" and madeline goes "david bowie IS god" it was amazing. Yeah then we studied for science for a bit, then i walked home. More to come but now madeline wants me to check her blog, brb.
