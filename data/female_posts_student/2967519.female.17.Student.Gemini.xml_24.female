My dad dosnt have the internet at his house and so they only way i can use it is if i go to my Aunt Char's. Lots of plans to do stuff though it should be a really cool summer for the most part. Im sad that i have to say goodbye to everyone though, even if it only is for a couple of months. I usually send out all my friends an email lol! I hate the whole goodbye thing, it just isnt fun. Im going to the bookstore here soon to get some reading material for my trip, and i still need to do a little more shopping but im almost done!
