So of course the first question was regarding the War in Iraq. And of course Dr. Maiden aka the liberal bastard that runs the social work department decides to answer...using the word "we". As in "we" feel like this war never should have happened now that "we" know that there are no weapons of mass destruction and many of "us" feel that he's not the real president anyway.  Maybe it's just me but there is a time and place for a bit of tongue biting and patriotism...like when you're serving as an ambassador of your country to a bunch of future militia members of an ally nation. Maybe it's just me, but I was really disgusted. I can't stand the fact that he represents our university, much less our country.  So immediately afterward we broke into small groups because there were like 60 people in the room and it wasn't much of a round table and I and several of the criminal justice students clarified that not everyone shares that opinion.   Funny internet cafe moment:  One of the girls is trying to talk to the employee and says in the middle of the room where about 6 of us students are emailing, "does anyone know how to say bathroom in Russian?" And we all say simultaneously "TOILET!" I feel so bad for the Russians who are using the cafe with us. I know our guides must be saying "Monday can't get here soon enough!"  We've decided that we're going to take pictures of all the crazy toilets here and make a coffee table book of Russian public restrooms. We're going to make millions.
