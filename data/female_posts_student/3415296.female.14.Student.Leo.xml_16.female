I can't believe I wrote that in my other blog. But..I guess it is true. I do. I really do. No matter what I do, that feeling is never going to be gone. I'm folding stars right now. I bought more. I don't even know why. I guess I wanted to finish my goal. I have to recount all of those all over again. I forgot how many I made. I want to talk to him again. Like we did before. All those times when we would laugh together, on the phone. Those were the times I'll always miss. All those times when he would comfort me when I was feeling down, or insecure. Those were the times I'll miss. All those times when he said I had nothing to worry about, those times when I knew he cared about me. Those were the times I'll miss. The moments where I knew he loved me, I'll miss.
