Shortly after I published my piece on  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  Nick called me to defend his position and debate mine. Now in a perfect world all of this back and forth would have taken place in cyber space, but with our emotions high and minds racing, the lag between typing, posting and responding was too much.  The gist of the conversation was Nick stands by his opinion, I am resolute in mine.  (Nick if you want to continue our debate online I'm more than ready to defend my  Eternal Sunshine  until I can type no more)  In the past few years the ante has been upped on the action movie genre.  No longer are audiences satisfied with lots of things blowing up.  We want Johnny Depp's humor or mind blowing CGI.  The wide range of popular culture (internet, television, movies, comic books, video games, ect.) has left 80's style action movies (buff hero, little plot, big explosions) feeling stale.   The Punisher  is a by the numbers action movie that is as banal as it is predictable.  With no plot, interesting characters or atmosphere whatsoever (Tampa?) the film is devoid of any emotional attachment.  After seeing  The Punisher  I happened to come across  Spiderman  on t.v.  There was a film inspired by the comic, that took it's characters and storylines seriously.  Someone needs to understand plastering the Marvel logo before a film isn't enough.  How awful was  Punisher ?  At the end when the Punisher heads out of town he says "This isn't revenge, it's punishment."  No, I thought, it is revenge.  Mindnumbing revenge at that.
