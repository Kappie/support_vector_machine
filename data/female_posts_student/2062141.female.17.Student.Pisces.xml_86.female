Tomorrow is my mom's birthday and we're gonna see Lord of the Rings (.. just saw it yesterday... it's so long... and depressing... ah well I promised I would go). On Sunday me and Charlotte and possibly Nick, Josh, or Erinn are gonna do Christmas-y things like watch all the great Christmas movies and look at Christmas lights in my neighborhood and what-not. I guess the rest of the week will consist of shopping and... yeah shopping. Then it's CHRISTMAS!!! I'm always slightly sad on the actual day of Christmas... cause the season is over. Oh well. Every year goes by so much faster than the last. I usually spend the whole day playing whatever new video game I get, or listening to new cds (i'm still not done listening to all the ones I got last year). Then, there's the crazy week after Christmas where you don't know what the hell to do. You're like, it's not Christmas, it's not New Years, it's some crazy vortex! I would have a party, but strangely enough I have relatives coming.. (?) Natalie has relatives? Yeah my two cousins and my uncle are coming over, and I guess my Grandma too. And my Aunt Robin and Uncle Richard. These people haven't been to our house in 10 years. 'Cept Grandma who comes *all the freaking time*. They all live in California. So that week will be so amazingly busy... I've also started some sort of relationship with Ryan, from my art class ... 'Bout time I found a nice guy! :)  This break is gonna rock. Boop boop be doop~
