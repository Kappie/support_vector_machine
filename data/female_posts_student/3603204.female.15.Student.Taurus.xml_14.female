MPH. mainly because of these two's atmosphere, and the things they sell. MJ has got soooooooooo many jazz cds, more than any other shop i knew of, and MPH has got soooo many versions of LOTR, and soooo many books(much more than popular), and sometimes (especially the one in raffles city) it will have jazz. god that's really nice. i basically enjoyed the silence when i am roaming these shops..but i realised my need to talk as well. i think that (even though i DON'T like) i need to learn how to communicate with others more efficiently. how to bring across my ideas clearly to my audience...how to TALK. the art of TALKING or CRAPPING. god knows how much i suck at crapping...  i don't know, but when i saw txy online i just felt like talking so much to her, and a lot of topics i wanna talk about and all these topics just like exploded in my mind and i am like...typing soooo quickly...and trying to make her understand all the things, and jumped from this topic to another, and i am like..well, nvm.  i know i can pick on anybody to talk these crap, but txy is someone i felt QUITE comfortable talking with. she is.. okay, but well, much better than anybody else..mainly its because..im to proud or what..i just sort of flinched away from someone i don't feel comfortable with, or look down on. i know. i am too proud. i looked down on too many ppl. that's bad. but i just am who i am. and its soooo common for me too look down on ppl. i even look down on my friends. well, sometimes...  and i looked down on ppl whom most ppl liked. well, if he is really good than i won't but most of the times i managed to see the darker side of ppl. i think that is..pretty sort of not-a-very-good-thing, because i am like..seeing the dark side of everyone and not been able to feel very bright as well. i mean, when you find something not-very-good about someone, i won't feel very happy, and you won't feel very nice and good and comfortable right? of course bright things make me brighter too. i used to live at the end of the corridor of the 4th floor, and the whole corrider actually has pretty girls living in the rooms and everytime i saw them i just felt very happy, very relaxed, very comfortable, and brighter as well. i don't know, but when you see bright side of world, you'll feel nicer..
