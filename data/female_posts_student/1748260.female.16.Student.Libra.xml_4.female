But everything is all juz still the same.* Haha, really it seems the same everyday anyway! But it's a lil' bit different today. Well, I juz came back from church. This afternoon I was havin' a dilemma. Go to Jen hse then Church or go back to school for band? Oh ya, today's Camilla's birthday. Well happy birthday cow junior! Hehe.. After all, I chose to go to Jen's hse then go to church. Today had service coz of dedication service. Had a special speaker. He's about 90 plus years old. Still strong man! Well, after church ate handmade noodles again. Hahaha. You may ask, "Not sick of it huh?" Well, it's delicious. Haha but kinda bad today. SO MANY SMOKERS!!! Argh.. Almost spoilt my appetite. Moreover, today when I was walking to my place. Some woman was smoking  I didn't know. The smoke kinda irritated my eyes  it was damn painful I almost fell. Argh, inconsiderate smokers. As I would say, kissin' a smoker's like lickin' an ashtray!
