I just need to host it somewhere but yesterday geocities and tripod were being whores and making me angry *shakes fist*. Anyways.. I'm semi-depressed today for some odd reason, thus being why I'm listening to '99 luft balloons' mehe.. the german version kicks so much ass. Well I'm going to the vet w/ my mummy so that  Taffy  (that's the only pic I can find >_>) can get her nails trimmed. Cuz.. yea. And Cardcaptor Sakura is on @ 6 for some reason... so I'm gunna watch that cuz it makes me damn happy. And of course, today being friday Inu Yasha is on @ 10-11 *dances.. Oops, I mean "donces"* ^o^. I didn't have time to excer-ma-size today so I hope I'll have time later on today.  Anyways... this is all boring. Does anyone know where I can host my flash ani??! Damnit alls..
