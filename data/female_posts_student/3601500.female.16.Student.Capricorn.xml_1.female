Like Martin - and if you're reading this, Marty, know that I'm more tired than pissed - who just started chatting. We chatted about senseless stuff, which is amusing, but in this case just flat. Then he just out of no where says bye - while I always regret having to go - as in he's bored... insulting. I told him I'm pissed though and that I might not talk to him for a while - he wondered if that was a good or bad thing. Annoying prat. I need sleep.  In other news, decided to go for written driving test (for permit) Thursday. *grunts* I have to go, otherwise my mom will have to drive me to University. -_-  Too tired to think. Will post later.  ...I want a bunny, but not a pink one.
