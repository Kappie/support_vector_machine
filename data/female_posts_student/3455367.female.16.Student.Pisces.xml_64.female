How cool are these emoticons btw... check this one out:   hahahahaha, it's so Shiva.    Me, Shiva and Benji went driving today, that was fun.  I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow, maybe go driving again.. and do some homework. WOOOO FUN!   I hope there is a good party on next weekend.    *licks maya*    BYE BYE
