Either way, it would appear to be your lucky day. Or not. I'm really just trying to sound like I'm important; I'm not. Cool. Yes, maybe. Important. I doubt it.  Anyway, I've moved on to listening to  urlLink The Transplants ,  urlLink Diamonds and Guns . Hell, there is nothing like Tim Armstrong rapping. You gotta love it. (This link took a while to download, just to let you know. Be patient, it will work)       ::Diamonds and Guns::  Bombs goin off in Sierra Leone Taken more shots than Karl Malone Battle looms, your doom, injustice entombed Who got the diamonds? Who gonna find them? Who gonna mine them when the time comes? Diamonds and Guns, Diamonds and Guns  it's a wicked world that we live in it's cruel and unforgiving it's a wicked world that we live in it's cruel and unforgiving  Knock, knock, knock, who's that? It's Momma, son Lookin' for the bitch who took the money and run Now the daylight's gone and there's no more fun And who's the fuckin' bitch who stole all the heroin? Heroin, heroin, it's all gone Smoked it all up, and now you got none And now you look around and that's not the plan This is not what you had in mind  I shot in heaven, now I cry No one lives forever, in fact we all die From those who bust shots to those who stuff cops To those who serve rocks on all the hard blocks  Every last soul must pay the last toll In the dice game of life, who gets the last roll? Is it the one with the suit? The one with the sack? The one who hides behind his fuckin' gun and his badge? Negative outlook? Well that's how I'm livin' And like he said, it's a wicked world we live in  It's a wicked world we live in  I'm wiggin out, flippin' out, hearts is what I'm rippin' out I'm slippin' out, I'm dippin' out, killin's what I'm livin' out Pick 'em, let me pick 'em out, spin and let me whip it out Gat to your face with the fuckin' bullets stickin' out Missin' out, diss and bout, blood's what you're pissin' out 84 I'm Crazy Horse, shootin' up, I'm illin' out Rippin' out, I'm trippin' out, different now, I'm pimpin' out any color at my belt and ouch while they're clippin out Criminal I'm hittin' out, in L.A. no gettin' out 2-1-3, pack your P, fly wicked style Listen now, I'm sinnin' out, a 6-pack I'm sippin' out
