Me and Tyler biked into Colwood today. Took about 2 hours, we hung out at BK for a bit, then went to Thetis..I want to go back now, it's soooooo niice..Who wants to go?:P Then we started home, stopped to play at a playground, and to pick wildflowers every so often :) We had fun, which was good. My bum and legs, and back are so sore, and I'll pay for it tomorw, for sure. It's the start of a very busy week, everyone wants a piece of me (almost literally in some cases) so, in advance: If you get on the back burner, there's a reason for it. I have to start taking school seriously, and if I love my classes so much, then it shouldnt be too hard to try and pull off straight A's this semester.. *HOPES*  Adam, you and me need to re-make our plans for cuddle time! I still feel super bad about ditching it yesterday, but I felt like crap....Wasn't in a cuddle mood..:( NEXT TIME....Mwahaha..  I'm so sore, I'm gonna hit the sheets early for sure tonight. Especially because MEAN ANNETTA is making me walk home tomorw from her house. What a wasted hour.
