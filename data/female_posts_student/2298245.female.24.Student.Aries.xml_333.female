Ted Kennedy declared in a speech at the Brookings Institution: "Iraq is George Bush's Vietnam." John Kerry, Bush's foe and Kennedy's junior colleague, has made Vietnam, where by the way he served, the centerpiece of his campaign. It's interesting to find Kennedy of all people arguing that Bush's own record of service matches Kerry's.  Not that Kennedy's speech was entirely favorable to the president. Indeed, much of it was an anti-Bush rant. "In this administration," he said, "truth is the first casualty of policy," whatever that means. The  urlLink Associated Press  reports that Kennedy said, "This president has now created the largest credibility gap since Richard Nixon." And: "He has broken the basic bond of trust with the American people."  Mary Jo Kopechne could not be reached for comment.   I hope Kennedy keeps shouting his mouth off, because this could become a recurring bit in Best of the WEb, much like when it reports some story involving Arafat's continued support of terrorism with this statement:  "Arafat won a Nobel Peace Price in 1994."
