My sister's boyfriend (and pseudo-fiance) bought her some fish to put in a fish tank that he had left over from when he used to not live at home with his parents, and gave them all to my sister to keep in her apartment (or, more accurately, her trailer).  He bought the ones that looked the best, but apparently they were all very "aggressive" fish and now, there is only one left.  All the rest are dead, having been attacked by what I can only assume is the meanest one of all.  I'm sure that this was incredibly upsetting when it happened to my sister, but I can't help but smile about it.  It's typical of my sister's foibles, and what makes her such an endearing person.  Later, I was walking down the street, after having made a run to the Bridgemarket Food Emporium for some Haagen Dazs chocolate ice-cream and a Pepsi and a Lean Cuisine dinner, and I started thinking about this latest funk I have found myself in.  And I started to get confused with the cause and with the effect.  Am I depressed because I don't do things?  Or do I not do things because I am depressed?  As soon as I think I've pinpointed it, I only get confused in tracing it back.  And I think that by doing so I miss the point.  Because it doesn't matter which causes which - the point is they feed off of each other.  And it's important to try to break the cycle.  And since it is hard to break out of the depression end of it because it's all in my head, I've been making a concerted effort to get out and do things, and keep up with my routines (as I've said before), and I think that this little mini-depression may be nearing an end.  I still feel stressed and overwhelmed, but as this is a normal law school feeling, I'm willing to accept it, and it is easier to deal with this.  So that's the state of things.  Tentative, but it's the best I can do at the moment.  My paper is coming along slowly.  I am not used to this kind of writing, or really even writing at all since I've been doing very little of it since coming to law school.  It's funny because everyone talks about how good writing is potentially the most important thing for a lawyer, yet we do very little of it in school.  Just moving closer to my belief that law school has very little to do with the practice of law.  But as I don't have the luxury of skipping over the school part, bear with it I must.  And back to it I must go.    I don't normally say this, but special thanks to all who have taken the time to read my thoughts here and comment on them.  It has probably not been so fun a task as of late, but it means a lot to me that even one person reads, sympathizes and understands.  So thank you to all of you, whether I know you or not.
