On a lighter note, I spilled Cranbery juice alllll over Kel's carpet. I went up to her loft and dropped it down. It was GREAT. We made a whole crime scene thing. It was funny and I wrote on her floor upstairs where the new carpet will be put. I wrote, "Catie was here" and drew all sorts of things.  Then, Brett, Jamal, and John all showed up. It was a really nice surprise. Brett had this soap in his car that...wow, it smelled sooo good. I think I'm addicted. Hah. They brought oreos too. Mmm. They're now my favorite people. It was fun...until there was sort of a big fight. I'm not going to go into it but...I don't know. I just wish girls were less melodramatic. However there was comic relief throughout the night when they brought the seats from Brett's van inside to sit on since all of Kel's furniture is gone.   And, I'd like to write about my adventure with Mary Clare Sunday which, actually started the whole spat tonight. We went to see The Notebook, which was really, really good. It was cute. Sometimes I wish I lived in the 40's or 50's. Guys were so much more polite then. At least in movies. Then, we went out to the parking lot and we couldn't get MC's air conditioning to work and the windows wouldn't roll down!! It was terrible. We were so hot. So, we went to Colonial and we called her dad who came and told us we had the heat on to top it all! When we were driving, we were so hot we'd stop at lights and open the doors! People must've thought we were so weird. Haha. But yeah, we drove home and I walked in my house and I'm like...wow, it's warm. I asked my mom why it was so warm and she told me the air conditioner broke. I jusr thought it was kind of ironic.   Anyway, I'm pretty tired and I have a lot to do tomorrow. I'm going to sleeeep. Good night all.   P.S.-I'd just like to clarify how AWESOME yesterday was. :)
