(And it's got nothing to do with the fact that my cousin practically owns it..) Did I say that out loud? (No, I did) Hmm, moral rant now. I was thinking about how different people have different methods to get friends, doesn't any one now go for old fashioned plain simple nices friendly kindness? Hmm... guess we've all gotta be complexed now and think we're better than every one and every thing. (Pigheaded then) Yeah, I guess so!
