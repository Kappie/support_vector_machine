I held my senior photo and stroked with one finger my full head of curly beautiful hair, and wondered what the David of Fall 02' would have done differently had he known the fate which lie ahead of him; A slow death. Death by uglification.   Picture a monster who's existence is only confirmed through those he has destroyed. Invisible, lurking to and fro preying on the unsuspecting. The first thing he takes away is your self confidence. He infects your mind with thoughts of "should I wear a hat?" or "she's staring at it again, damn damn damn". He flaunts the fact that you will never be married. What slim chance you had, smothered. I know bald people, and listen to me people- they are not getting married anytime soon. I cannot blame women. I mean, if I were a woman I doubt I would choose the guy with a horseshoe over the younger man with all the same qualties save he HAS hair.  I would have smelled every rose just a moment longer. I would have cherished those times in Tribes 2 when I die 10 feet before capturing the flag, but my momentum causes the enemy flag to land ontop of ours for a capture. I would have asked Betsy Sue to go steady.  I'm learning to like the me I'm turning into. Perhaps if I'm lucky, I'll get a job as a manager for a fast food place in a low income neighborhood. Of course, I'll be 43 by then. I'll wear a little headset so people know who's in charge, and a seperately colored plastic name tag. I'll be the guy who always says his lines the  right  way as an example to the new employies. And on weeknights I'll drive home in my ford taurus, and watch taped VHS reruns of M.A.S.H to a TV dinner. And as I fall asleep on my lazy boy crying because I have no wife, I'll look past the trashcan full of empty rogain bottles and used subcriptions to the hair club for men, and see an 18 year old boy in a pictureframe who was blind to his own demise. The 18 year old who would never suspect himself turning into the kind of person who changes their answering machine message every time someone calls, because it so rarely happens.   The last coherent thought running through my mind before it drifts into blissful none-awareness will be on Eric, who lives in a big white mansion on the hill, married with 4 kids; 2 boys and 2 girls who always loved to run thier fingers through daddy's hair.  And if you don't think Eric fits into this whole scene, perhaps you should know that currently I dream of Eric stealing my wife about once every 3 weeks. If you think thats me just being insecure, then you should also know that yesterday Eric confessed that he had a dream he was jealous I was getting married, so he stole my wife and moved to hawaii where he found true happiness.  Done.
