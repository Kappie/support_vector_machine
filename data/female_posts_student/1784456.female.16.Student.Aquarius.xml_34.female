Oh, nothing important! All that stuff about foot-and-mouth, I haven't seen any of it. Some people (not saying any thing) were afraid that the country side would be full of it! Well none that I saw was. Hey, the governments paying me well to say this stuff! Hehe, wish it was. My Dad's gone mad on Kelly's ice-cream. Apparently it's from Cornwall and every time its out he likes to tell every one. Hmm. I'm beginning to think that the world hasn't gone mad, I have. Oh yeah forgot to say this all this time, DEATH TO MACDONALD'S! Hey, sue me. Wow! It's ike pitch black and it's only 5:45!
