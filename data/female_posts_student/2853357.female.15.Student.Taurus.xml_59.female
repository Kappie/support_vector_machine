(that i can do... *glares furiously*)  um...  angels and demons  is lying on my desk. which reminds me, mom left for mexico for 9 days and bought another dan brown book for the plane trip. and i SO WANTED TO READ IT! so i was going to give her  the da vinci  for her plane so i could take the other book, BUT, apparently, ryan let gina borrow it and i'm seeing gina TODAY! and mom left YESTERDAY MORNING.    ah well.   ok, bored again.    ta patty
