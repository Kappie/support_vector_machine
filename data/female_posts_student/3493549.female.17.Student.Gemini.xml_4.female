Last night, I dreamt about this chair in my room which started moving by itself and I tried to scream but my throat felt so constricted. When I tried to run away from the 'ghost' chair, it was as though somebody had tied me to the bed. *shudders* There's something about these nightmares; they leave you feeling all helpless and that really sucks. Now I don't feel like going to bed tonight, I'll just toss and turn all night anyway. I've been having problems sleeping since I was young and my friend calls me an insomniac. I'm not too sure if that's true though. Sigh...   Wk came over today and Jay, Wk and I played Monopoly. Jay was the big winner and Wk was in debt about $7000 over. Lol. It was really fun and at least I wasn't losing, ha-ha. I actually invited Wk over to study but well, let's just say we got carried away. Firstly, we talked for more than an hour and then decided to leave our physics and bio behind and play Monopoly. The tough part was waking Jay up. hehe. Anyway I had to leave the game early so all my properties and cash was inherited by Wk while I went off for yet another driving lesson. I spent an hour driving around the driving range all my by myself while the instructor went off, probably for dinner or to smoke. It was fun the first few rounds but after that, I was bored and since he was nowhere in sight, I started speeding..well, just a little bit *grinz*. Then, the instructor let me drive home and it was the first time I drove on the road. Pretty fun actually. The only thing is everytime I look at the side mirror, cars behind me are signalling to get out of my lane. Well, don't blame me! I was only going at 60kmph! lol!
