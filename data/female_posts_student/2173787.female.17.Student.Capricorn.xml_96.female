My grandmother called this morning because my grandfather was having chest pain and trouble breathing, but he refused to let her call EMS.  So my parents ran to his house and took him to wakemed.  I'm stuck at home not knowing what is going on and when I called to let them know that I was coming up, they told me not, at least until they knew something.  Fuck that.  I want to go now, but I won't, I'll sit here pulling out my hair but not going because it would just be more stress on my parents.
