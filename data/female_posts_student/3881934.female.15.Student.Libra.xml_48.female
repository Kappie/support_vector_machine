Lik wad mani had said, todae topic will definately be on O LVL MT RESULTS nehx.. Well, not gonna reveal wad I've gt YET.. Tell u wad happened todae first bahx..   Earli in e mornie gt called out by Elanie to get e OARS cheque.. N moi first thinking is tht 'My hair is messy!!' Lolx.. So not presentable nehx.. Haha.. Den, saw Lindi and she din reali look good.. Hence, I went over to show moi concern.. ( Hello! I'm concern abt ppl de, u noe.. Stop qns-ing mi nehx.. ) Den, found out tht she gt some itchy rashes appearing lorx.. So, told MsChow abt it  accompained her all e way while e Upper Sec ppl were running.. Sobbiex.. I wanted to run nehx.. Nvrm.. Take it as I zhuan bahx..  Den, gone back to class fer lessons lorx.. Nth much either nehx.. After English was Physics.. Sigh.. Used to lik physics, but no more.. Wonder wad gt into MrKoo nowadays man.. So weird.. N he din seems to feel fer our MT results, noe? It's lik he dun seems interested at all sia.. Let alone tht, bell rang at 10  still refuse to let us go whn he noe clearly tht MrLim is outside n his lessons has ended.. Gosh.. Tht's so barbarian lik man.. I'm not being baised.. I'm merely stating a fact nehx.. Isn't it so.. Cuz I'm not e onli one who sae this arx.. DiaOx.. Hao.. NEXT~!!   Results was announced.. 100% passes!! WhOox~!! !*Sup man*! 43% dist.. Almost half but not yet.. Sigh.. Cuz tht was wad MrLim wanted MORE than half a class dist.. We disappointed him nehx.. Can't disclose ppl grades here, so generally tell u how they fare lorx.. Those who r suppose to get A, gt their A.. Those suppose to fail, manage to clinch a B/C.. Lolx.. N guess wad I got? Dun tell u lehx.. =P Dun ask.. Not gonna tell u.. Haha.. getting a lil lame.. But, no way M i gonna tell.. Lolx.. Anywai, seen onli tears of sadness fer our lvl lorx.. Sigh.. Qt a couple of ppl cry over e results.. Well, did I? I was expecting myself to.. But, still I din.. Dun b disappointed.. Guess mani were expecting mi to cry ehx.. Lolx.. Well, mayb u can sae tht I'm jux being greedy fer wanting higher grades.. Who dun, ryte? Everybody wants e best fer themselves.. E highest grade obtainable mahx.. N i guess I'm one of them whn it comes to results.. B3 to someone who failed consistantly in Sec3 thru out  earli Sec4 is indeed a sense of achievement.. Guess I expected this grade but, jux dun wanna resign, u see.. Plus as a matter of fact tht I gt Dist fer moi Oral.. N tht's sth good, I guess? So, main prob now is to retake or not..? =X  I can sae tht I'm not confident enough to get a Dist.. I have to admit tht MT paper is easy to score but, It's onli a matter of HOW WELL? Sitting e same paper as those higher MT candidates simply drop moi confident.. Plus, izzit worth it to spend so much time  effort on a sub tht mite not have any improvement? Sigh.. So mani qns.. All ard a circle n back to e same point.. Will lady luck b wid mi den? Wun things b better if I jux concentrate on e other 6? Or do I have a higher adventage to score a dist wid my oral dist? Sigh sigh sigh.. Anywai, u din noe I gt B3 ryte? Shhh.. Nobody noes.. Dun tell anyone lahx..   N u noe wad? Todae oral is on Campcraft, camping  leadership etc man.. WhOox.. Certainly seems to b 100% nicely fit fer mi, ryte? Lolx.. Jk lahx.. But, I have to sae tht if I gt this topic, I wld b laughing till all my teeth drop man.. It seems so easy.. Esp to Wt, kaiyuan, Esper  Shufang man.. Make mi so jealous.. Nvrm.. Luck counts.. Who ask moi dad surname not A-H de? Lolx.. Jk lahx.. Gimme free de, I oso dun wan lahx.. Lolx..  MrsAnshad is finally back! Simply feel so warm-hearted to c her back again n this time as our Co- form.. WhOox.. Lolx.. Hope I will work harder n score well bahx.. Guess it's been 200 yrs ever since I last pass my Chem paper, despite of studying so hard? Mayb I'm not a Chem student at all bahx.. No worries.. I wun give up de.. ( I hope so! ) Lolx..   Sat having e SPF badge rehearsal.. Have I said it b4 anywhr? Nvrm.. Jux reminding myself bahx.. Wonder if e BBQ is still on mahx.. Gonna comfirm again tml.. Hope not lyk e previous Sat man.. So diaOx.. Feel lyk catching more movies.. Craving~! Haha.. Tml's e last dae of e week le.. Finally.. Hope everything wld b fyne.. Esp to those taking Oral de bahx.. N a BIG BIG congrats to those who fared well in their Mt paper n those who din perform up to expections, dun worrie.. Dere's a second chance fer this arx.. Wadever izzit, ppl live in e furture.. Get things over n done wid.. Be brave to move on bahx.. Prelims + O lvl fer 6 other Sub is still waiting fer us in 80 daes' time nehx.. JIA YOU, M2.. We mux all strive together!! WhOox..
