Today we actually did something...we had a quiz...so0o easy ( we did it with a partner so it was 10X easier )   After summer school I came home and ate...then my mom and I went over to the mall to Barnes  Noble mostly but we ventured down the mall!! I got some cool flip flops in Dillard's...they had some really cute ones but not my size so I got some fuzzy slipper flip flops!!! They are so0o0o comfy!! I got my book from the Summer Reading List! I chose...When you come to a fork in the road take it by Yogi Berra!! It sounded like a good one...better than the other ones!!!  Okay...anyone who is taking AP Euro next year you'll understand...what the hell (pardon my french) are we supposed to do?Â¿? He expects us to write 6 jammin essays and know all the nations or countries or something on  planet earth !! Yeah okay see ya there....NOT!! haha! Oh well its only the second week of vacA but whatever its still stupid!!!   Who are three people you would want to have dinner with? they could be alive or dead...I'm still trying to decide who to bring and where to go...oh well I'll finish it by 8 tomorrow morning!! lol  "Normal People Scare Me"
