I am inclosing my arms, grasping hands, fingers white, bloodless, entwined in the lost hope that I shall close this gap before it allows my last breath of sanity escape ...   refuge.    the only place of comfort that swims before my aching eyes is that of a small house full of children. I will go there and be comforted. I don't know when I shall return.    I will return.    someday.
