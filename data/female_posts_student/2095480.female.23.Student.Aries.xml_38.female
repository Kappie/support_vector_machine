I was driving around the other night and flipped on my brights - that was when it occurred to me that I didn't even think it, I just did it. We do that alot. We all have our different things. Musical instruments, computers, language, vocational skills. Kinda crazy.  2) Stop and enjoy the sunshine once in a while. Its simple really - but I actually did it today between classes, and it felt so good.  3) Celebrate a good grade, at this point they are far and few.  I have had alot more, but that's all I remember for the moment. If you have a random thought, post it. Later.
