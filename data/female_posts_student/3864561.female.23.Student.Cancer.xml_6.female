But I just read last night's match report on BBCi and thought it was worth a quick mention (full detailscan be found  here ). I do realise that gloating over this win after having had little interest for the last few months makes me a glory supporter but hey, what the hell; I suffered throughSuper League 1996when we onlygot 12 pointsall season under Dean Bell so I think I've earned it.   Note to Iestyn Harris: I think you've backed the wrong horse, mate.
