Helooo this is me, that anti-social girl of the year talking! Ok, ok, so I was watching tv ok? Nah, I had the two smells over and we watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail  again ! I'm still trying to get Izzy to watch 10th Kingdom! (It's sooo good!) And really funny. Ok, so I messed up the whole brackets thing but toody doo! Ahh... we were all talking about some one who we'll call... AND who likes Izzy! (If you know our friends you'll know who it is... or you won't and still be clueless, ah heck) *maybe it's an invisable guy Izzy made up!* Probably. Eeek, musn't say too many of my thoughts! Ahh yeah, then you'll find out that I'm actually mad, and I'd rather that you were stuck with the assumption that I was mad. (EH?) Eeek, shh mind! BACK to the point. Geez, really need to keep a close check on my mind! Any way, Izzy doesn't know what to say if AND asked her out, hell my life's just one big teen movie, or one crappy Peach Girl book... Stick with the movie... Ahh, it's late and I have to get up early to go into Brittol, buisisi!
