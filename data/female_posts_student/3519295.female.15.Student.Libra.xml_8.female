MWAH-HA-HA!!! :) ...or at least he did Freitag... On Friday night at about 10:00 the phone rang and the King of Mixed Signals (HIMSELF!!!) asked what I was doing. Turns out he and his Best Friend Forever from Tay-hoss (texas) are roaming around the neighborhood and wanted to give me a ring. I didn't think that my parents would let me out of the house that late, especially to visit boys, so I was like "I'm sorry, Dan, but I can't!" (that was his friend from Texas' name...Dan. )and he's like "but Frank told me all about you and all I want to do is shake your hand, come on" so I asked my mom and she was like "just for a few minutes" and I was like "cha-ching!" So they came over. I was sitting on my mailbox when I saw Frankie walking under a streetlight next to this kid with alot of blonde hair, almost all the way down to his chin. He walked up and shook my hand and then like, looked me up and down and said"Okay, Frank, now I believe you." I was like OMG!!! you are the freaking hottest dude I've ever seen in my whole life!!! After I got over how awesomely gorgeous Texas Dan was,  we hung out in the front yard till exactly 11:08, when my little sister, for the third time, told me it was late and I should come back in. They told me to sneak out of the house at midnight and meet them by the pool to hang out with (I quote) "The hottest buckaroos in all of the Midwest".  Sadly, i did not get to meet them because it scared the pants off me just thinking about getting caught not sleeping innocently in my room.  But, yes, now I am madly-in-love-slash-hate-slash-like with Frankie again. But my new SoulMate of the Week is: DAN FROM TEXAS!!!   p.s.     why don't seagulls fly over the bay? duh; then they'd be bagels.
