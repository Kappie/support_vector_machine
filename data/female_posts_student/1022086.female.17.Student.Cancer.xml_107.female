It's catchy, though... who could forget it?! *Jams out*  Hmmm... the past few days have been absurdly fun and fairly exuberantly recreational but relatively physically and cerebrally exigent (w00t for the proverbial cup!!). For essentially half the weekend I, so to say, congregated with a Coty for the first time in aboot a year, or something to that extent anyway. It was generally her first appearance in this home, and the first time in likely three-or-a-decent-enough-such-estimate years that she had been yonder over--here anyhow... 'twas fun. I nearly cannot believe we're seniors. Coty and I used to be inseparable at age 11-- she was fundamentally my first actual friend when I scoowampled to move to the USA, and I find it amazing that, out of all the folk I befriended back then, she is still in contact and good rapports with me. The fellowship of the long-haired foreign-or-close-enough two (soon-to-be long-haired one, however) actually managed to survive and maintain itself decently afloat to this day. I hope we'll be able to keep in touch throughout college as well although I know that she has no intention whatsoever to attend either of my potential scholastic choices.   Any-with-a-how, 'twas fun. I still ache from excess swimming and kids' toy expropriation missions that we effected at her house. We're talking five consecutive hours of unrelenting motion, kids... Fran here is getting a little too old to do that easily (I never thought it would come to this!).  Today we went bonkering--shopping, that is, and that was strictly amusing (figure it out). My mom did her share of nuisance for a while, obviously, but once she calmed down, all was better. I got some stuff... 's interesting. I'm not really one for hours and hours of shopping, so I'm really tired, but it was fun nonetheless, and I fit into some stuff I actually liked, which is nearly unheard of and yay.   Life right now is so sporadic, and I hardly have a clue of what's scoowampling to happen. There are very many things left to do before leaving, and, on top of that, I have no earthly idea exactly when I'm leaving yet!!! This is going to be interesting, to say the least. Be aware that, if I suddenly just depart from the continent and you knew nothing of it, it's no personal issue between the you and the I. I just may not get to telling you. So, yeah. That. Hmmm. I have to do a whoooooooooole lot of phone calls and laundry, I do know that fo' sho'. Loads to do! Hmmm, I may just go read a bit more of that morbid Jane alien's story now... although the plot is truly agonizing to read. I will give Bronte props for writing intriguingly enough to keep me awake (I even have to look up a word here and there, and I actually find that a good thing ---I'm foreign).  Oh, and I do believe I'll have a poodle cat sometime really soon (very likely this week). Shall snap a photo if I get a chance. ^.^
