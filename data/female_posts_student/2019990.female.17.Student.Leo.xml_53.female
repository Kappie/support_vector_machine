Today was an easier day of work, there were less paients, and we had to leave early anyway to pick up my aunt, from ND, from the airport.  My grandma came in for lunch today, and stayed the afternoon repacking sample pills to take to the Ukraine.  It's so awesome, we bring diffle bags of pills, an medical supplies over.  We also got a bunch of donations in the mail today.  It's shaping up, no all we need to do is pack.  It's really too bad that the girl my age can't go though.  I'm rather sad. Big news today, Wed. is the day all the sales reps come into my aunts office, and today they brought pens!  I have two new ortho-trycyclene pens!  And then they had this bucket full of old pens, and I got to take as many as I wanted of those too.  I love the medical pens  they're so mch fun.  I'll have to show them to you when I get back.  I love them.  That was definitly the highlight of my day.   After the airport we went for a walk again.  My aunt is trying to get us in shape for the Ukraine, because the cars are so bad over there, everone walks if the destination is within a few miles.  So I need to bring comfy shoes.  But walking is better on your feet than just standing there in my opinion, so I don't think it should be a problem.   I think my grandma is getting somewhat senile.  She's really confused a lot.  She's getting lost in my aunts house, and we have to watch her to make sure she comes back from the bathroom when we eat out.  It's really sad.  She can't move around very well either, she has to take a cane everywhere she goes now.  And she looked exhausted as we left the airport, and I bet she didn't even walk a block while we were in there.  So I decided I could definitly never go into geriatrics.  It would make me so sad.   Well that's all for now.  Oooh that was a good thunder!  It's bedtime for this girl. Miss and Love you all.  Mwah
