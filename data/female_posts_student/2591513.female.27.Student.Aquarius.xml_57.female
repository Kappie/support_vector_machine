We NEED the extra money...but I guess what is really getting to me is that I want to be pampered when I am sick.  I swear, when I am sick, I have to do everything.  I know, the job of mommy.  Well and then I was thinking, he is leaving again soon.  By June, he will be returning to Iraq.  Am I ready for him to go?  No.  With Americans dying there everyday, how can you prepare yourself for something like that?  I mean, yeah...DRAMATIC....I am just saying, he is such  a HUGE part of my life, HUGE part of me.  I can't imagine him not being with me...I can't imagine raising our children without him.  These are the things no woman likes to think of, but a military wife always has in the back of her mind.  I know that God will forever keep us under His care.  Okay, well goodnight everyone...that was the last thought roaming around my medicated mind.
