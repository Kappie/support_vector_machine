Coz we're talking scandal'us here!!!  Anyway, I watched "pay it forward" and it's really gooooodddd!!! I did the life expectancy test while watching cast away - i'm gauranteed to live over 65 - (i missed some of the questions so i don't know for sure)...i don't think that show was good for those planning to end their lives early..hmmm  Guys i want to warn you about Zheng's driving!!! - She's not like Mary who likes to drive at 20 km/h (btw, Mary there's nothing wrong with that - safe speeding all the way!!!) and she's not like Marija, who would drag race with any stranger just so that she would feel like she was on the fast and the Furious with her Vinny  Zheng's a case of her own - she prefers to drive over small children and fluffy animal - she seeks danger!!!  But if ur a thrill seeker like me - (i like to steal science equipment and homework) then join Zheng in her aim to wreek havoc on the streets of Kogarah - coz i'm a joiner!!!  Ok, Nat, there's no use fighting over Ioan - let's just ask Ioan who he wants to be with ok?  may the better georgie win!! And Tina - u were very immature about his tongue, but i forgive you, for u are just a mere mortal amongst powerful, graceful, chocoholic immortals like myself and Ioan  do u not realise his tongue is the cause of divine intervention!!!  Anyway, my bubbly budds (alliteration!!!!) I'm outta here
