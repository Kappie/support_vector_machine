Today I had nothing to do, so i went to LCC with my mom (she works there), she showed me around, then we attempted to fix a lamp with tack. It didn't work, but we spent a good hour at it. Then i came home, made dinner (fried dumplings, rice, brussel sprouts), probably my favorite meal. Now im here, tommorow is death from above. I want to go, but im...broke. I need a job, so i think i'll be getting one if i can handle it (with schoolwork and whatnot) anyway. I need to buy some books.
