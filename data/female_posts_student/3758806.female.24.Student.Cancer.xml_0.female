I'm going to head out to the open-air show, and hopefully not re-experience what that old man did to me on the metro today..... Ick!!  Yuck!!!!  Bleck..... *shudders*...... Nevermind.   Ew.  I was meeting with a mentor of mine for a drink earlier this evening, and I had a gin and tonic while he had a rum and coke.  When we finished those, he ordered another round, but I had a Diet Coke instead.  He thought this was odd.  "Celeste," he asked, "How do you expect to write a believable dramedy about substance abuse when you have never experienced  intoxication ? How are you qualified?  You must write that which you know...".... I debated for a moment whether or not to tell him, and I decided to go for it.  Like Jack Kerouac wrote (before he drank himself to death), "O the pain of telling these secrets which are so necessary to tell, or why write or live" ( The Subterraneans , p. 17)... Ok, without getting too preachy now (look at me, quoting Kerouac, sheesh)I explained: I have avoided these things because I am not so egotistical to think I'm strong enough to be in control of the things which have held hostage my father, sister, brother, aunts and uncles, cousins, great uncles, and grandparents...  But  seeing this first hand for 23 years (and being sober the whole time) puts me in the perfect position to talk, and even joke about it as I do... but it's a  cautionary  joke.  And believe me,  I know far too well...  Vous me comprenez bien, j'espere...   *wink*   Anyhow, there are plenty of other things in life which are intoxicating in their own way...  On a different note, I finished my professional communications class today with an A (one percentage point away from an A+).  And then my professor asked me out.  He's a very handsome and intelligent man (only 13 years my senior, which is just under the wire for my 15 year rule), but it just didn't seem appropriate to me, as I have another semester before I finish this program in early December.  But yes.... an A....  *pats self on back*
