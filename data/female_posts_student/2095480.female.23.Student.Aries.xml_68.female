He came over last night after closing (Locos), his last night in Valdosta, and we simply curled up on the couch for a while. Not much had to be said... we both knew. We actually fell asleep hand-in-hand... and for the first time I believe I loved and was loved in return.  I    2)  I was on  national radio  tonight! I called into the  Jim Bohannan Show  out of Washington DC and was put on the air live... Yay Me! The the topic was driver safety, and the reason I called in was because when I wrecked my car in March, I was on the cell phone... which was the primary topic of the show. Basically, we were debating whether or not cell phones were safe.   3) My brother  Richard   (Biology Major, Furman Univ.) is currently at Woods Hole, outside of Boston, doing scientific research on, well... little creatures from the Pacific ocean, and next week he ships off on a research vessel in Seattle to actually do site research. I'm really concerned about him... here is an example of some of his text messaging w/ me:     ~hate life right about now ~i am just too dman (sic) tired  Me: whatcha working on?  ~DVM and copepods ~ i have gotten only 9 hrrs the last three days    I really hope he will be okay... He has limited time, and he has to do well on this research project.   4)  I talked to a friend today that is currently a music teacher here in GA (VSU graduate). He just had a devastating break up with his girlfriend and he is having a hard time. I spent quiet a while on the phone with him today. Break ups are hard... I wish they didn't exist. I find that alot of what we have to deal with at college are directly related to them... maybe we should outlaw dating and go back to arranged marriages. JUST KIDDING!   5)  I got a phone call at about 3am the other night.. from a buddy of mine who is in the local chapter of a friendly fraternity on our esteemed campus. Basically the conversation went like this:   Him: Are you awake? Me: Yes Him: Are you sober? Me: Yes Him: I need your help. I need you to come get me right now. Me: Okay, no problem. Where are you? Him: Bill's Bayou. [which is nearly around the corner from me] Me: I'll be there. Let me put on decent clothes.  Him: Thank you.   So I get there and all I see is blue lights. He had been pulled over while DUI. The back up police officer was Derick, told him... Look, Liz lives around the corner, if you can get her here now I'll let you go. So there you have it... I rescued a friend. *smiles*    A very close issue to my heart:  I am very worried about a friend of mine (who shall remain nameless here... but I know you read this occasionally.  (I hope I don't offend you by putting this up.. if it does let me know and I'll remove it from the website.)  This is the away message that my friend is currently using:   Be still, my soul, as I lay here dying.  Reliquish control; the turning point has come.  Be still, my soul, with broken bones here lying.  Enrapture the Lord; the darker day is done, for the victory has been won.  Just a suicide away from home.  So I'm here waiting, afraid to make the move, drunk on wine and moonshine that floods into this room.  And I can't stop thinking of streets paved with gold.  The fingers laid on razor blade, I am coming home.    While the writing is fantastic, the underlying message to me is very scary. Please, if you need someone to help... please call. I'm here for you.   Regarding that debate about a woman as president...   Thank you Eziel for your comment/ question regarding what happened the other day in my conversation regarding presidents.   My points in the discussion were pretty simple to be quite honest. I pointed out that many successful women had held a variety of offices in Washington, as well as in other countries and I reminded him that India and Great Britain both have had female prime ministers. To this he said "yeah but they aren't American, and its only American women I'm concerned about here." Well, duh... only Americans can hold office right? Moving on... I also added that the Army now had a woman as a one-star general.. and I asked how he felt about that. He said that as long as she had no buttons (reference to Nukes) to push it was okay. I also tried to comment that it was very likely that Hillary would be nominated for president in 2008, and he said that every man and most woman would vote against her. I'm not so sure. Isn't about 52% of the nation female? Today on talk radio, and I am definitely going to tell him about this tomorrow, several Washington insiders belief that George W. will dump Cheney as VP, and nominate Condi, and add to that Kerry will select Hillary. Now, how cool would that be? I think both of these women are wonderful leaders and I know they are infinitely smarter than many guys I know. Many women are very patient and rational - and add to that most women that are high enough in government to even be considered for the VP or Prez office are age 50+, the whole hormone argument is invalid. My main comment to him was: I just hope that a man as arrogant about the abilities of women as you does not end up in any place of power.  Harsh I know.. but that is how I feel! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  *Sighs. I miss Davis alot. I wish a few of you had met him.*
