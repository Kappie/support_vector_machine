Hey kiddo- so I'm taking in all your logged transmissions little pieces at a time, can't over do it, then I will have nothing to look forward to for tomorrow, can I tell you how excited I was that you called, thrilled, anyway, think I already told you that.... Hows life??? I forgot to ask hows Cabana Boy???? hahaha... I thought that was entertaining myself. I mean don't let me discourage you, even if he is a loathsome bottom feeder who attaches and then sucks every last happy memory out of your body and replaces it with his own dissatisfaction, and self-hate, as well as hate for anything else that moves..... Ok ok I guess I'll quit, I still don't like him. Ok you know what I'll give him a chance but only if you want me to. He's going to have to pass a couple of tests however..... Test number 1: Crawling on hands and knees across the surface of a recently erupted volcano, while complementing your amazing sense of style, your humor, grace, wit, poise, and brilliance......Test number> 2: He must go with me to my bar and spend an entire night not watching girls make out with each other but instead tell me how much he misses your company, and how he wishes he was cuddling with you watching girlie flicks all night long, and if his eyes wander for even a second, I'm stabbing them out with a rusty spoon.and the last test, Test number 3: He must learn Latin, then recite William Shakespeare's entire collected works from memory while strumming a lute and dancing around in some very restrictive tights, while smiling...... Anyway, I thought it was funny...OK Love you lots, and I miss you a million bottles of peach propel
