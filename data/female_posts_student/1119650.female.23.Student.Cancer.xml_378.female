You exist to continue your existence. What's the point?  What's the point of your existence?  To feel! 'Cause you have never done it, you can never know it. But it's as vital as breath. And without it, without love, without anger, without sorrow, breath is just a clock... ticking     Thats a lil bit out of the movie Equilibrium   Its a utopia stoy you know how those go but I liked this alot I thought maybe it woudl be dull but the action is fun story agian you see it comeing sorta cause what mroe can a utopian story be but it tells it good and i liked it i wish it was still on i wish it was 80 hours long
