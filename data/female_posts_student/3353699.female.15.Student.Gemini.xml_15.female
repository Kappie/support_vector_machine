(WHOO)and um the yeah yeah yeah, (But they really suck im sorry what's her name CANNOT sing) don't think i saw anyone else. we left after the beastie boy because all that was left was umm what's their names.... uhhh The Strokes. idon't really like them. so it was all right. the only relaly bad thing is that my feet were hurting and people smoke soooo much there that everywhere you turn there's smoke. oh yeah and it got really hot and then really cold later hehe. but it was great other than that. even though i wanted to see story of the year. oh well. i still wanna go to warped tour more, but have no one to go with! poo. oh well. type again later -drea oh yeah i invited the guy to my b-day. yeah, it was nothing big. doubt he'll even go but whatever.
