Of course, you can't go to  any  event these days without there being some sort of political statement, but that's okay. Personally, I thought it was great when he started shooting fake blood out of a water pistol. You don't see that everyday. Good fun. And once again, I've probably drank more then I should. It seems to be the weekend for it!
