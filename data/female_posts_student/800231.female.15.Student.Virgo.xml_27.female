Oh, I don't want him to yell at me again... After all I've done to erase him, I'm going back. It seems almost like I'm going home, revisiting the building and all. I'm scared, not of him, of everyone there. Lucia and Helen seem to think that my fear is some sort of joke. It's not, I don't need to feel any lower. Let him be nice for once! Pretend to care, or at least don't show you hate me. God, let him have missed me.
