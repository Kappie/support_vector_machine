Well all but 3 who were sitting in front of us and didn't even change their clothes from the ones they were wearing that day!  But oh well I'm not their parents so nothing to be worried about!  Later one in the night IMPROVE did a little thing for us and it was great! Right before that my dad left so I decide to just laugh and not care! Which I did!:D And today at school Mrs. Banga apologized for Mr.Puscus not being there and he should have told someone or her so she could have presented it to me and she felt very bad and Mrs.Hrazney shook my hand because no on did last night and we both kind of laughed at how big of jerks teachers really can be!  I had a lot of stuff I really needed to talk about but now I forget:S! That's not good! Oh so today Brett Wylie won Tickets to the first rider game right?! Well he doesn't like the riders so he gave them to me! But one big problem! I don't know who to take with me!!! There is Ashley, Michelle, Megan, Jackie, Taylor, and Neil were all possible choices but one problem Neil will probably think its a date but I know he likes football well I am pretty sure since he wears a football bunny hug or so I think That's what it is because I was talking to Dan and he said something about sundevils I think play football I just know the sweater has a smiley face sunshine one it so I don't know I am guessing its football and he tried out for the team last year but he will probably think its a date when two friends are just going to watch a football game and Then there are the girls and I know if I pick one and not the other they might get mad because they are girls and it always happens I am guilty for that this is so hard to choose!!!!! ARGH!!!! I NEED MORE TICKETS! Hey shawn if you read this do you like football? NOT A DATE! lol Rhiannon I know if you were in Regina and didn't have your own tickets I know I would ask you with out a doubt but now....I don't know what I am going to do:( its like I am picking my soccer team okay whose the best kicker....? whose the best goalie? LIKE I DON'T CARE!!!!! I JUST NEED ONE FRIEND WHO NO ONE WILL GET JEALOUS OF AND THAT LIKES FOOTBALL!!!!! When Jason asked if he could go with me I should have just said yes! I am so stupid! ARGH!  Anywho until I know what else to write about I am out  later gator!
