I found many of the poems to be vignette oriented, with one being in letter format, one pantoum and one prose-poem. There were no ekfrasis poems, but maybe they should start? They have a deadline of September 15 and everyone from our class should send 3-5 poems. The publication comes out of Greensboro North Carolina. Pick up a copy, read it and see if your stuff fits in. Sorry I have no comment on the story content. I'll write all the submission info if you want it, but you're better off buying it, reading it, then sending out.   J
