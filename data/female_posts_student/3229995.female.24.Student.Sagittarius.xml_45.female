The Eighties pop band Duran Duran took their name from ... yep you guessed it: The evil scientist Duran Duran.     The Matmos is the name of the evil energy liquid form that almost wipes out the universe in Barbarella. Are these people also inspired by the film?   urlLink MATMOS    Luc Besson's "The fifth element" (1997) with it's fantastically fashionable outer space (costumes designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier), females dressed in minimalist plastic and The ultimate evil threatening to destroy the universe was also inspired by Barbarella.
