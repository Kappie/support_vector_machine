Last night I went to see the Broadyway musical  Fosse  at the Bell. It was such an amazing experience. They were selling shirts and programs and eychains, mugs, magazines, pins, hats, etc. I stocked up! Not that many musicals sell merchandise at the Bell. (I made a RENT shirt. Fell thru though. ;_;)I had been looking toward this all season long! The dancers were almost flawless and the movements for every body part were spectacular. it just shows me again how big the world of dance is from the little Show Choir we have @ ST. Speaking of Show Choir, I heard that president was between Natalie and myself. And I saw the list and saw "President" beside Natalie's name. Of course she was best friends to the pres this past year so it's all about  who you know  not the talent. It really bugged me throughout the evening. However, I will choreograph my own dances (Fosse has really inspired me) and I will choreograph 3 numbers this summer not including the greatest idea to perform "Hey Ya." I will show them all. I'm not angry at Natalie or anything, it's just how she got there is what ticks me off like no other.  I had a date with Jack tonight. We went over to Berry's and Stephanie's house. There we ranted over the OD and made fun of one of my "ex"-friends. Long story. But it was hilarious hearing them talk. We hung out on the computer because they had all these cool black lights around. We watched a strange pantey obsessed anime called "Colorful," which was fairly odd but funny as hell.  Thank God! I finally fixed that damn virus on my profile on AIM. I just hope it stays. Here I'll recommend the service! http://www.jayloden.com/VirusClean.htm I checked around the site to besure it was a reliable source and it sure was. I am soooo happy that I do not have to get another screen name!  I miss Jack already. He was looking really good tonight in blue. It went good with his red hair. Hehe!  I'm tired. I really want to work on my ever so continuing Sailor Neptune scrapbook. It's pictures of accumulated pics of Neptune from Sailor Moon that I have collected for 6 years since my first year in middle school.  G'night all!
