Sometimes, the car gets off course and I crash and burn, but somehow, I always seem to find my way out of that situation and back onto the road.  I know that it didn't always seem like I was making any progress.  It didn't seem like I was an actual Christian because I was having so much trouble.  Well, I wasn't.  I was having troubles relying on GOD.  For a while now, I have been relying on myself and nobody else to do things to help me with things.  But then, I got into one fine mess.  GOD had to send someone to clean it up.  Only a few people came to my rescue.  These select few have helped me get out of that mess, out of the grasps of Satan.  It has taken a few years, but they are working with me and we are all working with GOD to return my life to what it should be.  Well, at least what would be best for me.  They have helped me more than I think anyone could have ever helped me.  I know that you may think that I'm just doubting everybody else.  I'm not.  Anybody can do anything they want.  I know that, I've sort of learned that.  What I am talking about though is the fact that, even though, they know I don't want to hear it and even though it is something that they don't want to tell me.  It is something I have to know.  They are open, they don't tell me anything that is a lie.  They have become like a mother and father to me and I shall forever be grateful to them both.  I believe that if I stick with them, I will grow and prosper forever.  I can do anything with GOD, my adopted mother, and my adopted father.  We are all helping hands to each other.  They are the best ones anyone could ever have.  IT IS ALL GOD!!
