I was cleaning with that decrepit vacuum of herswhen it fell over and the on/off switch broke. Now, it won't turn off when it's plugged in. I already said sorry but no she won't have it.She's still nagging at me now.I'm inanother room with headphones blastingaway music in an attempt to drown her out. It's difficult.I can still hear her asking me things; I have to answer at least some of the questions (or else she'll barge in here).    Is it really necessary for parents to drive their own flesh and blood up the walls? It must be their mission. Is she trying to push me away by causing all this stress? Stress. That's the big word. Lately, she been more I don't know. Very moody? She's always hyper in tense situations. She needs to breathe. Deeply. But will she listen? Oh, no...she just  has  to cause chaos by acting hysterical and then passing the mood to everyone else around her. Yeah, good job.   I need space. It's way I'm here typing with my headphones- I can't handle the frustration that comes with her presence every time she argues.   ::sigh:: I recently received an invitation from the National Society of High School Scholars and two more college aid letters. I have to pay a fee for NSHSS membership and a processing fee for one of the college aid submissions. Oh yeah, in addition, there's my senior portraits left to pay for. The college process and, especially, public education aren't cheap.   I'm excited for my last year of high school and apprehensive of applying for college, though. I have to retake the SAT I and SATIIs; my scores were average and I was eligible for aid with them but...colleges are so competitive now. I really need a better score.   I feel much calmer now. I'm not really that mad at her any more. I know she cares...but still does she have yell so shrilly? Writing is becoming more of a necessity to me nowadays. Also, it's much easier to vent to a journal than my mother. Safer too- less headache.
