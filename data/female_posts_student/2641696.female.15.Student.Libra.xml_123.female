She has much strength and persuasion, even over MSN. *sigh* Whatever.   She's suggesting that I write about the CDs and books I got today. Hmm.. okeedoke! Me and me family went to Futureshop and got a bunch of CDs... I bought two David Usher CDs (older ones), and and an older one by Danny Michel. Yup. I love David Usher especially, though :P he's super cool!!   Then we headed over to Booklore, a small private bookstore that's awesome and always has lots of signings and stuff. I have a book actually SIGNED by George RR Martin!! Isn't that insane?!?! He's like the best author ever, so. Anyway, I got the next two books in the Senet trilogy (by someone I forget -- it's a girl though!!). I hardly even remember the first book, except I DO remember that I liked it a lot and it was a pretty cool idea (something a bout overthrowing a religion). What else... oh! A Discworld book, by Terry Pratchett. Wee Free Men, I think it's called. Terry Pratchett is hilarious. He is to fantasy what Douglas Adams is to science fiction. Except Douglas Adams had a nicer writing style, I think.   Also, my dog rocks. Honestly. She's the coolest thing of all time. And she knows not to bite hard!! When she feels anything tasting remotely like human flesh/skin, she spits it out and freaks out a bit. Unless she's with me, because then she knows it's ok because I'm nice and I don't mind playing rough.    My cousin's coming over for the weekend. This sucks for a number of reasons, but mostly it sucks because she hates me and to be honest I don't like her that much either. However, in order for someone other than me (as I am now broke from the CD splurge (mummy buys the books for me because reading is healthy)(I don't understand how David Usher and Danny Michel aren't healthy, but hey, she's the boss)) to pay for an expansion to a game I really like (Rise of Nations, to be specific), I have to be nice and hang out with her and all. Blah. I think she's 13. This makes her a year younger than N. I still think my cousin looks like an 8-year-old, though.   I have her jelly bellies in front of me. I'm eating these stale things in protest of my mum and sister's dieting and exercising frenzy. So every time I pop one of these candy-gone-rocks into my mouth, I'm thinking "HAH! Take that, you health-nazis!!"   This is the longest pointless post I've ever written ^^;; Well, except for those two or three written during class/after school. Which were insanely pointless but also insanely long, for no reason except that I'm bored. Only difference is that now I'm being forced to; not bored.   PN is ignoring us. I was supposed to start my piano lessons yesterday, but he never called back. I think he might be moving. Have I mentioned how much I love his wife? She is soo cool! She's a paramedic, and used to teach the piano too (which is where they met; they were both teachers in his Studio), and she's super-nice and fun and all that.   And hopefully I'll be starting the harp again!! W00t!! Of course, I don't have a harp, and I'm not sure if RE will let me rent one, so that's no good. I'm hoping I'll foil the 'rents into buying me a nice one from Dusty Strings or something... 31-string, levers on F and B, made of some nice wood like cherry or something... I can dream, right?
