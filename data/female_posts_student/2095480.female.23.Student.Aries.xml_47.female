I went to Books A Million this evening for a number of reasons... but none of which that are important to this. Anyway, I bumped into a person that is in my Executive Branch/ US Presidency Class. He told me I should buy Clinton's new book "My Life" because Clinton was a fantastic president. To this I replied, "Nah, I've got too much reading going on now... I'll catch it later." We then got into a discussion about Clinton vs. Bush... and then he said...    "America can not afford to elect a woman president."    If you know me... you know this pissed me off.  I asked him why did he think that? He said "women can think rationally only about 32 weeks a year, not 52, and their hormones are out of control once a month.. and by way, add to that Eve  (!)  was manipulative and secretive so now women can't be trusted. I then asked him if he actually had a girlfriend, which amazingly enough he does. Now, I agree that not every person is cut out to make it as president but come now, to judge all women now from an event that was on the dawn of time (and this is if you believe in the Old Test.) is absolutely ridiculous. It is because of men like him that people like me are held back to positions that we do not to be.. we will keep running into that glass ceiling as long as our education system allows for this kind of thinking to continue. ARRRGHHHH! I was rather amazed that he had the gall to even say that to me... knowing my position on "women's rights".  Now, let me add to this I firmly believe that men and women are free to choose what they want.  Either can stay at home, either can work, go to school WHATEVER! However, it is up to the individual to decide and to let their "significant other" know. It is our responsibility to be honest and truthful to the ones that we love. Now, if I ever date someone that doesn't want me to fulfill whatever it is I want... knock me on the head. Its okay for someone to say "Liz, you wouldn't be a good president because you don't have the skills due to your education" but its another to say "You can't be president because of Eve."   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I've had a rather peaceful weekend. Nothing too dramatic... Other than road rage and hateful debates.  One thing I will add is that I'm going to start documenting my "single thoughts" that I tend to have throughout the day and I'm going to write on them... I know alot of them are interesting at least to me... and they show who I am, but like those fantastic ideas we all have in the shower, if I don't write them down I forget them...
