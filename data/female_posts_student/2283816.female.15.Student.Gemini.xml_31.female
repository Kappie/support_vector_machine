Hopes to write one meaningful song before he dies. Tom Collins: computer genius. Also HIV+ and back from NYC. Benny Coffin: Mark and Roger’s landlord. Wants to build a multimedia studio. Joanne Jefferson: public interest lawyer and Maureen’s lover.   Angel Shunard: street drummer transvestite (cross-dresser) who is also HIV+.  Mimi Marquez: dancer with AIDS and a drug problem. Maureen Johnson: performance artist and Mark’s ex-girlfriend.  ACT ONE:   Mark and Roger are spending a cold Christmas Eve in their industrial lot apartment in the Lower East Side. They receive several phone calls (TUNE UP #1  2/VOICE MAIL #1). The first is from Mark’s mother consoling him about losing his ex, Maureen, to a lawyer named Joanne. The second is from Tom Collins – who is cut off when muggers “detain” him. The third is from their landlord Benny, demanding the rent. The power blows, along with Mark and Roger’s tempers (RENT).  Collins is still outside in pain from the mugging. He is found and comforted by Angel, a street musician, who offers him a helping hand (YOU OKAY HONEY?). Discovering they’re both HIV+, they set out for a night on the town and a life support meeting.  Maureen calls Mark with a technical problem and asks for help, so he sets out to her performance lot. Tonight, Maureen will perform a protest against Benny’s eviction of the homeless. He tries to get Roger to come along, but he refuses. Roger (as Mark explains to us) has not left the apartment in six months. He’s still reeling from the suicide of his girlfriend April, who slashed her wrists when she learned they had AIDS. Roger is trying to write a song but suffering major writer’s block, and the only melody he can find is “Musetta’s Waltz” from Puccini’s La Bohème (ONE SONG GLORY).   Mimi, an S dancer who lives below Mark and Roger, knocks on the door with a request: LIGHT MY CANDLE. There’s an immediate attraction between she and Roger, but Roger shies away and shows her to the door. She knocks again – she’s lost her stash. Roger helps her look and Mimi eventually finds it- in Roger's back pocket.  Joanne is frantically trying to fix the sound equipment for Maureen’s performance. Her parents leave her VOICE MAIL #2, pleading with her to come to her mother’s confirmation hearing. Collins arrives at the apartment with a bag of cool stuff. Angel comes along gloriously arrayed in his Christmas finest - wig, glitter, and platform pumps. In TODAY 4 U, Angel explains how he earned $1,000: a wealthy woman hired him to play the drums until her neighbor's yappy Akita barked itself to death.  Benny enters with a proposal (YOU’LL SEE). If Mark and Roger stop Maureen’s protest, he’ll drop the rent. He tries to bribe them with Cyber Arts, a state-of-the-art, multimedia studio to realize all their dreams. He is unsuccessful and leaves. Collins and Angel persuade Mark to come to life support with them, but can’t persuade Roger.  Mark finally reaches Maureen’s performance lot. There, he meets Joanne, still struggling with Maureen’s demands and sound equipment. Mark offers to help her. They discover (TANGO: MAUREEN) that although they dreaded meeting, they have a lot in common. Finished, Mark heads to the LIFE SUPPORT meeting.  In her apartment, Mimi is dressing and appeals to an imaginary Roger to take her OUT TONIGHT. She barges into his apartment and continues her appeal to Roger himself, but after a passionate kiss, he vehemently rejects her. They fight, her words blending with the affirmation of the support group that emphasizes the importance of living the moment (ANOTHER DAY). A young man from the support group asks quietly, "Will I lose my dignity/Will someone care?" (WILL I?). His thoughts and fears are echoed by each member of the community. The thoughts are Roger's too, and he decides to go outside.  After the meeting, Collins, Angel, and Mark roam outside and rescue a homeless woman from the taunts of some neighborhood cops (ON THE STREET). The three dream of opening a restaurant in SANTA FE, tired of New York life. Mark leaves, and Angel and Collins express their love for each other (I’LL COVER YOU).  Joanne, meanwhile, has her hands full juggling work, parents, and the ever-demanding Maureen...all over the phone (WE'RE OKAY).  The scene changes to St. Mark's Place where vendors hawk their wares to the bohemians of the East Village (CHRISTMAS BELLS). Angel buys a new coat for Collins. Mark finds Roger who spots Mimi looking for drugs. Roger apologizes and asks her to dinner. Just as the snow begins to fall, Maureen finally appears on her motorcycle to perform her protest, OVER THE MOON.  After the performance, everyone heads to the Life Café, where they meet Benny. He announces that Bohemia is dead. The others immediately engage in a mock funeral that turns into a celebration of LA VIE BOHEME. During the song, Benny confronts Mimi and threatens to reveal their past affair to Roger. Beepers go off to remind the revelers to take their AZT. Roger and Mimi each discover that the other is HIV+. Frightened, excited, they vow to be together (I SHOULD TELL YOU).  Joanne has been sent back to the lot by Maureen several times to check on the equipment. She finally rebels, telling Maureen that their relationship is over and announcing a riot in the lot: Benny has padlocked the building and called the cops but the homeless are standing their ground. And mooing. The artists rejoice, the riot continues, and Roger and Mimi share a small, lovely kiss.  ACT TWO:  The second act begins with the company posing the question, "How do you measure a year in the life?" (SEASONS OF LOVE). It is one week later, New Year's Eve, and Mark, Roger, Mimi, Maureen, Joanne, Angel and Collins are having a breaking-back-into-the-building party (HAPPY NEW YEAR). Once inside, Mark listens to one more phone message from his mother in Scarsdale as well as one from Alexi Darling, a tabloid TV producer salivating over his footage of the riot (VOICE MAIL #3). Benny crashes the party, angering Roger and alienating Roger from Mimi. Dejected, Mimi wanders outside and into the welcoming arms of her drug dealer.  Mark fastforwards to Valentine's Day. Roger and Mimi are still together. Angel and Collins could be anywhere. Maureen and Joanne are still rehearsing another show, but it is not going well (TAKE ME OR LEAVE ME).  The company reprises SEASONS OF LOVE and time marches forward again, to spring. Roger and Mimi have a fight and Roger walks out. Alone, Mimi reflects on what life would be like without Roger (WITHOUT YOU). At the same time, Collins nurses a sick Angel; Maureen and Joanne reconcile; as do Mimi and Roger.  At the end of the summer, Alexi is still courting Mark for her TV show (VOICE MAIL #4). Roger and Mimi, unsatisfied by love's complications, break up, as do Maureen and Joanne. Angel dies (CONTACT). At a memorial service, his friends remember his spirit. Collins remembers his love (I'LL COVER YOU: REPRISE).  Outside the church, Mark phones Alexi to accept the job. Mark ponders how life has changed since last year as he recalls the joys of that one night last Christmas (HALLOWEEN). As the mourners leave the church, Mimi confirms that Roger has sold his guitar and is leaving town. Roger confirms that Mimi is now with Benny. A fight erupts among Roger, Mimi, Maureen, Benny, and Joanne. Collins interrupts them with the sorrowful reality that the family is breaking up. Joanne and Maureen reunite. Mimi and Benny leave.  Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York and face his pain and the fact that Mimi is very sick. Roger attacks Mark, accusing him of hiding from his feelings. Mimi enters, having overheard the entire angry exchange, and bids Roger farewell (GOODBYE, LOVE). Roger leaves town. Mimi turns to Mark for help. Benny offers one helping hand to Mimi and extends the other to Collins to help him pay Angel's funeral expenses. Mimi refuses the help and flees. Collins accepts and he and Benny go out for a drink.  Mark considers the events and faces the last year, as does Roger, who is on his way to Santa Fe. Roger begins to discover his own song and Mark turns down the television job to finish his own film (WHAT YOU OWN).  Roger's mom, Mark's mom, Mimi's mom, and Joanne's father all wonder where their children are (VOICE MAIL #5). Back at the loft, Mark tells us that again it's Christmas. He now has a rough version of his film, which he's going to show tonight. Roger has returned, has written his song, but cannot find Mimi. Collins enters with money he has gotten from an ATM rewired to give money to anyone with a special code. The password? Angel.  Maureen and Joanne suddenly arrive holding Mimi, whom they found collapsed and near death in the park. Roger begs her not to die and sings for her the song it has taken him all year to write, YOUR EYES. Mimi dies as Roger wails her name over a blast of Puccini's music. Suddenly Mimi awakens. It seems that a guardian Angel was watching over her.  The company joins in a reprise of the affirmation that love is all and that there is "no day but today" (FINALE).
