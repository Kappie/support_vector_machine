H-A-T-E-D him. he always let his kids (Alex, val, and tato *mikey*) get away with murder but when me or my brother did something wrong like letting our lights on we did something only the devils children did. Do you see why i hate him??? He was cruel to my brother brett since he was little. That is what made brett creul. you know what they say, bite the dog and the dog will learn to bite back. I wanted him out of the house before my mom even sugested it! Any boob can be a parent but only a select few can be fathers. And he was not a father! He is gone now! YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Okay i think you get it. but now there is another man in the house. He is Sam. He is the only man that i would ever consider a father. He is kind and understands. For the short time i've known him he has been the nicest adult male that i've met. I see my mom and she is actully happy. I guess somebody is missing out cause sams ex must have been insane. Sam is a sweetie to my mom and i love it. If he lets me i'd start calling him dad. So mom if your reading this i love you and thank you for finding a sufficent father! oh and here is  urlLink my mommy's blog  read it she'd like it
