Although this new "metallicastic" Dream Theater is better than Metallica. It's hard to find a band that plays as well as DT's guys.  I gotta buy the album and listen to it carefully. So far I have only three songs downloaded from the new album "Train of Thoughts".  Ok, I changed to "A Change of Seasons" from DT. It's a masterpiece, really. It's one "song", divided into 7 parts, total playing time is 23:06. A Change of Seasons (ACoS) was written 1989 along with "Metropolis - Pt. 1" (probably the best DT song) and it was supposed to be published already 1992 on "Images and Words"-album. For some reason they didn't. Maybe it would've just been too much, since "Metropolis - Pt. 1" was already on the album... Two long masterpieces on one album is not necessarily a good idea. So finally they recorded ACoS as an independent work. Since it's "only" 23:06 minutes long, they filled the rest of the album with a live recording from Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London (1995), where they played covers e.g. from Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and Queen. The rest of the album is not that good, at least IMO, but worth listening. They have chosen the songs from the bands they grew up listening to. A great idea, though =) They wanted to have some fun and relax and that can be heard from the tracks.  Yesterday there was a moon eclipse... It was soooo beautiful and strange. The sky was clear and we could see stars really well, too. Although the light pollution disturbs us both. It's just not dark enough, the city lights illuminate the sky so effectively. The eclipse was whole at around 2 am and at least I had trouble staying awake so long... But I'll tell you, making love helps in that sense! =) Although right after making love I just wanted to stay in bed, laying next to my honey. But, we have a lot of time to stay in bed and cuddle, the rest of our lives (or at least till we get children, if we ever get any and that far :D) if all goes this well ;)  I am so happy with my man. I never thought that I'd have my 25th birthday in Switzerland and that I'd celebrate it with the man I love and who loves me. At the moment "ich liebe dich" ("i love you" in German) are the most beautiful and comforting words in this world. I'm safe with him, I can be myself with him, independent and not alone. I've noticed that with him, for the first time I can be what I am. I can be silly, sad, funny, serious, furious... Everything I need to be and I don't feel myself awkward and he doesn't make me feel stupid and he doesn't want me to be something I have to pretend to be. Amazing, how my last two longer relationships seem to have been so much faking and make believe. I made myself believe that this is what I REALLY want. Now with Rico I've been thinking a lot of it and I have been so relieved every time I've noticed that this is not make believe, this is for real. I think that our relationship has the opportunity to live long. I think we could even grow old together. So far all the important things JUST MATCH! =) I am so lucky.  So, I gotta go and call my father. Today's the Father's Day in Finland and I want to say hello to my father...  *edit*  Wow, I just realised that today I've been exactly 6 months in Switzerland and we've been together with Rico that "long", too... Who would've guessed in May that in November we'd be living together! Especially when I had my doubts about this relationship at one point, as one ridiculous femalebeing decided to declare her love for Rico to ME. I talked about it with my friends and had a lot of support from them. They also found the behaviour of this person stupid, selfish and ridiculous. I mean, why tell this thing to me? Fortunately everything turned out just fine and Rico didn't let me down. After all, he said could never even imagine starting a relationship with her. They have never even met in real life! Now I can only laugh about it, it was all so pathetic and ridiculous and I KNOW that Rico loves me. Well, there are a lot of sad creatures in this world and they also deserve to live ;)   Well, time to go and clean up the apartment! Till later!
