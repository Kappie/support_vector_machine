The only part that really sucked about the night was everybody telling Staci to shut the fuck up. repeatidly. Hey, Its understandable, but i still felt a little bad. But only a little.     I feel left behind a bit, because last night Genie Zach and Kenzie all got together and got drunk. Genie told me about all the fun they had and i feel stupid because I've never been drunk before, and i wish they would have called me.  Peer pressure? woo!  I jumped off a bridge the other day cause there was a bunch of other people doing it too.  So anyways.  I'm going to start playing my guitar again. I can't even play mary had a little lamb anymore.  ...  hmm. this summer is going to be interesting. I predict a bunch of drama. Why? just cause...I feel it.  like the girl on "mean girls" i can predict the weather with my boobs.  There is a 30% chance that the sun will go down today.
