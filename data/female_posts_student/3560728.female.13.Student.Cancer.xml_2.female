They don't carry the Jinxed CD called Beyond the Obvious or any Fall Out Boy stuff, so now I have to pay $40.00 to order each specially. It's not my fault that all the best bands are signed to small record labels and are not particularly popular, so why do I have to pay extra because of it? Life sucks... Anywho, tomorrow is grad. I should probably go off and waste my time removing my turquoise nail polish, but I'd really rather not...
