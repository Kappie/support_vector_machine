This means more interviews with Shelby and Matt Lauer on  Today , which are  excruciating  at best and reinforce all stereotypes about the slow mentality and sheer idiocy of those who reside in our fair state (could they not have hired the man a speaking coach?- he's been on the Hill long enough to have earned one by now- and I don't know anyone from around here that actually talks like he does  ). Geez. When I first found out he was the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee afew years ago, I thought for a moment that everyone on the Senate floor was smoking crack to allow such a thing [on a side note- does one actually  smoke  crack? I need to ask Cracky on Monday.] Someone who sounds that damn stupid is a bad reflection on us all, in my humble opinion- especially when he's supposed to be representing   intelligence   .  Why can't the man give a cohesive, coherent interview?!?!?        2.   This is a man who used to be a Democrat, who switched sides ten years after first being elected to Congress- he actually switched sides only ONE DAY after the Republicans took control of Congress in '94. His reason? He claims the Democratic Party "left him and his followers behind," or some such garbage. But because this state is made up of mostly Republicans, he's been elected back twice since (or three times, maybe- I've lost count). Personally, I've never quite believed his sudden conversion to Republican ideology after being a Democrat for so long, and to me, it stunk of a political ploy(I remember talking about this in high school and being absolutely revolted by either his blatant re-election strategy... or his crappy timing). I didn't believe him then, and I don't really believe any claims of innocence now.        3. Although, in his defense (how distasteful it just felt to type those words), he IS a Southerner, and therefore is blessed, or cursed- depends on how you look at it- with the "gossip gene." If it's in his blood, you can't really blame the man for wanting to share secrets. That's why Southerners do not make good CIA operatives.        I just sincerely hope he doesn't turn into another Howell Heflin. We don't need any more panty-head-mopping politicians making everyone in the country think we're even more backwards than they already do.        And now I'll be hopping down.
