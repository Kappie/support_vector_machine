Louder  seems like its getting off to a nice start and I truly enjoy Bassey and Patricia Smith!  I REEEEALLY wanted to go though and I even asked Steve if we could change what we had to do to another night but we couldn't.  What we had to do was go to a student's play at John Jay college.  I was like, 'oh god, its going to be boooriiiing' but in actuality it was a moving, darn good play!  It's called ReVisions and it was done by City at Peace New York.  City at Peace is a  "dynamic, year-long, youth-led, youth development program that works with extremely diverse groups of young people, ages 13 to 19, using an innovative creative process to explore and address the complicated forces and events (e.g. racism, sexual discrimination, abuse, homophobia, violence, drugs, emotional distress) that they encounter on a daily basis..  The process helps them to solve their conflicts without violence and build long-lasting relationships.  They gain understanding and compassion across racial and cultural boundaries, cultivate leadership skills, learn to take active responsibility for their communities and in doing so, enrich and enhance their lives and others, breaking down boundaries in pursuit of a city at peace."    The show had about 50 kids in it, all colors and ages.  The story and songs were written by the kids and are based on their real lives (although they weren't necessarily playing themselves).  These kids put on a two hour show and kept us riveted the whole time.  What was sad was that the stories (all intertwined using a school as the main setting) were all true.  One story centered around 2 kids abused by their parents.  Another 4 girls were lesbians who are outed but aren't quite ready for it.  Another is about a girl who works, has to take care of her 3 siblings and grandmother, has a job to help her mother and is struggling in school.  Another boy's mother dies just as he's accepted to college on a full scholarship and falls into drug abuse to deal with his loss.    I cant say it enough.  It was all so moving because it was real.  That's what made it so scary too.  How easy is it to fuck up our kids?  How would I deal with a child being gay (I think I'd do ok, but who knows when its your own kid?!)  This happens all the time, and we don't really notice it because so much is not discussed. So much is shoved under the carpet.  So many kids are fucked up and we don't even realize how bad it is.  I mean, I know a boy who fell into the trap of drugs and whatnot when his mother was dying.  He always had to be 'the man' when his mom was around, taking care of his brothers all the time, he always had to be responsible for everything... and when he knew she wasn't going to be around anymore, I think he just freaked out and couldn't handle any more... I have no idea where he is now, all I know is that he kinda sorta ran away... I sure hope he's ok...  Y'know at the beginning of the show, the head of City at Peace made a speech and she said that this year, they only had space in the program for 60 kids and they had to turn away at least 100.  That means that there is a program to help kids, but the kids who need help cant get it because there's not enough funding for great programs like this.  Please donate if you can, in ANY way possible to City at Peace or programs like it.  www.cpnational.org/ny . Also, the show is still on - tonight and tomorrow at 8pm.  Tickets are $30, money well spent.  After this, they tour schools and such to get the word out.  ...After the show, we saw a few more of Steve's students who came to support their friend.  Steve was the only teacher that showed up.  I knew she gave the flyers out around the school and it was disappointing to not see any other teachers there...hopefully some will go to one of the other shows(?)  I think its great that Steve cares so much about his kids.  Its teachers like that  make a kid feel like they count... and I'm not just saying that because he's my husband.  I truly believe that if you show you care, you can make a little difference now and then.  Natalie, you and your cast were amazing!  Keep up the good work!!
