So long as you're writing something, and looking at them intelligently they think you're doing the work. Fools. Oh, have you heard about the theft story yet? It's official, me and Izzy are outlaws. :P Not exactly your average criminal but hey, variation helps the world go round. There was a painting of Izzy's being displayed in the entrance hall that she didn't want there and didn't give her permission to be there so obviously we went and nicked it. Hehe, or I convinsed her to *i'm a bad influence on everyone* So we legged it down to the drama block, and tried to take the picture out. Then Izzy broke the glass *cringe* into three perfect bits *wow, isn't that lucky! it's a real story though kids, don't try this at school. my freak luck doesn't rub off on everyone* she must have been leaning on it or something... Then all these kids came in cause it was 'there room' so we made up some lame excuse like 'modern art' and told them not to tell anyone. *sheesh gullable* Then we legged it and asked Pete what to do. He didn't know so we legged it back to the frame and Izzy panicked. But I was cool and calm, hehe I could be a con artist! Izzy wanted to take the 'dump it and run' option, but who the hell would nick a painting, take it out and dump the frame? Oh, I mean who would nick a school persons painting? So we took it up to the art block, glass and all. We told them that some kid had nocked it off the wall during between lesson time, it broke and it took us 90 minutes to get it to them cause of various things. Man we're good. Muhahahaaaa.... I could be the next evil mastermind in a James Bond movie.... Or a Disney movie, I'm willing to start small and work my way up. :) Little bit psychotic. Totally in control.
