She always wears like 200 dollar jeans and 50 dollar t-shirts. It makes me laugh because even though she has so much she isn't stuck up at all. Its grand.  Then we are going to my uncles lake to like inner tube and stuff. That should be ok..I get to wear my new swim-suit! woot woot. Its really low though... Well, i guess its not that bad....but yeah. I am soooooo afraid of those inner tubes. Oh my goodness. My uncle drives the boat sooooo fast I lways think I am going to die!!!!  After the whole lake shing ding I might go to church for a leadership thing, if we have enough time...if not or after I am going to Sara's soccer game! Woot woot! I hope marc and eric don't come. IThat would be kind of akward..I think I would just hide from them....   I am off to take a lonnnng shower!  Buh bye!!!  Laura Fantora
