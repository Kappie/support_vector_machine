I know, I promised something lovely and scintillating and... oh, wait, no, actually, I didn't. But that's ok. I was planning on it. But, quite honestly, I'm tired. I have two more, really good posts that I want to put up, but it'll probably have to wait until tomorrow because, right now, it's requiring more candle-power than I have to do the concepts justice. Mwah! That's all, folks!
