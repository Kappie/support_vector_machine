I had been doing art and textiles since 8pm so I wanted a break. After I came offline at about 11.45PM I did a couple spider diagrams and then went to be. Got up at 8 this morning, added some more detail to all my 4 spider diagrams and then came on here. In a mo I will go and do my geology and english lit (essay and book talk prep!!) and then go off to Woolies for my job interview. O the excitment. Then of course tomorrow I am going to the CBBC Prom In The Park with Jo, Tom and Nancy which should be a laugh. Then its back to school, week one, school service, lessons, mad lunches, free periods, general studies (pah!).
