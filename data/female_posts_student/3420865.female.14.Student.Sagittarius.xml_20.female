(it was sweet.) then i took the bus to erin's house. when i got off my bus downtown, i saw monika and cassie, (oh, and then i saw you-know-who. he was hot). and then steph was on the bus to erin's house. so we talked and stuff...it was coo.  then i got to erin's house, and vanessa was thurr. and we went for a "dip" in erin's pool... then vanessa left, and me and erin talked/listened to music/went on msn/ate. then erin did my make-up, and i went home. via the bus. god i  hate  taking the bus! all the people on it are so evil... this girl was looking at me like the whole time... and she thought i didn't notice. she was judging me, and i didn't like it. and then, my frikin batteries died in my cd player... so i had to travel  without  music the rest of the way home. it sucked.  then my brother left again like 10 minutes after i got home, i ate dinner, and then i watched tv with my mummy when she got home from work (at like 8). so all in all, you're just another brick in the wall. sorry, that wasn't what i meant to say... i started to say "so all in all, it was a good day", but the song took over. sorry.  eeek. lana's party tomorrow! it's gonna be kick-ass. (cuz lana's hot.) me and erin are giong downtown tomorrow to get her a present... but where to go? are there any cool places [that don't sell drug paraphernalia] downtown that i could shop for a gift for anal? please tell.  well, it's 12:00...and i'm not gonna go to bed, but i'm gonna stop blogging.  which would you prefer? my finger on the trigger- or me face down across your floor?  kayte.
