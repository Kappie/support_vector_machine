So we went 2 the mall with the twins,Brandon and Jen. It was fun at the mall. We went into Victoria Secrets. haha! It was funny. ppl were looking at Bryan because he was putting bras over his shirt asking me if it looked good and if it was "his color." Yah fun fun. He's a dork. Then I came home watched t.v, ate dinner and then I talked 2 Jenhi. Now I'm on the internet listening 2 music and thinking. So that's my day. Pretty boring huh?! Yah thought so. Well ya 2morrow might be fun, hopefully. Ciao!
