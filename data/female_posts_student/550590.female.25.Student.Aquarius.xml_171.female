Then I had bloody noses every day until I broke down and paid nearly $80 for my allegra prescription... Now I have a blocked, painful ear. To top it all off, I'm anticipating a weekend forecast of cramps and bloating, which will make for a very long and uncomfortable plane ride come Monday afternoon.  Maybe my body is just rebelling against writing the stupid pre-travel paper, which I still haven't started. Well, I wrote out a title page and subheadings.  Still haven't picked up the Russian flashcards I made, still haven't learned a damn thing about the language. Bruce's new thing is quizzing me on Russian words: "How do you say help?" "I don't know, but I have flashcards..." "Okay, then how do you say police?" "I don't know, but I have flashcards..." I also haven't found a voltage adapter. I figure since Bruce won't be around, I won't have to look my usual gorgeous (t-shirt and jeans and pulled back hair) self, so I can go without the curling iron and hair dryer (that are still packed from the cruise.)
