LOVE AND MARRIAGE       These two are so unlike as to make one wonder whatever could have been the attraction for either of them in the first place.  If it was a strictly a physical attraction it is not likely to last for one whole season much less a lifetime.  Scorpio is the type who lives to possess the ones he/she loves and to manipulate them in anyway he/she chooses.  This would not set well with the freedom loving, independent Sagittarius who refuses to be tied down or restricted in any way.  All of Scorpios attempts in this direction would be wasted on this personality.      It is almost impossible for any one person to tame this one as he/she will chase excitement, adventure, and the opposite sex with equal abandon.  Scorpio would have to handle the finances, and the risks that Sagittarius takes daily would soon have Scorpio a nervous wreck.  There is no way that Sagittarius will ever be a reasonable, serious person no matter how hard Scorpio tries to turn him/her into one.      If Sagittarius gets the impression that he/she is thought of as the exclusive sexual property of Scorpios, and it would be unwise for Scorpio to act as if this is so, that is when he/she begins to kick over the traces and will go bed-hopping.  This is an unlikely alliance and not a match made in Heaven.     BUSINESS PARTNERSHIPS      This would also be an unwise business partnership for much the same reasons as outlined above. Sagittarius will be much too busy searching out the excitement in the business and will work at it willingly, unless it becomes a hum drum affair at which time he is likely to lose interest in the whole thing. Scorpio is not as adept at dealing with the public for he is apt to sting those who can help and cultivate those that can harm the business. Not a recommended business partnership.
