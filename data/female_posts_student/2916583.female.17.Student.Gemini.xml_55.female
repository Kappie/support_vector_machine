I may have already told some of you, but I happened to find some yearbook pictures on some CDs, and I found some cute prom pictures (heads up, Candy K., Will C., Katy, Jeff J., Mallory, Brittany V., Amanda L., Kim E., Edwin, Elias, Jessica R., Joe S., Mingo, Justin M., Brittany Bl., Lindsay F., Shannon C., Daniel P., Kim T., Lauren E., LaDawn, Kim K., Mango, Matt F., Tatiana, Mark C., Megan W., Chewy, Rebekah H., Amber B., Ricci S., Casey S., Yasmin, Monique B., Jasmine C., Whitney H., Kevin H., Paula I., Tom G., and the Prom Court...a big heads up to that guy Becca W.'s with, cause buddy, you look like a baboon in the picture).  If you want to see them, just copy and paste this into the place where you type internet sites, and then press enter (make sure to leave out the brackets: http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph2uOIBBQR5ULnfB.dir=/1da2.src=ph  That's for the second album...for the first, copy and paste this link: http://f2.pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/smart_blonde2005/album?.tok=ph1tOIBB6IBJZJXD.dir=/d83d.src=ph  I'm definitely bringing a camera tomorrow (unless I forget for the second day in a row), tomorrow (for the "life skills test"...AKA pancake breakfast), and Friday for Kings Dominion.  As always, I'll post them ASAP.  Speaking of photos, I wish I had one today, when Yasmin and Ashley B. started dancin to rap...good times.  I'll say more later, cause I really need to take a shower now.  Later.
