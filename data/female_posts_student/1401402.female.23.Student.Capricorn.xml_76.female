The club was jumpin, it was just so notorious. But no matter what, anyone does they cant get any cheap feels from me. Nah-ne-nah-nah-nah... One two buckle my shoes...Three four shut the door... Five six pick up sticks.. Seven eight lay them straight... Nine ten A BIG FAT HEN.   Yippee I A, Yippee I oOo. It worked it worked. Damn, I'm good!!! I finally got Michael Yu to say his sorry for everything. The good thing was, I didnt have to ask him anything nor did I really care about his reasons. In just a couple of dayz, I lured him into falling for me and it really worked, then tell him I'm involved with somebody else. Ca-Boom, that hurted him so fuckin bad I could see it in his eyes. Truly, that was ALL I wanted to see, you fuckin bastard. I'm still alil perturbed about this whole thing, but for some reason it made me happy.   Games over, I WON...u scandalous sucker. I'm stronger now...I've got strategies... Strike from out of the blues. Come on everybody lets do the WAVE...whooooo... lol. oOo, a BIG thank you to Linda for all you're help =D.
