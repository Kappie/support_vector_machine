I liked it, although the speakers really didn't have that much effect on me, because they talked about their drug addictions and drinking problems, and gang problems.  But they did pray for my trip to the Ukraine, and Abner found out I was going to the Ukraine.  I'm starting to get more nervous, I leave tomorrow, well since it's very early wed morning right now.  But I leave for a month tomorrow!  Frightening!  I don't feel like I'm ready, I'm definitly going to need you guys to pray for me, pray that I don't forget anyhting.  And that the flights go well, and that we stay safe.  You guys rock.     Besides my freaking out, Abner succumbed to the world of blogging, and started his own.  It is proudly displayed in my links.  (we've trapped another one.  only a few more and we will begin to dominate the world.)  I would like to inform my readers that I think instead of e-mailing everyone while I'm gone, I'll just update my blog, because that is a heck of a lot easier than sending an e-mail to tons of people.  And in conclusion, I have noticed a strange urge of mine lately, when I go to write if,  I end up typing iff.  Unless I think about it.  As in shorthand notation for if an only if.  There, I had to suppress it twice.  I don't know if that goes along with the lack of spelling, or if (there it is again) I am just wierd.  For the time being I would say the latter.
