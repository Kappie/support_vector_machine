While I got help from friends in writing this, (as you can see it is not really my style of writing) I just couldn't find a way of saying it right.  I have decided that what I am about to tell you, has been needed to be said for a while now. We have know each other for a while and you know I am really close to all my guy friends. You always seemed to show a little bit of jealousy. You also were untrusting when I would hang out with them rather then hanging out with you. I saw the look on your face when I would leave with them. It looked as if you were being shot in the heart. I am so sorry that you feel that way, but this is just a piece of my personality that will never go away. I am a flirt and I will always be that way.  I don't want to here you saying things behind my back also. I know you see me and my friends treating each other like that, but that is because they are just my friends. Not someone I care about dearly. It hurts me when one of your friends reminds me that you said I was a "cock tease". I never would say things like that about you, I don't know why you say them about me.  I hope when I get back from Tampa Bay, we can talk about this more. You haven't been answering my calls, so I thought something might have made you angry. I promise you that I will try and be with you more.   You also need to be more trusting of me, I know you think somethings are happening but they are not. I had never been untrustworthy, you should believe me when I tell you I haven't been sleeping around on you.  I hope Ian posts this since I am having trouble with updating from all the way down here.So I hope you get this before it is to late for us. Ian has been acting weird to me lately so I am not sure this will ever be posted. That is a problem that I will deal with later, this letter is to you. I guess I just need to get it off my chest and out into the open.
