What pisses me off is that Marlo said that we wouldn't win state again and then we don't.  aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhh!!!!!   it was shit.  we played like shit and i knew this would happen.  We win regionals, win metroplex but then we don't win state because we got too cocky.  I told them so! no one ever listens to me!!!  We're reliving what southlake carroll went through last year!!!  I told them "winning metroplex is the kiss of death, southlake wins it and everyone thinks they're going to win state and then they don't!  i'm worried, i don't want us to win!".  Then Josh and Jimmy say "oh no, have faith, we'll do fine, we'll win".  or not.  So no we're off to third place game tomorrow, oh joy.  4 words to my boys: I TOLD YOU SO.  They did this to themselves.  They partied the night before and then they were running on like no sleep blah blah blah.......my boys let me down, and i weep for them.  Despite the fact that we won't win state on my birthday now, at least i'm still turning 16 and i'll be able to drive.  thank god. Now i can go have fun and comfort myself for Coppell's loss.  Oh yeah Dallas lost their series, not a surprise.  I actually didn't watch the game.  I didn't feel like it.  New Jersey also lost their series, the same way Dallas did.  So its alright.  Now i'm cheering for Boston or Tampa Bay, just because they're awesome and they have hott guys.  I would just like to say that i will miss my Niko Kapanen and my Patrik Elias, i hope their summer will be alright.    tomorrow is my birthday!!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
