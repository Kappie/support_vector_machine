I typed the entire blog just now and was about to retire when the WHOLE BLOODY blog just vanished. Totally gone, with the wind, a myth, a rumor. What the ~#@$$#@$!?! This morning is REALLY not my day. First, I woke up with the most irritating nose in the world- it's practically just leaking and itching like there's a whole tupper ware of itching powder being pumped up continuosly into my nose. It's been like that the past 2 weeks and seriously, I'm really getting impatient with my nose. Wonder if they do nasal Amputation...Hmmm.. then I would become a n MJ wannabee ( I'm mad! I'm mad! U know it, Whow!).  2nd, My wonderful Mummy is super duper sick. Puke and LS the whole darn night and I was nursing her till like 230am. Then I was woken up by my dad like 8am (I slept at 4am..whaha) to take care of my mum who had taken her territory in the lavotory ealier than I open my bewildering eyes to reality. Have to bring her to the doctor who proclaim that its a case of gastric Flu. Brought her back home and nurse her to take her medication. SERIOUSLY.. I'm pretty beat. I wanna hit the sack but I can't cos I gotta wake another 2 more hours where in between I'm suppose to wake my lao bu up to eat her medication. Hiakz..I tink I better dun complain since she has done this for me umpteen times and even more..=X  3rd, my new bunny, FUZZY is irritating my otic nerves...BADLY. The incessant scratching of his/her ( I dunno the gender la) impossibily long nails against the box wall is driving me nuts. Somehow reminded me of nails scratching across the blackboard(HIAKZ!!!!!!! *SHUDDERS..BRRR*)   4th I'm at it again. I'm thoroughly just stoning and procrastinating the whole damn holidays..Eeehhh..actually for the past half a decade. JEez, no wonder I'm feeling so low. I'm so totally unmotivated to do anything. I dun even feel like learning how to cook! sighz.. I just dun wan to do anything, learn anything, and THINK of anything.   5th, I'm totally and utterly broke to the core. I just spent like $60 the past 2 days and I'm sociaphobic now. I'm so scared to even venture out of my grills cos it means I'm most likely to spend money. I have absolutely NO discipline. I hate myself. I tried. I really tried. I just can't. Booohooo. Sorry baby, I really tried. I hate this.    I'm going to drown myself in panadols and hit the sack soon...Maybe I'll dream of beign someone else instead..talking abt cheap thrill...   Laterz dudes
