For those of you who don't know what that is.. it's a program that sends 350 of the Top girls in the state to Aimes and they spend six days learning about government and parlimentary procedure, campaigning for various positions, and getting to know the strangers that they are surrounded in.   It was the best experience i've ever had. Everyone there was so accepting and fun. I went in being upset and homesick and left crying because i didn't want to leave. The bonds that are made between friends are endless. you get to know ppl in a way that know one can understand. I miss them all ready (Cassie, Stephanie, Mary, Sarah, and everyone else). I hope we stay in touch more than anything else. They've taught me so much about myself. I can't thank them enough for that.
