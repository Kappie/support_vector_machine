I usually like to think of myself as a creator... Because that is what I do... I create. I'm an artist, I'm a writer. But as I continue to read I feel like neither, I feel useless, worthless. I mean some of these others are amazing... Their works inspire, they have passion. And so I wonder if I will ever be in those ranks ... Be one that inspires, empowers. Will I ever have that kind of passion, and if I do, will it ever shine through as brightly as these did? I'm astounded, I cant speak... I feel small.
