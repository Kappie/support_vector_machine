However, I still abhor exercise. I hate sweating and hurting and wasting a fucking hour of my life walking and not going anywhere!   You'd think they'd have figured out that the reason some people don't exercise is because they HATE it, and maybe try to fix that. But instead of the great teachers who show you their subject don't suck, they instead drill you with facts and give you the most boring and horrendous schedules to follow. I'm amazed at how something so incredibly NOT INTERESTING can still be so ouchy.  Is it really healthy for me to walk for an hour a day in my target zone? I mean, a whole fucking consecutive hour? I truly doubt that's a good idea, unless you're into pain and injury and fatigue. I was fine when the workouts were only half an hour - I felt GOOD then. That was GOOD pain. Now, it just hurts because the only way I can finish the wokrout is to push myself so hard it hurts beyond any fathomable promise of benefit.  Now I feel this mundane, endless task ahead of me every day. It's five-o-fucking-clock and I can't make myself do it. I just don't fucking want to exercise right now. I've had a tiring day and I need a nap, not an hour of hell.   I have to go walk in el THRZ-o for an hour and then do pushups and shit. Pushups? I love pushups. I eat those for breakfast.  I'm even fine with walking, even for an hour, except i have to walk within my target zone for an hour. This doesn't include the time you spend warming up, cooling down, and resting from overexertion, not to mention taking a sip of water and hearing the fucking heart rate monitor beep and tell you to work harder, bitch. No nutrients for you.  This leads to pain and cramping and soreness and for some reason, it's incredibly fucking DIFFICULT to get into the target zone for me lately, even when i'm feeling motivated. Maybe because I'm so pissed off. So I work harder and harder and I already absolutely fucking hate this course and I'm barely halfway done.  My soul is all shrively and gross. And my legs hurt, too.  It's people like Miss Biological Changes Over Time that consider this an important part of my education. [Put down the hairspray, lady. Actually, pick it back up and stop coming to work.] I KNOW people are getting obese and stressed out and shit, but i certainly don't think overexhaustion is a good alternative. If this thing were only a bit less ridiculous, I'd be just fine. But I cannot possibly live through two more weeks of hour-long pain sessions.  As much as I try not to hate things without good reason, I HATE P.E. If this course was a person, I would push them off a building and make it look like an accident.
