He's not a christian, he doesn't go to church, he leaves in the morning before I wake up, and gets home around eight at night...the number of hugs I've given him since i got out of third grade I could most likely count on two hands...he drinks- he smokes...we have nothing really in common...  And as Father's day is here, I miss something I've never had.  A good father.  And I realize that I may have it better than some girls, but it still hurts.
