He doesn't realize how good he has it, and I feel like I need to do something to show him. I HATE THIS. I hate being in school, I hate being underage, I hate have my freaking parents think they can control everything I do, they don't understand me AT ALL........... I CAN'T WAIT TO GET AWAY FROM THIS HELLHOUSE. I'm actually hoping this freaking hurricane will come and destroy everything, I don't care anymore. I swear I've spent about a third  (if not than more) of my pathetic 16 year old life grounded in my room. I'm talking grounded for things other kids would never get grounded for. All because of my ass dad. And he asks me why I don't like him. GEE I WONDER.  He's so fake. Why don't you try acting around your "friends" like you act around us dad. Yeah no one would like you then dad.
