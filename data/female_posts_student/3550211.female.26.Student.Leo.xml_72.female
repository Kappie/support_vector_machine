Oh, they'll [the media] find out details of people's sex lives and sue to publish and broadcast them, and they'll show endless footage of Abu Ghraib abuses. But terrorist beheadings? Nah.   He goes on to quote from the Los Angeles Times: "Any news outlet — or any private individual, for that matter — who makes available footage of the actual beheadings is, to my mind, an accessory to the crime itself,"   Give me a break. This is war and THEY are the enemy. Why is American media just focusing on our mistakes?
