Its so frustrating sometimes when you feel like everything you do, everything you put your feelings and heart into isnt good enough. Like you're never pretty enough, skinny enough, smart enough, funny enough, Godly enough, or like no one really gives a darn about you. I mean, I know I have friends and family and an amazing God who loves me...but sometimes theres a void. Like, it can be filled one minute and completely empty the next. I guess, you just have to keep truckin' no matter what. God loves me, and that all that matters.  Well, enough venting..im going to go run it out of me!     Love you....
