I'm kinda in awe about the fact that two people who have never once met in their lives can basically hate each other because of what is posted in theirs Blogs. I find that a bit fucked up. These Blog things can't possibly do any good to anyone excep for the person writing it, because as far as I can tell everyone is pissed off at everyone just because the writer of the blog said one little thing...OK come on guys GET OVER IT!  Yeah something that really bothers me, is when people have feelings about something that either pisses them off or upsets them in some way, but they can't come to me and tell me about it. They have to post this shit all over their blog, but they can't try to come and talk to me about it. Why the hell don't I get the respect from someone, to come and actually talk to me about it, I mean finding it online sure as fuck dosen't make me happy. Is it supposed to ?? Is that what they were aiming for? You know what I don't really even care.   I'm done for now...later
