Watched the beginning to Matrix Reloaded then we had to leave for a minor league baseball game. She downloaded some songs for me, weeeee! Thanks man! The game was ok. Grand slam in the first inning. We won! Missouri sucks, haha! 14 to 4... I find that really sad. Although they had two less errors than us... heh. In a week Dad and I leave for Kansas, whoo hoo! Cody leaves in a few days. We're gonna go see 'The Village' tomorrow. Maybe play some mini golf. All depends on Grandma though, she's our ride and money seeing as to how I've maxed out my card and Dad won't be home. I don't think he's going to be giving me any more money. Oh well, I don't blame him. I can't keep it for beans. I need to stop spending like that... I suck with money. Anyway, I'm supposed to be looking for something. later dayz
