Do you know how fustrating that is? I also wanna do a webcomic. ^^(), sometimes I can be very, very creative. I'm thinking of adding another blog to my account and you know, post stories there and stuff. I wonder if anyone would read it, they'd probably think my junk was terrible! Hehehehehe. Anyway, i'm gonna go set it up and make it pretty, and, um stuff. :D, I found this Lilo and Stitch icon that I wanna post up, but I deleted hello and the image server I use blogger doesn't accept the address. > do you know how fustrating that can be to a person? UH! My goodness. I'm gonna go write some stories now, and post them. Maybe i'll get some reviews =D, maybe my ego will boost. Who knows?
