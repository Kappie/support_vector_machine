Even fulfilling our most simple desires can prove challenging on some occasions, for example something that should be fairly simple like getting to class on time.   So you’re ready to go to school, you’ve had a shower to cleanse you of the nasty cigarettes stench from other club goers from last night and that beer-smelling sweat from all the booze you imbibed. You’re ready, even though you have a nerve-wrecking migraine from the hangover and you rather be run over by the AMTRAC, you are ready.  Oh yeah, let’s not forget, you are ready and you have sixty minutes before class starts. You have plenty of time, or so you think after all it’s only a 15-minute drive, 5 lousy miles to campus. But you’re wrong. You don’t even have enough time to call God and ask mercy from all that is about to befall you.   (Deduct the minutes you think these problems would take an imperfect human being to resolve instead of the minutes it would take your perfect self to solve and even leave room for improvement.)   First you go to the gas station and there is literally a traffic jam at the gas pumps (that lady in the Volvo almost hit you, b*tch), next the damn Indian (from India) clerk thinks he’s so hot with his thick annoying accent and the purple skin around his eyes (which brings only one thing to my mind; CRAZY RACCOON, RUN!!) that he’s actually starting to flirt with you (it’s 8.10am for Christ sakes!) and to try and touch your hand whilst he pretends to give you the right amount of cash back (it is of course less than it ought to be, because if somebody didn’t try to cheat you out of your cash, well, it would just not be a day in YOUR life, it’d be some lucky stranger in Canada). The adventure continues and next up you have ahead of you thirty red lights, … “But there’s only 12 traffic lights from here to school, what the?” … yeah, well that’s in the past smart-pant-traffic-light-counting-dude, now there are thirty, and for you they are all red. As if that wasn’t enough, one of them is broken, so it isn’t actually red, it’s more of a stop sign at a very busy intersection (how convenient NOT), the stupid-motherless children from hell are running as if Barney was signing autographs for free all over the school zone which means that instead of going 20 mph like you’re supposed to (even though you weren’t really planning to) you’re going like 3 or 4 mph if you’re lucky. We’re past that, you think you can breath again, you’re only three lights away from entering the campus’ parking lot. You didn’t count however on the crazy Aunt Jemima exiting the McDonalds at the corner and almost hitting you which was nonetheless a rush, or the motorcycle guy thinking that he’s some of REAL racer, because if he was he wouldn’t be racing in the street but in one of those God forsaken designated places to race instead of the freaking streets of Dallas! Oh yeah, there is the lady with the Volvo exciting the BankOne, hmm, if you only had a gun. Well so it’s not the same lady but you are quite sure it could be from the stupidity she displays while attempting something so simple as going from a parking lot into a street lane without killing somebody, or maybe, she did want to kill someone. So it’s now 8.50am and you’re looking for a parking space, all the good ones are taken. Finally heartbroken almost you take the one lonely place in lot Z and start the two-mile walk to the classroom. You get there and your teacher shoots you the nastiest look in his arsenal and says with a squeaky voice “You’re late Ms. Cordoba”.   Point taken?  If I could exercise my free will, none of that would have happened or would ever happen again. There is no free will.
