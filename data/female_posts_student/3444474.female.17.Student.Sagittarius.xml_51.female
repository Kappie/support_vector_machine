I hate napping, I can't get to bed before 3. I just want to sleeeeeeeep.  In other news, I talked to Cameron today, not on the phone, but while I was at work. He's ok. He'll prolly come over for dinner at some point within the next few days, which is nice, I haven't seen him since sunday and I miss him. So that's good. :)  My eyes are still stinging. In fact it's more of a constant stinging than one might think. I think that my eyes are therefore permanently tired, which sucks my ass, but oh well. My sleep schedule is fucked.   I'm gonna go shower now, since when I came home I totally crashed on my bed...again.   //"won't you let me explode, in a karaoke supernova..."  woot Ben Folds *rocks out*
