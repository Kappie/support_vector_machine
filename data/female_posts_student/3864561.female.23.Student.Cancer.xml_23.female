Now we don't have a scanner, but I had a play around taking photos of the scan photo with our digital camera and managed to get a decent-ish picture. So here it is:       I know it looks more like a "magic eye" picture than anything else at first but once you work out which bit is which it does actually vaguely resemble a baby; the blob on the left of the photo is the head (facing upwards) and the larger blob on the right is the body (if you look closely you can see a white line which is the spine). You can also just about make out an arm (the blob above the head) and a leg (the blob above the body) too.
