I guess I was wrong to think that he cared considering that he hasn't wrote. I have been trying so hard to fix the problems that we are having and instead of helping me control the pain I am in right now, he is dragging the pain out. I just can't do this anymore. He is making me hate him. I want to call him or E-mail him in order to tell him that he is an asshole. On the other hand, I just want this to be over. I just don't know what to do and I hate myself for feeling this way. I promised myself that I would never put myself in a situation where I could be hurt. Now here I am in pain. What a fucking stupid idiot I have been.
