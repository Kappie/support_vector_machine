I have cried enough, these past two years. And I have cried again, and I know that this will not be the last time I shed tears for him, him whom my friends deem unworthy, him whom my friends would beat up if he continues to be the cause of my misery.  But then again, my misery is no other's fault but mine.   I've let him down too many times. The fact that he still talks to me is even a miracle. I ought to be grateful. I ought to be happy for him.  But I'm human. I'm a fucking girl. And I can't.
