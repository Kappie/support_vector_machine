Lol, Valerie was stealing the chocolate chips now and then. Surprised that was still some left. Hoho! Anway, we were laughing ourselves silly most of the time. And me and Valerie tried to put our head out of the window grills. Lucky never get stuck, you will see us on the headlines tomorrow. Lol. Ooo, we were taking lots of the picture, and the cookies burnt right in front of us. Haha...       What a pity that Li Jia Wei lost. She was leading 3 sets to 1. Then the opponent fought back to level. And in the dramatic final set, Li Jia Wei lost by a very very small margin of 9-11. It was so close. But there is still hope! She can still get the bronze and I believe she will!      Damn, lost $5 just now. My heart pains!!! Trying not to think about it. And my brother didn't show any form of sympathy. How mean!      Btw, Man Utd is finally selling Forlan. Amazing how long he lasted that. He is a FLOP! (wahahaha). And Liverpool is gonna trashed Man City! yeah!
