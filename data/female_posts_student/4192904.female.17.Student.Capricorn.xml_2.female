It's a thai movie about this very famous boxer who is a homosexual... Very interesting and sad... The 2nd one is the Truman Show. It's more touching than funny... It's really amazing, It's about this guy who has been living in this so called "perfect world" and have been filmed since he was borned. Everything has been arranged for him, the friends he made..etc Even the girl he was to marry was also arranged by the direction and TV crews! He thought that he was living in a normal world but he isn't. The director made him lived in this so called "perfect" world.. Terrible...       Ate macdonald today again.. Hai.. I think i'm gonna have a hard time when school starts.. AEROBICS... (-_-)'' I have been eating non-stop!!! Must control.....      Sometimes wonder if i'm lame or boring... Sometimes i think i fit perfectly to what Han has decribed those girls who he think are lame or act cute.. Sometimes i try to think of something to say to my new friends, but they either made no response to what i said or they would start to talk among themselves.. Sometimes i'm so fed up that i'll just keep quiet rather that say sumthing rubbish and have people think that i'm act cute or lame. I just want to be myself... my bubbly cheerful old shelf... Like what Han and the others had asked me..: What has happened to the old Ah Bin? I can't answer that question myself too...      Eh... Should i go for the poly class gathering at sentosa on wednesday? Hmm... I'm afraid that I'll be left alone there again... Really want to play and enjoy myself too.. I also have my playside side of me too... Q told me to go and get myself bonded with the class... Hmm... Hope it will work..       When may told me that she was getting very well with her classmates.. I don't know why but i have this strong negative feeling.. I even said nasty stuff to her.. Feel so guilty... ='{ Ha! You guys must have though that it was jealousy, didn't you? No.. It wasn't.. I guessed.. I'm just afraid that she'll forget  her old friends...      Woah.. I wrote quite alot.. And i haven't started studying for my MEDISOC yet!! AH!!!! Ok, I shall stop here.. Take care all the pepole out there! And pepole who are in np, enjoy yer break! For people who are not in np, hang on there! Cheers!!! =)
