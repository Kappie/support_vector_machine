None of them are Notre Dame but... I'm still applying to Notre Dame of course but, I know what the letter is going to say. I did really good on one of the sections though, Mechanics and Reasoning I think it's called. I got 17 out of 18 and got in the 99%. Math was atrocious and I didn't do as bad as I thought I was gonna do on Science. I'm happy with the 23, and for those who don't know, ACT's are out of 31 or 36 or something like that. So, 23 out of 36 aint too bad. I'm happy. I wanna do better but, I can deal with that. Other then that the day was uneventful... they changed the fries they serve in the cafeteria... bastards. x0x
