Commencement was happening, and the town was full and music was playing in the streets, but my man and I walked on the periphery of it all.  We woke up in the afternoon and bathed each other and stood out on his balcony and drank chai. We washed my truck and took pictures of each other and ate Chinese food while doing a crossword.  We rented movies and forgot to watch them.  We ran in the dark on a track that wove through the woods, and there were lightning bugs and wild grasses and the moon was up.  We went home and tossed around in bed then went out and drank beer and laughed at each other.  It's a charmed life.  This weekend was all a blur.  I was so tired and strung out from wild night after wild night, and then having to work early every morning.    Dreamed I was killed in a high school shootout.  Highschool was like some underground cinemax thing.  Demon incarnates that acted surprisingly like real sixteen year old boys orchestrated a game of dodge ball with guns. They murdered me and I went straight to hell, but hell wasn't too bad.  Just a cottage with cobblestones and a lawn that needed mowing.  Had an orgy in there with an older lady who wore a tie dyed shirt and some hunks from the movies.    Dreamed I was in the woods with a woman like the witch from Snow White, a pale black hearted queen.  She grew mold on her face, green like the stuff that grows on grapefruits.  She shriveled away in quicktime.   Gave my stepmother a simple card and a "Bush/Cheney 1984" sticker for a late Mother's Day.  I am so horrible at keeping up with that stuff.  I rarely remember holidays except x-mas, and I have a poor sense of social etiquette.  I couldn't give a shit if I get thank you notes or birthday cards or whatever.  But my stepmother, bless her, really does care about that stuff.  I have to remember that.  She really liked even the small overture I made.  It was so easy, and I felt like a dick for not putting out more effort for people I love.  Same thing with my roommate.  She was hurt and angry about the lack of a party on her graduation last night.  She said she didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but we should have known that there should have been something more than a handful of people in a room with beer.  So lesson learned, I hope.
