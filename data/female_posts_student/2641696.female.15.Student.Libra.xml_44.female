And while I've gotten used to her little funks where she's just a bit mad at me for whatever reason (I've never actually talked to her about it before) because she normally grows out of it in one or two days, but wowie, it's a lot worse this time. Normally I wouldn't care, because she's not my only friend and as long as we don't go hating each other I don't mind not being stuck together at the hip, but M happens to be right in the middle of our little social group with me, and if she suddenly gets mad at me I don't want everyone to be dragged into sides...   So if someone knows what's going on (if anything), please tell me... so I can either ask her about it or fix what I'm doing wrong... Iunno. If there is something going on, it was bound to happen -- we are at the opposite extremes. Hippie v. shopaholic. ^^; oooh, the drama of high school... Gah. I was hoping that wouldn't happen here. This kind of thing only happens to my sister o_O
