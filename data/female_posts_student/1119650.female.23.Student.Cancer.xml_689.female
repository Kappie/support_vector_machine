My supervisor agreed and since I had the vacation time she let me take the day.  I got my hair done (red again as is my usual now) and just generally vegged out.  Thursday night was pretty crazy 'cause we too Megan to Finn's for the first time.  We all got pretty snotted and it was a good time indeed, but I was a little burnt from that so I stayed in Friday.  No motivation whatsoever to go out.    Saturday was a really nice day so mom and I went to go Stepford Wives.  It was cute and pretty funny and it mocked Connecticut and more specifically my Town (under the guise of "Stepford" of course).  I think the best line was probably "And I thought to myself 'Where could I build a town of robots that nobody would notice?  Connecticut!'".  So, so true, hahaha.  Saturday night Megan, Becki, Stacey and I ended up going up to Danbury for a yummy girls night out dinner and some chit chat that we all needed to catch up on.  Good times indeed.  I learned a valuable lesson that night though:  you can't fit a shopvac and 4 people into a Jetta.  Well, you *can*, but its not very comfortable for people of a Bex and Meggish nature.  (c:  Went to  urlLink the boy's  house for some forestry and a lil MTV movie awards action (he loves Lindsay Lohan).  I think the best part of the show (aside from the Beastie Boys performance) was this commercial that aired during it which showed black people pointing to jewelry saying "bling bling" and eventually a white girl over hears it at school and uses it and then all the white kids are saying it and then their parents are saying it.  It ends with a screed reading "Bling Bling 1997- 2003" it was pretty goddamned funny.  Sunday we went to the Pallisades center to Best Buy and the Apple store and a couple of other places here and there, came home, watched the tube for a lil while and then it was off to hockey, well for the boys at least.  Bex and I had some beers and cheered and watched Reg win his game!  Woo!  He made some pretty good saves, so I'm all proud.    Unfortunately Todd's opponents forfeited so that kinda sucked, but it was no biggie.    that's it.  Pretty boring to read about, but fun to have participated in.  Also: if there is someone on the planet that's *not* playing Halo yet: what the HELL are you waiting for.  I suck at it, but its still pretty fun.  (My guy is pink!  Woooo!)
