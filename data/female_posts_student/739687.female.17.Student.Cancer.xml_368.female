So Thursday I had my pre-op, and of course, when they were taking my blood I started getting dizzy and I was just kinda like 'uh oh....' and passed out. When I woke up there were 3 nurses freaking out because I sort of had a seizure? They tested my blood sugar, and of course, it was low. My family has a history of diabetes, and I don't have it, but it's something I'm aware of and have to watch out for later in life. Ahh well, I was really lethargic dont-give-a-crap about it. It was funny how little I cared. Then I went and had my hair streaked RED over the BLACK I dyed it the day before. *sweet stuff*  Okay, so yesterday I had my surgury. And yeah...I guess I'm okay except my stomach sorta hurts whenever the hydrocodone starts wearing off, and my shoulders hurt a bit from the CO2, and my throat is sore from the tube they put down it, and I have two incisions in my stomach, and I get dizzy when I sit or stand up, and it's kinda hard to do either with much ease....but other than that...I'm fine.  Yeah...I guess I'd better go lay down again. LoL.  Okay crazies, see you when I'm recovered (tomorrow most likely).
