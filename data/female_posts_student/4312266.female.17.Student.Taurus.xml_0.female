First musical rehearsal tonite and I can already tell it's gonna be great. I get to be a whore AND insane. SWEET! How does it get better than that? Honestly. I love this driving thing! It rocks! For those of you who don't know, or who I lied to for a while (can you blame me?) I just got my license Friday. Ok, if I lied to you about that at any point, I'm REALLY sorry, but can you really blame me? I mean, I'm 17, I shoulda had it last year when Ben got his. But it's all good, cuz I've got it now. Which means, yes, I AM going to get piercings and tattooes and randomly go out with people. If anybody has Psychology with Mr. Owens, that class ROCKS! Larissa, you're right, Mrs. Koerten DOES act like a kindergarten teacher. And I would come to school stoned during her class if I did that, but I don't. I do lots of stuff, but not that. Wow, I wish I had more to ramble on. I don't really so I'm going to make stuff up. Saturday nite I went out with a friend of mine to get his tattoo worked on. It's fun. And the dude at the tattoo parlor was like, Hey baby, you look like you need something on your body. So we went over to his desk to look at the pictures and stuff, even tho the whole time I'm like, yeah, I'm not getting a tattoo, not yet anyways. And he's just like, yea, that's alright sweetheart. And the next thing I know his hand it creeping up the back of shirt! I'm like, EWW! Ok, this guy is like 45 and he's greasy and gross and he's like as much body hair as he has tattooes and his beer belly's hanging out and EWW!!! So, I bitch slapped him and then I kneed him right in the balls, it was fabulous! I grabbed my friend and we were outta there faster than you've EVER seen anyone run. It's like those Olympic commercials where the person like running and all of a sudden he turns into this Olympic runner and then right back to himself. Yea, it was like that, only way creepier and way cooler at the same time. Haha, ok so I hope ya'll could tell that that story was made up, but if you couldn't tell that's WAY sweet! You need to be my friend. Well, that's all for now! Luv Ya'll!
