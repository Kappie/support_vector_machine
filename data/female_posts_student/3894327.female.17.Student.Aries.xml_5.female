Since I'm bored I will talk about this.   Why is it that when I need to say something the words get lost some where between my brain and mouth? This it seems is a fairly common problem. I have seen many people attempt to say something and end up saying nothing at all, or worse saying something foolish. Judging from ads I have seen on TV the next course of action when faced with such a crippling problem would be to make a pill for it. While I have not yet heard of such a project , I am sure that in a laboratory owned by an company that has an acronym for a name, there is a team of highly trained professionals seeking a physical cure for a mental problem.   I am not sure where I am going with this, as I said before I have nothing to say, and nothing tends to go nowhere. So here I am, nowhere talking about nothing. I am sure a conclusion should be drawn from what I have said, but I really have nothing to say. Think of your own.   -Driel
