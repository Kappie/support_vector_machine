First, we went to her friend Sheri's house so Amanda could pick up some clothes she had left there. She has talked about Sheri before, so it was nice finally meeting her. Then we went to the mall because Amanda needed to get a bathing suit top. Let me just say that the fat kid didn't get the low carb pizza this time! Oh yeah! haha. After the mall we stopped by Marty's house to pick up some CDs. We stayed there for about 20 minutes, maybe, and then we went to Alex's house to pick up another CD. When we were there, I had to do some "dirty work" for Alex. The things I do! Jeeze, I'm such a good friend! haha. So far that has been my day, but I doubt it will get any more exciting. Tomorrow Marty is coming over, and on Friday I'm going to Hooters with Amanda, Aaron, and a friend of Aaron's choice...possibly Winslow. Basically what I'm trying to say is that I'll have more to blog about later.
