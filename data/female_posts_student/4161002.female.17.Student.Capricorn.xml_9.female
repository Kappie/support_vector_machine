They even order pizza loh (ha...ha... can ask me make mah, no need waste money buying) as though a small party. Well didn't quite enjoy it. A bit sian... okay, their club are considering to merge the two department, the photography and the designing as one. (it's fine with me loh cause i am interested in both) Quite interesting to go around school of business and take event pictures. (erm...a bit like mrs fong like tt loh) BUT the sian part is, they only give 1 cca points per semester (tt's no matter how active you are in the club, die die also 1 point unless you are the committee lah then get 2). tt's very little. The extra module, business chinese tt i join, one semester already got 4 cca points lohz... hence i decided to try the changi youth ambassador. must go through interview. hope choosen loh.  yoru...
