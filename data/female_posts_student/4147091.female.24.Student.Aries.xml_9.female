That would be my 'look before you leap' quality shining through. However, I"ve managed to submit a resume to be a lead researcher for the upcoming SSCR conferance on the proposed restructuring of the Native reserves. Have I any interest in native issues? Not really. But i applied thinking that this might be a good way to get my foot in the door and introduce myself to the NRC as a competent researcher. However, I think back to my entire knowledge base of native issues and all I can think of is Five-Wing Goose Bay. I somewho doubt that will be a leading research topic. But I digress...money is money and experience is worth a million bucks.  However, what prompted me to post again today was a story just recently on The National. Darfur, Sudan. Yes, we all can picture the starving children, left motherless by the Sudanese rebels fight the Islamic government. Yes, we cringe at the staggering amount of women who are being raped during this 'genocide'. But sadly, what interests me is the hesitation of the labelling of this situation as a 'genocide'. I fully understand the reprecussions of the UN announcing the offical term genocide in Darfur. Chapter 7 (?) peace keeping missions and all that bull. But do we have to remain blind to the horrific acts of violence and horrid rape of humanity that occured just 10 years ago in Rwanda? Will we let Kofi Annan follow in the footsteps of the incompetent leaders that have come before him? Or will we 'outsource' the policing of the Darfur, only to make the area a protectorate of some other country? We should take a page out of R. Dallaire's book (not literally, having not read it yet) and shout at the top of our lungs, go crazy with the maddness of it all until the UN is faced with the reality of the situation. It will come to a chapter whatever peace keeping mission. Whether is comes to that now or in two months or in a year should not be a concern. What should be OUR concern is that we make it happen now.  What struck me as most humourous in this report this evening was the interview of a very clever academic with the Kennedy Center for Government at Harvard. She suggested that we call in those most emotionally equipped to deal with the 'problem' being created in Darfur, those unlikely Rwandians, who are truly the only people who can imagine such acts. Who better to fight the growing genocide than those who have experienced it first hand? Was it not the Congolise who were called in as a front line in Rwanda to help our dear R. Dallaire in Rwanda. The same Congolise who has suffered similar, yet different fates in thier own country? And as backup? This woman suggested that 'uncontroversial' countries such as Canada (a known powerhouse in peacekeeping...[Somalia anyone?]), Australia, South Africa (I shutter to consider who would have been in their place 10 years ago) should be the ones to clean up the mess made. At least shes honest about her own countries dangerous laisons. Do we really see a future in Darfur without the U.S.? I can only hope so. But I continue to digress...  Maybe we should 'outsource' the peacekeeping before we demand that the UN do what they were created for. Would Woodrow Wilson be turning in his grave? I doubt, but he probably didn't foresee a UN that would hide behind legal and linguistical technicalities either. But alas here we are, attempting to force the hand of the organization that was created to protect it.  But I should not have to digress again.
