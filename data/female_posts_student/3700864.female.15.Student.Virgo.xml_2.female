So that means I have to go into the school during my summer vacation (DAMMIT!) to get them fixed. Also, for some odd reason like all the teachers are leaving. We lost out principal, our business teacher, one of our computer teachers, one of our wood working teachers, one of our English teachers, two science teachers, one of our mathematics teachers, our French teacher, and one of our Spanish teachers. So that means a good portion of the staff this year is going to be new. I hate this damn place. At least I'm half done with it. Only two years left 'till I'm free.
