He will probably never be well, but at least he isn't struggling to breathe and move in some hospital bed.  I got to watch my dad yell at my uncle who was really, really pissing me off.  Then we went to dinner, my choice, but the cheescake factory line was ridiculous so we went out tonight and will again on Friday.  And... I get to drive the Mustang all day tomorrow.  Life looks a little bit better today.
