I had to waited for over an hour in line. Not funny to me. I felt drained when the doors finally opened. Ya know the price for a permit doubles (???) when you have to redo it. ::sigh:: But, as I was in the lil testing room, there was a nervous 1st timer on my left and a confused immigrant on my right. I just sat all calm and checking off answers w/ confidence. However, there were a bit annoying. They seriously needed to relax. And to stop that tapping and frustrating sighing. Plus, never forget how the DMV doesn't care whether you have peace while taking the test. Annoucements were as loud as ever and the people outside of the room didn't have the decency to keep it down. Good thing I used to working under distractions.  Fortunately, I passed the written exam again. 100% this time (the lady turned the 100 into a smiley face). I had three errors the last time and now that I think of it, they were dumb questions to miss. But, oh well...c'est la vie. Now about that behind-the-wheel test...
