We also got wet, but it was windy so it was a little chilly. We got our pics taken in the begining. I got it in the form of a keychain, so in order for me to scan it, I'd have to scan the whole thing. I don't think I screamed so hard in my life...Well anyways, I don't think there really is a word to describe how much fun I had.
