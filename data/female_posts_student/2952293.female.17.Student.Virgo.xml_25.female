Doc tells her that if she's going to stay, she needs to wear goggles, she asks why, he says just cause we're working with bleach. So she goes and gets one of those masks that has the entire sheet of plastic which covers your entire face, and walks around the room like it's infected with the deadliest gas on earth. God, she's so obnoxious. It was CLOROX!
