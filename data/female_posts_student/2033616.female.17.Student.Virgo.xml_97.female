You may notice a common theme in these lyrics (if you're bored enough and have the patience to read through them all)  yes they're all about love.  It's not that i'm looking for a boyfriend, or feel i need one, or anything like that... i just am very anxious for MY love story to evolve... a real one... not one i make up for myself.  I guess i want to hurry and grow up.  I'm tried of facing the world alone, and i want a guy to stand by me and face it with me.  I know relationships bring a whole slew of new problems, i just want to know what it's like to really be in love, to really know who and what you are meant for.  I don't need to know who, I just wish i knew where i was going, what i'm supposed to be doing NOW to lead up to what i'll be doing LATER.  Oh well... all in due time right?
