I'm a  seventeen  year old girl from a small town in Saskatchewan, Canada. People think I am odd because I love my hometown, which I honestly do. Sure, there isn't much to do. Sure, it takes 2 hours to get anywhere to buy clothes. But hey! its peaceful and I know everyone and I don't have to be home before dark because of rabid homeless people! Which, in my opinion, is a major plus, don'tcha think?  Both of my parents are farmers, which means some of the elite farmer knowledge has worn of on me, along with the fascination and contemplation of weather. My brother is going to be 21 soon, which is legal drinking age in the United States, where he works. Yay for him! Americans are funny people. The government will let them join the army before they are 21 and go off and fight and die for their country, but they can't sit in a bar and have a beer. COME ON PEOPLE, THATS JUST NOT RIGHT!   I have a dog named Sandy, who is my best friend pretty much. (Don't get me wrong, I have lots of friends! But I love my dog a lot. Her current nickname is Sugar, don't ask why.) I also have a big tankful of African Convict Cichlids, which I find utterly fascinating. They fight, they build nests, they have babies...its like a frickin soap opera in a box! Or an aquarium....whatever.  Someone said something to me once which I found rather amusing, and I have thought about it a lot to this day. It was, and I quote:  Your personality is exactly like that of a seasoned pot-smoker.  You sure don't hear that one everyday. I wasn't really sure what to make of it...is that a good thing? The person followed up the comment with an explanation.  The movies you like, the ideas you have, and the way you act...all of it points to pot.    Another thing that I have been told about myself which I find interesting: Two people have told me this, TWO PEOPLE. One of them is 24, the other 22. They have never met.  You were born in the wrong decade. Your personality and maturity level are that of a 21 year old.  Hmmm....so people are trying to tell me that I appear to be a 21-year-old pot smoker? Is that the way people see me?? Jesus, I gotta work with my agent.  Well, the hour grows late and the candle burns low. I should tottle along off to bed. And if anyone actually does sit down and read this, please leave a message.  PS. Pictures to come! (Just as soon as I figure out how to add them! >.  PSS. OMG! Only 10 more days before I have to go back to hell! I mean school...no I mean hell! :(
