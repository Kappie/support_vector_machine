I thought I could look to people for support, but it seems like I have go with this all alone... Wow, I feel really unnecessary right now, to everyone.  I'm going to finish watching a movie then head to bed. Gus and Wish are already sleeping. I work in the morning and I'm hoping that I will fall asleep sooner than later.  Have a good night, whoever reads this.    If anyone is bored, I wouldn't mind an email to read in the morning. Thanks.
