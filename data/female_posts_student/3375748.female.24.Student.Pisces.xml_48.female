It was expensive!!! We spent $79.50 for tickes, and the locker spent us $12!!! We only brought $100 with us, and we had nothing left after that. That day was hot, which was good. We went to all those water rides. Most of them were fun, but kind of short. I wish they were longer. It was really good to see all those good looking people and cute kids. I haven't go to any water park for a long time. It was really fun. I wanna go again with more people next summer!!! urlLink     urlLink
