YES...it's all so mysterious and mind-boggling. Lots of car chases, decoding crypt messages, and a bit of romance at the end (just a bit? =D) . Yep, the first time i heard about this book was early this year, when my Mom and Dad was watching Fox News (american news channel available in Dream Satellite..sorry, no Sky cable :( ), the daily news anchors ala "Unang Hirit" [lol] were talking about this book which talks about the mysteries and adventures of an American Symbologist and a French cryptologist discovering the truths about the lost secrets if the Holy Grail. At first, i wasn't a real book freak on religious subjects...what more on the cheesy Grail part...lol. But on July 23, after the outreach, My Mom, saw the DaVinci Code on a National Bookstore bestselling list. She told me about how internationally acclaimed this book is. She wanted to buy it. Well, I encouraged her to buy it and finally got myself involved in it.lol =D We bought it (thank God for that) and when we were on our way home, i took a peek in the novel. I saw exciting parts and i was itchy to read the book right away!!  Fast forward to a week later, i was in the middle of the book and i can't seem to let go of the book! Ask Karen, Klarisse, Steph and a co-DaVinci reader Vicky. They see me all the time with the damn good novel! at dismissal, when Im headed to the canteen or the library, i dunno why, but i seem to bring Mona Lisa with me all the time!! yes...call me addicted and weird.  Now that i've finished the book, im itching to read the book AGAIN!...lol...but my Mom's turn to read it anyway...and while she's not reading it, i sneak and get the book from the shelf and read my fave part. The Romance part....hehe...yeah...i probabaly read that chapter a dozen times...sigh...a love story..well, not really, out of the 105 chapters it has, only Chapter 105 shows a romantic side, lol =D and a bit of Chapter 82...lol...ive memorized it...:) yeah...im fanatic...im addicted...im obssesive! lol  signing out, Larisse
