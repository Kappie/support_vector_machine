If there are any cookies left over feed them to Toby The Scarmaker. Damn it all of you are having fun, damn it. Anyways, leaving early tomorrow morning; not taking my laptop for the ride, it's too heavy. Damn rock with a moniter! Anyways what else are you guys up to? If anyone has a lot of free time and is looking for good games for the PC; here is few titles that you might want to check out.   Homeworld 2  Call of Duty  MOHHA: Breakthrough  Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy  Tron 2.0   Tron 2.0 looks awesome, but you wouldn't understand the game unless you have seen the 80s' movie: Tron.
