Your rational mind tells you that everything is in place, that things are fine and that you have a green light to go ahead with all of your plans. There is a small voice inside you, however, that is suggesting otherwise. Perhaps you have an inkling that your plan is flawed in some way. Perhaps you are trying to ignore a certain pain in your heart by keeping it a secret from others, when in reality, you need to let it out to the world.
