Ryan is off galavanting in Pennsylvania with the Trinity folks,  urlLink Rebecca  is off in south Florida doing God knows what...it's hard to keep track of that girl these days...her blogs are random and mildly incoherent (hi kettle, I'm pot...pot...hehehe)  :)  David is allegedly coming to Orlando, although I wouldn't know because he and I are not on speaking terms today, Dave is in the process of moving back to DC,  urlLink Kimmie  is moving to New York next week, Rob and El are in Atlanta, hell, even Katie and Shawn managed to plan something mildly exciting for the weekend, and me?  I'm stuck in Borelando with my charming cousin for four fun-filled days.  At least Avi is probably going to be in town this weekend, too.  We can be miserable and bitter together.    The good news is that I'm no longer feverish or fluish and I'm sitting up and capable of typing for the first time in a few days.   I'm also up for any suggestions to make this weekend more bearable.
