Once again, I was amazed by the fact that people really do read these rambling, gramatically incorrect things. I know that if it were me, I'd have a hard time resisting the urge to grab a red sharpie and make corrections all over the screen. OF course, my father wouldn't be too happy about that one... School has been just dandy. Did I ever mention that I hated highschool? Well, I did, for a miserable period of my life, which was the first month and a half of being a freshman. I can't say that anymore, though. I'm enjoying most of my classes, clubs are fine, my locker hasn't jammed recently, and most amazing yet: I haven't been squashed against a wall during a passing period. It almost did happen once, though. I guess some people just don't see anyone smaller than them, and push their big butts right through the middle of the hall, sashaying and knocking people left and right with their giant backpacks filled with books and, no doubt, food to increase their already-gargantuan size. Bad news. I was boiling sweet beans so I could make bean drinks, and I was working on my science project (which is almost finished!), and I completely forgot about them. My feet started getting cold, or I finally realized that my toes were a little bluish, and so I went upstairs to grab my blue fuzzy slippers, and lo and behold! I smell something funny. Panic alarm went off in my brain. Holy cow! My sweet beans! I ran downstairs, hopping over a reclining Milo, and practically breaking my blue toes in the process (never jump down stairs without looking where you're going to land.), and open the pot. Ugh, my beans were black. What a waste of good beans. They were my last sweet beans, too, so I'll have to go buy some more. Upcoming events: The LEO installment dinner is at 8:00 pm tomorrow at Chevy's near Bayfair Mall. I'm thinking I'll go early and do some shopping before. Some people are going early to see Honey starring Jessica Alba, which looks like it might be an okay movie, but I think it's practically all guys going-- did I mention it's starring Jessica Alba? So I might poke around the mall for a bit... maybe with Tracy? Cross Country Awards Dinner is on Monday to 8th, and Jieun and I are going to make dessert for 40 people. What a feat. We've decided to make an assortment of err... delicacies, and put them on a large plate, hopefully with many garnishes to make it look appetizing. Or at least acceptable. Even edible will do. I'm looking forward to it, though. Making the stuff, that is. I don't really know about the awards thing. The last time I went was for Choo's senior year, and that was majorly boring. I fell asleep, right next to my plate of spaghetti. Thank goodness it wasn't in it. I've done that before. Hopefully it'll be more interesting now that I'll actually know what's going on. Winterball is on the 13th. The whole day has been planned out for me, by Jessica, Jane, Jodi and Ashley, Amanda, and Grant. I really don't think I've made a single decision for myself during these whole two weeks in preparation for it. Oh wait, I chose my dress. But that was it. First, Amanda persuades me to go with Lester, which I am, by the way, although he hasn't asked... whatever that means. Jane insists that I go, when I was thinking about having a peaceful night at home, Jessica doubly insists that I go with a date, no less, and Grant decides the rest of the night with his whole limo plan. Of course, I made a couple of decisions for other people, too. I asked Ed to go with Jessica, after her hees and haws of not wanting to find out that he said no, which he didn't. And I suggested that Sherman ask Talli, which I completely didn't mean to actually happen. But it did. Yeahh, I don't know what to make of that. So the couples I know so far, that I can think of anyway, are: Lester Mopas and Madrianne Wong Josh Mopas and Amanda Wu Grant Lim and Mariko Cavey Edward Chen and Jessica Shin Greg Hanabusa and Jodi Tam Tyler Ong and Jane Yi William Cho and Jane Kim William Chen and Christina Chao Eric Kim and Irene Hong Sherman Yang and Allison Lui Jon Hui and Jieun Choi Rolondo Lee and Steph Kong Elliot Hung and Anita Hegedus That's all I can name off the top of my head, but there are definitely more. This is going to be exciting. The musical opening night was tonight, actually, and it should be continuing on through next weekend. I think I'll attend one of the nights. It sounds like it should be fun. Plus, so many people put a whole lot of hard work and effort into it. Our science experiments are due on Thursday the 18th, and that's the day of our Winter Orchestra Concert, which is in the CVHS Cafetorium at 7:00 pm. Winter break begins on Monday the 22nd, and continues on through Friday the 2nd. Tracy's birthday is on Wednesda, the 31st, and Christina's birthday is on Friday the 2nd. My goodness, Christmas kind of snuck up on us all, there. I was feeling it a couple of months ago, but the feeling died out, and right now, it just feels wet and cold. No warm fuzzy feeling whatsoever. I'm sure it'll come back, though. Meanwhile, I really have to be getting back to church, and violin lessons. Not to mention piano theory and maybe Christmas shopping. There's a starter list for the next couple of weeks. I think those are going to be two of the most hectic weeks of school. In a good way, of course.
