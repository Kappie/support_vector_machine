We are leaving for Madrid, Spain in 19 days and so stupid activists in Northern Spain decided to bomb Madrid. We are still going, in case you were wondering, but it still upsets me. Even if I do die I know you guys won't miss me. Yes, Oklahoma was a very good play. I congradulate you on your performance Cassie. And Matthew, I still think you need to shave that beard, you look better without it. Well that was my two-cents on that issue. Well, are you guys happy now that I have checked my blog?
