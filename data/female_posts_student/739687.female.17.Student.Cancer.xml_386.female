First, I was bit by a brown recluse. I developed a fatal rash on my arm and it is quickly worsening. Then, I contracted malaria. When I went to the doctor, to do testing for my fatal diseases, he discovered I have the very late stages of skin cancer...why it was not sooner diagnosed I am not sure. Well, they decided to do do further testing and discovered a malignant brain tumor lodged deep in my cranium, with no hope of operating. Now, you'd suppose that this much bad news in the course a day, would dampen my spirits, but I remained hopeful that perhaps I could pull through. That is, until they discovered I had SARS. Now now...SARS is not too deadly so I still kept my head high. Until this morning they told me that I am HIV positive...and it will soon evolve into full-blown AIDS. Okay, so my esteems have waivered a bit.  Okay...I was pretty pissed.  Then, they discovered I have herpes. Yeah. That's probably the biggest blow. In fact...that just sucks.  But you know what really sucks?  I missed this party last night.   My life is freakin' over.   .. .. .. .. ..  I've nothing left crazies. Farewell:-P
