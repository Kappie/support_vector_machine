Sunday service was awesome...even though I made the greatest boo-boo as usual by arriving late at the wrong place and then having to arrive even later at the rite location... darn so I was doubly late... however, as usual, I sat by myself and missed the initial worship session but city church has always have proplonged worship session throughout the svc... Henri and the rest of Planetshakers are back with Ps Russell so that's fantastic..wonder how their trip to US had been... the new album will be coming out soon..I mite juz save enuff marnie to buy the whole Planetshakers collection since it's my final yr... The only thing in mind is that I hope even if I'm not here anymore.. Terence will continue going to church...   We've a guest speaker frm Perth and he spoke abt having to rise up male leader as spiritual head of the family as the observation has been that spiritually the woman in the family has been leading the household... I totally agree to that stance... knowing most guys will bag to defer.. ego?? Ok.. then the Ps spoke of Matt 14:21 on Peter walking on water..which was covered during camp..Coincidence?? I'm afraid not cos I suppose God has something plan for most OCFers and this is another reminder for us... to be focused on Jesus even when life is happy-scared and in the midst of the storm we can depend on Jesus to stretch out his hand for us to clutch on to... it is so true that only in stormy situations that we wholly depend on our Lord for help and the Ps remined us that we shld not see each failure in life as a setback but rather we shld see it as the seedbed for success... but this success can only be possible if we place faith in Jesus to carry us through... like in the valley of bones... we pass through instead of halt and fear... The success will bring us to another lvl in knowing Christ deeper...   I'm guilty of being of little faith cos for most of my life I can't trust anyone and life experiences make me feel that as long as I can handle I don't need to depend on anyone... so it has been hard to juz say "Lord, I trust you" I'm struggling and I admit that... I know He sees my weakness and tries to make me whole again through small situations..During my own QT, I discovered that anxiety and worry are sins that hinders us frm trusting God to provide for us... cos it only brings ourselves before God... rather than let God take the leading role in our lives... Hmm..I neber think of worriness and anxiety as sins and this is a mind-boggling concept for me... Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness then all ye things shall be added unto you...   This Month's motto: Walking-on-Water F.A.I.T.H
