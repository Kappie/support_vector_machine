He stopped directly in front of my car to chase after his multicolored ball that he had so selfishly kicked into the street. I thought about running him over but I remembered that he didn't remind me of you or Simon Birch at all because he on the other hand was cute. I let him live. He should send you a thank you card or something, don't ya think?    Chocolate  candy, Gia
