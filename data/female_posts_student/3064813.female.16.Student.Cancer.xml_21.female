Despite the fact that  I've been singing that song WRONG (that's the most embarrassing thing ever), it still rocks the mad beans.  Seriously.  That song is... sooo.... COOL!  Courtesy of the Pinkerton album.  GUESS WHAT!!!  I have ALL FOUR Weezer CDs, because I am a crazed, maniacal, and redundant fan.  I only have to get those two cool extra CDs and I'll be MADE!  RAAAAAAAHHH!!!!  I have a story to relate.  Later.  Because... bell.  Anyways, hello allison!!!  (hahahaha!!!!)
