No offense to anyone (I admit I hate that saying, because if you say that, odds are you are gonna offend someone) but at the risk of riling some feathers ---- certain people (and by 'certain people' and mean MORE than one) need to take a breather or something. I may be a little optimistic, but I hate when people are dramatic. I look around and hear people complaining.   ....Complaining about their bodies, their boring-ass lifes, their families, their friends and just basically their whole damn situation. Frankly, I am so sick...... completly sick of it.   Can't all of them just open their blind eyes??   You live in AMERICA. The greatest country in THE WHOLE WORLD.  You go to a good, finicially secure, safe school.  You are beautiful.  You are far better off then most people.  And...above all, and most importantly....at least one person, out of all the billions on the globe...loves you.  I know people get in a rut once in a while, and they need to vent, but does everyone really have to drag me down? I sound like a selfish, raving, ranting, lunatic....but this is my venting session.   MY detox.   Those people get to vent, so do I.  All I really hope for is that people can regconize and can see what I do. I am sympathetic, but done.  Completely and utterly done.  I am reading 'The Catcher in the Rye'. Holden Caulfield hates when people are overly dramatic and fake.   I am beginning to relate.
