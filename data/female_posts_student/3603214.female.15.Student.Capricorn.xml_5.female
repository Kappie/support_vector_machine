How can a man who has a cd player need another one? How can a man who has a nice truck living in our garage need to trade both the red truck I was hopin to get and his car so he can lease another truck to get more money? (There's nothing wrong w/ the nice Harley Davidson truck!) How can a man who has no yard need a riding lawn mower? How can a man with most of the niceties and accessories of life need more? I dunno, but I'm still stumped with the lawn mower...
