It's just to hard to say goodbye Listen to the rain  I stand alone in the storm  Suddenly sweet I say no Couldn't they stay for you haven't much time Open your eyes to the love around you You can feel youre alone But I'm here still with you You can do what you dream Just remember to listen to the rain
