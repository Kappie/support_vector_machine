First thing I was trying to think about is why I treat Ashleigh so bad, and I came up with an answer! :: I think that I've out grown Ashleigh!  I think its been like that for awhile!  It would explain my bitchiness towards her!  It would explain the lies!  And I think it would deffinately explain me ditching her for my other friends and for Kyle!  I think that I've been feeling this way for awhile, I just didn't want to realize it, ya know?  Because Ashleigh was my best friend, and you never really want to get rid of someone that you were that close to!  But I guess this fight was the last straw, and it really made me think!  It's better this way!  I'm going to be a lot happier, knowing that I won't have to come up with excuses anymore!  And Ashleigh's going to be a lot happier because she won't have to deal with the lies, the ditching, the bitchiness, and me stealing her friends away from her! ::  Then I started to think about Rachel, because she texted me and I told her that if she wanted to talk that she needed to call me because I was sick of texting!  So she called me ... and she talked to Mark for awhile, and then he handed the phone over to me!  I told her that I didn't want her respect, it would be nice to have, but I don't need it!  I told her that I know the truth and that I want her to believe me, but I don't know how to make her!  I told her that I'm not trying to start problems with Ashleigh, and that I'm not telling her that Ashleigh is a liar!  I'm just saying that maybe the story got a little screwed!  Maybe some things were changed out of anger, I don't know!  And I really don't care anymore!  If me and Rachel are meant to be friends then she will believe me, and I can only hope!  I'm not going to cry about it anymore, but no one is worth my tears!    And then I thought about Tiffany and Amanda and I really don't care if they believe me or not because I was never really that close to them, so I wouldn't be losing much!  I mean yeah, we had fun together ... but I have other friends!  It's not like I'm desperate for their friendship!  Alex ... well, I'm sorry about what happend!  But what can I do? Nothing ... If I can't make his friends believe me then there is no way that I'm gonna be able to convince him! Kelly made a point that if he really liked me (which I doubt he does or ever did) he would believe me!  But how could he believe me ... he has nothing to base what he thinks on!  I mean he barely knows me!  Yeah, we went out for almost a month, but we never really talked and he didn't get to learn much about me!  I mean yeah, I'll be sad to lose him ... but I'm not going to worry about it because that just means it wasn't meant to be!  Oh well!  Shandi, I think its bullshit that you pretended to be my friend!  If you didn't like me then you should have told me from the start!  Whatever fucked up friendship we had was a waste of time to the both of us!  We would have been a lot better off if we never met in the first place!
