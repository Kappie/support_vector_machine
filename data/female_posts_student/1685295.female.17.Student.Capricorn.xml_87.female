I forgot to mention a few things about people I couldn't contact during this whole thing and I wanted to know how they were, that's primarily why I wanted to post.  Dollface, I wanted to call ya and see how you and ur familiy were doing, and Summer, you too, but I couldn't use the phone much, (mom mentioned something about mebbe getting the crap electrocuted out of me, and the phone I was using was expensive) until late at night when she was unconscious. Today I couldn't call b/c I wasn't home and the cell phone was having trouble. Conrad, I only have u cell number and didn't know whether or not it worked.  Well that's all, I'm Deadinside and I'll shut up for the next week.
