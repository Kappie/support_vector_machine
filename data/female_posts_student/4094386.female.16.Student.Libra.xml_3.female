Now that my nightmare is over, I can sleep well tonight.heehee.  I woke up like...5.30 am today... I had a dream that I couldn't do the test because it was too hard...but I'm glad it was only a dream...it wasn't so bad actually, I'm confident that I got 4 questions correct out of 5. That's not so bad right? I'm so happy right now... :)  So anyway, I had an extra class today...until 2.30. Went home with a cab... I was so hungry and there was nothing to eat so I fried some chips...and then watched as told by ginger, (my fav cartoon ever) tomorrow's going to be the last episode of As told by ginger! I can't wait...I've been waiting for this for so long... :) after that I watched "Stuck on you", I saw the dvd on the cofee table and since I had nothing to do, I decided to watch it. The movie is hilarious. hehe.. and then after that I watched 'the simpsons' and after the simpsons I watched my fav new soap opera...Mi Gorda Bella, aka my sweet valentina. Whoaa....I didn't realise I spent the whole day watching TV!  So here I am writing about what I did today... I guess that's all.... write more soon.  :)
