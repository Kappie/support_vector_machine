(Sorry to borrow from you, Sam)  All I have done today is try to sleep and lollygag about in my jammies.  And watch a movie.  Pretty daft.  Ok, the movie I watched was "Thirteen Going on Thirty."  Who is the GUY in that movie?!?  He is hecka hot.  Ooooooo...  Ok, yes, that movie was totally predictable and followed the outline for basically any romantic comedy/chick flick.  But, maybe it was just my melancholy mood-- I dunno-- but I thought it was really sweet.  Are there true, faithful, honest guys out there???  I also think Jennifer Garner did a good job, especially playing a thirteen-yr-old in a thirty-yr-old's body.  Her mannerisms, esp. at first, were very gawky and adolescent-esque.  Ok, I'm going to "arrivederci."  Au revoir, mon amies.  Did I get that French right, Allie??
