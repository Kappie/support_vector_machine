Any of ya'll that are reading this and don't know James' site go to it its:                http://logosamor.blogspot.com/   You can also get there by going to his profile on here and choose from his many sites. They are all good.   Oh anyone that likes the tagboard.....thank James, it was his doing. I am so totally incompetent with technology. Oh well!
