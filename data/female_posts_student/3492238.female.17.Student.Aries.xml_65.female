POKER RUN! This weekend! I'm so excited! Really can't wait. Work tomorrow then I'm outta here all weekend, back in for 4 on Monday. Sweet. It's SM's birthday today. She's out all weekend too. 19. I should call her tomorrow. 19. I know where she is...  Done! All done. Next year, if I'm not on a good team with people my own age, or with KK or SW, then screw it. Where's the fun? I couldn't seem to find it this year. I don't blame Christina for leaving after one game, I mean, she was 20. I'm young to her, not to mention the rest of those children. That's exactly what they are, sooooo young frosh!  Dance shoes today! :) I'm happy I got them. One less thing to do on Friday, so now we don't have to stop in K-Town..that would have been crazy with out boat and everybody else's boat...bah. POKER RUN!! It's supposed to rain on Friday..oh no...we'll have to sit in the Tavern..god I hate it when that happens... lol. Yeah right. The return of Billy and Rodgie.. haha. Erich I can handle, but that Normand scares the shit outta me!! lol. We missed Rod Stewart! Good times. It will be this weekend. Can't wait!  Stirling tomorrow, 6. Tell your friends! lol Wait a minute..your friends are my friends.. (This land is your land..this land is my land...) Spread the word. Need to talk to LB! Straighten things out.  To Bed!
