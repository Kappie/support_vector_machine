(i dont know about this god thing, but i still pray each time i write in this blog to learn how to spell. i know there is spell check, but that's cheating.)  and so we get nostalgic on your asses.  so it's fall 2001. i'm a junior at A  nice. it is, oh 2 or 3 am. my friend wes and i had finished studying in the fort we built of pillows in rudder tower, and have moved on to the MSC to get into some trouble. we're standing in the ramped hallway by the flag room (the hallway with the wooden thingies), and a football and an athlete walk up to us.  yes, i said that right.  so this girl in a football costume, and a nice young man in a football player's costume come up to us. they say they are going to the athletic dorms to serenade the football players before the game, and to pep them up.  we of course, were game.  i'll tell the rest after i ruin the story and tell the best part: after i introduce myself, the nice young football player says,  "hedish? as in the website??"   good god, it still makes me happy. i'm not famous. but damn, i was for one night!  so we DID go with them, and sang you are my sunshine to a err, happy?, guy, and danced around...      oh air. how i miss you.
