And after that, I needed to drive him back Padstow, it's so far away, I needed to drive about 1 hour. Then he made his new computer and we had fish, prawn and chips (very delicous).  今日，晨早起床便同Gavin去左北面的悉尼，去做什麼，去了North Rock的電腦市場，因為他要買電腦用品。之後，我駕車車他回佢屋企，好長的車程，差不多用了我一個小時才回到Padstow。之後他便砌他的電腦，而且我們買了魚、蝦及薯條，好好味呀。
