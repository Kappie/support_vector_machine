It seems anything I want I can’t get It’s always out of my reach, and I can’t take it no more My love has left me, I’m cold and alone My soul quivers and shakes trying to escape my cold heart I’ve lost sight of the light that once I saw shine so bright now it to a miniscule flame delicate enough that I fear the slightest breeze the chains that bind me hold heavily against my heart the key I’ve locked away in the darkness I’ve grown within My whole body’s numb my pain and suffering is like novicane (supposed to be Novocain but I can‘t spell)  it’s been poured over my delicate frame and I’m numb from the pain My esteeme is low as it is my walls crumble in I’m lost in myself I don’t know who I am anymore Why I’m here? Why I live? My being is obsolete with iron locks and chains  I try to lock away my pain the suffering grows expands till it grows to big it consumes me I have nowhere to run no place to hide! I hurt inside I cry I scream…nothing nothing at all my outer self refuses to give in even when I fall even after I die the mask stays on Each time a wound opens a new mask is there  in it’s place I don’t know who I am anymore I’m a stranger to myself I don’t know how I feel whether it be pain, sorrow, hatred, what! My feelings are mixed I just want it to all end Maybe then my pain will go maybe then I’ll know the answers to my questions left unsaid maybe, maybe then…There’s hope through small a hope is there I can only pray Pray that one day one day in my bleak future I’ll break free Free of these chains that bind me in pain That one day I’ll feel the warmth of light, love, happiness…    you decide what you make of it. I also went through other writings i had scattered throughout that notebook...and found this...   Anger has such a way with words Sorrow is often felt in my despair Pain is present everywhere I go Suffering is what I scream out Hatred is what feeds my soul Agony is what rips me apart Death is my welcoming friend My anger consumes me It turns me into a monster  I stare at the mirror and realize something All those lies are true all my pain is real I’m worthless to you; no one cares They should be happy when I’m gone Whish is why I open my arms with a smile on my face And I’m welcoming death now as my friend  To long have I lived with this hate and anger! To long have I suffered from this pain! I wont take it any more! Just take my life away! Kill me now! *laughs* What are you afraid? ALL I WANT IS TO DIE! So kill me now!  Now I laugh in your face Full of tears, for what? My lose? I did you a favor one you can’t undo I welcomed my friend, Death! I wont suffer, I wont hurt, I wont… Hey, What the HELL! I still hurt and bleed! No! Death is my friend Death has become me…Death is my friend! NO! Death my friend don’t leave! Death…Die…Kill…..   hmmmm more talk of death...surprised i haven't actuallykilled myself yet? sometimes i am *evil grin* here's another i found...   Why does it feel like I’m being dragged down?? Did I ever do anything Wrong? How come my life has to be this way? So much pain and sorrow I hope strong I don’t know who to trust anymore I don’t know who’s my friend There’s no on to turn to  No where to hide I can’t get away From my feelings I hold inside What happiness I dare do find I cling to with my life For I know now ever so well It can be taken away from me In the blink of an eye or a heartbeat of day And not come back to me I’m so confused how I feel right now Am I say, hurt, in pain? Even in my own little world I’m coiled in sadness like a snake I’m empty inside  I don’t know what to feel Still a bitterness is near I deny myself how I really feel And move on in my life I wait in agony for the next day to come In hopes that I will bring A hapiness that last forever Even if it’s just a dream…   a bit more hopefull...but still angst...enough for now?....
