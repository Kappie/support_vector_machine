I love warm nights. I wish I could spend them with someone once in awhile. *searches for music to excite her* oh hell yes, Raized in Black. Fo shizzle. After I last wrote in here Mom called me to come home and do yard work. I got paid for it though. The backyard is almost as immaculate as my room. Michelle and I have plans for an all movie day. I guess we're going to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which I've already seen and IT IS THE BEST DRAMATIC MOVIE OUT THERE!!! GO SEE IT!!!!) and Kill Bill 2 (which she's already seen, and highly recommends). Michelle and I went out to Starbucks and played catch-up on our spring breaks, we then headed out the Pinball Petes for some good clean pool fun. Went to U of M North Campus and hung out at the most random places, chilling out and enjoying the view.   Nick and I talked today... yeeeeah. I'm going to try and be more open. If I talk with him tonight I'm going to give him the URL to this blogger. I just have to get really drunk before I do so just so that I won't remember and won't hesitate so much to write my feelings out.   How do I feel (this is for you Keehn): Okay, at the moment I'm sort of chill. I'm really tired for raking the entire backyard (which still looks like shit) with Michelle and playing DDR (the new Michelle and Ashley work out program). As for my emotions. I'm fine right now. I do feel sort of stalker-ish for calling Nick more than once today, but at the moment I thought he wanted to talk... and I was willing to talk. I don't really think I'm open about my feelings, but I'm just trying to make people happy... I really don't want to complicate anyone's life more than it already is; especially Nick's because he has enough relationship shit to deal with from what I've heard from the people up at Fiji, and he doesn't need some little 17-year-old fucking his future up... That's how I feel... Honesty. I'm in love with this illusion, a fucked up image in my head of what things could be, or what my heart thinks it should be, and I need to push myself far away from that because otherwise shit like that *points to last entry* will happen again, and I don't enjoy crying anymore. Welcome back to reality.  And as for other people... I don't think I'll be seeing Him anymore, just because I'm sick of being a toy. I'm sick of being used and then ignored the following day when I come into the building and he just sits there, never talks to me... Michelle agreed that everything is over, I think I'll leave it that way. Then again, I'm naive and stupid for ever starting this shit. I was being selfish and dumb and unrealistic. Because I almost fell for him but I then realized the open relationship and the fact that there was NO future, just coffee houses and HTML, and shit that I'm too scared to admit to. It never occurred, it never will (again). I just need to keep telling myself that and hopefully it will just go away. Kilts and mopeds. Don't you just want to die sometimes?  I need to get my shit together. I need to get a life.  There's Keehn.... oh how I want to delete this entry...
