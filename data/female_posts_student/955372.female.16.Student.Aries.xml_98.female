And omg, ok those of you who know who dtl is, know that he's kinda, well in-the-closet. Well there was this guy there, elliot, and he had this rugby shirt on (dtl-ish) and glasses just like dtl and a voice just like dtl only he was like out of the closet and i'm like OMG ITS FUTURE DTL! it was pretty fun. Aka boring beyond reason. And for some reason the hosts, john and diane, just know a lot of really weird people! like this woman who is just weird, i won't even go there. But even the irish guy was a little out there, Haha. Ok so now i'm done telling about saturday, nothing happened on sunday pretty much. I went shopping. So i was finishing up shopping today con mi madre. and we're driving out of the parking lot of zagara's and we realize we have a flat tire, so we pull into another parking spot. And i'm like "ma! our shit shack on wheels is falling apart... again" and she goes "its just the tire" and i'm like "yeah cuz its like ten years old! and the spare tire is older!" and she's like "it'll be fine" and then this guy, bill from gradyville, comes up and he's like "i'll help you with your tire" and we're like "yay thanks bill from gradyville" and mom held is little kid, little billy from gradyville. What a helpful guy. My mom still insists that the tire had nothing to do with our crap wagon car, but we all know thats not true, right? hahaha. yeah so thats pretty much what happened. Oh god tomarrow is xmas eve and yeah my mom tricked me into volunteering to help cook... all day... and i'm like "ok do you not like these people your cooking for" and she's putting my in charge of cutting/dicing/chopping and i'm like do you not want me to have all my fingers...? anywhat thats pretty much everything i can think of. I'll try and write more later, if i remember, i haven't lately.
