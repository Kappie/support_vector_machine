Anyways--- so thats who this journal entry is dedicated to. :D      Andy and I have only been dating for about two weeks but  most of those two weeks we've spent either hanging out with each other, hanging  out with others, taking drives, talking on the phone, or talking on the internet  together. Sending virtual kisses because we never get time to get to the real  thing. See, we're not the type to be into PDA's because we're private- ya see?  Now if only a few OTHER couples would realize this... the world would be a  better place. If you'd like to read a better explanation of why this is, I would  recommend reading Emily's livejournal--- frodo_fanatic. She has a lovely  explanation that really beats you to crap if you are into PDA's. They just arent  necessary. For you and especially not for us. Anyways--- moving on.     So Andy and I are quite different, yet much the same...      Sorry for those of you who werent reading this in hopes  of hearing about mon cherie- for those of you who were hoping to hear, this  should satisfy you.     *Sorry Im interrupting for just a moment to announce that  i officially, occasionally, am angry with my family. That is all*     So.  Andy is a tall redhead that is a joy to be around. I  am beginning to realize that our relationship is built upon our ability to be  comfortably awkward around each other. You know--- that kind of awkward where  you trip over things on a daily basis, and where you mix up your words  occasionally... that kind of awkwardness. Its really a great thing though you  see, because nothing seems too embarassing to talk about. So we talk about  everything. Andy's friend Matt is a great guy too--- it seems that Andy tells  him everything and then Matt pipes up with it later while chatting with me. It's  cool though. They're both really great guys.     Back to Andy. So when we hang out I always get this  feeling like I've known him forever when in fact when I first started dating him  I hadnt seen him or talked to him in person for about 5 months. But I feel like  we have a great bond in this way I've never experienced before. Uh oh I'm having  a hippie moment!!! Anyways---- So I really need to go over to Jamie's house to  see him--- I've been going through a withdrawal--- he's been gone for about a  week, and I need to make my mom come inside to help me with dinner so I should  go.... Tata!!
