I went in and asked if they were hiring and the bartender (Karen) said she'd ask the owner.  The owner came over and I asked him myself and he said he'd look for applications, so I just took a seat and waited.  At the end of the bar was this old guy (Jack) who wanted to buy me a drink.  I protested (I honestly don't like taking anything from anyone I don't know...there are always strings attached), but after awhile I just accepted.  I was sitting there talking to everyone who works there (bartender, owner's daughter, the assistant to the manager, etc.), and the owner came back and said, "So, when can you start?" and I told him tomorrow, and he said fine, come in.  I hadn't filled out an application or anything!  And then the guy at the end of the bar insisted on buying me dinner.  And then the bartender kept refilling my drink...and it's all been downhill from there ever since.  Yesterday I worked and went out with them afterwards (despite my protests), stayed out until 3:00 am (I only had to be at work at 9:00 am this morning, no worries), and seemed to manage to make the Jewish 33-year old want me.  All in one night.  I have to get to work now, but whoa.  Odd turn of events in my neighborhood.  All I know is that I need a sugar daddy in this town, a nice, temporary one, who will pay for my shit and take me out to dinner.  I've never been that way but this summer I'm broke as a joke and I am not ashamed to admit it...and do what every other sleazy girl would do if she couldn't pay for things herself!
