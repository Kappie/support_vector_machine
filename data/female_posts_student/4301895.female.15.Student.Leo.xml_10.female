We're living in this same city yet there's nothing but nights when we can't see each other Got no time, got no latitude, and got no money either But the antenna in your heart meant to receive the signal of my love Don't let such minor details rust even that   On nights you can't sleep close your eyes, honey bunny And count not the number of sheep but the words of love I gave you One night shouldn't even be close to being long enough I know what your dreams are, and I realize what my dreams are too My mind's about to explode with having to just deal with myself But still, not being able to see you is bad for my health and I almost forget your birthday, really, what's wrong with me Surely, no matter how many times we may miss each other in passing How many times I may not be able to reach you by phone With just one kiss everything can be instantly resolved Even when words aren't enough Even when we can't smile If we can just kiss once, really that's all it takes For the last few minutes you've been talking like you're the only one who's lonely but I wanna cry too We love each other yet for some reason its really tough I wanna cry too I wanna cry too! -By Dani-  ~A memorial to Danielle~
