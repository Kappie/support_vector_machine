Arrr, but April also means birthday shopping too. Having an April birthday makes you ever conscious about everyone else who also has an April birthday. There's Tiff and Erum and Anna and Austin and Uncle Garlan, and I'm sure I've forgotten someone. Uncle is great, lol. He promised me anything, but I'm mostly sure it was a joke. Mom brings up that I've been bugging her about a car, but that's a joke too. Mm, maybe. I'm not that spoiled, and I'd just feel bad with anything outrageously expensive and new. Need to get something by Thursday. Am I busy this week? No, just journalism, maybe. And I realized that I do have another week to sign myself out of the hospital. Good. And it then follows that it's another night with Parshaw and Co., and diapers and cafeteria food and just laughing way too hard.  My writing's slipping. Austin's playing weird synth music (after a long Usher run) in the background. Disturbingly atonal. I should sit down and breathe and just think normally for once, but that's beyond me for now. Hah, I still have that legal pad stuffed between the cushions, and someday Mom's going to come across it and read it. But I've left my scribblings lying around before anyways. I wonder how much she knows. She certainly doesn't show it, but she is a person of extreme moods.  I should sober up. School is on the horizon. 7am English, lovely. And all of a sudden, I think Doupe's mom and the cats...
