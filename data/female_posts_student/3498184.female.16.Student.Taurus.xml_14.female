I guess it must be lack of sleep during the weekend. I got 5 hours of sleep before work on saturday, and 6 hours before work on sunday. It was hard at work those days. It's okay if it takes me awhile during the week, becuz then I can sleep in. Though, on the weekends 5am comes up FAST.   Oh well what are ya gonna do. I probably won't be up too much longer, I'm still tired. Laterz  ~Bayz
