The drama club decided to have a Day of the Dead celebration. So they dressed Wes as the Grim Reaper complete with scythe. Every 15 minutes he would wordlessly pull someone out of class to represent all the teens who die everyday from chronic head-up-ass disease. No, really. Anyway, I was standing by the science block landing this morning with Helen. I just happened to look down just as the Grim Reaper and Theo were walking up the stairs. Sadly enough, in my f'd up little mind this seemed perfectly normal and I just kept talking to Helen. It wasn't until Death and Theo walked directly in front of me that I fully processed what I was looking at. He was a very convincing Death by the way, tall, thin and the costume was very good. So I was a little freaked out. It was early and I was very tired so all I could say was "Helen, do you see that too?". Helen thought we were both going insane-er. God.  Ever listened to one of the phone sex shows? Those things are really crap. Someone gave me the number to one today so out of curiosity me and a few friends called on our cellphones. Really, two guys going "Oh yeah!" into a phone does not constitute sex. It was sooo fake. Bah, what's the point of phone sex shows anyway? There so much good porn on the internet... Yeah, I'm a perv.  Goodnight! I must go spy on neighbor. Err, I mean do homework or something.
