My web browser is just taking forever to load, that's all. Easily remedied. Anyways, I'm getting ICQ instant messaging, which you're probally thinking is pointless because I already AOL, Yahoo, and MSN instant messaging. The next one, this you're really gonna laugh at, Google Bloger instant messaging! Meet: Hello. Hello is this really new, kickass im system. The features are hot! It's got animated everything, file streaming instantly between you and up to 4 other people, and it connects ot Picasa (the last program I'm downloading). Picasa is a web imaging wizard. I already have like 3 other programs like it, but Picasa lets me put pictures online, so I can upload them to my blog.    My friend Tyler, no, not Taylor, this one's Tyler. Anyways, he's this awesome artist, and one of the things that he does is photography. He's got some awesome pictures that he's sent me, and I'm gonna be awesome and let everyone else see them in my blog! It's weird, my blog's really become addicting. I write in it everyday while I rock out to my 2003 warped tour CD.    So guess what else is new... My self piercing shit came in the mail today. I got 2 needles, a tongue barbell, a nose stud, and a pair of those tongue grabers. Can't quite remember what their called, something like forcepts...    Oh well. I really wanna get it done today, and I can think of three people that might be able to do it. unfortunately all of them I'm not too close with, and I'm not sure if I completely trust them... Oh well, at least this isn't the piercing that I really need absolute trust and closeness with whoever. That one is a lot lower...    Lol, maybe one day I'll be brave enough to consider that one. until then, I've got a ton more that I want to do with my ears!    ~Ani
