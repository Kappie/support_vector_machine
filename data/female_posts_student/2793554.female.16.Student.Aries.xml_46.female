Apparently he took a bunch of stuff he got off the internet and it was a bunch of stuff mixed. thats really fucking scary. i hope his girlfriend of now is ok...  MY MOM IS INSANE!!!! that is all i have to say. Shes insane. INSANE!!!!  Dylan is so cute. He left me this long love-filled message and it was adorable.   Im debating whether or not to cut my hair super short so i could spike the hell out of it. Maybe that would be too much of a pain in the ass? or maybe it would just make it not suck. And maybe i could get a less ugly haircut... :) Anyway, i feel like doing something insane.   bah. homework sucks.::stabstab::  and the adicts rock! woohoo!  ~abby
