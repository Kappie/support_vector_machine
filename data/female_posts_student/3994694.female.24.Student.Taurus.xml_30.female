He shows the painter what has happened to the portrait, and the painter freaks out, and though not a particularly moral man himself tries to convince Dorian Gray to pray a small prayer of repentence he learnt as a child. He quotes Isaiah 1 to him "although your sins are as scarlet, I will make them white as snow" and begs him to repent. Dorian is annoyed by this, and spotting a knife on the table, picks it up and murders him. He's kind of grossed out by it, so locks the door and leaves. He convinces an old close friend by blackmail to dispose of the body through his knowledge of chemistry.  So continued self-indulgence, Oscar Wilde theorises, leads to self-indulgence on a grand scale - disposing of a friend through annoyance. I wonder if that's true -- if we continually act out our desires and deny ourselves nothing, if we get to the stage where we don't even consider others -- we merely do what we desire. Dorian Gray is still concerned by the murder, but justifies himself because of the amount of pain the painter had unknowingly caused him. What would have seemed monstrous to him several years ago as a teenager, is now justifiable in his grander scheme of pleasing himself.  I also wonder if this is a lesson learnt from Wilde's own life, who (from my very vague knowledge) has had his struggles between different moralities. Or whether he just takes a point (what if there was no consequence to sin for one man) to its logical conclusion? More food for thought.
