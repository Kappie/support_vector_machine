I still think the text is took big but I'm too tired to fix it.  Ok, well I'm sitting around and listening to music. I'm very bored though. I'd watch FotR but I'm too lazy to start it up.   When I get online now and days, there's hardly anything to do. I look at most forums am in and then have nothing to do. I stopped posting at a lot of places and I feel bad but I just get bored. I was posting at LotR Plaza for a while and just got majorly bored. Now I'm bored everywhere else almost. I post @ IA Forums and these Dom boards I'm at, but still. Internet has lost it's luster!  I guess I always could work on my  urlLink LotR Directory  to keep me entertained, because there's a lot of stuff I need to add there anyhow, but eh. I don't feel like web building ALL the time. I'm a friggin' survey/quiz/whatever freak. I think I posted 5-6 surveys in my Xanga today alone, but it was really fun filling them out. I just took one of the Memgen's called " What ranDOM pic of Dominic Monghan are you? " and I got this picture:           He looks cute there. I just found a pic of him though. I know I gotta make a graphic with it now, LOL.           *glee* LOL, he's awesomely hot.  I just I should've mentioned how I screamed when my mom told me if I cleaned my room, she'd by me a  urlLink Merry  Pippin shirt  from Hot Topic. I think it's cute. They have a fucking Legolas pillowcase that I gotta get too, it's cute cute. I just need...money, LOL.  I think that's it. Um, yeah. I might post later. :)         Edit : I got something else worth posting, LOL;         You are Bouncy TRL Dom! Cheeky, hyper, and constantly moving, you bounced your way through your interview, humped Sean, danced like a crazy man, and stuck your butt in the air while jumping on a couch. We love you. We really, really do. Full throttle!    urlLink   Which Dominic Monaghan are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
