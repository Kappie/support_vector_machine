When i was a baby i chewed videos and tapes and one time, mum was taking apart her camera and she put the battery on the ground next to me, and next minute she went to pick it up and it wasn't there. She looked at me, just in time to see me gulping (swallowing) something. Guess what it was. Yeh so anyway, i was without a pen that was working today (on a account of i chewed my other ones so much that they all either don't work, are falling apart, or had to be chucked in the bin coz i chewed it for too long and the ink spilled all in my mouth...but that's another story) Yeh so im sitting in class and i was like " Em....can i borrow a pen" (in an innocent voice of course) and she's like "Yeh, but don't even think about chewing it! It is a special pen i got for my birthday, it's imported from Switzerland (as hannah said anyway)" yeh so she gave me her precious precious pen, and everytime it crept towards my mouth she would take it back. At the end of the period i forgot to give it back to her, so i went to Commerce with it. In commerce i couldn't seem to find the lid. I searched everywhere, but still know sign of it. I was freakin' by that time. She would kill me. At least i still had her pen. Wait! "WHERE DID I PUT HER PEN!!!??" I bellowed at the supposably 'innocent' hannah. She stood there layghing as i got down on all fours and searched the room.Know where. Just as i had come to the conclusion that it magically disappeard, i once again heard hannah's hysterics and marchedover to herdamanding Emma's pen bak. Sghe insisted she didn't have it as i started to interrogate the rest of theterrorised class. By lunch time, i figured i should probably tell Emma b4 my friends found her. I sat with my friends untill i saw Emma. When her head bopped up from the stairs, i choked on my tiny teddies from half laughing half crying.As i stood and took the much dreaded walk toward her, she stopped and just stared at me. I think she was as terrified as i was. She looked as if i was gonna tell her that Spud Fairy died or sumthing. N eway, as i could hear my friends laughing in the background i decided to take her behind the stairs so they couldnt here our convasation or see us. I slowly told her the story, and i was surprised to see how well she took it. Honesty pays off. I offered to pay for it, but she sed dont worry. It is quite crazy but i think i felt dissappointed that she didnt make a scene. It would've been superb if she stood up and yelled obsentities and threw stuff at me and such, but i could see that i wasnt gonna get that out of her, so i whispered in her ear "can u atleast pretend to be mad?". She looked at me, and then bak at my eager looking friends, and with that she stood up and yelled "SHIT Casey!!" and stormed off. It was brilliant! Gold stuff. Yeh so that was my day. TTFN-CM
