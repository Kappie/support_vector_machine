Well, he pulled over and asked me how I was doing and all. So he got outta the car and showed me his new system that he put in. Well, while he was doing that he asked me if I ever thought about the two of us toegether, then gave me his # and told me to call tonight. He's a good guy and all but at the moment I really don't want anyone. I am ashamed to admit this but my heart is still stuck on the last one I was with  ( kinda sad, huh?)  and I really don't like beingging in a relationship anymore! Like I said he's a good guy but I just don't want to get invovled with anyone anymore. My relationships wont last unlit I get up out of here and get my own place and that wont be for like another year and a half.... This happen like 40 minutes ago, so now I am sitting here thinking about all the crappy shit that has happened in the past.... AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!....It's driving me nuts! maybe I am blowing this whole thing outta proportion.               Goosh I feel like breaking down and crying! I haven't realized just how much sucky ass crap has happened in the last month and a half! Don't get me, it's not the whole situation I just told you about that is tearing me up, it's that I haven't really stopped to grasp what the fudge is going on. Damn it sucks to be going through this!         Nigh night   ~Brandi*~
