And I don't have to work tonight, so I don't know what I will be doing then either. I am also a little confused. I am not sure who is still mad about Cedar Point, but I think it is just one person. Oh well, I don't really care. And yeah, I am really tired because I didn't go to bed until 12:45 last night, and my mom woke me up at like 6:30 to help her fix the dog's ear. Ugh...stupid ear! I love Shadow though..hehe! Okay, goodbye for now.         Kate-
