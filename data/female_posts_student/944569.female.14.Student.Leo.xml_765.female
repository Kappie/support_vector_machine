Do you know how bored I ma doing this..You know what i more fun than this..Nikki, remeber when Mrs. Markle made us stay in all Lunch recess and sat at are desks and did nothing..That was more fun..Today is maybe just a bt better than the other days because my sister isnt working at wonderland today but still..I am bored as hell..Tomorrow i'm goign to New York though..Good thing..Bad thing: Wake up at 7:30 in the morning.
