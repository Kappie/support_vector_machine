Such things can drive a person mad, yet, I will put them out of my mind. As these events unfold I have a message for Michelle:       "Don't be stupid, you learn from most mistakes. But, that mistake will take your life and damn you to a hell that is of unimaginable irony and torture"   That is all I have to say on the subject and I will say no more about this unexpected turn of events. I will wait for a phone call, but, I have little hope of it.  Goodbye Michelle, we will never speak again.
