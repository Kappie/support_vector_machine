Not Sixth Form (no come on!!!), not American High School (duh!), but the kind where you wear uniforms and sit in school all day from 7AM to 5PM through boring lessons and endure horrible tests that never seem to end and sleep and laugh and talk to your friends and pass notes and make fun of teachers and bitch about people and wait until you can go home. Like normal Chinese high school. The kind I used to be in. The kind I used to hate so much.    Don't get me wrong. This doesn't mean that I regret my decision of leaving, and certainly doesn't mean that I've changed my opinions and now love my urlLink  old school , it just means that after careful consideration and comparison, I wish I stayed. Not that it's much better or anything. In fact, it's not. It's just the feeling that I wish I still had. It's completely different than what in England.    "Different how?", I hear you say. Well for starters I don't have to pay 5468921873214  pounds per year. Secondly I don't have to fly around the whole time, sleeping in airports and what not. I never have to worry where I'm going to stay during holidays and shit, 'cos I can go home. Don't have to worry about money, either, 'cos I'm not spending any (well not much anyway). I don't have to deal with Cantonese (no offense, really, but when you hear it the whole time and you don't understand anything, you want to EXPLODE). I don't have to meet fake, annoying, slutty and obnoxious people or any kind of weirdo produced of that sort (or not the sort, whatever). I don't have to spend nights (and days of course!) missing Chinese/Taiwanese food, the warm (though damp and disgustging at times) weather, my family and friends, and (especially) that ceratin someone.    I'm not denying that it's been better for me. Because it has been, definitely, in lots of different aspects, a lot better than my old (high) school, and I truly learned quite a lot this year. I just don't think it's worth the 3274 million pounds my mother had to and has to pay.    And if I could turn back time, I would've waited. I would've waited until I graduated from high school to leave for university or college or some conservatoire or whatever. But it's too late. And I'm sorry. God I'm such an idiot.
