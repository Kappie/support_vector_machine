The lovely humidity, the plethora of green, and of course, the light rain showers of southwestern China just makes it seem like the perfect rainy time experience. Not much thunder and lightening, so it was perfect for kids. I remember stomping in the puddles and getting my skirt wet and dirty. And when I got home, my parents or grandparents would lecture me about getting sick and ruining the skirt.  Of course, rain in the dry desert of the American Southwest is much different. The times when we really get rain is during the monsoon season. A storm like tonight -- thunder, lightening, lights blinking -- characterize my new favorite type of rain. While I can't go outside and play in it... at least during night time... it's so much fun watching the water pounding on the streets. And one has to love the streamy look the falling rain by the street lights. It's just great... and relaxing although the trees outside sways violently, an enjoyable contrast to the quiet serenity of home with dimlights and the television echoing the flashes of lightening.  *** I am in no way disturbed. As I reread what I wrote, I sounded somewhat psychotic with the whole transition from a spring shower to a monsoon storm. Anyhow, I just like water a lot.
