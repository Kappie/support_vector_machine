SO I was at work at 8:00 this morning, when my last day was suppose to be August 6th. IT IS AUGUST 13th. Im not gonna complain, because I really need the money. So i come today, and my cousins not even here! So me and Jenn, just planned my future, Im gonna be a Designer/ Carpenter.... who writes books. Sounds Interesting, since Marcy keeps insisting that Im gonna marry a NBA Star and be " Bling Bling" ( I hate when Marcy says "bling bling"). I do wanna write a book though, i really like to write, its one reason I have this Blog.          Ive been getting pumped up for the Olympics since July watching ESPN classics "Road to Athens". Tonight was the opening cermony, I watched some of it, I realized that there are way to many countrys in the World and half those people didn't look like athletes. Im not really into watching the Track part besides the Steeple Chase, but i like watching weird stuff like fencing, and Judo. It was kinda upsetting that The USA Baseball team didn't Qualify this year.     Another big Upset was that the Cubs lost to San Diego yesterday after 11 innings, and lost to the Dodgers today at the last inning!           Things That Happened Tonight....      - Marcy asked me if i was a citizen...... and I told her I was born in Africa. Some people are just Dumb.     - Jaime McBride stopped by w/ her friend British.     - Saw Stans car at foodies, he was probably getting a 12er, and getting "crushed" before tomorrows race ( I would say BIG RACE, but I hear theres only 20 people).                                                Night ALL
