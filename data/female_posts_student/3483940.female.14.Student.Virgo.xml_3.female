Nothing interesting has happend far. Just the insane family. My brother for example. AHHHHH... Im not going to begin to explain. Just the moods that he sets me in. The rage i tell you. I just want to scream. ( I just did, and it felt good).   Last night i had people over for a friends birthday. We sat by the campfire. it was interesting. Thats when i came to reliese, that you cant aviod or escape gossip, nor talking about people behind their backs. EVERYONE does it. Its a cruel world that we live in. Then it makes you wonder:   This is how i see it: You talk or gossip about someone when they are not there, most of the things you say are not nice. You probably do not like what that person does, or just them. But you see while you talk about that person, they could be doing the same about you. Saying cruel things. But  you can't get mad at them, because you are doing the same thing. Things you would not hear. This happens all the time i belive. Or what if the person you say those things to, goes and tells that person you talked about. Its just an on going cycle.   I am also begining to think that summer doesn't make a difference on how i feel. But i dont know what i feel. And i dont like it. Its odd. Really starting to creep me out. I just want to know. I am good at times, but other times im just like fuck you. and im like the second way the majority of the time. I sit there and listin to peoples conversation, while saying in my head, "You have no idea". I would like to voice my opinion, but my voice just gets drained out by the others. Or what i say makes no sense. And when i have to chance to, i freeze up. Then that opportunity is no longer. Thats why i enjoy this whole "Blog" idea. It's a place to explain what your life is about, and how you feel, and its your opinion. Even though many people may not read it, its just out there for people to know, to give them an idea. And thats a good feeling. It's wierd the way it is.   Hannah
