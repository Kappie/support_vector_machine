As a matter of fact, you didn't even bless your meals, or   pray before going to bed last night.   You are so unthankful,   I like that about you.   I cannot tell you how glad I am that you  have not changed your way of living,   Fool, you are mine.   Remember,you and I have been going steady for years,   and I still don't love you yet.   As a matter of fact, I hate you,   because I hate God.   I am only using you to get even with God.   He kicked me out of heaven,   and I'm going to use you as long as possible to pay him back.   You see, Fool, GOD LOVES YOU and   HE has great plans in store for you.   But you have yielded your life to me,   and I'm going to make your life a   living hell. That way, we'll be together twice.   This will really hurt God.   Thanks to you, I'm really showing Him who's boss in your life with   all of the good times we've had.   We have been watching dirty   cursing people out,   stealing,   lying,   being hypocritical,   fornicating,   overeating,   telling dirty jokes,   gossiping,   being judgmental,   back stabbing people,   disrespecting adults,   and those in leadership positions,   no respect for the Church,   bad attitudes.   SURELY you don't want to give all this up.   Come on, Fool, let's burn together forever.   I've got some hot plans for us.   This is just a letter of appreciation from me to you.   I'd like to say "THANKS" for letting me use you for most of your foolish life.   You are so gullible, I laugh at you.   When you are tempted to sin,   you give in... HA HA HA, you make me sick.   Sin is beginning to take it's toll on your life.   You look 20 years older, and now, I need new blood.   So go ahead and teach some children how to sin.   All you have to do is   smoke,   get drunk or drink while underaged,   cheat,   gossip,   fornicate,   and live being as selfish as possible.   Do all of this in the presence of children and they will do it too.   Kids are like that.   Well, Fool, I have to let you go for now.   I'll be back in a couple of seconds to tempt you again.   If you were smart, you would run somewhere, confess you sins, live for God with what   little bit of life that you have left.   It's not my nature to warn anyone,   but to be your age and still sinning,   it's becoming a bit ridiculous.   Don't get me wrong,   I still hate you.   IT'S JUST THAT YOU'D MAKE A BETTER FOOL FOR CHRIST.      If you think this is freaky...then that is good. It is meant to be a little freakish. but its the truth. If you do not want to go to Hell when you die, except Jesus as your Lord and Savior and you shall live with Him in Heaven when you die....
