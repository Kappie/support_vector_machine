(even more) So now my brain's like a fried scramble egg! *i've had that!* Any way... it was really weird this morning, I woke up and my pyjamas were on back-to-front, inside-out! * - or not? * How tired was I last night! Or maybe in my sleep I turned them inside out... *hehe both spellings in! one of them's gotta be right!* The weirdest was waking up when I was really young in a cocoon! *my douvet was kind of wrapped around me really tightly* I had to roll onto the floor to get out of it! *freaky kid* Yeah... I used to hide all my toys under the douvet cause I thought the toy monster would get them! Then when I would find them on the floor, it only proved it! *FREAK* I only had half a bed! Then I used to think that if I didn't sleep upside down, under the douvet the vampires would get me. Then I would forget how to go to sleep. Geez, getting to sleep was a big deal for me! *cause my brother was taken ill in the morning and couldn't wake up or some weird freak thing like that* Nope, just me. Mmmm... I just blogged about sleep... mind you, that takes about two thirds of my day!
