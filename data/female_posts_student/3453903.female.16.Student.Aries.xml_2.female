I may have a LiveJournal, but some things are not for the public knowledge of those who read it, whether they be your best friend or worst enemy. Some things are things you don't want to know people have read. Or are embarrased to write when people don't think of your mind in the way that it works. When my mind wonders it wonders to places who know me don't think it can reach. I think it scares them. I don't think they like seeing that part of me, like a swimmer that is used to the surface of the water, but plunge any further into the murky depths and they panic. They are in unfamilar teritory and they thrash about, ready to sink.  In other words, as you may have already gathered, this is my outlet for waffle. Unlike in my LiveJournal I am not going to apologise for it. You have been forwarned.
