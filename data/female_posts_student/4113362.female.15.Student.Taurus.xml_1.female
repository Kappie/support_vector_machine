I'm so happy, yet I have no reason to be. Everything in my life is falling down and I'm just sitting here, watching it fall, and smiling, because I'm numb. Whatever. Saturday we're supposedly going to CR.  That should be exciting, hopefully I get to hang out with Curtis but I highly doubt that. The percentage is probably sitting at about .4   "I wonder where you are, please don't come around tonight 'cuz I can't stand to see you and I don't want to fight. Give me one more drink and I swear I think I'll be ready to make the same mistakes again, with you. I finally figured out that you're not coming back, I'm not going anywhere." -Effing AWESOME band. I found it whilest searching for a song that wasn't by them..but was by Dashboard Confessional.   Everything is so good. Everything is so happy..being happy is so much easier then being sad. I love it. It's good. You're all such sweethearts :-P lol  "I want to be what you've always needed. I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste. I want you and your beautiful soul"    Yeah. I'm thinking about burning a CD. Cd's are good. Curtis is also good. I'd like to let everyone know that. Especially you mr curtis, you have the ability to make everything seem okay again. And when I'm really really bitchy, and you're saying nice things..and I say Whatever, whatever. And you think I'm not listening, and you think you're not helping. You are, im not even really..that upset anymore. I just..am too stuborn to admit it. And if I really hated you as much as I said I did all those times, I would have left.      I've concluded numerous amounts of things in the past couple days. My writing has gone downhill a horrible amount. I need to start writing again.  I also concluded that everything in the world doesn't need to be a contest, but with me, it is. Which is sad, and needs to change.  So yes.  On a lighter note; (Ohh...it's a pun)  I lost 7 pounds. Because I'm cool. You guys all said, "Your diet wont work." Well it worked. You lose. :) I definitely win.   That is all.
