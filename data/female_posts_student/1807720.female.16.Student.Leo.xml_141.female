Today Active Living was really fun and we did fitness testing which I did awesome on and tomorrow we are doing the 30 minute run.  I got really freaked out today though - I mean I didn't tell anyone but when we were doing a 5 lap warm-up around the gym I starting getting this stabbing pain right about where my heart is on the left side, then when I kept running the pain like stabbed through my stomach.  I had the same pain when I went to go work out at the YMCA one morning and well I am kind of scared.  I mean there's pain for a reason obviously and I have to run for half-an-hour tomorrow and I will do what I need to do to get a good mark - even if that means running though half-an-hour of stabbing pain but hopefully it won't happen again.  I talked to that Aaron girl in Bio again this morning too - she is the only person I talk to in Bio and well I am glad that at least someone talks to me.  I am scared for doing a lab though.  I am not scared of any labs or anything, I am just afraid that I won't know anyone and no one is going to want to do that labs with me.  Maybe I am just over reacting though and thinking too much.  Maybe the gr. 11's could just go in their own lab group.  Who knows really - I guess whatever happens, happens for a reason.  I sort of feel out of place in English too.  There are lots of people that I see as "acquaintances" but other than that I don't really have a lot of friends in my class.  Making friends was never really my thing - that's Chelsey thing, then she just introduces me to people - but I am going to have to learn something right.  But half of the people I would rather just not know, because I don't make friends with smokers, druggies, or people who can't focus, do work, or pay attention.  My English teacher does seem really nice though but she comes across to me as a "favour picker"  - those are the teachers that give students better marks because they are their favorite or they just suck up 1000 times, or they already know them.  It is only the first week of semester 2 though and I mean I can't really make too many judgments or assumptions yet.
