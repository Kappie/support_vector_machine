Yesterday Dave tells me that he is moving in with Jason. YAY. I crawl into bed thinking all is well with the world my house is slowly becoming my own again. About 1 in the morning my door opens up and Dave comes stumbling into MY room and crawls into bed and passes out. He smells like alcahol (sp) and I had eaten before going to bed so my stomach started turning. I got up and went out into the livingroom where Tony was talking on the computer. I asked him how long he was going to be up and he said a few more hours so I asked if I could sleep on the couch. He was not thrilled (adult talk I think lol) so I grabbed a pillow and went and slept on my bedroom floor or tried to. I got up and went outside and slept on the porch for awhile to settle my stomach. I was then going to find a warm blanket and go sleep out back but Tony woke me up and made me lay on the couch where I slept until 5:45. He was still online. I got up and went back in and laid on the floor in my room until my alarm went off. When Dave finally stumbled out of my room after noon today he asked me why I slept on the floor. I told him why. He then sulked off like it was MY fault. He's damn lucky I didnt tell him what all was on my mind. I am seriously thinking of writing a letter and giving it to him as soon as I am away from here though. I dont think he would do anything but I dont trust him totally if that makes sense.  Good news. I have started to pay on my student loan. Which now they are willing to write me a letter saying that I can go back to school. If I do this then I will go back to Massage school first. That will only take me a short time to learn and then I can go back in and see about finishing my pychology degree. I'm excited about it and I will be filing paperwork next week to get the grant to go back to school.  On top of everything I thought of how unjust it was that the school that Joey was going to was getting away with so much. Well I intend to go into small claims court and sue. Ok I know I wont win but it's the pricipal of the matter. Which btw I need to note in the lawsuit it is not against the pricipal of the school.. Sence starting to work with him things were starting to get better until this last thing happened. I will be sueing for emotional and pychologcial damages. I dont want to play any more. Like I said I know I wont win but I can at least go on record.  I wait paitenly for AC. I know he will be mad at this post due to the Dave thing but I know he will ask me about it and we can talk. I do wnat to say this right now NOTHING has happened between Dave and I in a sexual way. I think once AC finds out what I have literally supported Dave and Matt for 3 months putting myself into a worse financal bind he will be furious. I know I have learned a valuable lesson. No more freeloaders. I cant afford the emotional or finacale hardship any longer.
