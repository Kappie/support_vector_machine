After all, they got me into this mess. :)   A man of rhyme and rhythm, and just the right words, my dear buddy from CWRU,  urlLink Shareef   Fellow OSU mudphud, favorite Iowan, traveling buddy, and partner in crime,  urlLink Aaron   Law student, shopping buddy, co-habitant of COJ coffeeshop, and professional cutie,  urlLink Chris   What's interesting is every one of these guys is politically inclined. I guess that makes up for my dearth of political commentary. Really, you'd think it would rub off on me by now, but so far all I have is a deep appreciation of Michael Moore's works and an interest in voter registration among minority communities (like mine!). Ah well, Enjoy!
