And I wish I had my cell phone, but I left it at Robert's and I'm too lazy/tired to go back and get it... So blah. Anyway, this is how everything has gone... b/c last night was kinda bad. At least one specific part of it...  Went to visit Lainie at work around 5:30 ish, then went to play prac. Idk if it was hot in there or what, but I kinda took a downhill slide and felt shittier after I'd been in there for about 15 mins. Then I went to do my line and I talked to fast and couldn't remember a little part and I wasn't authoritative enough and blah blah blah...Church was grumbling, and it wasn't even like it was a big deal or anything, but Iwas ready to snap on him. That or just run out of theroom crying... I was so fucking emotional... grrrr.....  But yeah, prac got done at 8:45ish, then I went over to robert's. Him,Beth, Sam, Andy, andJake were already there playingbadminton in the backyard. So we hung out there for awhile, then we went inside and ordered pizza.We sorta just watched TV and waited for the pizza to come.Jenny and AJ both showed up.Then Jake and Jenny left to go get some guy and came back with 2... hat guy and no hat guy. Brian and Derek. Minty Fresh (bad story behind that, I wish I hadn't heard it) and Miller Time. Call them whatever you want... hat guy was the sorce of all of my problems. Anyway, a little while after Robert's dadleft we started drinking. We played a game called Fuck You, and that was pretty damn fun. Everybody fucked everybody, isn't that your idea of a good time? It got me pretty damn drunk... I was fine until I had to do the bong, and that's when things started to go downhill. But first -- how come no one went in the kitchen to watch when Robert bonged it, but when I had to the whole fucking party followed me into the kitchen? I hate audiences... Beth said it's b/c I'm a girl... Does that make it funnier or something? Idk... But I did it no problem, and about 5 mins later I was pretty far gone... And this is where my details start to get vague... B/c I can't really remember everything that happened, the order it happened it, or who was there... Anyway, we went outside w/ Beth's pipe and passed that around for awhile. Then all of a sudden I was hanging all over hat guy and he was doing the same... Then we fell on the grass and made out a little bit... that was pretty gross, b/c he tasted like beer (although I imagine that I did too), and he was a bad kisser. The main point of the story is that little asshole was hanging on me all night and I was too damn drunk to care and I guess it got bad enough that Andy was making comments to Beth and him and Beth and Richie and Idk who else were all watching hat guy so he wouldn't do anything. It's kinda reminiscent of the Christmas party at Gregg's... There I had Amanda, Gregg, Jim, Missy, and god knows who else watching me to keep other stuff from happening... But yeah... lots of "Zirkels of Love" w/ everyone dancing in a big circle in the kitchen. I have crazy bruises on my feet from people stepping on me. Plus one on my hand that appeared out of no where, and one on my arm where Sam bit me... But then Beth and I left around 2:30 to go back to her house... to get away from the crazy hat guy...NO MORE PARTIES WITH HAT GUY! If I ever go to a party and hat guy is there I'm leaving, I swear to god. Oiy... I don't want to go into any more details about last night, if you know about it you know about it, otherwise too bad. Lainie I might call to tell you some random things... Ken I might tell some stuff, just b/c I think we both need to work on the 'getting over our physical and emotional attachments' thing... We both have a problem with that right now... Anyway, that's a bit off topic. Now to today...  Beth and I got up around 9:15ish. I put my contacts in, we drank a glass of water, filled some water balloons (w/ intent to throw them at hat guy if he was still at Robert's), then walked over to Robert's. Instead we put the balloons under Robert's car tires (muahahahaha!!!) the peeked in the window to see if anyway was awake and walked inside... Saw Robert sleeping on the couch. Poked him until he woke up. Then we went in to see Sam, and the 4 of us sat in the living room talking. Blah blah blah, that was fun, luckily hat guy was gone before we got there though. And eventually everyone else that was still there woke up and we just sat in the living room and watched TV and talked. Robert made pancakes and french toast. Watched more TV, then people started to leave... Around 2:30 it was just me, Robert, and Andy, and I was getting tired, so I left. When I got homeI realized I'd left my cell phone at Robert's house... Go me... Oh well, I just called it and told him to take it and the disco ball over to Beth's, and then I can get my phone from Beth some time this weekend. So yeah, don't bother calling it unless you'd like to hold a conversation with Robert. :) And now I'm going to do a few more things then take a nap. Then I'll shower, change, make the car wash posters, and probably by then Ken will be here... It's already 4, and he said he got off at either 6 or 8, so... Idk. Argh, I just need to crash. Later.
