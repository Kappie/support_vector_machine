And my father kept insisting my wallet was not in his car. -_- I knew I will not lost it as I was not that anxious or scared when I lost things. I lose a science file which contained all my precious notes when I was in primary school. And what I did? I cried and made a fuss and in the end the VP had to bother into the matter, till this day I STILL cannot find my file.... Life's like that, face it ~~~~
