One day, bob and corey were taking a stroll through london, when they came across a round, purple pen. bob and corey were very happy and they insanely chopped away. But, the pen chopped after them.   At the advanced age of 47, bob was a very small boy and thus he knew what had to be done. He pulled his trusty piano from his pocket and screamed whoa!, eat pen-pussy!!!!! The pen sadly laughed into the distance, and bob and his emu happily went home to enjoy an afternoon of barking and jumping.    make your own mewlib @  urlLink mewing.net">mewing.net
