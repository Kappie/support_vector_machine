I still want to be your friend but there are things that I am responsible for now. And about being offline so much, well that's because I have been spending so much time online that I put off the things God wanted me to do. He is more important to me. I hope you understand that I love y'all very very much and you all are my best friends. So much love, and see you when school starts.
