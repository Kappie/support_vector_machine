Well, right now I'm talking to my CA (central alliance) guy Eric. lol He's so awesome. Also, I'm just getting ready to practice for solo fest and I'm listening to The Early November. If you check out one band that I listen to, it should be them. Every song is amazing and you can practically feel the heart that they put into every song. Now that is what I call music. I mean, if you even have a doubt at how amazing they are just look at the lyrics.    Here is a sample:   Looking in your eyes Praising every moment because you're my only light Reading through stares at your passion that bears me now Shedding no little tears The silence scares us more than leaving could   CHORUS:   Come back Please don't leave me now I'll be all that you need in life Because I can't live without you and I know all that you need I can give you everything When you're so far you'll forget about me    Waiting by your side Knowing every moment is closer to your flight Upset with the past, but it's all that holds us now Believing no lies, telling each other we'll be fine forever  CHORUS   But I'll wait    I could never leave those beautiful eyes    I know you're sorry   I know what you must be going through    And I feel sorry for you     But please don't leave me now [x3]  -Come Back- The Early November
