AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I know what I need....death music....yes....some good angry death music.   OK, the Cubs TOTALLY had it. It was three to nothing, and now they lost and just...poo. :( This just makes me mad. And, I have to read this stupid play by tomorrow for Sat/Com. I understand it's supposed to be a great work of art but it's NO Shakespeare. Seriously, how much does O'Neil have to reiterate that the mother is a drug addict and the father and his kids are all alches.   And, on top of it all..I'm writing in here when I should be reading...yeah. Dumb, 'eh? That's what I think too, yet...I continue writing.  My day wasn't all that great either. At least I didn't have to take the bus this morning, but....blah. It was just sort of a mediocre day and this was not a good end to it.   I just realized why my day was so blah. Everything was like...two steps away. I'd get so close to something and then it would just exceed my grasp. I would get so close to doing something right or getting to do something I really wanted and then...the carpet would be pulled from beneath me abruptly. Oh well. I don't care. It'll all be better tomorrow. In the meantime, I'll listen to death music and read this timeless classic piece of....poo. Heh...classic piece of poo. I made myself laugh. Wow, that doesn't happen very often unless I trip or something which isn't really possible seeing as I'm sitting down...but, yes...anyway...I'm just going to go sleep now.
