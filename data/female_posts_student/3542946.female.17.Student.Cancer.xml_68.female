I think Max that you should have placed prominently a list of what we believe and what our site regulations are, to avoid confusion by newcomers, as has happened with A_P_C.  Make it clear all these rules have been decided by the m3r community, and keep the list open to comment so that anyone who's interested can comment and campaign for whatever change they want. Maybe you could have it as a post which you replace and update regularly, and which people can continually vote on.  That way we can see the development of the beliefs of the group as a whole and add another area for people to argue about. It would also increase the feeling of ownership by everyone involved.  Admin.  Rules Ok here are the rules if anybody wants to add some more or challenge a rule say so. Fregmonto you've put me on the spot here. Could you help out.   1.This site is open to debate, all political views are welcome, except for blatantly fascist, racist,homophobic, sexist, basically no descriminatory views are welcome,  we all here have a good sense of humour and these things said in jest with no real feeling beneath them are acceptable. Please don't stop posting things that are un PC just exercise some good taste please. 2. The m3r community does not welcome anonymous posters if they post anything vaguely offensive. Please visitors to this site who aren't known to the m3r community you are welcome to post comments. But if you are known to us a name would be very much appreciated. Your comments will not be deleted unless they are offensive. 3.If m3r is to remain an utterly free cooperative positive forum for the reporting of injustice and for debates it requires all of you to be responsible in your posting. Stick to these guidelines but above all have fun!
