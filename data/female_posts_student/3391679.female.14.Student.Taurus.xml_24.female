I always want to go back after two weeks. Mom says we might take a vacation during fall break i figure she feels guilty because my sis and i always complain that all r friends are on vacation and we NEVER take any. The past summers we have gone on road trips with my aunt to visit my Gram who doesnt like me or my sister because are father is black. How rude. My mom hasnt had a real vacation the whole time i have known her. She wants togo on a cruise so i think i want to try and find a way to get her one SOMEDAY. maybe when i graduate because my sister and i will both be gone and she can CELEBRATE raising us as two girls who have succeded in life. lol im wierd. I really want to go see my cousin. He lives 20 minutes away and he was teaching me to skatebord last time isaw him. He says im reallly good fora first timer. I got a "battle scar" as he says. I was going down this hill and i rolled and scratched up my arm, but i didnt go home or cry like a baby or anything. I got back up andhe was tyring to get me to do a trick he cant even do yet. Is he crazy. I almost got it htough. yay. well. note to self...{DONT SMOKE----- even if everyone r redy has , sister, cousins, mom tried it once, friends, dont give into temptation,} by y'all amanda michelle C.
