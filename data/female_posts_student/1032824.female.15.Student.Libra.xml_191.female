This is a song from  50 First Dates  - It's one of the most hilarious and at the same time, romantic songs I've heard in quite a while. If only my future sweetheart could compose something like that... * Dreams dreamily *  Impressive.     Her Excellency  resembled a  Morbid Queen  today. Sexiness. I hope she returns to school in time for our lessons. Good luck for the blood test. BABIES :) Anyhow, I'm gonna hit the books right now.     An accelerating carousel, my mind.
