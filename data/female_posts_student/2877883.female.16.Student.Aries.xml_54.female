I'm sure I shall get "needs improvement" on the English section as I always seem to get.  Lucky lucky me.  So, I believe there are 23(?) days of school left.  Thank goodness.  Today=softball practice that I didn't even know about until now.  Joy also.    This weekend was Maine.  Good beaching on Saturday, but other than that it was fairly boring.  Wow my life is boring.  The other day i decided that there were some girls who I really want to become better friends with.  I'll give it a shot.  Haha, I saw something funny today.  Must tell Meliss because it directly concerns her.    I have come to the realization that I want a boyfriend so badly.  I don't feel as antisocial as I seem, I don't think.   I want someone to come with me to Maine over Memorial Day weekend.  Any takers? Because if you are free that weekend it should be a par-tay.    That is all.  Ciao.  Au revoir.  Adios.  Love from  the  coolest.
