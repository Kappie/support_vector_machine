Current Mood Weather ::  partly cloudy  Blogger is moving uber slow right now and quite frankly it's pissing me off because I want to write!  I have had inspiration just spilling out of me the past week and a Â½ or so. As a result, I've had poems out the yin yang. In fact, today I set a new personal record of five good poems in two hours. I've even been able to write on a fairly regular basis of every other day/every three days or so. For me, this is incredible. If you were to look back on my older poetry, you would see that I would have a poem every month, two months, sometimes even up to six months. However if you look over the past two weeks, I've written one every three days or so. I'm very proud of this because I've always had the horrible pattern of writing a poem, going through a LONG dry spell, writing one or two poems, going through another dry spell, and so on. It seems like for now, I've moved past that.   An update on my bipolar situation. Mom is going to find me a psyciatrist so we can at least figure out what's going on. I don't think I am bipolar, I just have a lot of symptoms for it that I didn't have before.  Before what? I honestly don't know. Mom's cancer, maybe. When your life is monotone - depression, short spurts of happiness, depression, depression - time tends to blur. I can't pinpoint the exact day or even month I started having these symptoms. I can, however, tell you that I probably had them long before I ever noticed them. The thing that confuses me is that even though it seems like it's blatantly obvious that I've developed these symptoms and habits, nobody else has noticed. If they have, they haven't said anything.  Why are people uncomfortable talking about mental illness? Even people who don't have a mental illness have problems discussing it. I'm mentally ill in that I'm clinically depressed and possibly bordering on bipolar, but I have no problem sharing. M told me the other day how brave I am for sharing my deepest thoughts with the world. I had never considered it before, that some people can't talk about certain things around other people, but the more I think about it the more I notice it. When I happen to mention in passing my depression, people will either A] bullshit about how they understand what I'm going through (a huge pet peeve of mine and most other clinically depressed people, but that's another post), B] change the subject entirely, or C] just plain stop talking. What's the big deal? This is something I live with  every   single   fucking   day . It's everyday life for me and millions of others. People get physically sick and nobody has a problem with it. However, somebody can be mentally unhealthy and suddenly we've stumbled on a taboo topic.   Why is this? Is it because the general public is uninformed and knows nothing about mental health? That seems to be the case with a lot of people I've talked to about my depression. Brookadee, bless her, took the time to ask me what I go through and learn about depression in general. She admitted that she knew nothing about it and had always wondered, but was afraid to ask. I told her that if the rest of the mentally ill (I have officially over-used that phrase) were at all like me, they will appreciate being asked. It's refreshing. It's a breath of fresh air, to use a tired cliche. Instead of avoiding the topic, she faced it head on and I, for one, was very greatful to have a chance to talk about it in-depth and to educate somebody about the real deal.  I just realized that what started out as a short post on the random things in my life, this has turned into a polite rant about mankind's insensitivity and stupidity. But I feel good now, having gotten that off my chest, so perhaps I can go to bed. No, wait. LiveUpdate just popped up and now I have to run it. I guess I'll entertain myself and y'all with a story of Zeus's first shower.  Zeus was starting to smell really bad, as dogs often do. I usually pay my sister to bathe him, but at this point she is covered in over eighty bug bites (it isn't as bad as it sounds, really) and didn't want to risk him scratching her up. So I decided that since I had to get clean as well, Zeus might as well take a shower with me. He was actually pretty well-behaved, even when I was shampooing him and holding him under the shower to rinse him off. The only difficulty was that as soon as I set him on the bottom of the tub so I could wash my hair, he would jump out, one time nearly taking the shower curtain with him. Overall, though, it worked well and was pretty fun to boot. He's only twenty-three pounds, so it wasn't that big of a deal to hold him. It was slightly awkward trying to make sure I had him all shampooed, but I really had fun watching him look like a drowned rat. =] From now on, Zeus gets all his bathes in shower form with moi. Too bad Scarlet is too big to take a shower, eh?   LiveUpdate is gone, so I'm off to bed. Goodnight. Er, morning?    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  fidgety, as I often am these days  listening to/watching ::  Eve 6  eating/drinking ::  nothing  craving ::  foood...  talking to ::  nobody...only insane people like myself are up at this hour.  thinking about ::  i should be in bed  wishing ::  it would rain me to sleep  wearing ::  pink love-a-lot carebear pj pants and a white tshirt  random ::  I have two Coke cans, three Red Fusion cans, and two Vanilla Coke cans on my desk, plus an empty can of Pringles and a stale bag of Misson tortilla chips. Yikes.
