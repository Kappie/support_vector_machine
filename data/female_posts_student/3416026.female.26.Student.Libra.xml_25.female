And this really saying something, due to our having gathered most of the evidence from my neighborhood. Park Slope is not exactly a hot-bed of avant-gardism.  Once I saw a 9-year-old with a mohawk, wearing a sleeveless shirt and wristcuffs.  He was talking to this woman who looked like the 2004  urlLink version of this .  I lurked around to eavesdrop, and she was totally bitching to him, the kid, about her dead-beat boyfriend. He was looking all blase like, "Yeah, yeah, heard it all before."  As 99% of the world probably agrees, there is rarely anything more alarming than a gang of boys on dirtbikes.  One time we saw all these wicked Jewish kids tearing around.  They were total hardasses in their yarmulkes and with their white fringe shawls flying. Get out of the way!  The one mystery here is the recent popularity -- especially among the nerdier ones-- of  urlLink total classic rock hair .  Only not hot, like Zep. Nothing sets off a nice case of forehead acne like a middle part.  Sorry, kids.
