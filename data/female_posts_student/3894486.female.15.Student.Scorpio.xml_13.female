After the lesson we headed to the mall to go jeans shopping. We went into Abercrombie*shivers* for like my first time ever and I tried on a ton of jeans...I found out I was a size 6 which is better than a size 11 which is what I was during the school year. That made me really happy. None of the jeans looked that great on me so we went to american eagle. I tried on some sale jeans but those fit funny too. My mom was not about to buy me full priced jeans so I got a sweet shirt instead!  but yeah...later on I had cell group and then I went to baskin robins and went running in the rain...fun...
