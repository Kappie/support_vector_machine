I got 89% on my last Bio quiz, and so far have managed to score 70% or above on everything thus far.    Friday was amazing.  It was eventful and we were on the go since school ended.  First I had a Model UN meeting, then I ate a nice juicy chicken burger from the YMCA cafe.  Megz and everyone met up (about 23 people) and we divided into groups with one assigned driver and we given cameras and a scavenger hunt to do.  Some of the things we did were EXTREMELY CRAZY and are pictures to prove it!  Then we met up at Pizza Hut for pizza and Megz opened her b-day gifts.  I got her a g-certificate to body things which is a place she buys dance stuff from.  Then we went to East Side Mario's and ordered a million desserts til' we felt like our stomachs were going to burst!  Saturday morning I woke up bright and early to get to MODEL UN.  We met sooooo many amazing and wonderful and smart and good-looking and intelligent people!  It was so fun!!  I learned soooo much and walked away from the experience just saying "WOW."  I learned so much about myself, the UN, and gained plenty of knowledge that can be used in everyday life.  The University is soooooo cool and the banquet dinner was the most amazing this ever.  I felt like a queen for one night, like royalty.  No one even serves me dinner!!  I even made a really good friend.  Since in the Model UN you could write a note and then put the country name and the section such as GA: General Assembly (which is actually the room I was in) I wrote a note to Mr. Egypt I call him.  I think he is so perfect, just everything about him.  Lets say we sent a lot of notes to and fro and he even has my email now.  He goes to Grandin and he seems that type to keep his word.  In fact I know that he will contact me a while's after Model UN.  I walked away with more knowledge and a good friend.  I also met a lot of other brilliant, intelligent, and unique people!  Life seems to be going my way for once.  Everything is falling into place.   All I have to say is "let it fall!"  I mean Bio is going really well and I am doing good, MODEL UN was amazing and I met Jack (Mr. Egypt!) and I even got a part in the school play!!  What more could a gal such as me ask for?!?!  Note much more I wouldn't think!  I am more then just content, I am overjoyed.  Today I smiled for then I have in the last...hmm I can't recall how many days!  Of course I even said "hey" to LaCour and she didn't even have the dignity to say "hey vanessa" of course maybe she was just having a bad day.  But whatever, is people can't be polite and say "hi" and acknowledge that others exist then that's their problem!  Active Living was amazing today!  AMAZING I TELL YA!  Everyone wants ME on their team!  ME ME ME!!  That's right!!!!! - ME!  In jr. High I would always be like last, now it's like - hey we want the Work Horse!  LOL!  Swain kept telling the guys how they should play like me.  I bet out just about every guys out there, and out worked them all.  The guys on the other team were even complaining about not having ME on their team.  Swain asked if I could switch so they would stop complaining!  So I switched teams, and I still could out work them and beat em!  It was great!  I am really good at broomball!  I am turning out to be good at a lot of things.  Before I was just too blind from the discouragement in Chem and Math to see beyond the bad things, but I see further than even before.  I see the horizon where the sun comes up.  It rises beyond the hills and the sun shines on ME!
