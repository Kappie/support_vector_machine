Today I sat through an endocrine clinic which was full of chunky monkeys. Then I had some really good teaching where I found myself wrestling with a wriggly 11 month old kid.Oh if ever I needed to know just how bizarre my course is...  Not much else happened today. Had Chinese for tea.  Just found myself glancing at Handbag.com and for a moment the question of who's going to be the next James Bond weighed heavily on my mind. If ever I needed proof that my brain is tired there it was.  Arranged the final details of going down to Stratford on Sunday morning with Mum too.
