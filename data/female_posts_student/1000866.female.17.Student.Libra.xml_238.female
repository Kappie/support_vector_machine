They're so comfy though, so they're addictive. YaY hoodies! But, no, bad bad bad me for buying another one. I have like...ten! Who needs that many hoodies? Anyway, I also bought a new purse, and another black and white type shirt. I think I need pastels in my wardrobe. Ah well. I like dark colors so I'm sticking with them. I also got a really neat silvery sparkly belt, and then I got a picture frame. I'm going to stick my favorite picture of my grandma on one side, and then...I don't know. I'm thinking maybe another picture of my grandma on the other side since it's like, a connected picture frame. Maybe I'll find a picture of my mom, me, and my grandma. That would be really neat. I think that's what I'll try to do.   I really just have this sudden surge of...sadness, and loss. I miss her so much right now, and I wish I could just call her and talk to her about stuff right now. Argh. I just keep thinking of the last time I saw her and the last thing I said to her and stuff. It was, "I love you Grandma, see you soon," and she said, "You too Catie." I could tell she was upset. She knew as well as I did that I wouldn't get to see her again. I guess those are great last words to say to someone though. I'm glad I got the chance to say them to her, and I'm glad that I did spend last summer in Michigan. Yeah, I was sort of alone, but I had my cousins, and I really like being alone. My family worried about me because I liked being alone so much. They thought I was really really depressed. I don't see them that often, so I understand why they thought that, but that just made me feel even worse, because I didn't want them thinking I was really depressed and worrying about me along with Grandma. *Sigh* I need to go do something to get myself out of this. I don't really want to go read. Well...I do, but I need to stop. I've been reading so much by the end of summer, I'm not going to have anything to read anymore. I've gotten like...addicted to reading. I think I'm going to read that book, "God's Debris," tomorrow. It's had a really strong impact on everyone who has read it so far, so we'll see how much my beliefs hold up. I'm pretty sure they will. I mean, I'm open-minded, but I do have a strong set of beliefs, and I guess we'll have to see if this book changes anything.  I'm having my mom read it too, but...not my dad I don't think. I think it would just make my dad mad. My dad's beliefs are like...set in stone. Nothing changes his opinions. NOTHING. So, I know all this book will do is make him mad. I'm sure of it. Hmmmm, what else could I do? I don't know if I really want to watch TV, and I don't want to watch a movie, because look at what the last movie I watched by myself did to me. Poo. The Breakfast Club would be ok, but I don't have that soo...nevermind. I could go turn off my away message and actually talk to people. Nah. Forget that. I don't know if I can handle talking to people right now. I feel like if I talk to the wrong person I'll end up making myself mad. I could go to bed, but...not quite yet. Ah well. I'll find something. Maybe there is something good on TV since it's the Fourth of July. Kind of funny how I didn't do anything today that was Fourth of July'ish. Ah well, my parents are having a big party tomorrow night so...I'll probably stay locked up in my room tomorrow too. :) Maybe I'll go rent some movies tomorrow. OK, I'm going to stop typing now. Really.
