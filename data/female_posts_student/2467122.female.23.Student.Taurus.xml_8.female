I can't afford the test and my textbooks- at least not by 5pm today (the deadline to register).    Who makes a freaking test cost $120- especially a test designed for college students???  Probably the same people who charge a hundred bucks a pop for a text book.  It's beyond me.    Anywho- looks like I am going to have to resort to selling some organs to afford going to school from now until I graduate.  Hopefully I won't need to give up anything vital, but if it's for cash then who knows...   My mommy rules... I'm so glad that I'm her favorite!!! Too bad the rest of her kids suck!    Okay- Off to sell my soul for textbooks.  *me*
