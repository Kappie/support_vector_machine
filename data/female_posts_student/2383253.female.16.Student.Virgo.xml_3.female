However the English wasn't particularly hard...just long as hell. It was expected.  You guys may want to use this in the future: Sleeping in several small intervals alternating doing work is much better than doing all of your work and then sleeping. It lets you stay up later without feeling as tired. However, by the end of school you still want to sleep from now till Christmas.  Did anyone watch the speech John Kerry gave at UCSD? Very, very good. He was just here two days ago. If Bush gets re-elected then I'm moving to Bermuda.   In other news, I haven't done my calc homework yet and am not feeling greatly inspired to do so anytime soon. I guess it'll be another calc day in physics. Groan. I want to visit colleges on spring break...probably just the close UCs. Heather, Matt...think you guys would be interested? Don't want to go alone or with my momma.  Okie dokie, I'm exhausted. I think I'll go sleep.  Love you guys. :)
