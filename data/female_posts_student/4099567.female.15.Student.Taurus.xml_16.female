I am a monkey named Codswallop, and you are my mate. Heeheehee." Then he hung up. Honestly, stupid people are...well...to put it bluntly, STUPID. Oh, and my mother finally said yes to me having a birthday party! For everyone invited (This means you!): Allison Z --Yay you're coming Erin H --Yay, you too!! Emily R--No...:-( Emily B--work, i assume? Jess T--where the hell are you? Tracy S--yay you're coming! Ashley W--Yay you're coming! Jenn G--It's your birthday! So...No... It's at 12-noon on Wednesday, August 18th, and goes until 12 Noon Thursday, August 19th. We'll go to the annual Marquis family and friends picnic, and then back to my house for fun! Please tell me if you're coming soon, because my mom is impacient.  La'ers! --April
