Monday: did absolutely nothing.....i guess you could say i mentally prepared myself for the jesuit game the following night  Tuesday: Coppell vs. Jesuit game.  I swear, by far, the best game of the season.  It was soooo intense and i prayed for about half of the game.  Everytime Jesuit tied it up, i started praying that they wouldn't score the next goal.  It was like pong (my fave allegory of all time, lol).....we scored, they scored, we scored, they scored, we scored.  It ended 3-2.  in that game, i said aaaaaalot of stuff i shouldn't have said.  My mouth just ran and i couldn't control it.  Every time the puck went to T.J.'s end i crossed my fingers.  I hated the refs though, they didn't let us have one of our goals.  I can't remember who all scored exactly but i definitley know that Trey Snow and Jimmy Meyer did.  Thank you god that there was only 2:30 left in the game.  I was soooo scared that we weren't going to pull it off because had we lost this game, it would've ended our season.  I love my boys and they did really well!!!!   If they can get past jesuit, they can win state again!!!    And today, i didn't do anything again.  I've got senioritis early, so i don't feel like doing anything EVER for the rest of the year.  i figure if i just half way do everything and keep low A's, i'll be fine.  Sports Update: Coppell beat Jesuit 3-2 in a close match on Tuesday night with goals from leading scorer, Trey Snow, and at least one from Jimmy Meyer.  A tight game for the cowboys as the go on the march to defend their state title and play like the regional champs that they are.  Dallas takes on Colorado tonight at 9pm who will be without Paul Kariya and several other players.  This is opening night for the Stanley Cup Run and other games going on tonight are the Calgary-Vancouver, Montreal-Boston, and Detroit-Nashville.  This is the first game of the quarterfinal series and us Dallas fans can only hope the best for them.  *prays* maybe they'll win.  alright, kids, i gtg!  oh please god let the stars win tonight and maybe possibly the entire series.  and let Coppell win state.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
