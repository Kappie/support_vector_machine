Seems even Roxio couldn't even save the should've-stayed-dead p2p music prog. It really was never a good idea to try to revive it as a paid service, especially now, what with the major competition on of current free p2p progs (such as Aqualime, Ares, and the multitude of Lite KaZaA versions.) If you wanna read up on the whole damn thing as reported by Zeropaid,  urlLink here you go.      Iggy Pop - Weasels  Weasels  Weasels are runnin me to death, I checked my gas there ain't much left. Still I will take a parting shot, Before I leave myself to rot.  Barbaric motherfucking weasels  Weasels (x2)  Weasels have always been my friends, I've turned them loose now there's no end. Giants of rock tell giant lies, Weasels control the evil skies.  Barbaric motherfucking weasels, Bad breath bad taste cause of diseases.  I feel disgrace and I feel shame, I feel anger and I feel blame, I feel suspicion and I feel pride, I feel weasels on all sides.  Weasels (x5)  With guitars on T.V., Weasels Rewriting rock history, Weasels With an office and a chair, Weasels With nice butts and long silky hair.  Weasels suck and weasels blow, Weasels control rock and roll (x4) Rock and roll (x3)  Weasels    It's the Zenman, laughing at you  "You're wearin' a mask...you look better that way!"
