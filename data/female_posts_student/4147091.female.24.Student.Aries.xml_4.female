I was answering an email in my yahoo account and saw an ad for what look like a very cool movie...and dark and evil looking.  but it didn't say its name.  So I proceed to click the button to watch the trailer.  Its the new Exorcist movie.  I've managed to avoid that commerical the past few days, but here I go, making the mistake of following the rabbit down the hole.  I guess I deserved it.  So I"m day three into my olympic coverage.  To quote Nichole Richie...'loves it!'.  I woke up this morning to Beach Volleyball...mens....and womens basketball coverage.  I"m really actually just biding my time until the track and field comes on when I can squeal with delight when I see people that I actually know. It will annoy most people I know, butI will get satisfaction in knowing that I can remember a time when Mike Boswell didnt have cornrolls.  i also wait in vain for the winning height in the high jump to be like 1.80m.  then I will say...'see, I could have won the Olympics'.  Waiting in vain, I tell ya!  So the countdown to Calgary is almost in its final 10 days.  I've been distracted by the Olympics too much to really begin to worry.  I still have so much left to do, technical stuff too, the stuff that you hate doing.  Loan stuff and VISA payments and RSVPing for stuff.  Argh.  All I want to do it pack!  but I am getting excited.  I've been laying in bed at night before I go to sleep wondering about the kinds of people that are going to be in the Center with me and what my supervisor is like (having had a really bad experience with my honours supervisor...evil Leyton!).  I"m sure I"m giving myself an ulcer...
