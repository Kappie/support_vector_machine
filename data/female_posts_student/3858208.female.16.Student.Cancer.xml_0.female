[start: 11:10pm]  I never get a chance to just talk about the little quirks that make me me. So here's a whole twenty mintues of random facts about me. Number one, I absolutely hate seafood. It's gross, it smells, and I refuse to eat it. Number two, I'll never understand why it's important if the chicken came before or after the egg. As long as one of them came first, who cares? Three, I will only drink chocolate milk if it came from a store. I don't like chocolate milk that you make at home, even though it's basically the same thing. Four, I've never ridden a rollercoaster. I want to but the oppertunity has never presented itself, so to speak. Number five, I love boys - they're stupid. Six, I have a very obsessive personality, so when I'm into something (or someone...) watch out. Seven, I have a weird habit of always being polite to strangers, no matter how pissy a mood I'm in or how rude they are to me. I'm getting better about telling rude people to back off, though. Eight: I hate the noise a dial-up connection makes when it's connecting to the internet. Nine, I took keyboarding in eight grade. I still type at over 50WPM. Ten: Maroon 5's Adam Lavine can sing his songs to me any time, even though they're mostly perverted. With a voice like that, who cares?  Number eleven, I can't tell time from a normal clock without actually studying it and thinking about it. Number tweleve, I always spell remember wrong the first time I write or type it. I usually leave out the second "m" for some reason. Number thirteen, I'm a font whore. The more fonts, the better! Fourteen, someday I want to get a zebra just to say "I have a zebra" when somebody asks what pets I have. Fifteen: I can count to thirteen in Spanish. I can also count to ten in ASL. ;) Number sixteen, my older sister's roomate is my unofficial sister. I've known her my whole life so we might as well be sisters anyway. Seventeen, I get along well with people younger than me. I guess I can relate to them. Number eighteen: My favorite color combo is black, hot pink, and white. Coincidentally, those are also my favorite colors. Nineteen: I have a build-a-bear named Loverly that my aunt bought me for my sweet sixteen. Twenty: My mousepad has green and blue dots arranged in a semi-phsycadelic pattern.  Twenty-one: I drink too much soda. I know I shouldn't, but I do. Twenty-two, along with this blog, I also keep a paper journal and a meditation journal. It helps me organize my thoughts. Number twenty-three, I'm getting really tired of typing numbers. Twenty-four, I have a puppy that I adore and would die without. Number twenty-five: I like dogs better than people. Dogs don't judge, are good listeners, and at the end of the day are still going to love you regardless. Twenty-six: It's all about the eyes. Most days I wear lots of eyeliner and my look is smokey. Twenty-seven: I have a computer, a DVD player, a VCR, a TV, and a stereo in my room. We aren't rich, however; I bought almost all of it with my own money. Twenty-eight: I wear glasses. Most times I go out in public I leave them at home, though, because I don't like wearing them. Twenty-nine, I have no idea what I want to do with my life. Thirty, I leave WinAmp on almost constantly.  OK, so this has actually only been 15 mintues, but I'm tired and I'm going to bed. Night, y'all.  [end: 11:25pm]    RIGHT NOW     mood ::  sleepy  listening to/watching ::  WinAmp, right now it's on View from Heaven by Yellowcard  eating/drinking ::  nothing  craving ::  nothing  talking to ::  this girl in Canada...  thinking about ::  i don't feel so good  wishing ::  i felt good!  wearing ::  pjs  random ::  My foot is asleep.
