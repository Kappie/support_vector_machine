Saying my goodbyes It was off to Kyle D.'s Where we talked and laughed a while As we ate mac and cheese  Getting home I had With my parents, a great meal Chicken, biscuits, green beans too How full I surely feel  Now, off to bed I hop I said this poem would be brief I'll end with a small note to Geoff "You stole my heart.  You thief!"   Good night, dear reader.  See you tomorrow!
