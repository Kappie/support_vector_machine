What do you guys think I should do about the play/work situation? Of course, you're all going to be biased, but nonetheless, I want your opinions.  -Kay   ~~~~~~~~~~~~   HEYYYYYYYYY! I'm lovin it is my phrase...not yours.    I think you should do the play.  Evelyn already called me this morning...I think she gets sad when she doesn't talk to me....hahahaha.  Today is Friday the 13th and I'm afraid to go outside. I really don't want to work tonight. Especially since katie and nicole work together...  Ok..now i'm going out..  My classes don't start until the 30th...hahahahaha...    Good bye.    h-
