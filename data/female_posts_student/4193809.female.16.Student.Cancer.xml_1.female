There has been so much confusion in trying to get my classes lined up that I dread stepping foot into that hot brick building.    At the end of last year (sophomore year), I applied for a spot in the Advanced Placement Government class and  got my acceptance letter. All was well until I received my tentative list of classes and didn't see AP Gov anywhere. Turns out the teacher got confused and put me into the senior Advanced American History class instead. She refuses to put me in her class. Instead, I'm being forced to take the senior class my junior year and the junior class my senior year. What crap! I actually wanted to take Government. This is an awesome year to. I'm already so active in the Democratic campaign that it would be no trouble to get 30 hours of community service.    Is it insane (and tres vain) to spend $23.50 on blush? The women at the Estee Lauder counter were just so nice and full of compliments... I couldn't resist. The "desert rose" just looked wonderful with my fair complexion, or so they said. Somehow I managed to avoid buying the "pink shimmer" lip gloss and the "winter sage" eyeliner. I am gullible.    Wish me luck tomorrow. Hopefully I can dazzle my classmates with my surprisingly long locks, revamped fashion sense, and "desert rose" blush.    In reply to a comment on my "lack of inspiration" post:       Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately, I've already done that. In February, I had an interview published between myself and the local band "Fatkid Dodgeball". It went over very well.
