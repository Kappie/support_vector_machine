       
      if i knew what to say i would say it a million times, but i don't, so i stay in a suspended silence. i shy away from questioning eyes, blinking away my tears of confusion, frustration, madness. black is what i see. black is what i feel. black is what i am. i don't know what to think, i don't know what to do, i don't know what to say.  so i stay in a suspended silence.
