Yesterday was rather okay,met huileng over lunch and had a short chat. went to the lab after sch to rush for the BCS project, met Weiping there( for the first time in TP)... Had this great feeling whenever i get to meet my sec. sch friends, guess I really miss them much...  Will be having my first online test of TP in abt 30 mins...so i should be reading my notes instead of writing but whatever...  Anyway, it's Ms Michelle Tay and Ms ong Peiwen's birthday today... Just wanna wish them all the best... It's great knowing them!
