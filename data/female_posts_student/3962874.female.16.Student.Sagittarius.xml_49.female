Then she gave me $40 that dad owed me. So that was a plus, sure I'll come over to dad's be bored for a day and get 60 dollars. Fun stuff. Not really I'm still bored. Daniel had to go home because tomarrow he is getting fillings. Dad got his shot and I guess it hurts. The doctor (and Ann who is also a doctor) said that it probably would hurt some more for a while and then in about a week it will get better. That would really suck. I have been playing internet checkers for a really long time and I keep losing. I think it's becuase I am so tired and bored.
