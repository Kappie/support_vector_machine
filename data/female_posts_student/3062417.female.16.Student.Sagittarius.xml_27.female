Carol spent the night Friday.   Saturday - My mom, Emily, Carol, and I went to Carousel mall. I bought flip flops for prom and a really cool yellow shirt that looks really good on me. That made me happy. I like spending money. We saw Adam at Kahunaville. He's a funny kid. I think Emily should date him.    Sunday - Easter. Went to my grandma's house and spent it w/ the fam. It wasn't terribly bad I guess. Aubree was there and she is really cute. Then I got home and was watching tv when Carol called. She met two guys. Aaron and Raik. Raik is for Germany. I'm trying to get her to ask Raik to prom. And if Carol takes Raik I will take Aaron (perfect right?). The only bad thing is they live in Saranac Lake (3 hours away). Whatever if we can get them up on weekends I'm gonna try to get Carol to convince Raik that we should go on a double date. (yay fun!)   Today - Fun. I went to my mom's office in Oneida with Carol and Emily. We sorted through clothes (clotheses) and just hung out. Carol really likes this Raik guy. Then we went to Pepi's Pizza and ate (wow suprise) pizza and played shooting games in the arcade. Then I came home and now I'm online listening to Allister and talking to Carol.  Song:  I've been sitting here for hours Burned an image of you in my mind Finding comfort in the words you say But it's not the same I know you're worth the wait And I can't explain What I'm going through inside But I would turn away the world Just to have you here with me tonight  We can take our time Making sure that everything feels right It won't be easy but I'm not afraid You're so far away We made our start from scratch It's now or never but we can't look back I need you with me for another day You're so far away Yeah far away  I've been sitting here forever Your voice is resonating in my mind Countless hours with you on the phone And now I'm not alone I know you're worth the wait  But I can't escape  What I'm going through inside But i would turn away the world Just to have you here with me tonight  We can take our time Making sure that everything feels right It won't be easy but I'm not afraid You're so far away We made our start from scratch It's now or never but we can't look back I need you with me for another day You're so far away Yeah far away  I know there's no time left for second chances Still we're right despite these circumstances You've changed me more than you could ever know So we will just hang on until tomorrow So take my hand, don't ever let me go This time it's right   We can take our time  Making sure that everything feels right It won't be easy but I'm not afraid You're so far away We made our start from scratch It's now or never but we can't look back I need you with me for another day You're so far away Yeah far away  -Scratch- Allister
