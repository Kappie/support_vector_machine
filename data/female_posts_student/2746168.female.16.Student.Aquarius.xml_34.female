Well here I am in Mexico on the day we celebrate the birth of our nation.  Being in this country with all its boundless natural attributes and its “third world status vies a vi the States, you really appreciate what our founding fathers accomplished.  We hold these truths to be self evident………. Those words on a piece of paper and their successful application and defense through the years is the key differences in these two countries.  Thomas Jefferson is arguably the second most influential person in history, in my humble opinion.  July 6th Navidad  July 6th aka Christmas day.  We are giving present to each other and having Christmas dinner tonight,  Bruce is going to grill a beef tender we brought from the states.  This morning for breakfast the cook found my field peas I brought for a southern dinner and made refried beans out of them they were really delicious.  Yum Yum!  We don’t have a Christmas tree so we are stacking the presents around our Christmas bongos. There is a Tuesday market today that Laura and Ben and Lizzie are going to.  Bruce wants some local honey from the market so he may go or get someone to buy him some.  I think I might go out and try the local 9 hole golf course.  Yesterday I talked to Ben’s guitar teacher who is also a painter.  He used to be a street musician in New Orleans and is a singer songwriter.  He is agreeable to doing a rooftop house concert so we are going to try and set that up for the night of the 21st.  The computer guy came yesterday and fixed my e-mail woop!
