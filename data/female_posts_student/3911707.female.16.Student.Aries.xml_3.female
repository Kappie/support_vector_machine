I don't remember why, but in my dream we had to put all of our things from out of our lockers into some box. I included my cigarettes with this. Some other chick did too, the same kind too. After some class, I went back to get my things and leave for the summer; apparently it was the last day. Kaitlyn handed me a crushed box with 3 left in it and I said to her, "Those aren't mine, I had like, 8 left." When I said that, Raeven handed me another box and goes, "Are these yours?" I nodded my head and she dashed off with them. I started screaming down the hallway at her and no one seemed to care. That was extremely strange, considering it took place in my elementary school.  When I woke up, I had such a craving. For water. It's understandable when you crave a soda or something with a taste, but who craves for water? Well, I have my water, and not just any kind of water. I'm a high-roller; I have Aquafina. Or should I say, AquafinA. For some reason, that's the way the label is printed.  Not only was I craving water, but doritos. I know we have some around here somewhere, but I can't figure out where. I looked in the cupboard, but no luck. I even looked in my little brother's room. Not there. My stomach is speaking in tongues. I guess it would probably be a good idea if I start eating more. Mini-meals aren't very healthy, you know. So, I think I'll stop typing this boring, pointless, stupid shit and find those chips. Then I might be able to get back to sleep. And since I'll be satisfied then, I might have a good dream.
