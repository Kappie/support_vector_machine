I can't wait for Friday because that will be my break. I have a feeling that as I climb the ladder of high school, I'll need more "breaks" .. no wonder the high schoolers get to have more fun during school. I'm considering going to the Switchfoot concert coming up. It's free, so, that gives me reason.    My hair has blown me away today. It's so.. blech. Frizz control is what I need people. How come frizzy brown hair is so common? Why not blonde frizzy hair? Or black? ..    I have to clean.. I hate cleaning. I have to fix up my room.. ooh, torture. I guess now would be better than later because I have to wait for Sarah to get on anyways..
