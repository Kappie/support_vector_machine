I've been busy sleeping in, cleaning the apartment and getting a head start on making up time at the library for being gone this coming Friday.  Whew!     So, about the big show.  Felt pretty good about heading to the Beach all by myself; was looking hot in my new jeans and tight green Banana Republic tank-top...the one that shows off the new Seattle Gap belt oh-so-well.  Did a round of yoga before heading out, too, so was feeling pretty good in my flexible skin.  Took a perch in the bar upstairs and people-watched with the Voice of God for a bit.  Janet didn't arrive until the first set got underway, so I spent quality time with Kathy in the meantime.  We took stock of the crowd (a fairly young one) and I learned that, while I'm not a baby dyke, I do still qualify as 'chicken' because, according to Kathy, I "would be really fun to do."  Always good to know.    As the crowd dispersed at the first show's end, Kathy, Janet and her friend (possibly the messenger?) and I met on the stairs where Kathy hurried through the introductions, on her way to put out some fire or another.  We three secured our beverages and I took another perch overlooking the dancefloor, waiting for them to join me.  The only words we'd exchanged thus far were "Nice to meet you" and I didn't actually know for sure if the TabiKat story was all that credible, so I didn't really feel the need to follow Janet and her friend around...just yet.  Instead, I made sure to stand in clear view of them, leaving plenty of room on either side of me for company.    And sure enough, before long, Janet sidled up next to me and we started chatting.  I have to say, it was really nice to be able to carry on a conversation with someone easily, without worrying about how this flirt came across or whether that was a spark.  There weren't any of  those   sparks to speak of, but that was more of a relief than anything, too.  We talked about the school (she's a UI alum), how the drag shows have changed since her time, law school and law enforcement, the Boise scene, and how 29 is not old.    "I'm 23, and..."    "SEE?  I AM old!!"  "...I feel old in this crowd."  Watching the young things dance and be merry was a good time, I have to say, but seeing the gang of baby dykes I was once drawn to made me chuckle under my breath and shake my head.  So glad I'm not a baby dyke.    But back to the story...after we downed our beers, we ditched Janet's friend (and no, I can't remember her name), who was adamant about her position as wallflower, and hit the dancefloor.  While there was no bump-and-grind action, it was just plain nice to dance with a just plain nice person.  I know it's not flashy or even a bit angsty, but for whatever reason (and probably more than a few of them), I'm just not in the mood for big excitement or gasp-filled stories.  So it was just the perfect thing, really.    Not long after the second show, my reserves were finally giving up, needing another dosage of Vitamin C, and my bed was calling, so I decided to make my exit while I could still be polite and charming.  Being the classy lady I am, I left her with my email address written on a bar napkin.    So yea, not too exciting, but that's just okay.  She wrote me a little email this evening, so I should go see about a reply.  Then I'll finally dig in to Book 5 for the rest of the evening.  If the rumors are true about the book's potency, I may not sleep at all!
