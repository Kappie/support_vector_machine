This horrible, mind-numbing, brain-rotting, suicide TV!  So I have to admit that I was once a fan of this media craze, too. I even find myself trying to rationalize it and defend it to my husband who is determined that “Reality TV” is going to be the end of civilization as we know it.  Then I saw this, urlLink  “MR. PERSONALITY"  coming soon to FOX television.   First problem, its reality TV -which seems to get dumber and dumber by the season. Second, it’s hosted by Monica Lewinsky –how does giving the president head make you qualified to host a reality series?  Now I have no problems with Monica Lewinsky, I would even endeavor to say that I am a bit fascinated with her in some ways, but come on she is a bit overeducated for such a lowly position, don’t you think?  Between ‘Temptation Island’ –which I can honestly say intrigued me- and ‘The Bachelor’, ‘The Bachlorette’, ‘Joe Millionaire’, ‘Who want’s to Marry a Millionaire’ and ‘Married by America’, ‘The sexiest people in America’ and who can forget ‘American Idol’ our country is turning into an invariable laughing stock of wanna-be’s and desperate pathetic jerks who cant act!  Oh and I nearly forgot the unbearable ‘Survivor’!  What is this world coming to, I mean really coming to?  If there were life out there, in the stars and they were watching us right now they would pass us by for invasion looking for a more intelligent race!  I long for the days when television was purely fiction and people read books rather than rotting their brains and lowering their IQ’s with this drivel we call “Reality TV.”  So I wonder if it could get any worse than a television show about a desperate woman and 20 “eligible” bachelors in masks making out on national TV for one hour a week.  Every season I wonder if it could get any worse, any dumber, and for goodness sake any more desperate and every season I am surprised –unhappily- with the idiotic programming they come out with.   Then I wonder what terrible thing happened in their pasts to cause these seemingly normal –under other circumstances, of course- people to subject themselves to the demoralization of “Reality TV”?  What utterly pathetic lives must these people live to parade around in front of the world as lonely and desperate!  I am beginning to think this is something beyond the understanding of anyone with an IQ over 5o –though I know better!   Now don’t get me wrong, I can understand that some people like it.  I can even try to respect that –like I said, I used to watch it back when it was new and exciting.  Some Americans want to come home after a long hard day of work and not have to think about anything and for them I say: “Watch your Reality TV and enjoy it!”  for it is truly those that place themselves before the world in the most humiliating circumstance possible for their 15 minutes of fame who I pity, not the viewers!  ~Kristyn
