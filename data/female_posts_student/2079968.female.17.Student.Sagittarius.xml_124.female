To think that I'll be in the same boat that they are in a year is unsettling. It's nice to know that God will be leading me to a new path...closer to His mission in life for me. But at the same time it's strange to know that I may be leaving behind the town I grew up in...the people I love. But hey, I know that you never forget where you come from...it's always a place close to your heart.  Hey, I still have some growing up to do...I have a lot to seek in the year to come as God guides me. As long as I'm closer to Him and His desires for me, that's all that matters.  But in case I forget I want to say congrats, Class of 2004! God bless you guys...to my friends, I love you all. Don't forget me, I know I won't forget you.  On a totally different note, I feel like I'm getting sick...I hope and pray I stay well, haha.
