But i talked to Courtney and we were talking about maybe..around like the 4th..coming up to wv and stay with her. hehe...it would totally work tho..Justins dad works for the airline company and he could get me tickets realllllly cheap. But the problem is...would my parents let me fly by myself? Probably NO!...so we were also thinking...they could fly down here and i'll fly back up with them and then come back home somehow. It would work tho. I reallllly hope that i can come to wv to see everyone. And I know Ryan is going off to Buffalo in late July..that'll be cool.  *Excited yet..frustrated*...i got my dad kinda thinking about letting me go. But im not even going to bring it up with mom yet. lol  Deidra's going to be here on Sunday yay!! She told me she cut off her hair and got it layerd and all that shizz...she had such long hair and now its GONE! and she even said that her hair is shorter than mine...now thats very weird cuz...uh this is the longest my hair has EVER been..i always cut it..and im trying to just...bare with it lol.   thats all for now.
