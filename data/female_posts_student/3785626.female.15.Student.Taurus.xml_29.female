I woke up at 6:30 got ready for the hike. They picked me up around 8:00. Then we went to Little Mountain. It was a nice day for a walk too. I got my exercise. The whole time I was thinking about Tregory. =D Then after that we went to French Camp, got there at like 10 something I guess. Then we walked around the historical places, it was very interesting, I think my mom would like it because she likes that kind of stuff, but I don't know if she could take it. We went to the little gift shop thing, it was awesome. Then after that, we went to the French Camp park and ate and played on the Merry-Go-Round and the swings and the zip cord. It was like recess. Then after all that we went to Ackerman park. Me and Christina played batmitton(Sp?) and we kept winning. Yay. We rock. We also raced around the "track". I got 2nd place but that's just cause I was getting tired. Maybe next time, eh? Then after that we went to Kristina's and Jacqui's house. I got to see their kittens and we played Speed and War (Card Games). After that we had hamburgers. They took me home to take a shower and change. And then I went to church. I had fun. Did you have fun? Anyways then today I did nothing. Tregory came over. Really happy!!! And then I got to practice driving. I saw Derek, Tregory's cousin, and I saw Cortez and Cortez. Lol Then I went to sleep after that. Saturday I am going shopping with Ashley and Monday after band camp I'm going shopping. Yayness! We're going to have lots of fun. Wheeee!!! I Love To Shop. I just wish I had a job for money. Yameen? Anyways I get my contacts the day before school starts. I'm happy. I don't know when I'm going to get my hair cut. Just whenever...Blah...Well later.Love Cherry Loving Tregory Love  Anyways now yesterday I didn't do much but e-mail Ashley and see Tregory. I drove around a bit. I think I'm getting kind of better. Hm...Anyways then today I saw Tregory. :) Happy Me. Tomorrow I'm going shopping with Ashley! Woot! If I mow the grass I get $10, and maybe my dad will fork over $20 more. So then I'll have $30 to go shopping with. Cause you know these days you can't buy anything good with $20. Lol, Anyways I'm off. Later. Love Cherry
