I have some, of course.  Seamus Finnagan's father is a muggle, as stated in the first book. So, he's sort of obvious. But then there's the whole thing with the Dean Thomas and how his part got smaller, and how the second book was supposed to originally have the title of the sixth. There's also speculation as to how it could be Hagrid. Which it very well could be, but somehow I don't think so. I even went out on a hu~ge limb (the end of the branch being several meteres away from the trunk of the tree), and thought about crookshanks. I mean, he's half cat, ne? And Remus. But I'm not sure if being bitten by a werewolf makes you half-blooded or not. I would love a book about Remus though. He was my second favorite, next to Sirius.  And Sirius' death. Well, I think he's coming back. Of course. Maybe not in this book, and maybe not back to life  persay , but I think he'll be back none the less.  Luna Lovegood is another one we have most certainly not heard the last of. I think she'll have big role to play yet. It seemed as though in OOTP, we were just being introduced to her, but leaving us to think about her a little more.  The sixth book should be very special indeed, my darlings...
