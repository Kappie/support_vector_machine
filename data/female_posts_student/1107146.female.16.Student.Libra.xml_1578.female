So count me out. Heheh. But I'll try my best.  Yes, Linds, let's go a la library...I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm not sure if you actually need that many, I thought it was a certain number per chapter. But I dunno so don't listen to me.   Schedules are supposed to come right before school, they should be here any day now.  That's about it then. G'bye all.
