While we were still driving around outside, I couldn't bring myself to think that  that  was the Manila Hotel. In my head I was thinking,  Isn't this supposed to be a five star hotel or something?  Honestly speaking, it looked like a big motel from the outside. :P But once we drove into the driveway, boy was I surprised! Inside the lobby, we met up with Tita Lulu, who was basically the big honcho on organizing the prom. While they were talking, (my parents and Tita Lulu) I decided to walk around. The Lobby had many red sofas and even a band playing classical music. Plus a chandelier. Anyway, I went to the Polka Ball to have a sneak peak of where the prom would be. I wasn't too impressed tho. The first thing I saw when I went inside was the ceiling. Sure, it had chandeliers too, but some of the lightbulbs were busted, and the ceiling was dirty. With cobwebs and unidentified sticking objects. There were more tables than I expected, but the stage sucked. O_o Then I noticed the carpet. I was wearing the platforms my auntie gave me, and when I stepped on the carpet, I felt like I was sinking! >_>; It was that soft. Soft.. But it had all these black spots on it. O_o Like bubblegum or something. After that, I went back to the lobby where my parents were still talking. We went to our room after checking in. Room #1013 on the 10th floor. :D The room was very comfortable. We got a view of the ocean and the swimming pool. :P  After a while, Gela and Camilla showed up at the room (after much texting and excitement from yours truly). They told me that the beauty dude was there, so I took a shower and went down to get transformed. >_> I brought my mom with me, and when we got there, Gela was just getting finished. The mommies started talking and stuff, and after a while, Racine showed up with one of her mommies. Then it was Camilla's turn to get pretty, then mine. While I was in transformation, Gela, Camilla and Racine went to Racine's room to get her dress. Then Camilla's mom came, and so the room was filled with mommies. :D Then Racine got pretty, and it was time for the prom.  While I was running around, going upstairs and downstairs getting all my stuff, Gela's date came and they registered and went inside. Before that tho, I was able to get some pictures of us. We waited in the lobby for Camilla's and Racine's dates, but then Gela texted, telling me to get over there with her. :P I then realized that I was the expendable one because I didn't have a date. Anyway, I went there and registered; got inside and met Franco. He was nice; he talked, and when Gela was getting noticably cold, he offered his coat (numerous times!), but Gela refused. (aw...) The conversation was just getting started when Camilla came in with her date, CJ.  Hmmm, approved!  I thought as I looked at Franco and CJ. :P Honestly, that was what I was thinking then. I asked about Racine, and it turned out she was still waiting for her date, Frederick. I went to the lobby, and said "Moral support has arrived!" Luckily, we didn't have to wait for a very long while. He came after a few minutes ( Approve approve! ) and it was to the prom for us.   *note* My post was WAY longer than this... but it got cut off. n_n;; I type to much when I'm narrating something. I'll just post the rest next time. My mom's being crappy and telling me to get off the computer. *note2* Again, I'm stuck in a bad situation with my mom. x_x Why is this happening?
