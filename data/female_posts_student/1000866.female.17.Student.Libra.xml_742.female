She's a good kid. Plus, Ke'ls going away for a few days. Bummer to the max. Plus, Bryan's leaving Sunday for like, a week. NO GOOD! :(     Oh well. After that, I went to my trumpet lesson which was ok. Not too bad. I ad to drive home in the rain though on the expressway. I was honestly scared out of my mind. *Shudder*    Oh well. Then, I came home, hung out for a while and then went out with Diane to get some Starbucks and chat. Then, we went to Matthew's work and annoyed him until he got off and we went to Diane's house. Fun, fun times indeed. Then, Matthew had to be home so I had him drive me too. We spent like, 20 minutes just talking though. It was nice. I haven't been alone with him in a while and it was just nice being around him. Super fun. :)     Then, I came home, expecting to write in here and go to bed...only to get a call from Bryan ten minutes later. So, Bryan and I went to hang out for about an hour and a half.     Wow, I spent time with a whole lot of different people today. Crazy.    Plus...PETER'S HOME!!!!!!! I'm so happy. I've actually really missed talking to him. What will I do when he goes to college?    Anyway, I must be off to bed now...night kiddies.    XOXO
