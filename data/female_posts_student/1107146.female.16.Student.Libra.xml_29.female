[Disclaimer for Leigh's sake: Jackie is engaged so there is no possibility of there being competition.] This whole thing reminds me of her thing with Vincent.  Do you remember that, Elizabeth?  If you do, you'll see the similiarity.  [Second Disclaimer because I always tend to get things wrong: If Leigh happens not to like Josh at this particular moment, please don't bitch me out]
