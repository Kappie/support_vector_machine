I decided for this year that I would make a "Halloween CD" and play it through the windows in my room... so, I set it to play continuously, and for awhile, a lot of kids didn't even come to the door (we watched them start up the walk, and get scared and run away).  HAHA  Sorry, I can' t help but laugh.  It's sorta funny.  So my Mom told me to turn the music down, and maybe at least then they wouldn't hear it till they were farther up the walk so they would have too much time to run away... in other words, I'd get to the door, dressed as a normal person, and they'd then realize they were in no danger.  Of course, if they were SMART about horror movies, they realize that it's the people you DON'T EXPECT to be the killer that is, in fact, the killer.  Oh well...  Anyhow, so, after a time of handing out candy to the little kiddos, I go to the door, and I look up, and I see Amber Dellinger.  WoW!  I haven't seen her in over two years!  It was weird to see her... with her 2 year old daughter!  And she told me that she had her son in the car (with her fiance`).  WEIRD!  So, she has a 2 year old daughter, and a 3 month old son.  We visited for a few minutes, and then she headed on.  Well, okay, so about 30 minutes after that, some REALLY cute guy came to the door.  I would venture to guess he's a junior or senior at TR.  Anyhow, he was the courtyard crowish type (well... a skater boy)... and *sigh*... he was hot.  So, we flirted for a good 5 minutes.  He was showing me all the candy he had gotten, and telling me some story about how he had been given a toddler shoe by someone... which was weird... then he proceeded to smell it after I asked if it smelled funny.  Hehehe  Man, lemme just say... if he was 3 years older... I'd have my way with him!  hehehe  He was just cute as could be.  And the gal that was with him seemed to be getting a bit tiffed that he and I were flirting so much.  I dunno if she was his girlfriend or one of his many adoring fans (I'm sure he has many fans... cute guys usually do).  Anyhow, then we started to run out of candy... and I finally shut the light and music off around 8:45.  It was so funny... I noticed people from years past.  And I had many tell me they'd come back next year.  I guess we give out AWESOME ASS CANDY!  hehe  It's cause my Dad buys it.  If my Mom got the candy, it'd be that "Kiddie Mix" sheisse.... anyhoo... Okay, I have no more to say right now... well, one more thing... I'm going to A-town tomorrow...!  yay!  I'll be there till Sunday evening.  Me and   urlLink Mel  are going to see The Ring tomorrow night... it's gonna be AWESOME!  I dunno.. maybe we'll go eat someplace, too...  I guess it depends on whether or not her Aunt is gonna party with her this weekend... in which case I may have to go to assist in the consumption of alcohol... ;-)  Anyhow, okay REALLY that's all I have for now.  I'll post more later... probably after I get back from Austin.      urlLink  postCount('Halloween');
