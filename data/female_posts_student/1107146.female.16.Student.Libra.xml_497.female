But no, today I remembered why I hate recording by myself so much...I'm the only one to get pissed off when things go wrong, and TRUST ME, I get plenty pissed off. So I was absolutely screaming in between takes today while recording...something...and sweating like no other because the fan was off and the vent was closed...so as to prevent that wonderful audial entropy called "NOISE". But that still didn't stop the cords from getting crossed and making a wonderful 128+ dB hum called "FEEDBACK" that also qualifies as "NOISE", expect I was using "MIC LINES", and "MIC LINE FEEDBACK" is so much worse than, say, "AMPLIFIER FEEDBACK".  Sorry for the biting sarcasm all. This is me pissed off and trying to catch my breath.   Not to mention the wonderful waste at MLK today...trying to get my ring back. I didn't, if anyone didn't get that earlier post. So I was incredibly pissed off today, but I did get to see Chloe and Boy at my dad's so that was frickin' AWESOME.  Man...every time I go to MLK I lose a bit of my rational thought for a while. Like, right now I'm trying to remember all those wonderful phrases I normally use, but I can't. Like "OMG that is so L337". There's one, but still.  End result: I hate my life. A lot. And my anorexia is saying "don't eat anymore" but I'm going to, by golly, because I'm frickin' hungry.   Anyone who hasn't heard the band Cold hasn't come to be yet. You need to hear something from  Year of the Spider  and your life will be changed forever.  RAAAAAUHGGGGGHHH. So pissed! My cat is in the other room meowing his head off and I want to go and KILL him. And that isn't normal, friends, most of the time I just don't care. But today was a downer so there.  Bon soir, amis. YES.
