I went into work for a few hours and then I came home to an 18 month old baby and a lil 3 year old. I had to babysit for my mom while she was helping out a friend with work. Ashley called me and told me she was back in town so she was going to come over after she did some things. So...Ryan and Tony call me and want to hang out so I tell then to come on over. They helped play with the baby even though Ryan made her cry. When the baby left Tony and Ryan wanted me to go play pool with them So I called up Ashley and we all had it planned.....Then my mom tells me I have to baby sit Kendyl, that my mom was going to a concert. So I had to have Kendyl find someone to spend the night with. She did. Then.... we took Kendyl to her friends house and then we all met up back at my house....    Ashley got a call from Jesse wanting her to come over there. I was like ok if you want to. I didnt care I totally understood that she wanted to see her boyfriend after she had been gone for a while. Then Ryan and Tony leave me there with Ashley. So we go to Jesse's and we are there for about 15 min. I tell Ashley that I need to go up to Lizards. So we go....    When we get there, there was alot of people. So me and Ashley talk about things that happend. And yes of course I tell about her that 2 faced bitch Liz. Then after we get done "Talking behind" Liz's back we find better things to talk about. So then Tony gave me 5$ so that I could go eat some food. I was starving. I love Tony he is so sweet.     When Ashley left guess who shows up? Tiffany Sanchez the other 2 faced bitch...I was ok with her before Liz told me Tiffany was talking behind my back. So I was nice to her I said hello. The whole time she was giving me these looks. I even invited her to my house to hang out with Tony (Because Ryan told me to invite her I realy didnt want to) So as we were leaving she gives me one last dirty look. So I go off. I start yelling at her. She walked away but hey that is ok because Ryan was pulling me into the car.     So then we left Lizards and we came back to my place ate some chips and hung out then the boys had to leave. And that was about it.
