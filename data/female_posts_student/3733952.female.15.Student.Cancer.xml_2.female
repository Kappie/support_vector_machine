If you disagree with any of my opinions on these issues, by all means, flame.  Harry Potter Romances: I support Harry/Hermione all the way. They are like perfect. Christina doesn't see that, but the book won't tell everything. Some things you just have to figure out yourself. You may think that they can't be together because they are friends. Well, if you watch As Told by Ginger, you would see that Ginger and Darren are together and they have been friends since they were babies. All good couples start out as friends. Jack and I started out as friends and look at us! We're perfect! The girl Harry cares most about is Hermione. And the boy Hermione cares most about is Harry. Well what about Cho and Viktor? Cho and Viktor are Harry and Hermione's CRUSHES. There is a MAJOR difference. We all know that Harry looks like his dad, right? And we all know that Hermione is Muggle-born like Lily, right? And we ALSO know that history likes to repeat itself in Harry Potter's world, right? Right. IT IS FATE! If you, like Christina, support Ron/Hermione, you should think again. Ron and Hermione fight NONSTOP. Do you know what happens to couples who fight NONSTOP? They break up! They get divorced! Ron and Hermione just DON'T FIT! And Ron doesn't like Crookshanks. 94% of women would dump their boyfriend if they didn't like the pet. HARRY/HERMIONE ALL THE WAY!!!  Other romances I support: Ginny/Neville Ron/Random girl (Parvati maybe) Draco/death (though I know it won't happen) Ernie/Hannah Jack/Livi Dobby/Winky Percy/Penny (I think it's cute) Hagrid/Madam Maxime Crabbe/Goyle (it would be extremely funny to add gays to the books) I better get on to other issues.  Initials: We are going to play use-your-imagination. Pretend you are a girl who walks into Kohl's to find a cute purse to take to Vegas. You like those initial purses that everyone has, so you decide to get one of those. Now think of your name... good... now the first letter of your name. That is called your I N I T I A L. Now that you have that letter in your head, go look for a purse with that letter on it. You search and search and search, but you can't find that letter. There must be a mistake. There HAS to be at least ONE.. somewhere. You search some more, but you CANNOT FIND ONE. Your heart sinks, your hopes are gone, so you by a black purse instead to match your mood. Then you leave the store wishing you had a different name. This is how I feel EVERY TIME I WALK INTO A STORE. There are no purses with the letter "O" on them. But your name is also Livi, by an "L". NO. I want my O's! "O" is not the only letter left out either. I have a very good friend named Hillary, and she can never find anything with an "H" on it. Without are O's and H's, we would be nowhere. This book here that I'm reading for the 3rd time would be called: Arry Ptter and te Gblet F Fire. And Santa Clause wouldn't be able to say "Ho, ho, ho!" To all the neglected-letter names, I feel your pain!  Teen Couples: I don't know about Jack, but I get put down all the time. People don't understand how serious I am when I say I love him. They think it's pathetic and stupid and stuff. They don't think we can make it a long time, but I think we can. I know we can. Others think we are too young and just having a "crush". Yea, I'm young, but I'm getting older. And THIS IS NOT A CRUSH. This is real, I know it is. How can I make you people understand? *sigh* You'll see in time, I know.  Dance a Sport? Yes, in my eyes, dance is a sport. Yea, I know, there is no NDA (national dance association) but it is still a sport. Most sports are played using balls, like basketBALL, baseBALL, volleyBALL, but not all. Swimming is a sport, but it doesn't use balls. Cheerleading is a sport too. I don't like many cheerleaders, but I have to stick up for them on this. It IS a sport. I am just as dedicated to dance as the rest of you are to your sport. I give most of my time and money to dance. Dance is the only thing I do. There are three things that I think all sports have in common. Practice: You have to practice every sport to get better at it. Dance is no easy task. You have to learn balance and posture and technique. You need to learn motions which turn into steps which turn into dances. It takes a lot of time and a lot of concentration. And along with practice is dedication. If you weren't dedicated, you wouldn't practice. Next time you are with me, watch me. If I get bored, I'll start dancing. Practice is as must for a sport. Sweat: Yea, I sweat in dance. I sweat a LOT. Some of those costumes are like an oven. And the lights are like a tanning bed. And THEN you dance. A sport is usually something that gets your heart rate up. And usually when your heart rate goes up, you sweat. Sweat is a must also. Competition: What is a sport if you don't compete? In basketball you have all these tournaments, in track you have meets, and in dance you have competitions. You travel around the country to get scored on how well you dance. It takes a lot of teamwork to make the dance perfect. It's just like tournaments, you want to get first place. You want to be the best. Without competition, where is the sport? With these three things: practice, sweat, and competition, dance can be classified as a sport.  A note to all: Dad is taking the computer away now. I have no idea when I'll get it back. I will try my best to find other computers to raid. I will miss you all. Talk to you when I get it back.  Bye!
