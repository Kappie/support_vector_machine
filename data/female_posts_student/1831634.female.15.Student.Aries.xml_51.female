I have a freaking 98 in algebra because of HOMEWORK.  that is the STUPIDEST thing to get dragged down by.  sheesh.  not that I should be complaing about a 98.  cuz all my other averages are... way down there.  haha.  -___-  we've done almost nothing in these three weeks...  yeesh.  anyway.  what have I been doing?  I've been sleeping like heck.  I love sleeping.  Id wants to sleep.  Ego tells me to go to bed.  I wanna kill superego.  Id and ego both want to kill superego.  anyway, I've just been gadding about reading fanfics all week.  so now I have an art proj due tomorrow that I still have to work on.  and I'm just thinking about how much I'd love to use jack's prismacolor pencils to color it.  why does HE get the prismacolors when he doesn't even LIKE art?  I gotta go do... some stuff now.  =)  so buh bye.  maybe I'll write a super long post later tonight.  but don't count on it.  unless kailing bugs me to do it BEFORE 11.30...  cuz she keeps going, "sunshine, I think you should update your blog" at ELEVEN THIRTY.  and then she goes to sleep!  I mean... wth?!
