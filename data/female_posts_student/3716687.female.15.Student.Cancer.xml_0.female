I've found a church that I feel like I will spiritually grow at, and is exactly what I am looking for in a church, and youth group.  I saw Mike yesterday and it was great seeing him again, ripped converses and all :).  So many more things, that I don't have the time nor energy to write.  But more shall come soon children.  -Allison
