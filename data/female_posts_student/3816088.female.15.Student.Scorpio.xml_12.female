We all woke up around 7 to get ready and stuff and my daddy went and picked up my mommys car because the doors are all fixed from the accident and we loaded up the car and ended up being ready liuke an hour before we needed to be so we all went to subway and just took our precious time. NOthing much exciting really happened on this day at all. Like we got to our hotel at about 11 Hawaii time or 4 in the morning our time and considering none of us got any sleep on the plane we were sooo tired!   Friday! On Firdaywe all woke up at like 6am because we were all stuck on Texas time so it would be like 11 so none of us got like any sleep at all. But we went and had a light breakfast and then went out to the hotels pool to spend the day there. And let me tell you the hotel was amazing. There were like 4 seperate towers of hotels and in order to move around you rode either a boat thingy or a tram and it got you to were you wanted to be and also in this area since its a big resort there are all different types of shops and restaurants galour! Like anything you wanted they had. Then they had 4 acres worth of pools. There were some pools that were the regular water and cloreine and in those there were tons of water falls and slides and some slides that went through waterfalls. It was all so amazing. Like every corner you took was either like a slide or a waterfall or a groto or something really neat like that. Then there were also pools that had sand in them that they brought over from the beach and the water was also brought over from the ocean. Its kinda hard to explain what it was like but like you were swimming in the ocean but you werent. And in those areas you could swim with dolphins, go snorkling, paddle boating, kayaking, or just swim or lay on rafts. It was soo neat. I mostly just went down the slides with my brothers and we also went paddleboating and had competitions with my parents. And let me just say you dont put 3 soccer players in one boat and have them compete with the two parents because we kinda kicked there little tooshies! After we spent the whole day there we went back and just showered and went to go and eat dinner   Saturday!  This day was pretty boring for someone like me because I hate taking pictures. But anyway we drove around like all day and just went sight seeing kinda like off some really big mountains i guess and stuff and we saw the King Kamayamaya statue and stuff. And dont get me wrong it was all gorgeus but really kinda boring. One plus and fun part was that we went to this place that started with a P and had Ranch as the last word. i dont know the name (im so bad) Anyways we walked around there and did some shopping and goofed around a lot in the area.  Then later that night me and nick and mitchell all layed down in our hotel room (my parents had a seperate room) and mitchell fell asleep right away and nick was making fun of mitchells really really shaggy hair so he went and got his electric razor and ran his hands trough mitchells hair and turned the razor on and mitchell woke up soooo fast and jumped about 2 feet in the air (and i am NOT exaggerating at all) and like screamed NOOOOO!!!!! It was hilarious and then my parents called us and told us to shut up b/c we were being obnoxcious lol.   Sunday!!  Well early on sunday morning I woke up because Maegan called me phone at 6:30!!! and woke me up..haha jk maegan i was already awake I promise. And anyways we got up and went to breakfast just in the resort to make it fast and when we did we met this family who is also from Texas so we were talking and stuff and she asked my mom if she had lived in Texas all her life and she said no and that we were all pretty much born and raised in St.Louis and she told us that she could tell we were from somewhere else because of our accents. Excuse me...I am the BIGGEST midwest fan and stuff esspecially since my boys the cardinals are like kicking everyones butts right now and stuff but we do NOT have accents!! I say geaaagraphy normal! lol jk I seriously dont get it though! Will someone please explain it to me After breakfast we went straight to the beach and were there until like4or5 and i got the BEST IRISH TAN!! its nice and red and pink! Its soo attractive. My right forearm got it soo bad too where my cast was. Who would have guessed that 12 weeks in a cast would make your arm sensitive to the sun..hmmm. Well yea i got scorched! My forearm even stated blistering but then they all disappeared so its all good even though its kinda discusting looking still. But on the bright side of this day when we were walking back into the hotel there was this kid who looked around my age and he was soooo totally hott!!! i mean like gorgeus!! he and his family were just checking in and i felt like going up to him and saying no need i have my own bed andim very lonely!! but then the tram thingy came and my parents wanted to catch it so i had to go. :'(  Monday!!  This day was AMAZING!!! We woke up and got dressed and all got in the car right away and drove to the volcanoes and of course it was POURING DOWN RAIN! we got totally soaked but we still did some cool things. Like its about a 2 hour drive to the volcanoes and then we went through a lava tube and the devestation trail and all that neat stuff and then at night we went on this 3 mile trail to see the lava flow into the ocean and it is just amazing!! We have it on video now and if anyone wants to see it feel free to ask b/c it is a sight to see. I have never seen anything like it before. My shoes got kinda scuffed and are a little black in spots from all the lava rocks we had to climb on but it was well worth it. It was just exseptional!! You could see all the lava flowing down the volcano and then when it hit the water this big thing of steam would come up and you could see the glow of the red, yellow, and orange for miles! I though Pearl Harbor was really interesting when we saw that 4 years ago on Oahu but that has nothing on Mount Kilauea!  Tuesday!  We were completely dead and useless. Since the night before we had been on our feet all day and probably walked like 10 miles at the volcanoes our feet didnt want to move. We all slept in like a lot and had a really late lunch and just skipped breakfast and just hung out at the hotel and stuff. We like swam a little and kayaked at the hotel but other than that we just relaxed and man did that feel good!!  That night was a riot too. Me and my brothers all stayed up pretty late and my parents just crashed in their room. Mitchy kinda fell asleep a little early (of course) and me and Nick went channel surfing and found Bug Juice on the Disney Channel and we both just sat and laughed the WHOLE TIME!! And once Mitchy woke up from us laughing he joined in too. One of the girls said like the girls were "jumping out of their skin" and then they show the girls and they dont even look excited about it. And just the stupidest things set us off. It was one of the mostfun and themost stupidnights!  Wendsday!  Our last day... We basically got up and packed up our stuff and the guys came and loaded our car and we had our whole day to shop because our plane wasnt until 10:30pm so we shopped ans shopped. Me and my mom had time to go into the Louis Vuiton Store and Coach and all those fun stores!! And my dad said I could get my coach purse that I want soo bad but they didnt have it there. i was soo pissed!!!! Then we went to dinner to this place right on the ocean which was just gorgeus!!! And so were the waiters let me tell you! The one we had was to die for and he was only like 18 (hehe only).   Leaving on a Jet Plane!! That night we finally boarded at 10:30 but it was well worth it let me tell you! The first flight from Hawaii to LA was kinda boring I mean I sat next to my mom and acctually slept for like the whole 5 hours!! I was soo happy and so after that we had an hour and a half and since my dad flies ALL THE TIME we got to go into the admirals club and hang out there for a while and get on computers and watch tv and stuff so that was nice but what was really nice was what was in store for me!! Me and Mitchy were grouped together b/c the other seats were by the exit and we werent old enough so we were sitting and waiting for the person who would be sitting next to me and then he comes...... DUN DUN DUN!!! but no it was far from that! He was FINE!! So it was a nice surprise!! And so we got to talking and stuff because we were both pretty bored and he asked if i was flying by myself because he was because he was and wasvisiting his cousin who lives in McKinney and stuff and he ended up being 16 and his name was Davidand lives in LA!! Rich Boy?? hmm He was just so sweet and Mitchell saw us talking and eventually we both got to sleep and are asleep for like an hour. After we are off the plane I ask Mitchell if I fell on him (Mitchell that is)when I was asleep because I tend to move my head a lot I guess when I sleep and he said "no but you fell on that kid" and I started freaking! I was like are you serious!! And I thought I was saved when I thought he was a sleep too and he said he was asleep until I fell on him!Right now I still dont know if he is lying or not but I think he is. I am kinda freaked though!! But its not like Ill see him again so I guess its ok but he was just sooooo fine!!!! grrrr!!! Why did I have to fall asleep?!? lol   Well thats all for now i love you  heather
