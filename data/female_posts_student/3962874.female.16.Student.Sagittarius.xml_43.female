Something I noticed: My name has been mentioned once in very small print on one of their sites. Dude. Do I not write about people like they are my friends? Yes I do, we have fun together and I consider them very good friends, return the favor ladies? I'm just not good enough am I? Oh well your fucking loss! I still love you. Sort of. Well, we'll have to see about that. Oh well, you can obviously tell by the lack of adventures in my blogs that I don't do much other than sit around at home. My life sucks. But there isn't much I can do about it, as far as I know. Maybe there is. When I figure it out I'll let you know.
