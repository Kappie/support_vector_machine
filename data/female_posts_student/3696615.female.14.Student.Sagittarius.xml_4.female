My social studies teacher was a republican, and she even said "republicans support big business, while democrats support the people." Then why be republican? Why support a party that is more interested in oil than education? Anyway, back to George Bush..  He is one of the worst presidents we've had - if not the worst. He caused the largest deficit in the history of our country, then when confronted about it, all he said was "well, they're wrong." Very smart Georgey boy. Got any facts to back that up? Sheesh.  Most of the times he cant even form complete sentences, and has the worst grammar ever.  "Rarely is the question asked, is our children learning?"  Is they George? Is they? ;-)  He caused an unnecessary war, that 50 percent of america disagreed with, as well as the United Nations, and even George Bush's own father!!  What the fuck could he possibly be thinking? Is he that desperate for war and power?   I'm also tired of people complaining that both George Bush and John Kerry are bad, and so they're just not  going to vote. Think people, just take the time to use your brains. You know... those things in your skulls there. Which one is the better candidate? Which one is against the war? Which one can form complete sentences?  I also wish people would desist from voting for Nader. Whats the point? Hes supported by 5 percent of america. Obviously he wont win the election. Is he there for an ego boost or what? To me hes a little dipshit who should get his ass out of the race, and try not to screw up the election and bring Bush to power yet again.  And why is it that good presidents get assasinated, and the most terrible live long lives? I mean, come on... Lincoln and Kennedy...  At least Reagan (whom I've never liked)  has gone on to a better place (if you can count the underworld as a better place. I certainly can. We've screwed up the "upper" world :-P )  Ok, I'm done ranting.
