Getting Michael Jackson arrested less than a year before the presidential election is a stroke of genius for the re-election of George W. Bush.     "When it comes to news coverage, the 24-hour news networks, major newspapers, local stations--everyone--will be focused on that. Who's going to pay attention to the whiny Democrats and their complaints about Iraq (especially since the economy is improving)--when the Michael Jackson trial is going on? Talk about a feeding frenzy!   A year from now as people are getting ready for Thanksgiving and Christmas, they're going to pause and say, "Wasn't there supposed to be an election or something this year? Oh, well."   Don't know how Rove pulled it off, but it's brilliant."   Obviously, for anyone who is offended, the above is meant tongue-in-cheek.  And for anyone who doesn't read or subscribe the Opinion Journal's Best of the Web should do so immediately.  It gives a little summary of the news of the day in a humorous, albeit conservative, manner.
