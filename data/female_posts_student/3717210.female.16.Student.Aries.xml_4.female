Well, I am pretty sure they are, this next weekend they are leaving for the weekend to discuss things. My mom doesn't want to fight around us anymore, and I thank her for that. I hate it when they fight. I just hope they get this done and over with because I am sick and tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home. Anyways, I was at my cousins graduation party today. She obviously doesn't have many friends, because it mainly consisted of family, friends of the family, and a little group of her friends. I almost feel bad for her. Almost. Anyways, I seen my father there and I gave him his late, late, late father's day card. He didn't mind. Next weekend while my mom and step-father are gone I am going to go to my dad's and we are going to put new brake pads and stuff on my car. I am sort of excited. We don't do much together and it is nice to sort of develope a relationship with him. Man I really need a job if I am going to keep up with this stuff. Babysitting pays well, but not well enough to pay for insurance, my cell phone bill, and then car crap plus gas money while having anything left over to save. Jeez...I am hoping to get a job more around when school starts because then all the people who wanted a job for the summer only will leave and then the people going back to college will leave, giving me more opportunities...I hope. Wow it is getting late. I am tired, so I think I am going to hit the sack. Guten Nacht!
