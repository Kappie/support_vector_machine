Man charged with swinging gator at girlfriend      Florida woman alleges 3-foot pet alligator hit her at least once     The Associated Press Updated: 2:00 p.m.ET July17, 2004     PORT ORANGE, Fla. - A man hit his girlfriend with a 3-foot alligator and threw beer bottles at her during an argument in the couple’s mobile home, authorities said. David Havenner, 41, was scheduled for a bond hearing Saturday on misdemeanor charges of battery and possession of an alligator.      The alligator, which Havenner had been keeping in his bathtub, was turned over to Florida wildlife officials. Nancy Monico, 39, told investigators that Havenner beat her with his fists, then grabbed the alligator and swung it at her as she tried to escape, sheriff’s spokesman Gary Davidson said. She said the animal hit her at least once. She also told authorities that Havenner threw empty beer bottles at her, Davidson said. Havenner’s version of the story differed. He told investigators that Monico bit his hand because she was upset that they had run out of alcohol.     © 2004 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
