"you're going down like a sweet muffin!!!" then after that movie, we snuck into the day after tomoro. i would describe that movie as intense. coz it was. and it was also super good!! right now i have a headache. ow. today me and shan got recruited to be "operators" we had to call like 50 people and invite them to some thing. yeah. it was great fun. now i am going to drink some water and eat some food and then go upstairs.
