Anyway, they had the cake and all the other desserts and the polkas(which by the way are polish) AND they had the Greek dances where everyone dances around in a circle, or something.  I went outside when all that fun started.  Before all the dancing though, the best man gave about a ten minute speech, but it was well worth it.  The bar was only serving Bud and Bud light, amongst all the 'hard' liquor.  I saw some bottles of Miller Light and went on a mission to find where they were coming from.  Seems as though the wedding party had a cooler full of them from the Transpo Trolley(instead of renting a limo, they got the city transpo trolley to drive them around downtown south bend)  So being the good friend that I am of the bride, I got me some beer worth drinking for the rest of the night.  Good food, great company and an even better kisser made the night.     Sports Report  Looks like the wooden broom took a shit.
