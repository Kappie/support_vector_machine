She sits there babbling about icons and codes just expecting me to know what they are! and then she has the gall to make fun of me when I say I want to curl my hair all 80's style. Pshaw! So here I sit, trying to figure out what codes and icons and affiliates are. I think i'm beginning to understand.  Shannon has just started explaining: "Well you know how on the INTERNET you go to a WEBSITE and they have AFFILLIATES. In other words, contacts and things. Friends of the website if you will. You know how the AFILLIATES have litte icon do hickies. ICONS are buttons which most often have pictures and pretty designs."  Yes, Shannon I understand. That did not make me feel like a retard at all.  Well, now I have just made an icon. Now I have no idea what to do with it. I will just sit and wait for a nice explanation from Shannon. She says she needs my URL. Well at least I know what that is. She is going to put my icon/afilliate/URL/ whatever the hell it may be called onto her website for me. Well how nice of her.  I am going to go fiddle with blog things and see what's what.  -Bailey-
