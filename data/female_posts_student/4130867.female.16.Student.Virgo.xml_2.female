Nothing special i guess. nothing happened so far and nothing will to probably. just finished my physics paper today and I am that damn glad man~ Ive always been very bad in physics but today's paper wasn't THAT terrible actually. Ive expected something worse but luckily it ain't that tough. but lets not be over confidence though. I'm sure it wouldnt turn out good, as it had always been. gRrr how i hate physics and additional maths. in da future i guess i wouldnt be doing much of a blogging anymore, I'll be so busy in the next few months. exams, exams and daT biG daY in November. my life is now a much more plain, calm, peaceful road. no more series of never-ending dramas going on haha~ at least not for now. Im just so super sick of everything that happened in the past before. u people can just leave me alone.
