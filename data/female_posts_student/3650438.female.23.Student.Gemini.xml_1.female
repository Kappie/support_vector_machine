I'm a weblog virgin, so go easy... :) Well Ian and I decided that we have the coolest names in the weblog universe, which I have to say is true.  So let me explain the origin of my blog name.  About five years ago, I had a roommate named Quinn.  We worked together and a friend from work began calling us Quinn Shady and Slim Katie (this was around the time that Eminem's second album came out, and it was all over the radio). Hence, the kick-ass name.
