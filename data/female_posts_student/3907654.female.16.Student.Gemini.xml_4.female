Mom's in madison today and i'm supposed to be cleaning the house, but i'd really  rather not.. so who knows! Stephan's camping until  Sunday=(  Which means i really REALLY don't have much to do!        Last night I got a nice little  unexpected  ((except for the call 15  minutes before hand)) visit from a good friend I havent seen since February!! That was quite nice! It made me realize that I miss my old crew..*sigh* So I tried to talk to +msr+ today but as soon as i IMed her, she  put an away message up,  but I kept talking thinking she might put it down when she realized i was trying to talk to her-- no such luck. i basically just told her i wanted to hang out sometime and that it'd be great if she called, but somehow i  doubt  that'll happen =-/               ah well, i should probably get going-- i s'pose i'll do some laundry for my mom!=)  [peace.n.love]
