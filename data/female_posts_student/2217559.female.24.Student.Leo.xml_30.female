The Shell Sisters and I are going out today to a resort about 20 minutes outside of Mazatlan. Apparently the whole staff of the ship tries ot make it out there to play volleyball, drink coronas and just veg for about 3 hours. The ship leaves at 5 so we have ot be back by 4:30pm.  Yesterday was awesome. I met th emost amazing couple at the beginning of this cruise and I was able to give them a private bridge tour with the Captain yesterday afternoon. The woman, very attractive, in her mid forties is a pilot. She has been flying planes for over 25 years. And her boyfriend, well he's a photographer for Better Homes  Gardens. Just awesome - really awesome people who really liked me a lot. After the private bridge tour (which i will discuss momentarily), they invited me back to the royal suite for a couple glasses of wine. We sat and tlake dofr baout an hour and half and it was just awesome. Wonderful people that I most definitely will stay in touch with.   The bridge tour was the first I have given. It was very cool though as it took place right at sailing so we were able to see how the ship gets moving and all the commands needed to get clearance. Inside the bridge, greek is spoken. The navigational officer took us around each side of the bridge and told us specifics about our ship and it's operations. It was very neat. Not to mention the view! Next time you are on a cruise, A) Find the social hostess and schmooze her (that's me) B) Ask the social hostess or other officers on board for a private bridge tour.  C) Ask to dine at the Captain's table. If you get to do any of these things while on board, you are a member of the elite few who have.   After visiting with the great folks in the Royal Suite, I received a call from the women in the penthouse. They invited me up to hang out and have ANOTHER glass of wine. I accepted and spent about an hour hanging with the two of them. It was really fun. I had to go to come down to my office and have a meeting with my hotel manager after that. It was fine though. I wans't tanked or anything. I must say we have had some wonderful guests on board for this cruise. Definitely met a few people that I will stay in touch with. Can you imagine this every two weeks? Meeting more and more people? Wow. One group leader I met with earlier in the cruise, gave me 15 baseball caps and a $75 gift certificate to a fancy restaurant in San Diego. When these people are nice, they are VERY nice.   Well, not much more news other than that. This week has been pretty relaxed with having all of the ports in a row. I haven't worked tha tmany hours but tomorrow will be about 13 though. I have my elegant tea party, formal night and the midnight grand buffet where I have to give my speech. That speech I give is really long and I have to pronounce all of these french chef names. It's fun but I have to ask them to prounounce their names a hundred before I get up there.   Lots of love and wishes for a great Christmas.   Shell
