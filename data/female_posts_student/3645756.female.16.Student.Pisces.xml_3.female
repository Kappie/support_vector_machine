Most all of my family is Baptist also, except for some family in Ohio they're Catholic...but I don't hold that against them...jk.  I dont't have anything against Catholics or any other religion for that matter...I may not agree with it but I've come to learn that what I think means absolutly nothing to everyone else...but that's ok because it means the world to me...as does my religion...I dont know what I would do with out it.
