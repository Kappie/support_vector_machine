I'm not in mood to write more. It has been hours and I still feel it's just only another bad dream, and I'm going to wake up soon.  But it's really not. It's a reality. I must face it. He must, she must. I don't want to describe who 'he' is, and who 'she' is. Life goes on, life never stops only for waiting. Failure is only a delayed success. Don't you ever give up.  *Ganbatte for 2 persons i love much!*  [ m i t a ]
