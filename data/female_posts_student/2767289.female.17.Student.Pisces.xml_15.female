I get paranoid that they might fall asleep behind the wheel, so I just sit in the front and keep them company.   It's soo uncomfortable trying to sleep in the car!  But then again... once you're past the "tired" stage... you can't fall asleep anyway... so yeah... I've got humongous bags under my eyes!   So the visiting those people in CA wasn't all that bad.  They're kinda... well... STALE!!!  I've only enjoyed the company of like 5 or 6 people(out of like 45 that were there).  Three of which were grownups and the others were lil kids.  There's this little boy... probably around 9 or 10, he's soo adorable!  We were saying our good-byes to each other for like half an hour! He said he loves me! Awww... Sucks I didn't take a picture, though!   *** I missed school today... yet again... We came back at 6:30am.  I was tired out of my freakin mind!!!  And I wasn't planning on going with blood shot eyes!  Geez I hate that!  I hope I won't get a damn B in English just cause I missed a few attendance points.   This whole attendance crap is STUPID!  Like in typing... I was typing OVER 55wpm!  I was doing 75wpm!!!  And I got a freakin B in that class because I missed 4 days of it!  Goodness!  So, what was the whole point of the class then?  To improve your typing?  or to just BE there?  It's ridiculous!   And then there's that whole lecture on if you're gonna be absent, notify the instructor...  Notify MY ASS!!!  What's the point of that anyway??  It's not like they're gonna "not count" it.  I used to do that.  I e-mailed my teacher and told her I had surgery, so I can't come in the next day... And??  I still got a B for missing that one stupid day!   Anywho... happy thoughts, happy thoughts, happy thoughts........ 1)That little boy I met in CA (don't remember his name) 2)Serge said I'm smart (it's an honor getting a compliment from him) 3)Got 4 hours of sleep this morning in my oh-so comfortable bed! :-)  Well... off to work out!  Carpe Diem!
