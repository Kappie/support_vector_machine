It won't be delayed... and delayed... and delayed. I promise.  You might tell me to ask my dad to send the vital image to me but... if you knew my dad and computers, you wouldn't tell me to ask that. I mean, we're talking about the man who asked me the following while installing a program from a CD-rom: "Does the CD have to be inside all the time?" My dad's great tho. He's learned all he needs to know about computing (an invoice program for his company and information search from internet) at 50. My god, I hope I'll be a lot like him at 50! I just won't bother to ask him for things he doesn't know how to do, like attachements to e-mail... or how to find the right image from the labyrinth of my files on his computer.  Hmm... I might as well get back to work now that I have the appetite for it!  P.S. Don't expect too much please... It's going to be very simple, based pretty much on my last existing website. Like I said, my brain isn't in the mood for creating new things :P
