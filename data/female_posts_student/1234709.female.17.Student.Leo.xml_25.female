I'll try to keep this in an enlightened point of view, but somehow I doubt I'll be able to keep it up.  Summer's made it's entrance and I'm left with the empty feelings like I could have done better in school, and in life this year. I remember making goals last summer, and I don't feel like I've accomplished any of them. As hard as it is to explain, but I made a goal to find myself this year. And throughout the year I've felt like I had, but then something would happen and I'd be left right where I started. Searching. And the problems I've had with myself I've aimed to overcome, and in the process of doing so, I failed and lost something that could have been beautiful.  This is going to sound cliché and corny, but I don't know who I am. If someone were to describe to you, they'd be able to go as far as, "She's blonde, listens to Modest Mouse religiously and makes corny Jewish jokes." Shouldn't there be more? There probably is, but I can't seem to let it out for everyone but a select few to see. "She laughs at herself a lot as well." I feel like everything about me is insignificant and not even worth mentioning. I miss being younger, back when things were so much simpler; I was content just riding my bicycle and playing on the monkey bars. Fuck this cliché shit.  I feel like starting something new. Maybe an art project or something. I'll dedicate it to this year. All the memories from 2003/2004. I'm going to miss all you graduates. Another thing I'm going to miss is math every day with Fraser. Fuck those were good times. We used to goof off and tease eachother so much in that class, but eventually the teasing wore off and we became closer friends. I hope I never lose that. Ever.
