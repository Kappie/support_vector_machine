Or just ignore them because the one person is just gonna babble and not make sense and the other person, well he already cleared shit up but it's still just strange to me. Sorry guys, I don't like using names. I would explain more but I can't. And I can't just change names because the person would know if it was about them or not. But I have faith again. I didn't do anything stupid. I worked on my communication skills.  And I'm happy again! WHOA!  I'm very proud of myself for this all. YAY! Talk to you all tomorrow. It's funny how I'm back to normal after crying all night. Alex told me I'm just a teenage girl so I guess it all makes sense. But it would have been funnier if I was PMSing...Oh well! Sweet dreams~
