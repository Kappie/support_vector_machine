Every one (I'm talking to peeps on blogger who don't know what's going on in the outside world (IZZY)) go to the saneasakitten site and see the cool thing on the left! :) It worked! Ooh I'm so proud! AHHH! I just hit a problem...if we get too many it err might kind of fill up cause it's not in a table... oh well! :) I'm just happy with what I've done so far! So now we've got... a chatterbox thing, comments and a poll, and e-mail addy's! HA! And every one thought they would get away with not telling us it was 2050! ...Yeah...I really should go to sleep!
