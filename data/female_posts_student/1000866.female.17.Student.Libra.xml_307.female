Haha, weird stuff, right? Anyway, one is black, and so so pretty, and the other is white with a gold head. They're fan tail fish. I went with Kelly to get them! So exciting! I didn't tell my parents until after I got home, but they didn't care. It was my money, and I'm keeping them in my room. YaY!!!! It's so cool. I named the black one Theodore (in honor of the poor Caseville fish who had a tragic death) and the white one with the gold head Genevieve. Hehe. Such fun.
