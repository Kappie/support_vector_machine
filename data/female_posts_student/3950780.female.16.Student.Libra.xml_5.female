When i got home i went to my friend Bekah's house and before i left my dad told me go to bekahs then go to the bayview then go back to her house and call if any plans change. well i left bekahs house around 7 pm and headed towards the bayview. well, we drove past and it was really busy with no place to park, so i called my dads cellphone, no one answered, then i called home, noone answered, then i called my moms cellphone, no one answered, then i called my dads cellphone and left a message telling him we were gonna go eat at elevated. so there, i called and said what i was gonna do. well, i always park at swains no matter what im doing in town, cuz its a pain parking anywhere downtown. so bekah and i walked to elevated. we got jelly beans instead of eating anything. we started walking back up to my car when her parents walked outta the belmont. we talked for a little bit and said we were going back to her house, which we did. as soon as i walked in her doormy dad calls me and tells me to get home right away, cuz i didnt call or something like taht, well i told him to check his voicemail and all the other caller id's at the house and my moms cellphone. well he went quiet for a minute then was all ' umm...get your butt home RIGHT NOW.' and started making up some other excuse about me being in trouble. well i headed home and then got a talking to and my parents started saying i never called and that bekahs parents were furious with me (all of which are NOT true) and stupid stuff. I got my car takin away till the 20th then along with that restricted driving privliges and crap. but oh well...it will all soon be over cuz im almost 17. i hate stupid ppl and they all keep breeding. oh well. thats my story and tune in next time for the tragic life of a runner who never was...lol.
