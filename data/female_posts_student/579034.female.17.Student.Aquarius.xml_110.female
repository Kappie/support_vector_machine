Everything has been done on faith and on a commitment to excellence an on a commitment to each other. If you asked me what this team means to me I'll tell you it means one, dedication and two, family. Where people care about you. Not just cause you win or things go well but because they generally care. Being apart of this team means you know the standards and are willing to make the commitment. Last year they said this team would never win again. A while back we had a group of girls who wanted to win but didn't know how. Then we progressed to a point where we had a group of girls who wanted to win, knew how to win. Now we are at the point where we have a great group of girls who want to win and know how to win but don't always exhibit it. That's a thing of the past. We aren't going out there defending anything. We are going to fight for it, to compete for it. Nobody gives you anything in this world. People can give you money, they can give you wealth, and fame. But the one thing no body in this world can give you is respect. They can't give you the self respect you have for yourself, the way you run your race, the way you believe, and the way you do things. This is a sport of respect. You are the SJS track team. You are special. You represent all those who came before you and all those who are gonna come after you. Girls, this team has a spirit, the spirit is within all of us. Girls, all you gotta do is listen and believe in that spirit. And remember girls, today's the day we're gonna win.  **Yea, well, we got 4th.... but I was proud of us... we had a good run girls... and, well, Tech deserved it... one day we'll be strong again...**
