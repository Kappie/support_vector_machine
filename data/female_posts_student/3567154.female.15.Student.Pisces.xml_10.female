I love being here it is so relaxing and a nice envrionment. My dad was teasing me about Jake and Kristelle it was funny. My dad is really weird. Him and my mom have beem devorced sence i was like two so it doesn't really affect me that he isn't around me all the time. He is moving at the end of the year ,i belive that is when he is moving. I will be sad when he moves but i just keep thinking about after he moves how i get to go spend the summers down there in South Carolina. O well not like i can stop him from moving.   Drivers training is boring! I don't get to drive untill like next Thrusday and I am sad. Last time i drove i almost ran two stop signs. LOL. I didn't mean to, I couldn't see behind the cars. O well i havn't hit anyone yet. YET being key word. LOL. Nah i won't hit neone i am a good driver. I think.  peace out,
