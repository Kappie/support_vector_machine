It was absolutely wonderful, and I'm very picky, so that says alot. Well, of course, they don't have my size. But I swear to God I will wear that dress or I'll go naked. I'm hoping they can specialy order my size. Because GAH I need that dress. The one size I tried on was just a BIT too small, and all the other sizes were huge.  But it's so pretty.... :(  Oh, also this:    Well, I'll talk to you crazies later. Leave me something in my chatterbox, k? Adios.
