"Both son. God is both."   After awhile the kid comes again and asks, "Daddy, is God black or white?"  "Both son, both." "Daddy, does God love children?"   "Yes son, he loves all children."   The child returns a few minutes later and says, "Daddy, is Michael Jackson God?"     Anyways! today was THA' B0MB! val, xiongster, beng, edwin, meiyi, yati and myself gave ourselves a common surname because we belonged to the similar 'family'! so now we're called the " dabeaches ". don't ask how we came up with that name, we just did. we headed to siloso beach for a kick-butt outing! it was mad..you can read it at val's OD too. we soaked in the sea and played silly coconut bomb games. then val and i played some kayaking water-polo(?) game with a buncha cuuute boys. yes an emphasis on the cute. we were kayaking around the area when we accidentally bumped into their kayaks so later they approached and asked if we wanted to play. at first we ignored them and kayaked away. haha. but since they asked a coupla' times, we obliged. teehee. and! kana beng's super power sand ball! * bish !* oouch..haha. val and i did brainless stunts such as impersonating kate winslet and leonardo dicarprio in a titanic scene. edwin and all also dug a hee-uge hole and burried val in it as an xmas gift for her! haha. her entire body ached so badly after a bashing. that poor soul. oohs you had no idea how much i enjoyed myself today :D
