It was me, Caroline, Emily, Nicole, Shannon, Lindsey, Zach Cap, Stratty, Ryan, and Josh. We swam and ate and it was a lot of fun! And Mom, Virginia, and Charles left for Pt. Clear so I'm just with my dad!  Saturday - Went to Cape with Aunt Rebel. We went to Best Buy and bought CD's (I got The O.C. soudtrack which is really good), saw "The Terminal", and saw Holt's band at Broussard's. They were awesome! Got home around midnight that night.  Sunday - OMG what a BLAST! JP's 16th Birthday party! There were soooo many people there and it was so freakin fun! The police had to tell us to turn the music down haha but it was a blast! Defintely the most fun I've had in a long while. Austin brought us home and then Sarah spent the night which was fun too.  Man, what an AWESOME weekend!
