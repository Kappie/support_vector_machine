Night's movies!They've got a specific set of approved questions to ask, certain places to be, things to say, and they CANNOT AT ANY TIME make eye contact with M. Night.Everything was so strict, you'd think the Sci-Fi crew was interviewing the president! Then, later on, M. Night and the crew go out and eat some dinner, go to a bar, etc. and all of a sudden M.Night is this happy, perky, social butterfly talking and letting people take his photos. He went from sheltered recluse, to Mr. Popular. It was like he was a different person! Even Johnny Depp (oooo teeheehee *-drooling-*) was involved. He wanted to play a part in the movie, "Signs", but they were going to make him sign a contract saying that he couldn't say a word of anything that went on there. That was a little freaky, but THEN he had all these quotes and stuff, and it all got really weird, so he said Forget it, and Mel Gibson (hahahahaha he's a dope XD) took the part instead. I was like, "Woah, even Johnny Depp got involved with this!" But I was glad he didn't take the "Signs" part cause I thought that movie sorta sucked....it was ok though, not the greatest. Supposedly, M.Night "died" from drowning. A deer fell through the ice in a river, and M. Night walked out to save it, fell through the ice, and "drowned". His mother then cradled him in her arms and walked into the river, drowning herself as well, as Sci-Fi put it, "Bringing him to his maker in person". So supposedly, M. Night isn't even alive! I think that's a crock, but I don't deny he might have "connections" with spirits or ghosts as some people describe them. I  do  believe in spirits and such, and it  is  possible he might have some connections with them. I guess you never know! ^_^
