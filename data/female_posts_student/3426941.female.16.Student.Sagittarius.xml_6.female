Eponine, the fragile waif,translucent angel, innocent criminal, stood at the corner watching, waiting for him to come. She knew he would After all, no man inher father's gang would dare break a promise that involved a profit. Her courage was fed only at the thoguht of sweet Azelma being fed. Her sister was worse off than she, less street wise, and more susceptable to her father's thievery.  Standing, facing away from the wall, she pressed her back up against the stone and felt the vertebra of her too frail body bump the hard surface through the thin, stained chemise she wore. She stood like that in the mist, wishing she could shrink herself and become a pard of the wall, become invisible.  "Please don't come, please dont come. Dear God if you remain with me, please don't come.  But of course he did.  Eponine saw the tall figure approaching long before, perhaps he even saw her. A flicker of fear surged through her. "Run, now! Get away. He hasn't seen you yet!"But duy was duty, and money was money, no matter how dirty, no matter the bargain.  He came swaggering toward her and smiled sickly baring ugly yellow teeth within a thin mouth, a sharp jaw covered with stubble, and stringy, greasy hair. She knew him. Montparnasse. Would that his name be spit upon, damned forever. "Ah, my lovely." he drawled drunkenly swaying close to her. "What brings you here all... alone at night?" Staggering he pressed one dirty hand against the wall above her head and leaned down to her so that she could smell the foul stench of cheap ale on his breath.  "You know why I am here. I am here for the payment. I hae my father's money to repay you. And I am not your lovely. I belong to no one." She retorted, her bravery surprised even her, a poor street rat, though it was true what she had said. She had no one.  "Impudent brat!" He spat. "How dare you show such insolence to me. No wonder your father speaks of you with such distaste. CLearly, you are good for nothing better than to steal, or to beg." he grabbed her roughly and shoved her against the wall by her small shoulders. "I will get what I came for, Mademoiselle."  "Here's your money. Take it and leave me." she said, but her voice betrayed her fear. This man, though inebriated, could kill her if he wanted to.  "I'll get my money, I will. But first I'll have you."  Montparnasse grabbed her by the waist and carried her into the alley. She tried to scream, but his cold hand covred her mouth, claiming her cries so no one could hear. Kicking him did no good, for he shoved his wight onto her usinghis size as a weapon.  Tears formed in Eponine's eyes as she realized with horror what this evil wretch of a man was about to do. With prayers to anyone who would listen, she closed her eyes and succumbed to her fate, thinking only of the man she loved and knowing that though she could never have lived up to what he wouldhave wanted, now she would never be good enough for hmm. She was tainted, dirty, and defiled. The night seemed to go on and on, though she wanted the sun more than anything.  ******************************************************************  Le Baron Marius Pontmercywas walking home from le fafe Musian in the chilly evening. He noted the mist in the air and the smell of tallow as he walked beneath the dim streetlights. The meeting that nght had gone well. It seemed as if their little band of simple, curious students were finally becoming and organized band of strong soldiers.  As he walked,listening to the clicking of his shoes in the darknes, he heard another sound, but quiet faint. Looking about,he tried to discern where it was coming from. I sounded like a small wounded animal. "In Paris?" he thought aloud. There couldn't be such a thing.  Finding it was coming from across the street on his left, he slowly, cautiously approached the alleyway which was shrouded in mist and cloked in the darkness. There he saw a small figure who appeared to be a young girl.  "Mademoiselle?"he inquierd, softly so as not to startle the child.  She turned adn he realized that it was not a child at all, but his friend, Eponine. He was immediately aware of her tear stained face, bloodshot eyes, and the new bruises on her neck and shoulders were frigteningly fresh.  "M'sieur Marius!" she cried, shielding herslef with her arms and rising to booted feet.
