Oh, and my parents telling me mind the clock since I am getting older and the likelihood being able to change decreases. Well, I am switching blog hosts again... for the second time since March. If the chameleon actually made it on the Chinese Zodiac, I should be born that year.  What prompted my decision to change? Well, letters from colleges and extremely expensive summer programs and death of my band director and jasmine blooming and a mix of a viral infection and allergies -- just life in general. And since it's summer, I thought a change might be good for my sanity... knowing there is still something I can control in my own life is always a plus.  So this is just a rather wordy introduction.
