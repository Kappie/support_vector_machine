"the sims superstar". the main reason i bought it is coz i found this coupon on the net on the sims site that was buy one get one free rebate type thingy. so im gonna send it in and they'll send me a free expansion pack of my choice. yay.  i woke up so early today. at like 9:00. went to church, and only now came home. i got new shoes, so thats a plus, but i have a headache and im tired like whoa. time to play sims: the unrealistic world that i created and control that i wish i live in.
