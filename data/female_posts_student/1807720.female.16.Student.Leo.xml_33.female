And omg we had a sub. for Chem today, now that I think of it I had a sub. for all of my classes except for one.  Anyways the sub for chem didn't even know what he was doing and it took like half an hour to balance an equation and then he explained to us percent difference the wrong way, he was actually explaining percent yield but I don't think he knew that.  Then he was talking about SATP but on the board it was written as STAP...LOL!!  I got the biggest laugh out of that and well then he was like "Oh and can someone explain to me how I would figure out so and so kinda problem" and then someone answered that they would use Gravimetric Stoichiometry and he was like "Well I don't understand that."  I hope my actual chem teacher is there tommorow cause I don't want another class with someone who doesn't have a clue about things.  My chem teacher is actually pretty good, smart, and nice.  Sometimes I underestimate her I guess.  And well I have gained 10 pounds in four days.  Scary as it sounds it is true.  I can't stop eating.  When I think about chem I eat.  When I think about not eating I just want to eat more.  Chocolate bars, timbit things from timmys, and I even had a doughnut tonight.  I can't stop but I want to.  I used to be sooooo good with the healthy eating but then everyone is like "vanessa eat this, eat that" and now I can't stop.  I am out of control.  I don't want to starve myself but tommorow I really can't eat ANY junk.  I am starting to worry.  Before I just wanted to be thin and on some level I still would like to be thin but I am more worried at being at a healthy weight.  I just want to be healthy and yeah thin would be nice too.
