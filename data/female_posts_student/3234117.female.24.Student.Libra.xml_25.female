I was really looking forward to it as I hadn't been to Six Flags since Fall of 98 when I went with my boyfriend at the time to Holiday in the Park.  I really have great memories of this place, but none are just quite like the ones I have made today.  It was hot, I felt sick, I got all shaken up, I got a headache, I was sweaty, and the list continues.  Not only that, but did the seats get smaller or did I get bigger?  Christina and I are not big people, but let me just say on some of those rides I felt like sardines being packed in a can.  I also felt all my organs being rattled around.  Experiencing this, I realized why "grown-ups" never were too interested in riding the rides.  Who would want to subject themselves to this torture?  Okay maybe I'm being dramatic, but my memories of my past times at Six Flags did not hold up.  Maybe it was the corn dog we ate?  I will say this, if you do endeavour out and want to try Six Flags, you must ride the Titan and you must ride it BEFORE any food enters your stomach cavity.   urlLink The Titan , by far, is the best ride in the park.  Here is the link, you should check it out.  I would avoid Flash back, the Judge Roy Scream, the Texas Giant, and the Mine Train if you want to avoid back pain or getting jerked around.  I would also avoid the Superman ride unless you enjoy being twirled around like a cork screw.  I actually liked Superman despite blacking out for a moment.  Just kidding, it's not that bad.    Anyway my message is this:  Memories of fond times at an amusement park might not hold up presently.  Unless you like to sweat.
