I thought that was hilarious.  No biggy since I am on the computer at home all the time.  I am sure only Shannon Will notice, me not emailing her all day. But don't worry shannon, school will start school and i'll be online during the day again. This should make your workday go faster. Well my position, kinda sucks, but hey it's a job. I really hate greeting people. Went to the gym after work, felt kinda lazy today, so I didn't lift any weight, just 30min of cardio and some ab work. Heard from Christine that she is leaving floriday tomorrow night. Gave her directions to my house. I haven't actually talk to her on the phone for a while. WoW She is getting a southern accent. If she pronounces Wisconsin, messed up I might have to hang up on her( Just kidding Chris) Well I have a lot to do today still cleaning up my guest room and bathroom for Chris. Plus I have to go grocery shopping, I plan on going out in Milwaukee this weekend with Christine since she is from Milwaukee, we might Wind up going on thursday To UW Whitewater bars, we both you to go there. Who know how fun it will be since it is summer.  But there is always something fun and cheap to do there. Get a hold of me If anyone wants to meet up this weekend, and meet my friend.
