It couldn't be that the two geographical locations, as far apart as they are, could share, say, macadamia nuts or waterfalls. No. The only thing this pathetic state has in common with tropical paradise are creepy, crunchy cockroaches.     I remember my stay in Oahu, even though I was only thirteen then. My dad paid for me and my sister to spend a week on the Islands, a way of getting me out of his hair for the summer. I had to have a chaperone, so he reluctantly bought my sister a ticket as well. Together we made the eight-hour plane voyage in first class, my sister giving me sips of her rum and coke the whole time, until I could no longer stay awake and passed out while watching that movie about the dogs who are trying to find their way home.     Our condo in Oahu overlooked a golf course and I could smell the sugarcane in the air. The condo was very nice on the inside, a little outdated with its 70s decor, but nice. However, we soon discovered why there was no food at all in the kitchen. The minute we left something sitting on the counter, a dozen cockroaches the size of tongue depressors would have it devoured before we could get to it.     My sister would scream and fly into a tizzy, but I really didn't care. At thirteen I had yet to develop a fear of a lot of things, including bugs. I rode dangerous rollercoasters, jumped off high-dives at waterparks, and watched scary movies while home alone. Cockroaches didn't faze me.     They certainly bother me now, though. Now that I have to live with them on a daily basis. I spent most of my childhood in urban apartment homes where there are so many pesticides that one never really has to worry about bugs. But now that I'm a homeowner in a more secluded area with trees and dirt roads, there are bugs galore. In fact, just yesterday I found a tarantula on my back porch. It was the third one I've seen this summer. But you know what? I didn't kill him, creepy as he was. Nope. I left him alive to go and eat the cockroaches.
