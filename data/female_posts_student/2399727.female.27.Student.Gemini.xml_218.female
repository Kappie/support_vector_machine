IOPs were good (15 and 14), the retinas are both attached and looking okay, and there was no other obvious defects to be concerned with.  He'll follow up with me again in six months and mildly chastized me for failing to call when I saw that massive amoeba-like floater that covered up to 50% of my eye a couple of weeks ago.  Seems that's significant, so at least I know that for the future.  I've been quiet lately because I have a ton of studying to do for my next term test (July 21); once I have that under control I'll say a little more.  More to come ...
