Having a great friend does not mean you will never argue, or have some rough times, regrets, or grudges.  Friendships are just like any other relationship.  Marriage, is not perfect.  Everyone knows that.  People fight, they go through stress.  Why then... Do we expect our friendships to be perfect?  Why is the mark of a "best friend" always, "someone you can tell anything to."  Maybe a better friend is the one you need to tell nothing to.  A friend can see you for all your faults, all your quirks, all your aggravating little flaws, but the definitive mark of a true friend, is the one person that sees all of that, knows all of that, but still holds on.  They don't do it for themselves, but for you.  I stopped one day and was shocked, "why are all these bad things happening, why are friendships so messed up!!?  How can I have so many broken, torn, friendships.  What could be wrong with me."  But then a great friend reminded me.  "The difference between them and me, is that they never took the time to really know you.  I have gotten to know you, to care about you."  And that, is the mark of an amazing human.  Lately I have found, the people closest to me, most important to me, aren't the people I am with 24/7, that know every one of my last secrets.  They are people that I have known, that I have drifted from, fought with, betrayed, the ones that grate my nerves, that make me scream!!!  But in the end, I love them, because I know who they are and what they are, that they are my friends.  I've made mistakes, I've treated friends like dirt.  Right now I ask, please forgive me for my own regrets.  To my many amazing friends of all the years And to every amazing friend I've ever lost, i hope you have found your "hero"too.  (b/c Don Quixote doesn't count)
