As to the spelling of "grammer," I think that's another nationality difference, same as "honour" and "color".   Actually, Jack, I've had very little chocolate today. One little serving of chocolate ice cream and that's it. Very abnormal for me. But at that point, I think I was still on my regular dose.      I must point out that there are worse ways to "go" than being hanged or being shot. Colonel O'Neill has found quite a few of them.  If anyone cares, the worst death I can think of is dehydration. Either that or acid. But I've done neither. (I would say obviously, but sometimes, that's not so obvious.)   Alright, Jack, I'm gonna have to disagree with you there. "The Great god of Oz"? Gimme a break!   Yes. All Jaffa should watch each Star Wars episode at least four times. I'll keep them company if they don't try to bite my head off first. Maybe I'll just happen not to mention that I'm a ... while around them.   Excuse me... "Counciling and medication"? I'm perfectly healthy, thank you! If I wasn't, Miss V would kindly let me know. *Miff* "Counciling and medication". Even if Miss V didn't constantly moniter my state of mind, body, and general health, I get a stinkin' physical every time I come back from a mission!    Lip piercing? May I "put in my two cents' worth"? Having a piece of metal jammed into your lip has several side effects. For one, it chips your teeth. You may possibly have to receive ceramic replacements. For two, though the social interactions among peers may improve, any respectable employer who might try to attract elderly customers would not hire someone with such a piercing.  Plus, (although I think Miss V summed it up pretty well), Leviticus 19:28: "You shall not make any gashes in your flesh for the dead or tatoo any marks upon you: I am the LORD." (It wasn't really the one I was looking for, but it's close.)   Hey, Jack (both of y'all): While I was looking for that, I came across another one I thought would be interesting for y'all to hear. Miss V likes it. Leviticus 19:33-34: "When an alien resides with you in your land, you shall not oppress the alien. (34) The alien who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were alines in the land of Egypt..." 'Course, that's just what it says in the NRS version.
