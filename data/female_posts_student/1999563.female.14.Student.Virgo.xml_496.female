Most of there fathers are like abusive or not there.  All the kids were SO nice! They were like wya nicer then at a normal school. It was crazy. I mostly hung out with this girl named Jasmine and another girl named Tianna. they were so cool. But one time this girl tripped so I went to help her and she was like "My daddys in jail." so I was like "Oh..I am sorry.." then we said "My brothers hate me. They call me stupid, but i'm a GENIOUS! My mom calls me PRINCESS!" aww. She was cute.  It made me sad that I couldn't do more to help them. They were glad that we were there. It was a group of about 10 people from church. When we came they were like "THE TEENAGERS ARE HERE!" then like in the middle they were like "WE LOVEEEEE THE TEENAGERS!" haha. it made me laugh.   I leave in 14 hours for San Diego. Wooohoo!  But get this.  My passport is expired and my photo ID from school is MISSING. I am like frekaing out.  I better go look for it some more!  Bye!  laura fantora
