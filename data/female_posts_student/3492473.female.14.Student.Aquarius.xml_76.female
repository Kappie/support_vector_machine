Just throw in the "baby" part.) In school, they teach you all that Sex Ed. But I personally think it's not as detailed as it should be. In Sex Ed, they teach you all the reasons  NOT  to have sex. They don't tell you anything about HOW to have sex or where to get the morning after pill in case we decide to or we get drunk one night and make a mistake. I bet half the people in my grade don't even know what the morning after pill is or what it does or what EC is. Or where to get it more importantly. Just the other day, one of my friends was like, "OMG, did you know they have  female  condoms?" She said it like it was so amazing. Our school's sexual education classes should teach us  about  sex and about all the forms of protection that can be used and all the details about those forms of protection.  My magazines are doing a better job informing me about sex and protection and statistics then my own freaking school.  Now do you think that's right? I don't. As much as they stress sex in school, the things they teach us,  SUCK!  Okay, they cover STD's pretty well and HIV's and AID's. But I mean, it's not like in Mean Girls where the Sex Ed teacher is like, "Don't have sex. You  will  get an STD and you  will  DIE!" It's not as drastic. And they make it out to be that way. They don't give us a comfortable environment to talk about it or make themselves (the teachers) approachable in case we have really private questions we're too afraid to mention in class. Also, stop shoving the whole "stay a virgin til marriage" thing down our throats. I understand why they do that and I agree with them that it's the best choice, but stop making it sound like if we have sex before we get married we're trash. It's our decision. You can add your two cents but don't MAKE us agree. Staying a virgin until marriage these days, seems completely pointless to me. Once again, this is my opinion so don't flip at me. To me, it feels like the person I'm gonna fall in love with and marry is not gonna be a virgin. And I waited my whole life to give him this great "gift" of mine when he gave his away so long ago. Ironic, now isn't it? That's what I feel will happen to  a lot  of us when we get older. So I don't see the point in waiting to give that person something so special that hardly means anything anymore. I mean seriously, it's all over the place. Sex. I mean, God knows most of the celebrities weren't virgins til marriage. Except for Jessica Simpson. Most of them have kids with all different dads or moms! Sex is everywhere! If you look up lyrics to songs, most of them refer to sex and 12 year old kids go around singing it acting cool. The media is to blame for this. They take something that should be special and break it down into the "cool" thing to do. But I'm not even sure if sex really should be considered something special between two people. I dunno, it's just my opinion. I'm not saying it's okay to run around and get pregnant when you're 14 but follow your heart and if you feel your ready (physically and emotionally) then go ahead. Talk to your parents, get protection, and go ahead. You have one life to live. And you never know exactly how long it's gonna last.
