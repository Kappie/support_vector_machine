We've been hanging out so much lately and it's a ton of fun every time we get together. It's always a party. Plus...she loves Six Flags, which I do too. That's always nice! Heh. Anyway, I'm off to probably sleep. Mary Clare....please say you can do something sometime soon. I haven't seen you in too long. :(
