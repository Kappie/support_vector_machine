Now I'm home watching 50 1st dates, I remember seeing it with someone it's a memorable date but it's a little sad right now, let's just say everything I wish for or want back keep drifting farther away but anywho I don't feel good so I'm just going to go now... *Everything's changed except the way I feel about you-Lonestar
