Attempted to tackle me but was unsuccessful. Would not clean up his food mess until I created:  THE LIST.  Yes, teenagers of the world, I have a solution. THE LIST will solve all your problems. Simply grab a piece of paper and pencil. Proceed to make a list of all the bad deeds your client is committing. Inform them that their sins are being written on THE LIST and will be given to Parent to Deal With Accordingly When They Return. Just make sure they don't grab the list and try to rip it up. Then you have to make a new list. Anyway, once they know this, tell them that when they repent for these sins, they will be crossed off the list and never be spoken of again.   It works. It really does.  Alice: Good as usual. I experienced a first when she had a number two and wished to be assisted. I have never done this before. I probably did it incorrectly, too. Oh, well. *sigh* Oh - scenario.  LAURA: Um...so... you wanna do it? I mean... here.  ALICE: You don't know much about this, do you?  Sophie - I like her now... She likes to swing. And she likes popsicles and Monsters Inc. Speaking of. That movie brings a tear to my eye every time I watch it... it's so SAD and so good...   Yes, Sean, I know. CASABLANCA. I'll watch it this weekend. I really don't have the time tonight. I'm, um... being lazy. That takes time.   Amy's life sucks, and Amy wants to die, and Amy wanted to slit her wrists a couple days ago but couldn't find any sharp objects. The rest of the personalities were delighted with this, but Amy just wanted to cry. But she couldn't get the tears out... Amy wishes all men would quit trying to screw over her life. Amy is going out to a club and getting wasted.   In other news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is probably doing quite well. I haven't checked in awhile and I don't plan on it.  One thing that bothers me is people who don't know when to leave well enough alone. If others don't like you, don't talk to them. Leave them alone and/or start a hate page.  I'm off to find a RENT page of the characters. Bye, y'all!
