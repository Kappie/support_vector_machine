We went to Pancakes on the Rocks for brunch, most of us succumbed to temptation and had the 'Devils Delight' chocolate pancakes. mmmm.... Helen took lots of photos of our mangled pancakes at the end. Nat and I ate the least, and Anika was a bottomless pit and devoured hers and Ash's meal. We went to the Rocks markets after, that was fun as well. Helen bought a really pretty bracelet for her sisters b'day. I bought Mango Fudge and those hard Rock candy things. Jess bought these luxury strawberries. They are the biggest things u'll eva see and are coated in chocolate and various other yummies. Mmm...Jess bought home a catalogue so she could hint to her Dad 2 buy them 4 her Mum 4 Valentine's Day so she could eat them. She suggested I hint as well. I laughed. Mmm...those strawberries really did look good. We didn't get much time at the markets though because we had 2 catch our bus home. Anika knew her way around the city like a local, so we had no chance of getting lost. But by the time I got home I had a throbbing headache so I collapsed on my bed and slept for 2 hours.  Mmm...feels good now tho. :D Hannah's coming over soon because we have a lot of work 2 do on our dance 4 MSPA. Everyone must come and see us dance! Yay! :) Blogging off, Beth
