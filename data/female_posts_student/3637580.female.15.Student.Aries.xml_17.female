I forgot to say that my dad and his girlfriend announced they were having a baby (wait don't get ahead of yourself) they told me that they had something important to tell me, and they began with theres going to be a new arrival to the family, so they decided to play a little joke on me..hahaha the ignorance of elders..bad move. I just stared at them and then commented that I didn't know what the hell they were doing trying to get pregnant at the age of 47. They stopped my shouting by saying JUST KIDDING! What the hell is that? You seriously DON'T joke about that. In turn they tell me that Trish's daughter will be moving in with us. I don't know what to think about this. She got to our house last night at like 2 AM. It's going to be so diffrent from me. I'm a spoiled only child, who's always got whatever I wanted and I NEVER had to share it. I had (up to this point) my own bathroom, but now I'm going to have to share it. I'm going to have to share my shower and my drawers and my vanity. Get this they're even giving her MY dresser, the ONLY reason I'm not mad about this is that I've been wanting a new one for a while, but still, it's not as if they took that into consideration. I guess this situation could also be cool, I mean I've never really had a sister. SO maybe in that sense things will be cool, plus she has a car so maybe she can uhh give me rides places! haha..anyway Everything kinda sucked last night, no one was paying attention to me, they were just putting all their effort into Jessie coming, and making her arrival happy. Not that they pay attention to me anyway...   So Soccer today..damn they worked us hard. We ran Notre Dame, we got in 5 miles. It was a really good work-out though. Tomorrow we have prectice again from 7-9 and then we're all going to the beach it's going to be really fun. It'll be the girls and guys soccer team...(if ONLY this was last year when Jason Sabo was on the team...:( haha.. KIDDING) My legs hurt MUCHO bad, and I have a muscle pull in my back and I need a MUCHO good massage for it haha! (wow gotta love the spanish skills)  HaHaHa boys suck! maaan...so I'm pretty close to positive all the "talking" stuff is over. I know people are probally looking at this like...Damn bitch it took you a while to figure that out. hahaha whatever...fuckers  Seth asked me to go to his grad. party Sat. cause it's also his cousin Ryan's. Ryan's fat and he dosen't have alot of friends hahahaha so Seth was like yyyeaahhh...bring a bunch of friends up there so Ryan feels cool. Haha that kid's a dork!   I think I'm going up to the lake this weekend. It should be pretty kick ass, if I can bring someone with me otherwise it's probally gunna suck cause who knows if michael, and all the neighbors will be up, and I HATE being stuck with the family...  Well I gotta get up at 7 tomorrow so I better get my ass to bed...LaTeR
