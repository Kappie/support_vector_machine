Save up money 4) Try to get good grades for End-of-Year examz  .... Well, at least I'm gonna try. Nowadays when I always last minute do homework, it made me realise that it's been so long since I've actually  COMPLETED  my homework at home. The first thing that I do when I get home is : *beep* on goes the computer. Hiaz....And my grades are getting from bad 2 worse~ >.  Mum's been telling me to revise my work, study...All those things. But, if I've actually revised and study at the first place, she won't have nagged at me rite? *answers own question: Rite~* Hehe...  Anyway, I wanna cut my hair!!!!!!!!! It's dropping so much~! Heck, even Fion totI've gotten mi hair cut before I even told her it was dropping like there's no tomorrow...~  The horror~~~    Ast  - Όταν σας αγαπώ, θα μαδήσω τα αστέρια από τον ουρανό και θα τα σας δώσω σε. Αλλά όταν σας μισώ, θα ανοίξω τις πόρτες της κόλασης και θα σας ωθήσω κατευθείαν, στις πυρκαγιές που καίνε μακριά τη σάρκα δερμάτων σας...... όλα σας που απεχθάνομαι απολύτως. -
