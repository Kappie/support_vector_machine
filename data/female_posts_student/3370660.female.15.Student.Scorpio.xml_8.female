It was an  urlLink evening  that I held onto, physically, for too long.   By nature I tend to be a packrat, and hold onto everything I feel has sentimental value. In this instance, it was a dollar bill that I kept as a memory of Alex. During Christmas break I found it lingering in my purse, forgotten and wrinkled. It was then recirculated at Barnes and Nobles for a venti carmel frappuccino.  But the past aside- in the present I now have a penny in which to remember Vineet. And, I now have a new found view of the rapidly approaching summer.
