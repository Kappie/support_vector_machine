My parents are having a bunch of people over though, soo...if I do stay home I'll be up in my room.  It was weird last night. At the football game last night this guy named Adam recognized me, and I'm just like, "gosh, I know I recognize you, but who are you??" He's over at my house ALL the time. He's Dan's brother. Gosh. I can't believe I didn't know. I guess it makes sense since I usually ust stay out of their way, but still. Oh well...  I think I'm going to go watch this ABC family movie, "See Jane Date." Then I'll probably go wallow in selft pity at the fact that I don't have a boyfriend. Wow, I know myself pretty well.
