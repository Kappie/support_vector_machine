Kim, thanks for having us. :-)  You Rock!!  I  loved  the videos. They really hit home on how women are so so so negatively portrayed in the ads.  As objects (and not subjects) of our own destiny.... The impact on us is phenomenal. 3000 ads viewed daily. In the next 10 years, you'll be seeing about ten million nine hundred thousand ads. 10,950,000. Most of them, i guess, women.    To continue our discussion on media  women, let's bring magazines to our next meeting. I'd suggested males mags but let's do that another time. I'll get a movie about that another time.   For now, let's stick to women's  girls to keep the impact going.  WHERE: Royal Oak, Laurier street (between King Edward  Cumberland street)  Time: Same as usual 7:30  What you need: 1 magazine. Yourself.    ;-) See you tuesday. Anne-Sophie
