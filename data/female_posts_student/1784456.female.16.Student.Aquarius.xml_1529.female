It all started one dark evening *...* Ok, so I was walking down this road with some people when I head this person scream "AMY NOOOOO!" and then I turned and saw a car run someone over, then there was a sound like someone hitting a football and the persons head flew off near to us. Then everyone started crying and saying "Amy's dead!" But when I looked at the face, I didn't recognise it, but I should have *I think it was my face!* so I started crying anyway. Oh, and the voice that shouted "AMY NOOOO!" was Amy... freaky huh? Ok... so maybe no one wanted to know at all! It's just too freaky! Get it away! Nooo! Then I had another dream where I was horrible and everyone was swearing at me and telling me to go away, so I asked someone "Am Ireally that horrible?" but I woke up before I got a reply! (I don't think I would have wanted to know anyway) Ummm anyway... I'll just be crawling away now to do homework...
