Kenny, Kyle and Tommy visit Cartman. Cartman has a real monkey that helps him spell that he bought in a package. The monkey plays the drums and is beside Cartmans bed:  Kyle: Hey Cartman, how's home-schooling doing?  Cartman: Its fucking great you guys (conversation is going on)  Meanwhile, the monkey savagely jumps at kenny and starts poundin on him and raming him into the wall, finally Kenny dies.  Kyle and Tommy: OMG, THE LEARNING MONKEY KILLED KENNY!  Cartman: Damn right.
