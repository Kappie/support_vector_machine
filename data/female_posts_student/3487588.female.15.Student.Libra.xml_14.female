He's the only one i trust now.. the only one whom i trust whole-heartedly.. the one i am not cynical of.. the one i want to depend on.. others are too hard to depend on, too difficult to trust, too busy to listen to me.. i find it hard to get them to understand, to empathise..  ah yes, i've learnt to love my enemy and i'll remember to turn the other cheek. so TIMOTHY SIM, since you've slapped me for 3 years on the same side of my cheek, i'm gonna let you slap on the other without flinching this time.. but i think i'd better get some painkillers, or else i'll die of pain and lack of dignity.. and remind me to do that, cos humans normally dont practice wad they preach.. and pple tend to have the brain of a goldfish when it comes to memory.. maybe i should read some books on neuroscience to know more about brains.. oh yes, some books on psychology too.. man, why cant i study on subjects i'm interested in!? man, im sick of dissecting guppies and frogs.. i wanna dissect bigger things!  btw, nowadays, i've been feeling dizzy, giddy, mainly cos i have low blood pressure suddenly.. imagine, i've to hold onto railings everytime i go up and down the steps.. especially in skool.. haiz.. and man, those headaches irritate me..  and since this may be my last entry for 3 months, i wanna tell you pple.. everybody's self-righteous, esp when you think you arent.. so, before you comment on how self-righteous others are, look at how you're judging them.. in the book of luke, remove the plank from your eye before offering to remove the speck of dust in your brother/sister's eye.. a hypocrite is the one who judges..
