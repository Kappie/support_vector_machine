I wore the (as nate called them) hooker boots with my short black skirt. I love that outfit, especially with my black trench coat. I was surprised Headley didn't bitch me out for wearing something like that on the field, but I marched just fine SO HA! I am one of Balthazar's musicians. Well, actually I'm the only musician. It has no lines, but I think it's actually going to turn into a pretty important part. Music is needed in this play, and I play it well.  I've been having terrible dreams about bugs lately. The first was that all these ants and mosquitoes had made nests in our house, and that mom and dad wouldn't do anything about them. Yesterdays about about this sweat bee that got inside my thumb and started sucking my blood. I could feel it too, but I couldn't get it out. I could see it, but there was nothing I could do to stop it. *shudder* not a good time to sleep.
