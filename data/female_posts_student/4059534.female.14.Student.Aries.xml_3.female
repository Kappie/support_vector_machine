Some-one once told me that when you swear you haven't nothing more intellegent to say, this is very true and leads to the fact that I have no intelligence. Because I swear A LOT. I have said Fudge about 100times in the last 3days, which is really bad, because I swear too much. I would say it's not my fault, but you know it just comes out. My family are not really very "reserved" in the way that they talk. In Aotearoa I swear even more than what I do in Australia which is A LOT, in fact it is HEAPS!!!! This is probably due to my families influence on my language.   WOW that actually sounded smart. Weird....... Also Fudge the actual candy is very nice and the best would have to be french vanilla fudge and chocolate fudge it is sooooo nice, like eating the most fattening thing on the planet. It is also a ticket to about 30 pimples the following day. Hope everyone feels a lot more informed about "fudge."
