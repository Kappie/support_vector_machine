I’ve even practiced my oboe and now my mouth hurts and stuff : \  Oh well, I improved so that’s all that matters.  Today was rather boring.  Wait, I take that back.  Today was extremely boring.  Let’s see, band was just.... band.  The usual solo stuff.  Apparently, I need to fall in love with my tuner.  I find it difficult to fall in love with inanimate objects, but maybe that’s just me.  Spanish was actually great fun, but at the expense of Mrs. Segler, as usual.  Me and Martin just goof around the whole period.  And of course we were totally making fun of Mrs. Segler when she wasn’t looking and then Martin randomly turns around and Mr. Spann is sitting like right there.  It’s just Jimmah Spann, but we were really embarrassed because we were really really really misbehaving.  Luckily, Sra. Segler no puede oir.  Right Martin?  haha   Anyhoo, history was alright... nothing new.  Lunch was kinda fun- Pete and Nick had a good time asking me millions and millions of questions.  Chemistry sucked.  Took a quiz and learned more about bonding.  Hot dog!  And BCIS was so boring, that I can’t even express in words the extent of its boringness.  We resorted to typing each other notes on our computer while the ever-so-annoying “teacher” droned on and on about how to type a resume.  I was very glad for that class to be over.  But thank goodness tomorrow is Friday!  And we have Renaissance lunch, too!  And then Jordan’s party!  So it should be a pretty good day.  What should I be when I grow up?  Seriously, what do you picture me doing?  Because I sure don’t know what to do with my life.  And it really bothers me.  So any opinions are appreciated!  And don’t try to be funny and suggest obscene, X-rated, or just plain stupid jobs because I’m really serious about this.  Yep, so anyhoo... cool song alert!  “Te Aviso, Te Anuncio” by Shakira.  Shakira’s my idol, omg!  She is so awesome.  But, since I’m sure nobody that reads this is a fellow Shakira fan.... another cool song is “Ghost” by Pearl Jam.  Well, I guess that’s all for today!  Hope everyone is doing fantastically : )  Until next time!
