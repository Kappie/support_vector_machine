If they're not digging into your lip, your clashing teeth. when the fuck do i get these peice of shit things off!?!?  But like really, no one really needs to have there lip cut off from making out with braces, i swear i almost got my lip cut a billion times tonight! so i had to keep re-shifting to avoid losing my lip and all circulation through it. I wonder what it feels like for Jamie... like, do they hurt him too? Ugh these are the stupidest things ever.     And OMG, Curtis jsut asked Mom to marry him. Wow. This is weird. I thought 4 sure that they were gunna break up. and he was gunna move out and now their engaged! this is wacked. i'm not really sure what i want to think. should i be happy or not care or mad cuz he annoys the crap outta me?  Like, this is boggling my mind right now. I'm really happy for mom tho, i knwo a while ago she wanted this, i think it was one of the last things she was expecting. Wow. i wonder what mom is thinking right now. my mind is whirling. i think i shoudl go to sleep now.
