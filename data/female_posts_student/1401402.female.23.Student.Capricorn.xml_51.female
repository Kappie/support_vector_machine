I'm sooooo excited for the weekend!!! It's gonna be AWESOME! Dinner With families tonight. Going clubbin with some cousins hope that they won't leave me in the bushes when i get drunk. LOL.   I'm going home on Sunday. Kinda sad and depressed but GOD DAMN I MISS THE BAY AREA. Nothing beats home sweet home. So here I am enjoying the very last moment that's left. Sitting here smiling away. Grams working on her garden as always. All the lil cousins playing, fighting, crying as usual. Alyssia's bossing everyone around...  It's so nice outside...Yade yade yade yade...It's such an exciting time to be alive... So many things going on...
