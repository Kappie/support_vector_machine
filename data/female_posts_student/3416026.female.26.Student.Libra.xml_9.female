It's kind of good (helps spread the word that gay people are, you know, real human beings that deserve like, real human rights) and kind of bad (I can't get all warm and fuzzy about Mtv and Viacom, for Christ's sake).    It strikes me that it's like some other trend-driven innovations (are there any other kind of innovations, actually?) such as McDonald's salads where you're all, "Well, this might be a choice that I could make as a consumer which is better for me, but something about this whole thing still makes me want to puke in my pocket."  You know?  Or maybe that's just me.  Either way, I gotta say:  we've come a long way from the  urlLink tender embraces of Matt, the gay guy  on Melrose Place in the early 90s, to the  urlLink hard-core fucking  of the brilliant  urlLink Queer as Folk .  I know, I know:  QAF is on Showtime and all, but still.  Anyhow, just like with the totally retarded (and boring too, is it just me who thinks so?) Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, I guess it's better that it's there, but I'm not so sure that this is the best conduit for social change.  I feel like maybe Mtv and Viacom should just stick to making  urlLink this bastard  rich.
