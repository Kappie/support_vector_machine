I went up to him in the hall after school to tell him that Ms. Medlin said that we had to be at the school at 6:30 on Saturday instead of seven, and do you know what he said?  Bullshit.  My god of all the nerve.  Well he isn't getting any of my lemon juice this weekend.  That is if he shows up on time.  Anyway I saw him today.  Wow he got a new jacket and it makes him look slimming.  Very nice.
