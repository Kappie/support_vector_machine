I got to hang out with Christa some and she's gonna be gone for good soon so its good we got to spend some time with eachother!  Tyler Nelson....absolutely crazy...bless him, and all the boys!  My house is not gonna be the same with them going off to college! :(  While we were at the beach, me and daddy rode the ferry to Dauphin Island, and I showed him around and he was really impressed!  June 6th is creeping up on me quicker than i expected.  Its really beautiful down there and I know I'm gonna have an awesome time, but being gone for 4 weeks sucks really bad to!  Im gonna miss Jessi, and Mack, and Aubrey soooooo much! Its not even funny! If my parents dont get me a dang cell phone I swear Im gonna shoot myself!!! "fo real"  I got to talk to Aubrey while we were at the beach! yay!! I was soooo excited! *tekek* He's sooo sweet! and if you think he has a girl name, I'll tell you like he told me....AUDREY is the girls name, and AUBREY is the boys name! lol.....I just let him think what he wants to on that one! :P  jk with ya!   Im soooo ready to be out of school!  Its gonna be soo much fun for the few weeks that I'm here..then I'll be gone for 4 and yall will all miss me so much (hah I wish...Jessi and Aubrey will, but that's about it) then I'll come home and get my license late since im gonna be gone for my birthday! :( oh well....who needs a birthday anyway!!! lol....I feel ya on that one jess! As long as I get a few cards, I'll be good!  I just thought I'd let yall know that I do NOT like suprises at all!  Its fine if you give me a sweet note or card or something, but I hate it when everyone knows about something that someone's gonna do to me and I dont! It really stinks!  and another thing....when you are calling a person "honey" its not spelled like that its HUNNY *aubrey* and just b/c you think someone tastes like honey, doesn't mean you should tell them about it...that's like telling someone you're sex fantasies or something.  You only share those when you're face to face! lol, but I'll let it slide this time but dont let it happen again, oh..and another thing....if you're going to sleep, you probably shouldn't tell people to call you, b/c when they wake you up they kinda feel bad! just a lil tip....hmm anything else I can think of.............nope, not today!  I hope yall had a great weekend b/c i know i did!! ttyl
