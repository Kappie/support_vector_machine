    
       After a long week and a new decision to deal with my stress and anxiety in an alternative way, I guess I could say I am generally ok. I miss Jesse a lot and have decided that the only reason I am going to continue to be is to not break the promise I made to him before he left, He asked me to be here when he came home for good. I already can tell that this journey will be a long and very hard one for me to take and even though Jesse is facing a tougher future at least I know in my heart he has the strength to prevail in everything he does, he has the determination to drive himself. I on the other hand am not as strong as him and that is exactly why I admire Jesse. We haven’t had a chance to talk much this week and I have put myself in a state of panic over the whole deal. I know that eventually all I will have is my keyboard or good old fashion paper and pencil to guide us through our tough times, and the phone calls will probably be next to none once he gets overseas. I never expected to have to go through the things I have had to and more than ever I want Jesse home. I am terrified of what is to become of me. I had grown so comfortable of the simple things we had and now, in a matter of days, weeks and months, everything has become so much more complicated and a little too much for me to handle. I guess I finally found a downfall to falling in love with your best friend… you couldn’t always have them there when you need them. I am sure that eventually these feeling will pass and I hope that the time will fly by as well. I guess out of all of this I am just very curious as to how Jesse feels. I hope that this time apart will allow us to grow closer and to be more open when it comes to our feelings for the situation at hand and feelings about us. Our feelings can become our special secrets that we only share with ourselves and not with those around us, that is why they are our feelings.
