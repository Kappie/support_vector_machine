Fast forward>>> Then, i went out with him. Hehez, it was enjoyable.  We went to Orchard, because i wanted to see the Singapore Great Sale.   We didn't really shop much, because we spent most of our time taking Neoprints. Woo... we took two times, which cost him $18. Heart pain... beacause he won't allow me to pay. Well, we took pretty good ones. Cheerz* hehez. I had alot of fun.   We went for dinner after that. I had that plate of chicken rice, full of rice, but only a few piece of meat. But i was still very full.   Then we took a train down to singapore river, sat by the side...  We chatted.  And it happened... This was the first time he said how much he liked me... I was very touched to hear that, because he finally showed his trueself, he expressed.  I always love him, beacuse i never hate anyone.  I didn't show my feelings to him, because i didn't know whether he felt that way. {insecure } But this night, i can really feel love...   [ Now, i can take the fact that he wont message me for anything, except for fixing date and time to go out together. because this is the way he is. ]  Hmm... maybe with his new look, he looks more 'guai'. hehez, in the sense, cute to me...  the moment i see him, my heart really melts... and can forget about any worry in mind...   i want to say  " thank you" to him...
