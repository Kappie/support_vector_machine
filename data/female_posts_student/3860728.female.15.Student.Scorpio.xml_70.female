Okay, now that ive gotten that out of the will talk about my dog, missy, and then my little sister, spirit.      MISSY. I love missy. Sometimes i talk badly about missy, but i love her.. hmmm i suppose, it's because she can't talk back or maybe because she doesn't critisize me. Anywho we bought missy last year at the petshop 'Feather's and Friends'. She was in a cage all alone and there was on cage on either side of her with 2 puppies in each cage. I actually didn't want her b/c i thought she was ugly. I wanted one of the peek-a-poos (i'd had one in the past named scooter), but then all of a sudden missy one of the dogs in a cage beside missy licked her and missy bit it and wouldn't let go. The pet shop owner had to unlock the cage to make missy let go and since we saw that he lowered the price on her from $250 to $150.. needless to say i got stuck with missy. My mom picked her up after she'd gotten her shots and such the next day and i was the first person home 2 see her. After that she followed me around continously for about 2 months until i became rude to her and i'd yell at her to make her leave me alone. She stopped following me and started following lavender who does not care. Still, i love missy (she grew on me)although she pees in the bed once in a while.. she's a lot better than my mom or sunny anywho.      Spirit Spirit was born August 18, 2003.... 3 days after Lavender turned 17. She is 15 years younger than me. I love spirit and spirit loves me. we're as happy as can be. wow that rhymed. lol j/k. Anywho, i find when spirit is not being dumped off on the nanny, im constantly taking care of her. I don't really mind though, i like watching her grow up and do new things such as talk and crawl (she did learn how to walk, but she forgot). Hmm i really take pride in the fact that she calls me SuSu, but she doesn't call my mom anything (HA IN HER FACE). Spirit's birthday is coming up and i plan on getting her something special, but i wonder what exactly... I can imagine 10 years from now having spirit coming to live with me b/c she won't be able to stand living with my mother. Hmm.. spirit is the most adorable baby isn't she? I think she is anywho. Someone asked me was she a boy once. I nearly had to kick her fucking ass. NO... I DIDNT CARE IF SHE WAS 11...hmmm spirit is kewl. she's a lot better company than lavender could ever be. I only hope we get along as we get older since they say scorpio's and leo's don't get along (this has been proven between my ex bf vs me and lavender vs me). Anywho, i love them both.. missy and spirit.
