That pizza smells so good, soz just noticed it and thought I'd say it, it's my treat for surviving)14 June Song:Alright- Supergrass ('Got some cash, bought some wheels, Took it out, 'cross the fields, Lost control, hit a wall, But we're alright,  Are we like you, I can't be sure, Of the scene, as she turns, We are strange in our worlds') For the rest of the lyrics click  urlLink here   Quote of the day: 'Diamond Dogs are poachers, and they hide behind trees Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal' David Bowie-Diamond Dogs (oh by the way, if you type these lyrics ('mannequins with kill appeal'(just this bit)) into Google, you will discover that it is not David Bowie's song that appears first...but my blog!!!!! See I told you all I'd be famous)full lyrics----> urlLink here    Quote by me, before nasty Jessica can nick it: 'Look Jessica! Look at the lambs! BAAAAAAAAA!' Ha! Beat you to it!!!!!!! Kinda vain to quote myself, but it is my duty to before the evil quote monster steals it.  oOOOOh speaking of famous Guess what? You know that piccie we thought they took during the transit of Venus. They did, My fringe looks really long! But shiny, so it's all good! Here it is!   OMG that nice pizza smell has been replaced by the smell of burning, kay one min i'm seeing what is going on.............OMG!!!My mum has gone mad, I just went out into the back garden and she was stood there poking bits of flaming newspaper into the bbq, then she proclaimed 'I'm having a bonfire!!!!!!'....I ran away! We're having pizza, it's in the oven...Why in the name of all that is good and holy in this world is she roasting the Sunday times!!!!!!!!Hang on she must be roasting the Daily mail, the Sunday times is in my room, oh thank god!! Anyway what was I saying..... Oh yes Happy thought for the day: We're all still alive!!!!! eg. We are not Mannequin food. Gentle readers I am sure that we all can rejoice in this fact together, and that is the fact that I survived!!!! I'm not mannequin food!!! I feel so much better now, in the museum 'thakerly medical museum', it was horrible there were mannequins EVERYWHERE, and they were all crusty and not real, and my chest was really tight, and the whole time I was there I felt like I couldn't breathe, and I was so claustrophobic, and I just needed to get out but I couldn't!!! It was truly awful, interesting, but awful! I feel so much better now, I can breathe again, but only just, I just felt so relieved when I got home, I sat down and on the floor and nearly cried, it was where I had wanted to be all day! Safe to say, shadow gave me very weird looks!  Update on the BBC situation, mum was burning papers rather than throwing them, I told her she was contributing to global warming and our inevitable doom...She told me to shut up. Oh here is a list of the interesting things me and Jess saw on the way to Leeds: 1. Sheep 2.Cows 3. Trees 4. Farm in middle of motorway 5. Farmer from said farm getting into blue hatchback 6. The best hill in the world which me and Jess will climb...ask me 2moz if you want me to draw you a pic.  Anyway I must away to do English Coursework and have my first proper meal in two days...I leave you with this.( kay I'm a one women quote machine today...bear with me  Gentlemen.

This is the War Room! ~ President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) in "Dr. Strangelove"  Always forgive your enemies -- Nothing annoys them so much. ~ Oscar Wilde *poignant stare* AND  All you need is love! (Kirsty you may be the only one who understands this, but he said it again today to Shirin and Jess when they asked him for a quote, safe to say I burst out laughing and made the weirdos with the blond hair and too much makeup stare at me!)# Kay there are more that just need to be said.
