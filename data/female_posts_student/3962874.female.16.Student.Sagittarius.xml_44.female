Daniel says that we should just get her shit-faced one time and she'll never want to drink again. I think it's a good idea but she is small and I don't think I want her to do it at all. Alcohol poisoning is not fun I hear. Oh yeah, lastnight Amanda insisted on taking a shower so we let her and when she get out she announced "I went pee in the shower and didn't rinse off." Great, piss on yourself and then get out right away, couldn't wait a few seconds to rinse? Guess not. I think Alex was a little mad at me for letting her, but I think it was a good thing that the first time she got drunk was with us and not someone else who we can't trust. A lot of people would have let her do some stupid stuff and we kept her under control, a little. Dad said he was going to be home today but I haven't heard from him yet so I don't know if he will be. I feel like shopping. Oh yeah, Ann said that dad would double the money I earn for school clothes and things, he didn't approve it yet but hopefully he will and then I can stop working and shop!
