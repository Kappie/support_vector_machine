I listened to Stuart McLean in the car, but Melanie is right I am sure my brain is already programmed to sleep when I hear his voice, because I suddenly started feeling VERY tired.  Not particularly helpful when driving along the motorway at 80mph!   Have decided to move my room all around, well as much as I can in my uni room.  Basically just the things on my bookshelf and desk!  I do like my room here though, it feels like mine. It’s my space.  Had lots of post (which I LOVE – how can people hate getting post??!!) including my next student loan cheque (the bank balance is now looking slightly healthier than previously - phew!) and a letter from my church asking if I would like to attend a meeting about social action and the role my church is and should be taking in the future!  I am really excited about this, because social action is something I feel ENOURMOUSLY passionate about.  And also it would be great to become more involved with the church, rather than just going and doing ‘time’ on a Sunday.   Ok I think I will watch a DVD tonight – still haven’t watched Pirates of the Caribbean yet. Does anyone know can you get ER on DVD/video?? (Not that I’m desperately obsessed or anything – I have a long way to go to reach Debs so it’s all good!)  take care guys love Karenxx  p.s. I now have  smooth  peanut butter! Yippee! p.p.s Beah where do you live? I know Ontario but that’s a pretty big province (between Quebec and Manitoba – are you impressed?!)
