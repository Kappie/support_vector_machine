I constantly reminded of the good she brings into my life and how invaluable she is to me.   THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART!  That card really made me think and really lifted my spirits, so thank you.  I have lost so many friends in the past few years, I hope to not lose anymore because the few I sincerely cherish.  OK that's it.
