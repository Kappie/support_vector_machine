Then we all went to the anime convention. It was fun, but I don't think it would have been nearly as fun if Nick wasn't there. He told me that I dragged him there! I feel so guilty about it! ah well. He made my day a whole lot brighter. ^_^  I bought a fan at the con, but I lost it! I must have set it down somewhere. I'm really sad about being so forgetful. It's rather frustrating at times. I don't know if I'm going to buy another one though. *sniffles* I feel so stupid for forgetting to pick it back up from where-ever I sat it down.  After Nick left, I started to feel physically ill. Not because he left, but just because I felt sick. So, around 4:30, I called my dad and asked him to come get me. He arrived at 5:15, by which time I felt a little better, and we went to Rosie's to eat. I didn't eat that much, I wasn't too hungry. Then me and my mom and Inky went to the mall to exchange the candle I bought her and accidentally broke for other stuff. I bought a disposable camera and a necklace.  We went home after that. I got on the computer, then called Nick. I believe he is frustrated. I was only kidding about fate being against us, Nick! That'd be terrible if fate really was against us, because I care for you very much. I love being with you, and no matter how long I am around you, the moment we're apart, it feels as though we haven't seen one another in days. I suppose that sounds a bit obsessed, but I don't care. That's how I feel. Chelsea, don't worry about April or camp. Everything will work out for the best. You'll see. And don't worry about you and Barry, I'm sure you two will stay together for a long time. ^_^ You need to stop trying to be paranoid like me! No one can be as good at being paranoid as I am, so don't even try. And I already know that I can't write nearly as much as you, and NO I wasn't counting my music list. hmph.... I'm kinda tired, but I don't want to sleep yet. It's a complicated thing. I've got alot on my mind, I suppose. The thing is, I don't know exactly what it is. It's like I'm supposed to be concentrating hard on something, and I don't know what it is that I'm supposed to be concentrating on. It's almost frustrating. Ah well. Tootles everyone!  Love, Shannon "Let me be the only one to keep you from the cold. Now the floor of heaven's lain with stars of brightest gold. They shine for you, they shine for you. They burn for all to see. Come into these arms again and set this spirit free."--Annie Lennox "Love Song for a Vampire" (it's really pretty!)
