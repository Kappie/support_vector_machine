"Without real trust in who God is - trust in his never-failing love and wisdom, we set ourselves up for disappointment. Is He a good God? Will He give what is best? If the answer is yes to both questions, it follows that He will withhold many things that look attractive to us. It is His mercy to withhold them. Shall we accuse Him of failure to get "His act" together or shall we echo the psalmist's word, "I am still confident of this: I will see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. Wait for the LORD; be strong and take heart and wait for the LORD" (Ps. 27:13-14 NIV) "If we imagine that happiness is to be found by furious pursuit, we will end up in a rage at the unsatisfying results. If, on the other hand, we set ourselves to pursue the wise and loving and holy will of our Heavenly Father, we will find that happiness comes - quietly, in unexpected ways, and surprisingly often, as the by-product of  sacrifice . "Waiting is a form of suffering - the difficulty of self-restraint, the anguish of unfulfilled longing, the bewilderment of unanswered prayer,flesh and heart failing, soul breaking. These are indeed tribulations, and tribulation is the curriculum if we are to learn patience. We want answers  now , right  now , but we are required at times to walk in darkness.  "Nevertheless, God is in the darkness. "'My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from Him' (Ps. 62:5 KJV). In Him alone lies our security, our confidence, our trust. A spirit of restlessness and resistance can never wait, but one who believes he is loved with an everlasting lvoe and knows that underneath are the everlasting arms will find strength and peace.  "God is in the waiting." ~Elisabeth Elliot  The Quest for Love
