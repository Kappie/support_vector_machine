Wow. I love this song. I've had it stuck in my head for the past week.  "It's my life," No Doubt. I kno I kno. Kinda corny, but it has a cool guitar part, and the pedals are awesome. I want a pedal. I want a life. I want some chinese food. There you have it. Three more things. Have fun. -It used to all be fun and games, until things changed. Like Ive said. I dont like change. I dont like snow. Or the artic.  I want to be a pirate.  Im sick. I think. Ive had random dizzy, nausea and tiredness spells. I dont think thats a completly normal thing. I cant tell the parents. I just got over having the flu, tonsilitus, Bronchitus and almost namonia. (_ Im not a very needy person. I only want a few things. But I cant get those. I guess I either dont have any luck. Or no one gives a fuck about me. Im thinking its a combination of both.  Im going to go before I depress all of you too much. I wouldnt want it to wear off.  I dont care anymore. cuz nobody ever did.
