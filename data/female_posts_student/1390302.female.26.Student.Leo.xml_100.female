Where there is love and inspiration, I don't think you can go wrong." ~Ella Fitzgerald   Well, it’s been a while since I’ve written so here’s the scoop.  Matt and I are doing okay; we’re swamped in schoolwork up to our eyeballs!  Matt’s calculus class is going so fast that he just spends most of his time studying.  I have two Internet classes, English and Government, which are going really, really fast.  But I think I’ve said all of this already, so on to something I haven’t said.  We went to Deleon yesterday to look at some mobile homes. It’s pretty certain now that his dad is going to help us buy a mobile home.  So anyway, we went to look at them, one was $10g, the other was $15g, and of course we liked the more expensive one.  It was 3 bed /2 bath and the master bathroom had a corner tub –oh how I love those.  Now we’re just playing the waiting game.  It’s really nice of his dad to help us, but I am feeling so STRESSED OUT that it’s now funny.  My ulcer has been acting up and it’s killing me.  I am also feeling depressed when I should be feeling happy about getting a place.  The thing is that most of them sell really fast so I am left feeling like we’re just spinning our wheels, as the cliché goes.  I am trying not to feel stressed; homes are out there we just have to look for them.  Still, I am left feeling helpless and I hate feeling helpless.  I also hate just sitting around and doing nothing when we should be looking for a place to live.  Matt’s doing everything he can, especially since he has so little time during the week, but if we don’t get moving we’re still going to be looking for a place to live in July, and that’s bad since we’re moving in the end of July.  I am wanting to go look for them we my free time, there’s a guy in Alvarado who has some in our price range, but Matt wants to wait all the way until next weekend to go look at them and the guy told him that they may be sold by then.  Matt didn’t seem to care and it really bothers me.  I am the type who cannot stand not knowing…that’s it, just not knowing.  I have to know where I am going to be living when I’m getting ready to move.  I don’t think it’s too much to ask.  So we are going to go see Matt’s dad today and talk to him about it.  We should know more about what’s going on after that.  He’s going to want to go look at the places, which he can’t do until next weekend, so now not only am I am Matt’s whim, but I am also at his dad’s.  It’s really stressing me out!  I’ll let ya know how it goes…  ~Kristyn
