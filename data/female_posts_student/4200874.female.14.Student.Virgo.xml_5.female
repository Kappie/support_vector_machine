Also, it seems that 'Be Yourself Day' is gonna be pretty fun! Oh and Thank God Hairin's bringing the fabric paint for the T-shirt coz I sure as hell am not hunting for it!       Secondly, Amath sucked today! That new teacher - Mr Alvin Lim, he so needs to improve. He's nice and all but I seriously am gonna fail if he continues this way! Oh and there's an Amath Class Test on week 10! SUCKS BIG TIME. Oh at least that wasn't too bad. I think I CAN manage.      Okay... for the thing that PISSED ME OFF BIG TIME. Geezz, I'm pissed, embarrassed, mad and definitely NOT feeling too happy about this. Teacher's day is coming up and the Sec 3s have to put up something. My class, being the freakin enthusiats that we are, are all pumped up. We have this presedential elections idea, not a bad one actually. The thing is that, I was previously TOLD to go up as Mr Clarence Lim's supporter. The thing was that I didn't want to and so I said so thinking that was the end.    Then today, during SS/Geog lesson, which happened to be a free period, was used as a rehearsal. Our first actually. Zahra came went out calling everyone, and guess what, my freakin name was called. I was like WHAT THE HECK?! Okay, so I decided to try to do it, but I was throughly upset. I know this may not seem like anything big to many, but I'm totally without confidence. I think I get stage fright and I'm not up for embarrassing myself. Plus, the damn speech was so LAME. Sucking Up much! GEEZ...   Anyhow, by the end of the day, I was obviously upset  I was certainly whining. I went up to the assholes who had no consideration whatsoever to have asked me, and told 'em that I DIDN"T WANT TO DO IT. Thankfully for Shaniszah, who sorta saved my butt here, was willing to take up the post for me. Woohoo. I owe her a bar of chocolate, which i totally don't mind getting for her! Oh and Zahra was pissed. LIKE I GIVE A DAMN. venting helps... to a certain extent.       Anyways, I'm currently busy downloading, or at least looking to download a couple of George Michael's numbers. Thought he was AMAZING, don't mind the pun, on Oprah's Primetime last night. Loved his songs and fell so in love with father figure. Too bad he's gay, he's pretty hot. Wish him well anyway. Hope I find good ones. I know I like a couple just don't know the titles. sigh... gonna be a chore.       I'm procrastinating again. Homework and all... let's see : Malay, Amath, Geog!!! Will do 'em later, at least Geog and part of Malay. Throughly busy now.       -Later Dayz-       that's all you wanted     something special, someone sacred-     in your lifejust for one moment     to be warm and naked     at my side          sometimes I think that you'll never     understand me     but something tells me together     we'd be happy
