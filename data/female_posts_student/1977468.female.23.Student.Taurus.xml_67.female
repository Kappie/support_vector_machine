A capitolistic whore house established to facilitate the sick materialistic lusts of a nation who's only shared pasttime is the consumption of unneeded wealth to the means of pacifying their immediate selfish pleasures. Knowing this, and contributing to the system makes me even more of a bastard, I admit it. I went Christmas shopping yesterday with Eric.   Going into those places, seeing the glitter in a child's eyes as he handles *insert random fad toy* discusts me to no end.  I want to rip it out of his hands and scream "IT WON'T MAKE YOU HAPPY" until either he starts crying or his mother intervines. Likewise, watching teenage girls browse through aisle after aisle of the latest slutty trends leaves me in a stumper as I wonder if they ever question "who" is telling them that its "cool"... HELLO? The very companies which are making the profuct zibberscone-sauce heads!  When will the masses take control of this twisted manipulating funhouse known as capitolism and realize that slaving away your whole life to reach the top of the pay ladder leaves you with nothing but a life behind you of sacrificed opertunities, comfort and personal health all given in the name of some pie-in-the-sky retirement fund when we can all fineally "relax".   If quality of life is an interchangable term for convienence, then America gets the trophy. But its a deceitful trophy; the shiney iridecent shell merely a mask for the rotting wormwood which comprises the core of this wonderous prize. A prize of fools, as the very forces which drive this system buy into the same set of false values as the ones they are manipulating. Success has what to do with money? Nothing. Money is a tool of influence, it defines noone who has it. It only means they have it, how they aquired it and what they use it for is a much more relevent issue... an issue which sheds more light into who you are rather then what you have, an issue which lost it's battle as soon as the term " consumer economy " became an acceptible banner to fly under.  -----------------------------------------------------------  con·sum·er    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (kn-smr) n.  One that consumes, especially one that acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.   A heterotrophic organism that ingests other organisms or organic matter in a food chain.    what does heterotrophic mean?   het·er·o·troph     ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (htr--trf, -trf) n.   An organism that cannot synthesize its own food and is dependent on complex organic substances for nutrition.    We look to society to give us our food, and it tells us we need money. Money never was nutrition, its the longest running joke on the planet. When I have children, I am going to buy a cabin in the middle of colorado and live out there until they are around 20 years old. I will tell them that we are the only people on earth, that there used to be countries and things but everyone else died. This will allow me to mold them to me exacting standards...  Of course, they will be encouraged to attend college when they become of age, and I know a liberal arts education will undo alot of what I had taught them. Either that or they would reject everything they were being taught... Well, it'd be interesting either way.  Ironically, I am leaving now to go entertain myself with Counter-stike... despite my editorial up there.... hey, I said I was a bastard.
