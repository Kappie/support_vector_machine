It's so different there, without alarm clocks and deadlines and traffic and noise.  I can sit for hours watching kittens wrestle with each other without feeling like I'm wasting time.  I'm sure everyone has that one safe place they can always go to, and for me it's Dudley, Texas.    So yesterday, after a fun-filled weekend of weddings, pre-Memorial Day drunkenness, and Memorial Day laziness, I decided to go for a quick run, then clean up and get back to the real world.  A little over 2 miles into my run, I noticed a little furry thing in the road--it looked like a ferret.  What in the world is a ferret doing in suburbia Dudley, one might ask.  Upon closer inspection, I discovered that the "ferret" was actually a teensy fawn, curled up in a shade.    Now, growing up in the country I know several rules about cute baby animals that one might not associate with said babies.  One is, if there is a baby, somewhere there is most likely a mother.  A very protective one.  So I was a little apprehensive about hanging out by the deer, since I could picture myself trampled to death by a vicious doe and becoming Callahan County's sixth unnatural death in two weeks.  But it was late in the afternoon and deer move in the morning and late evening, and it became obvious after a little while this guy's mother wasn't coming back.    So I sat and bonded with the little guy for a while, letting him smell me, petting him and cooing in my best mama deer impression.  Soon it was a foregone conclusion--I could not leave the baby deer there to get eaten by coyotes in a few hours.  So, after some more exercises in trust, I picked him up and carried him the 2+ miles back to the house.  It was quite revealing in regards to my potential child-rearing skills, since I felt like I should comfort the fawn somehow.  But as I tried to remember lullabies all I could think of to sing to it were Merle Haggard songs, Limp Bizkit, and "Amarillo by Morning."    We finally made it home, much to Mom's chagrin.  Infant deer apparently have to be fed every 3 hours, day and night, and are considered a delicacy by her dog and a few badass cats that live there.  So we called a few people we know that raise orphan deer (you might be a redneck if you know people who raise orphaned animals...) and found a new home for the adorable thing at a cousin's house.  (You especially might be a redneck if the person who raises orphaned animals is related to you.)  Actually, my mom's cousin has been the designated orphanage for wildlife in Callahan County for a few years now.  She said last year she raised six little deer--how fun would that be?  Maybe not very much, after a few 4AM feedings, but they're almost cute enough to justify it.  She also had some squirrels and possums.  If you don't know what a possum is, consider yourself lucky.  They are the ugliest creatures alive and I can't imagine why anyone would save them.  But one cannot discriminate on appearances when saving helpless animals.    I really wanted to bring the deer to Waco with me and nurse it to all of its 12-point glory in my backyard, but I figured that in light of recent parking disputes (in which we are completely in the right, except for Coby nailing the Mustang, and he  did  pay for it), the neighbors are looking for any excuse to call the police on us.  Possession of a deer is a huge fine, kind of like having a meth lab or something, plus it would eventually be able to hop out of the yard and roam the neighborhood.  In light of this, I think it's best that we gave the deer a nice home in the country where it will be well fed every three hours by someone that is not me.   Talk about back to nature.  You just haven't lived until you've walked 2 miles in 90 degree heat holding a miniature deer in your arms.  So cute.
