Boys are Bad, God is Good (Superchic[k] saying btw)  Princes and Frogs- Underdog Mix You hate men, is what you say And I understand how you feel that way All girls dream of a fairy tale But what you got’s like a used car sales Man trying to conceal what’s wrong, Behind a smile and a song And I’m not saying that boys are not like that But I think you should know That some of us will grow Because….  All princes start as frogs, all gentleman as dogs Just wait till it’s plain to see What we’re growing up to be Cause some frogs will still be frogs Some dogs will still be dogs But some boys can become men Just don’t kiss us til then  You found him is what you say And we all want you to feel that way The frog you’ve got seems cute enough to kiss And maybe frogs seem like that’s all there is  But just because you haven’t found your prince yet Doesn’t mean you’re still not a princess And what if your prince comes riding in While you’re kissing a frog What’s he gonna think then So look into his eyes, are you a princess or a fly?
