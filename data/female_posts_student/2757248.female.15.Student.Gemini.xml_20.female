OUR GROUP DIDNT DROP ANY BALLOONS!! YAY!!  then we layed down on our backs in a line head to head w/our arms in the air and then they put a girl on top of our hands and we had to get her to the end of the line w/using just our hands.  then these girls told us really sad stories about gettin pregnant, their abusive boyfriends, parents and guys and stuff that girls talk about.   then we broke up into small groups and "talked" --not really.  then we went back in and ATE PIZZA! it wasnt dominoes or anything but it was ok i guess. then we had these "magic card" thingys where you write someone a nice note and put it in their envelope on the wall. so we all wrote ea. other nice notes and put them in ea. others envelopes  then we listened to more girls talk about parents, guys, and stuff like that. and then we MEDITATED!!! and we had SOMEONE who kept stinking up our lil area i swear it stunk SOOO bad. but then the smell went away and we layed back down and meditated more. then we were dismissed so we went and got our "magic cards". and me and michele and julie and gwen and lexi and about 7 other ppl went outside to wait for our rides and read our magic cards! YAY! i got alot, i didnt know that many ppl liked me they made me happy.   :o)  now im here bout to take out all my pictures and put them up and be decorative for my last 2 weeks here. im excited about the move but i just found ppl that i like hangin with and its gonna be sad to leave them cause they're really sweet. even though i havent like known them all my life im gonna miss them alot. but yeah lets not get sad cause today must be a happy day cause i  FINALLY  have plans to do something tonite! i think shrr is gonna be proud!!!
