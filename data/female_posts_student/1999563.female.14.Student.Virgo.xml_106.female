Then I grabed the tonnnnnnns of bags of candy (mwa hahahha) and we headed to the car. By the time we got in the car it was like 3:40 and I was like AHHHH! WE ARE GONNA BE LATE FOR BEING EARLY!  So we headed towards Kaizer. Buttttt we got stuck the the HUGGEEEE traffic jam  I started to freak out....  So we were all like "Lalallalal...when will this ever end?" Then is FINALLY ended and it was about 4:30 and we still had 30 miles to go!!! But at least we were going fast again! yay! So we ate TONNNNS of candy and got SUPER DUPER hyper! Mwa haha! We were like singing the who0le way there. It was grand. On the way there we were listening to a little kids station. It was sooooo much fun! It was the "Absolutely Mindy Show" It was wild. Being as hyper as we all were, we decided to call Mindy and yell and scream like  lunatics. She picked up the phone as was like "HI! Itttttttttttts Mindy!!!" So we alllllllllll screamed and she was like "Uh......okaaaaaaaay" Then we sang to her "You are my sunshine"  FINALLY, after more than an hour, we saw our EXIT!!! YAYYYYY! We all screamed for JOY!  We finally arived at the church and I saw HEATHHEEEEERRRRRR!!!!!!!!!! YAY! I was like "OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH THATS HEATHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and everyone was like "uh..who is Heather?" ( Heatehjr is my awesome Superchicky friend!) So we parked and I ran out with my SUPER DUPER COOL strawberry sunglasses!  So i talked to Heather, her sister, and this guy in front of us who is obbsessed with superchick. It was cooooool! Then I looked at Heathers awesome photo album! So we got there baout 2 hours early, I just sat on the pavement, ate a bunch of candy, and talked to the other people. Then Kelsy (sp?) howed up. (My other superchicky friend!) JI didn't even know what she looked like or anything but we KNEW it was her right when she came! She was pertty spiftacular. She showed us her superchick folder and she just talked. Her brother was there tooo. He was coool. I kept hitting him on the head while we were in the mosh pit though.  :/ FINALLY they opened the doors and we were like *w00t* We finally get to go in!! But they didn't let us in. Grrrrrrr! We had to wait in a line at the door to the sanctuary for like a half an hour. it was sooooooo boring. All these people kept going in and out of the doors- everytime we thought we would get to go in, but they would never let us in. GR! Finnnallly, they let us in. But then we had to wait for another half an hour. GRRRRRR! Finally Sending Jonah started. They were ok..not really my style though. I was SUPER impatient so I was all like "WHEN WILL THIS EVER END?" And I think I said it a little to loud.  They played about 5 songs...then they left. I was like "YAYYY! SUPERCHICK TIME!" Then they had to give out alllllllllll this free stuff. GRRRR!!! Then FINALLY superchick started!!! Yay! It was awesome...expect for the whole mosh pit thing... There was like a 5 year old girl right next to me. It was pretty crazy. At least Heather and I jumped!!!!!!  It was a pretty normal concert..... OOOOOH! SKWID WAS WEARING A SANTA SUIT! It was sooooooooooo funnny!!!!!!  I took a tonnnnnn of pictures.  Then the concert ended and we went outside and sat by the merch tbale until there was no one left in the line for autographs. It was pretty spiffy! I got to talk to them for a long time and I got pictures with them! It was pretty funny because on Thursday I got my RE:Generation CD in the mail and I had them sign it. It was the FIRST TIME they had EVER seen the CD!!!!!!!!!!!! They were all like "Where did you get this?!?!?!?!?!" So they all passsed it around. Max thought "It turned out better than I thought it would!" Max wasn't at the autograph table and I really wanted to talk to him so Heather, Heather (my friend  ), Katie, Johanna, Sara, Heidi, and I waited out side the door for a lonnnnnnng time. Then Dave wentin where Max was and we told him to go get Max for us and he did! YAY! So we got to talk to Max for a long time! It was awesome! Then Melissa came up to me and put her arm on my sholder and was like "It was good to see you here tonight!" It was AWESOMMMMME! I was like "WHOA! HER ARM ON IS MY SHOULDER!"  Then we were all SUPER tired even though it was only 11:30 so we decided to go home. On our way home we got slurpees at 7/11. They were gooood! All the people in there looked at us super funny because we had our concert outfits on. Haha. It was great. Well..I guess whats all!
