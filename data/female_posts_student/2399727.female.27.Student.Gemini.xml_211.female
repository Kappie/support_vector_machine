Heading back to Hamilton for a weekend of beautification.  Highlights tomorrow, first-ever pedicure and second-ever manicure on Friday.  Lots of Psych reading to do too.  Blah.  My life is Psych reading these days.    Peterborough is drying out.  I noticed a sign on TV that said: "Welcome to Peterborough!  76% dry!"    Dad got home safely from Warsaw/Krakow.  He was delayed because of thunderstorms but only arrived 1.5 hours late.    I've been set up on a date on Wednesday with a friend's friend.  I  have a few reservations about it that I won't get into here.    I climbed between my sheets at 5:30pm and intend to stay there until 11:30pm, sleep from then until 7:30am or so and then start the fun that will be my Thursday.    More to come...
