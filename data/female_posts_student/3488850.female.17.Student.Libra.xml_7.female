The bus terminated at Toa Payoh bus interchange, and from there, i took Mrt to meet him.   There's some miscommunication on the meeting point. Lolz, okay, it's my fault.   Today he wore a black long sleeve shirt and black pants. That made him Man In Black, lolz.  We went to PS as i suggested, and we watched a movie. As usual, I enjoyed spending time with him. hehez.  We ate Yoshinoya... hehez, hoped i got the name correct. Ahh... today, he paid for everything... except I paid for the Nacho n drink for movie. I have to pay for something... MOney doesnt come easy for him... Heartache always... Nxt time, i must do something to his wallet. Hehez.   ** I cant wait to see him the next time.    Today, we talked abit more. We talked about revealing our relationship to my parents. I longed to do that, but no right time n no courage to do it. For the first time, he encouraged me. I asked  him whether he is prepared to meet...?  A question for him to ponder?    But i dont know what will happen if my relationship is to reveal to all my other friends, from church, from primary school... i know some of them are rather concern for me... i Hope i wont hurt them...   But I still must strive to survive this ordeal, of revealing to my parents, no matter what the outcome is like.  Can i Overomce???
