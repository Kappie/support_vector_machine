And there's this book with a chic chick that's totally fallen for a photographer, both of whom are supah dupah rich. . .But yeah, she's completely for him and he seems to distance himself at times, because that's best for his work. She reminds me of how sad some become because they are "in love" and it's like "eh!?. . .???" Makes me wonder at times, you know?. . .  [Oh, and in the book her name is basically "Moi"]
