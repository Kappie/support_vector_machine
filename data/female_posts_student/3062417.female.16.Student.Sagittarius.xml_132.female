I really like hanging out with Gavin. He makes me laugh and smile all the time. I don't know many people that can make me do that. I'm so happy that we are friends and everything worked out for the best.   Today it seems as if life couldn't get much better. I mean I finally seem to have friends that truely care about me and how I feel about things. And people actually want to hang out with me and talk to me on the phone and stuff. It makes me feel a lot better when I realize how much my friends really do care and that they will always be there for me.  Today I had to babysit Paige. Talk about boredom. Well atleast I'm getting some money out of it. Then we went to Ward's for dinner. After that I came home and talked to Carol for a bit and watched some tv. Now I'm online and I'm home alone yet again until about 10 so if anyone wants to come keep me company that would be the greatest.  Tomorrow I'm either babysitting Paige again or I'm going with Carol to take the 5 hour so I can get my licence hopefully by the end of July and then buy a car right after that.  Listening to: [Where To Begin by Bowling For Soup]  Sail away, sail away with me I don't have a ship  But we could get one easily Drift away, drift away with me On the raft we'll make of memories On an ocean we can call forever more   [Pre chorus:] I want to find A piece of your mind I want to see Your make believe I don't want to try so hard I make it hard for you to breathe  [Chorus:] Jump into the ocean Living on a notion If you're caught up in the motion Back track and do it again And if you make it up I could never get enough Me and you together But you've gotta tell me where to begin  Break away, break away from me No forget that, just sit here and look at me Summer's day Summer every day And we watch the sunset come back up And somehow know it never goes back down  [Pre chorus]  [Chorus]  I've been saving up to buy more time with you You've been living it up with someone else And that's okay with me Because I know it and you know it too  [Chorus]
