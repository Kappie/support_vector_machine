Tish and i are going back and forth being really lovey to blah wit h each other and it is making me crazy. Not to mention the fact that yet agian she is hidding something and wont tell me about it. Why is my relationship so unsteady? I seriously go from be mad about her to mad at her in a matter of seconds. I dont know whats going on. I dont know how much more i can or even want to take at this point. If she is hiding stupid stuff from me than i can only imagine what else she is not telling me about. I just dont know i am so confused. I wish i had some friends here or my family.I am pretty sure if things with Tish dont work out that i will move back down to SO CAL.I hate to think like that but it is true.    I have nothing exciting to report about today. Maybe tomorrow... i have Noah all day i am hoping he is in a good mood so that we can go out and do something fun together. I really need to work on my report that is due on Tues. I think that maybe i have been putting it off more because i dont really like the class. I dont think i really want to be a medical asistant. I just wanna be a rock star.Why couldnt i have just been a rock star???? Is that really to much to ask?   I guess so.    Well i am off to confront Tish(i might be back later to blog about the fight)Why does love have to be so much work? I know that it takes some work but damn this is ALOT.   N
