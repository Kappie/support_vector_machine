I’m retaking Math 205 (Computer Science) since I didn’t pass when I took with Stegemoller in the spring, and one runs Monday-Thursday, 8-930am. Most of the work is done in class, so I’m not too worried about that class. Plus, this guy Ritterskamp has already taught me more than Stegemoller ever did and it’s only the third day of class. So I’m pretty happy about that. My Math Methods class is a little tougher, but it’s not as bad as I was thinking it was going to be. That class runs Tuesday-Thursday, 415-715pm, which sucks because those are the only nights that Todd is home early. But, at least it’s only for a month. The prof is pretty strict and the workload is going to be like those of my previous methods classes, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. At least we’re not doing formulas and whatnot; this class is more like the psychology behind teaching math, and it’s actually kind of interesting.     I’m really happy I don’t have classes on Fridays because that way I can work all day and my mind can take a break from thinking in school mode for three days. Yeah right. I still have a shitload of work to do for class plus I have to catch up on the housework I’ve englected for the past few days. The cages, dishes, vacuuming, my desk, the bathroom…     Todd is wanting to go over to Harrisburg to play pool with Tyler and to visit Reger’s grave since he’s taking Saturday and Sunday off. I don’t mind if he wants to go, but I’ve got too much to do to go over there with him. I haven’t told him that yet, but I will tonight. I really hope that doesn’t deter him from going because I know he wants to. Hell, I want to go too, but it’s just not feasible on my end right now.    Sunday, Todd and I got new sneakers. I got a pair of white New Balance cross-trainers; the first new pair of sneakers I’ve had in I don’t know how long. I’ve always heard that New Balance shoes are really comfortable, and that they are. Of course, they  are  new shoes so they’re bound to feel ten times better than my old ratty Adidas sneakers did. Anyway, so I only got to wear them like twice before a hole was torn in the side. I’m not sure if it happened on one of the machines at the YMCA or if I inadvertently kicked something, but yesterday I took them back and exchanged them for a brand new pair. So once again, I am happy.    I’m so glad it’s Thursday. The last day of classes for the week, yippee! I’m thinking that when I get home I’m going to do the dishes, clean the cages, and do some homework, but I seriously doubt I’ll be that ambitious. Todd will be at Sky’s for his pool league, so he won’t be home when I get there. Maybe I’ll just take off all my clothes, have a nice hot shower, and drink a tall margarita while surfing the net.    Sounds like a great plan to me.
