All My Weirdness:  "It's like it smells so good, it smells like apple, apple apple apple - (mimes pouring shampoo into his mouth) and then... it doesn't taste like apple." -Alex talking about eating non-edible things that smell good  "Do they need a ride? Wait, I don't know those girls. (pause) They don't need a ride." -Alex   "It's easy to be cool when you're as hot as Mandy or Megan but when your name is Justin you really have to try." -written on the orchestra room board  (in history, we did a group project involving city-states in Ancient Greece.) Brandon: (who was supposed to do the family tree of our c.s.'s god) Our shrine sucks. Ryan: (who did the shrine) Well, I'd say something about the family tree, but THERE ISN'T ONE!
