It's easy to tell yourself that no one cares, and its your life to fuck up but in reality people do care and the whole "no one cares" routine is just an excuse to slack off.  I may be screwing up my life, but that's my fault and I'm choosing not to care about that too much right now.  Well I'm choosing to care about it and whine but not actually do anything proactive to fix the problem.  Its my life, my fault I didn't keep up with things and now all I want is pity I don't deserve.  Actually I want for the mess to go away but aside from that I'll settle for pity and my self respect back, because right now I look in the mirror and see nothing but this lazy self centered spoiled brat.
