In related, but unrelated news, I haven't taken my Paxil in over a week and except for this one wired auditory side-effect I'm doing fine.  Normally I get very nauseous and sick and tired and icky, but I consciously decided to stop taking it rather than just running out of it and I'm doing well.  I guess there is something to be said for being generally happy and functioning normally.  Friday Doogie came up here to CT and we had planned on having some sushi and renting The Two Towers and just vegging and maybe building a blanket fort in my super comfy bed, but this didn't end up being the plan.   Ashley (yes, the girl I was having all the loan problems with) called me up to tell me how the problem was getting resolved and she ended up telling me a lot of really bad news she was having so I offered to take her out for one drink, also to give Dennis a chance to meet her.  My friend Stacey was having a party at our favorite watering hole, The Turtle (which has since been renamed the Hungry Hamster), and the plan was to just go for one drink.  Well, prior to even getting there the drama started.  I don't want to get into it in case some of the people involved actually read this, but it was MEGA dramatic.  One drink turned into three or four or maybe more.  There was some dancing, some more drama and some spilled drinks, but all in all it was fun.  It was an interesting way for Dennis to meet some of my friends, but now he knows I don't make all the drama up, LOL.   We got back to my house and there were a few disasters with a martini shaker filled with various schnapps (Jon, think Sudi's upside down martini shaking) and a piece of lemon coconut cake that I wasn't apparently meant to have.  It was funny for me though cause I was a "maroon" as the boy says, but he knows he was laughing too.  We got snuggly for a lil bit and fell asleep together for a nap, it was really sweet.  Saturday was a parade in Pearl River where Dennis and his boys from "The Hut" were marching.  They all looked awesome in their uniforms and clean up real nice.  They won two trophies as well.  After the parade, there was a lot, and I mean a lot of beer drinking.  What is it about free beer that makes it taste so good?  Anyhow, I got to know some of the people there from the fire house a little better and ate some yummy food and danced and laughed a lot.  It was a pretty good time.  Let me tell ya 2 things I've learned:  1) firemen can DRINK 2) firemen can really have a good time. I'm a little scared of the "mysterious cowboy fireman" and his line dancing ways (no, I did NOT line dancee), but it was another really nice night.    We definitely weren't meant to get our sushi this weekend, but next weekend we've agreed regardless of what else comes up one night is definitely going to be a movie/sushi/snuggling night ofgoodnesss.  Oh yeah and tomorrow I am getting that fancy new IO digital cable so I will be able to wax intellectual on the marvels of TechTV, Noggin, and all the other "money" channels that all the cool kids are talking about these days.  Oh yeah, I'll also finally have HBO again.  YAY YAY YAY!
