THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON"T CELEBRATE THIS HOLIDAY ONLY: But for those who don't believe in these celebrations, just remember what we are celebrating, FREEDOM. If not for freedom you wouldn't have a choice in celebrating this. And you have a real problem if u think we praise the flag. It's not the flag we are honoring, it's the purpose and the reason for the flag. People died for Freedom. If you hate freedom, what America stands for, then just go live in Iraq, cuz they don't like freedom either. I don't say this just to be mean. I just am patriotic, and it really hurts that all these people have and are dying so that we could be free, and people make fun of the pledge, and make stupid claims like we praise the flag and stuff, and it makes me kind of upset. I hope this doesn't offend anyone.Really.  ~Peace n Love~  Pro-life rocks. God Bless.                           **Stef**
