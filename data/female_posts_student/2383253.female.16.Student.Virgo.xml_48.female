I think it was good that the movie was sold out because we needed time to talk like bitchy girlfriends. From the Coffee Bean to the beach to Del Mar to all the way up the 101, it was just one of those nights that you know you're going to miss when you're older and thinking about high school. By the way, I'd like to say that I'm completely over Torrey Pines. I understand why everyone thinks that this school sucks. An overwhelming portion of the people that go here are either snobby people from Del Mar or pretentious bitches from CV...and Heather, you made a good point when you said that people think that we haven't changed since 7th grade. I don't know what it is about this area or the community, but the longer I'm here the more uncomfortable and cold it seems to me. I really used to wish that I had grown up here from when I was really little, but now I'm glad I haven't been a Del Mar person my whole life cause I don't like how they turn out at all. And that kind leads into our evil plan with the RB people and what we're gonna accomplish (haha) over the summer. Which reminds me: I'm really looking forward to this summer. This'll be the first time since 4th grade that I get to spend a summer at home. I'm sad that I'm not going to see any hot Greek boys, but I've never spent a full summer in California and hopefully I'll get to take full advantage of it. And the driving privileges will surely come in handy. Notes to self: must buy Cookie Monster lunchbox.                must go exploring more.                must try heroin by the end of the summer. (KIDDING! :P)  Yeah I'm pretty tired. But the ocean air made me feel really happy and I've had a really good day (and the coffee didn't hurt). Which worries me, because I think my brain's in summer mode already, and that means that I probably won't accomplish anything for the remainder of school. Actually, I think that's a good thing.   Love, Enchilada  P.S.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I hope our plans for the end-of-school thing will work out. Note to Heather and me: Charthouse. :)
