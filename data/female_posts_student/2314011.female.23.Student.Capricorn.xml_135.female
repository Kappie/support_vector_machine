       
      So this is the first day of the fourth week of school.  We've had 9 Contracts classes; my typed notes for the class have reached 14 pages.  We're allowed a 10 page outline for the final.    Sometimes all you (and by "you", I mean "me") can do is laugh, shake your head and start reading the next two cases for tomorrow's class.
