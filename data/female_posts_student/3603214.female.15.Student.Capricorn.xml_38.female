Ditto to Tasha's comment *YAY! *golf clap**, but coming from the broken family point of view, I would have to disagree with certain things. I know it's wrong to cheat, blah blah blah, but I'm talking about the "If you're considering a divorce, reconsider. Think of your children, think of your families' lives after divorce." comment. Sometimes a divorce can be a good thing. Maybe not in the eyes of God or your peers. That just sounded terrible and is not helping my point...Maybe, just maybe, a divorce might be the answer to make one happy. I speak as the child affected. I am happier since my parents' separation. It may not seem like it, but I am. And that might make me a selfish, hypocritical brat, but I have feelings and opinions too. Why live in misery? So maybe I can't help society right now, but in the future, I'll consider it...  Okay, I know that I might have had a slight change in heart, but you know, coming back home for my dad would almost be like offering a robber everything you own. I can't think of a better analogy, so that'll do for now. All I have to say is my dad ruins everything eventually. I can't trust. I know he's trying to change for the better, but there's that part of me that doubts.  My mother asked me, "So, if your husband cheated on you, you would say it's over? Just like that?" and I responded, "Yes. Because no human being deserves to be treated like that. Letting him back would be something that he wants once again, and you're handing it over on a silver platter." I don't remember if I said it exactly like that, but that was what I was aiming for at the time.  There, I was redundant, but I don't really care. I got my point across...
