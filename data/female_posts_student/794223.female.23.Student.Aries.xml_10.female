If anyone even ATTEMPTS to come up to me and talk about how stressed they are, they've got another thing coming.  So just when I thought that the study abroad credit processing for Cuba was over, here comes yet another road block.  Not only did it take over a year for my 4th grade to reach UT, but now study abroad can't process my credits because the courses from Cuba need to meet specific requirements for the stupid-ass Spanish "concentration" that goes along with the Latin American Studies degree.  As a matter of fact, there has been so much grief in the past 3 or 4 years, and so much bickering between the LAS department, study abroad, and the College of Liberal Arts, that Latin American Studies is (finally) re-writing requirements for the degree; the current requirements are a red-tape procedural NIGHTMARE.  So now I am going to have to write 3 new course description forms, that I shouldn't have to write, so that the Spanish, Latin American Studies, and Liberal Arts departments can all fight over whether or not I get Spanish credit for courses conducted in Spanish in a Spanish speaking country.  Then, yesterday I get a letter in the mail saying that the GRE people had, apparently, lost my application and fees.  I am applying for extended time due to my learning disability (OCD); and that too has been a bureaucratic nightmare.  I had to have my psychiatrist write a letter not once, not twice, but 3 TIMES in order for UT to sign off on it, only to get a letter from the GRE people stating that they wouldn't accept the form from UT and that I would have to submit documentation to them "directly".  I am running out of time--I need to apply to Graduate Schools soon, and to do that I need to have already taken the GRE by like, yesterday.    So basically, people who are not doing their jobs and not communicating with me correctly are making my life miserable.  And I've already mentioned the "you can't apply to graduate and be simultaneously enrolled at ACC" mess.  Fortunately, that's about the only thing that has been worked out so far.  I feel as if I am in my senior year of highschool at Westlake all over again.  I feel like I am going to get a diploma IN SPITE OF everyone and everything at UT and elsewhere.  I work so hard, do things so dilligently, and then every time I turn around some ass-hole who is not doing their job throws another road block in my face.  For the past week now I have been bawling my eyes out, suffering from nausea-causing migraines, and no sleep.  I am almost to the breaking point.  But all I can do is turn it over to the Lord, because there is only so much that I can handle.  God must have infinitely more patience than I, and I am a pretty patient person.  The incompetance and disgrace with humanity would make me give up long ago if I were in His shoes.  And so He dies for us to give us yet ANOTHER chance, and we continue to be ass-holes.  Infinite patience.  He has infinite patience.
