I acquired the title of Dine-Out Queen from Sarah because almost every restaurant i go to, i have an official waiter or someone who knows what i get everytime lol.  For example, the Quizno's guy (i don't know his name lol!) knows what i get the Beef and Cheddar sandwich, extra cheese, mustard only, no tomato or mayonaise, lettuce and spices; Kenny knows that i get a coke with an individual sized pepperoni pizza (he's been my waiter since he started his job at Boston's, a whole year now!); Victor knows i get a coke with cheese fries (but thats partially because we were in a class together my freshman year).  lol i know, i'm retarded.  Anyways, so we ate there and were stupid for awhile and then we decided to go to the dollar movie theatre.  We saw Ella Enchanted, oh man the Prince Char guy is sooo cute!!!  Other than that, the movie was pretty good, our group were like the only people laughing....it was amusing.  Then we dropped Sarah off and we went back to the quiznos parking lot so i could get my car, but before we all left we sat in Kendra's car, drinking Peach Fitness water and chatted about our love lives.  Kendra found it the perfect time to make fun of how i go for blonde finnish hockey players with longish blonde hair, lol!  Shawn was describing her cousin and Kendra's like "oh is he finnish?  does he play hockey?  does he have longish blonde hair?  if so, mercer will love him!", i was just like shutup kenny.  hehe anyways fun stuff.  already, just like last year, i am starting to feel the emptiness that is the lack of hockey in my life.  I hate summer!  well actually, i like summer just minus the no-hockey part.  Why can't they have a summer hockey season just like they have a fall baseball thing!?  i'm out!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
