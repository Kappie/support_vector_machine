Today while folding my laundry I took the time to watch  Bend it Like Beckham  which I *ahem* "acquired" from the world wide web. ;  I was surprised by how much I like this movie revolving around that most loathsome of sports - soccer. The acting was exquisite and the laughs were numerous. I'd suggest all of you go rent a copy like decent citizens of your fine respective nations and city states. ;)  It also doesn't hurt that the two leading ladies were so luscious!     That's Parminder K. Nagra. I've always had a soft spot for an Indian face, and Miss Nagra is a real beaut.     Of course. The gorgeous Keira Knightley needs no introduction. :-D Girls with British accents are so sexy!
