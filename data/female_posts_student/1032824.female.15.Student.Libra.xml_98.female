Talking about Christmas pressies, I went Christmas shopping a coupla' days back and bought heaps of chocolates, soft toys, flowers, cards and earings. I don't really mind spending all that I've got in my piggy bank because Christmas is all about giving... and sharing... and being happy.  Yesterday's campcraft training showed improvement in terms of our team spirit and the quality of our tents! I am incredibly impressed by our never give up spirit. Seniors beng, xiongster, edwin all played in the mud.. barefooted. Haha. So gross I tell ya! But it seemed rather fun.. and Jolene kept whining because she wanted to join in the fun by taking off her shoes too. Nana and I were craving for food by the time training ended so we went to BB's Mac and bought ice cream! YUMMMY! She bought bubblegum flavour while I purchased my all time favourite, HOT FUDGE!   Val, Pinky, Faizal, Beng and I caught  Lord of the rings . Yay like finally! I was desperate to see it. The movie was  marvellous . The sceneries were jaw-dropping and the hunks and babes were all so adorable.  Must see it .. :) Faizola and Beng met me below my block to return me $ and we talked quite a bit before returning home for dinner. I didn't want to go back up so soon actually. I should've walked them to the bus stop. I have so much to say.
