THE WORD OF THE DAY --> Bag.        it's really useful, especially for women. they keep everything they can inside their bags. wallet, perfume, lipstick, mobile, adress book (bc mobile is fuul of numbers...useful or not), pen, other pen in case of the ink of the first pen's over, tampons, glasses for reading, sunglasses, lost coins, lost rings, earrings or bracelets or all kind of that stuff, a little mirror, eyeliner, and so on and NO, this is not a travelling bag...it's just a women's bag! u want to know what men keep in their bags? hum...i don't know...probably they don't use any bag....   ***take care***   is it me or this post is kinda huge?
