Will it ever end? lol I'm just kidding! I'm actually looking forward to living with my sister again. She and I are a lot alike, and I love her... like a SISTER. :D  My sunburn is totally gone now, and it has left behind a wicked suntan. Beautiful stuff for my picnic on sunday! Slap on a fake tattoo or three, and woo woo!  g2g  ambler  I'm a barbie girl...
