But we should go in a huge group when this scary one comes out.  :) Today I got work and then homework and tomorrow I got work (which will consist of trying to hide from those hwo do drama who will be at school and will be coming into see me, grrr) and after work I meeting Paul (hopefully I haven't quite asked him yet, LOL.) and will be wandering down to the park because I need to take pictures of the woods for textiles. Gah. And I don't wanna go down on my own so. Um. Yea. FFS, why is it snowing????
