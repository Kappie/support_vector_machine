The turn out wasn't great, but my old friend was there.  He was so pleased I noticed that he was absent the week before.  I guess he realized someone does care.  The food was crazy!  In addition to our typical sandwich and soup fare, we had 144 hot dogs, lasagna, bread pudding, apples and a big slab cake with "Thanks for the goat times" on it.  That got some raised eyebrows but I hear it was good stuff.  I was run off my feet but enjoyed it.  Time flew.  I'm going to miss it.   Of course, there's aspects to every activity we don't like and so there were a few things I would have liked to see done differently, but it was a good experience overall and I'm so pleased that the student volunteers allowed me to help out in the second term.  Came back here, did a load of laundry, called Fr. D. for an appointment after Easter.  Still waiting for a response.  Going home tomorrow.  E., how was rez?  More to come...
