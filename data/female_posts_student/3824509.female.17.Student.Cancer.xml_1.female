I also discovered today that no matter how hard you try you will end up having a klutsy moment. hehe I also went bowling today which is where is occurred * hey Bri remember that place we went bowling when you came up? That whereI went lol* I was winning in the game and allI needed was 2 pins win the entire thing. Right? So what does moron do? Throw two gutter balls in a row! What are the chances of that? I had yet to get a gutter ball too! But oh well. You not what else I learned? No matter how hard you try people will still drift away and find better people than you. However as long as you have at least one true friend it all is good! well to you people I saw MUAH
