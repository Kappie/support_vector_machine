Anyway, my brother will not be going as he is having tution and there is Matrix tonight! ^_^ Oh, by the way, I vivited this Super Dollfie's website. It is actually dolls with very real human features acept that they have this very very big eyes. And they are very expensive as they are made in Japan. You can even customize their faces and body...Haiz... How I wish I can have one.... ( o * - * o )....
