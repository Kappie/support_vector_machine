Thou art vivid and true.  If only I might take the time to write you!  I keep writing down little bits of my story, but much more of it waits in my head.  I don't like the word "story."  Thesaurus.com will help me think of a better word.  Okay, thesaurus.com isn't very helpful.  I'll just call it my novel.  Anyway, I fear that I shall spend much time only to find it is stupid and long.  But I assume it will be.  But it must be written, if nothing else, just to be written.  It awaits writing.  It nags me!  Gah!  Oh, I  do  think I've cracked.  I'm going to camp on July 4th.  Camp Wapsie.  The camp everyone goes to.  And I fear it, for its popularity.  But I will be away from home for a week, an idea which suits me nicely.  And I know of no one from my school but Abbu that is going that week, so that is comforting.  And I had signed up for the horseback riding lessons, but they were full, but Abbu got in, so she said she was going to drop out, but then they called me and had an opening, so I got in, and Abbu didn't drop, so all is awesome.  I think I'll have fun.  I know I'll have fun.  As long as I don't have to spend too much time with snobbish teenage girls.  Can't think.  I had one or two other things I was going to write about...if I think of them I'll post them.
