All I know right now is that my Sifu is busy on his mission to have all his students in the best shape they have ever been in, this meens he'll end up in great shape to. The man doesn't stop. He has the strongest stonach, I swear it's like punching a brick wall. But then he's always been very physical.   Well I should go now as my cat seems to be reluctant to allow me to continue.
