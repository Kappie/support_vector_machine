Why should i even be thinking about him when he doesnt If all he can talk to me about  WHEN HE'S IN LONDON is "oh i'm having a bad flu, a bad nose,dying liao" then so be it. Wat else can i say? And the next thing tat comes is "oh i'm at starbucks working on my work" Reali tats all tat i mean to him I'm never good enough for him to have any real conversation with. He sux. Big time.  But think of it this way, Its gotta end someday sweetie. If it's not today, its tomorrow, next week, next month, 3 months later, 6 months later or a year later Its gotta end. Someday, somehow. You can hold on to this for the next 6 months and nothing's gonna change. He's not gona turn around and say, "Hey gal,let's be together.  I wana be with you". No!Its not gona happen that way. Never is it gona be. So stop dreaming oki? Wake up from your dream. There's many out there who loves and cares for you. Why do you only want attention from him? Do you wana be with a guy who treats you like dirt? Be strong my dear. Get him out of your system. Give yourself one month to get him out of your head, out of your life. Truly, if you wana build a new life, you gotta break free from the 3 of them. You're doing great for the other 2. So what's stopping you from this last one? Baby he's the last one. Break free from him and you can truly say to yourself. My new life has began. One month darling And off you go to Tioman. Doesn't it sound like a great plan? Do it gal. You can do it.
