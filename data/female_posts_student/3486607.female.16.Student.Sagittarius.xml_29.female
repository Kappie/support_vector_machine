Struggling to be released from my imprisonment as the victim of large glowing utters, I nearly broke a hoof.  My wife explained to me that it was for the better of our relationship... but was this really true? Was my transformation really intended to strengthen our love? or perhaps was I in for a much bigger scheme devised by a greater power?  Why is it that I had to turn into a cow? Why is it that she didn't turn into a human? Could I trust her and live in peace and harmony with this alien race and live happily ever after? or would I have to go Duke Nukem Gone Bovine on these aliens?  . . .
