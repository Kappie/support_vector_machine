I think it has to do with actually having to write it out and then having to hide it. But with this, I just type (and I'm a quick typer if I do say so myself) and I can be online talking to people at the same time. Call it lazy if you want but I think this is a lot better than writing in a journal. And plus, you guys get a pretty good view at my life. Any who, I have a damn lot to tell you and a damn lot  not  to tell you so let's get on with it.      Friday night I went to bed at 5am. I would have stayed up later but Eddie was going to take a shower and told me to go to sleep. So I went to bed. I got up at around 11 because there were these strange girls knocking on my door, (my parents and sis weren't home and Eddie was sleeping) trying to sell some crap but I didn't answer the door so they left. Then I ate breakfast and Annie called me and asked me if I wanted to come over and I said sure so I got ready and left. Carly, Cook, and Ree were already there. As I walked in their all like, "Wow.  She's all dressed up.  She's wearing make up and she has her hair done and we're just like blah." They were like "scrubby." I was only wearing capris and a yellow tank top. How is that dressed up? Then we just sat around, being dumb, and hanging out. Then Annie mentioned calling Alex so we called Alex and he was like, "Where are you at? We'll be there in a few." So Alex, Jeremy, and Dominik came over Annie's. They took Carly and Annie's little brother for a ride around the block so yeah. I wasn't in the car so I don't know how that went. Later, they left and I went home to shower and get my stuff because I was gonna sleep over and then we were all gonna go to the beach in the morning. So I get there again and Alex, Dominik, Sam, and Jeremy are all there. I was caught off guard. They went to Wendy's for a minute and came back to eat. They stayed for awhile after that. Yeah. Some things happened. I was a little stressed out over one thing because I felt something was  blown way out of proportion.  And I pretty much became uncomfortable. I tried calling Katie but she wasn't home so I was pretty much ready to  bawl my eyes out  but then Chris came over so I didn't. I was miserable and confused for a lot of the night. Then some how I became  "me"  again and was asking stupid questions such as " Are a boner and being hard the same thing?  Because I think they are but I'm just asking" and beating Chris up. We were talking about masturbating and all that have fun stuff. We were pretty much harassing Chris with dumb questions. Then Mrs. Laboda came to pick him up and we all ended up in her van listening to music and talking. Tracy looked at a Kleenex box and thought it was donuts and everyone was like, "Whoa...donuts." Well, everyone except for me. You know me, my diet. So then this idea of going to get donuts popped in our heads. It was like 1am but we all left to go to Dunkin Donuts. Well, let's just say there was  a whole lot of drama  surrounding that issue and in the end, we didn't get any donuts.  Or anything else for that matter.  Carly straight up flipped at us and we weren't really fighting but she wasn't talking to us. So Carly slept in the living room that night. The rest of us stayed up til god knows when but we were pretty much bouncing off the walls. We were eating junk, Tracy and I were trying to read Tom Sawyer but that wasn't working out for me so I quit, and just being retarded. I slowly became tired and then we all went to bed. It was a bitch! I slept in the bed with Annie and we had to share a blanket because Reea and Tracy needed the other so we had to share. And let's just say, Annie was cold last night and I didn't get too much of the blanket. I just remembered some of my dream from last night but it's hard to explain so don't worry about it.      Today I woke up around 9:30. Yes, 9:30.  No, I'm not crazy.  I was going to the beach. So we all got up and got ready. I didn't wanna burn my back even more so I actually put sun screen on it for once. Alex told us to call him before we left for the beach so I did. At first he said he didn't think he had a car but then he called back to say he was going. So yeah. The beach.  I love the beach.  We played a lot of volleyball and swam and we went to the pier. Then Alex, Dominik, and Jeremy came up there. They were playing football and we wanted to eat so we just watched them for a little bit and then went and played with them. Everyone else went in the water but me and Alex just stayed out and played "soccer" for a little bit. It was with a volleyball so it wasn't really soccer but whatever. Then we all started playing a volleyball game. I was disappointed that I was on Carly's team. LoL!  I love her  but the girl doesn't pay attention sometimes. So blah, blah, blah. Eventually they left and we made friends with two guys (one of whom was really cute) and were talking to them and playing football in the water. Oh yeah, I can't believe I forgot.  My foot.  My foot was still hurting me. I think the worst it's ever hurt. I was on  the verge of tears  at that point. It hurt like a bitch just to walk on it. So yeah, it continued throughout the whole day and even now it still hurts. Any who. Tim and Machy were their names. Tim I guess was 19, although I don't believe it. He was the  hot  one. Machy was 6 and sweet. Machy goes to Fairport Harbor for school. The one team we actually beat for track this year!  Go us!  We were talking about drinking and things and they invited us to their friends part for that night. We all knew we wouldn't go but it was cool to be invited. So yeah. We tanned, played volleyball, had a pretty good time. By the way, I got Tim and Machy's numbers. LoL. I'm not exactly sure why I did but people wanted me to so I did. We were   there for like 6 hours! So we went back to Annie's, got our stuff, and went home. I came home, unpacked, sorta cleaned my room, took a shower, and got ready for soccer. I wasn't going to be running so I was like yeah, I'll just shower now. So then I went to soccer. We just patched the field and crap. But then I talked to the coach about my foot. See, I was going to go see my doctor but he told me to go see the trainer for the football team since she's a "sports" doctor. I just hope it feels better really soon because I have a scrimmage against South  on Thursday ! Then they were playing keep away so I left. Annie, Carly, and Ree were at Chris' and wanted me to go but I wasn't sure if I wanted to or not. In the end, I went at 10ish. Alex came and took us to Wendy's. All Carly there. Then we were just chilling for awhile and left to go to Taco Bell and then he dropped us all off. And now I'm here. I'm skipping a lot of things because I'm sooo super tired and I have to get up around 8 and I'm out. There's a lot more but whatever. That can wait.    By the way, guys have some weird obsession with Taco Bell.
