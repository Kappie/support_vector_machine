Everyone else has gone to bed. We lonesome teenagers linger, yearning for company nearer our own age. Apparently, we think ourselves more likely to discover it in the early morning.  I know what his question is. I asked him the same not a day before. I'd been avoiding his eyes as he came down the stairs, embarrassed for my own audacity. But he came towards me, and he spoke. "I'm seventeen," I say, setting aside my book and lifting my cooling coffee to my lips. I don't even like it; I take my coffee Irish. This is not an option here. For my age group, at least. He pulls out the empty chair across from me, looking quizzically. I nod. He sets down his near-empty glass. Knowing I would need it from the coffee, I slip a lifesaver from my pocket and into my mouth.  An hour or two later: We're walking on deck. I'm too restless to simply sit still and chat, and he's humoring me. We stalk the cold promenade, looking down at the fourteen- and fifteen-year olds in the hot tub below us.  "Look," he says, pointing at an unidentifiable yellow light in the distance, toward shore,"a streetlamp." I laugh. "It's a buoy." "No. Streetlamp." "For the Eskimos?"I ask. He nods solemnly.  We discuss the little-visible landscape for a long while. At last, a surprising change: far off in the diamond speckledsky, a star falls.  "Was that-" I say. "Whoa," he says. Even this far north, comet sightings are rare. He looks at me from where he stands leaning against the railway to my left. I feign interest in the view for a moment, then give in and turn toward him. I smile a bit and nibble my lip. I know where this is going. And why shouldn't it? Some god has given us a divine signal that screams,  do it! . My heart is fluttering. I'm still so much a little girl.  He reaches out and brushes my cheek with his fingertips. My mind is squealing like a twelve year old at an N'Sync concert. I never liked them. I smile at him, pushing back the edge of my flapper cap, from the shameful designers at American Eagle. He's a brand name boy, though, and he respects it. Ok.  Moves in. I'm lost. Here we go. Forget the 'tweens' below, watching us, surely. Perhaps their eager young virgin bodies will be inspired to greater efforts than poolside flirting.  Mmm. Hands on his neck, don't you dare back off now. His hand is hot on my waist, sliding under my vintage denim jacket, well-worn sprite-green sweatshirt. Hands on his shoulders, a hand on my lumbar, a hand on my neck.  We stagger over to the wall, lean there for a moment, clumsily move away from the pools. No one goes this way, we know. Safe here. Cold cold  cold .  "Here let's go inside", someone says. Was it me? 'Have you seen that commercial,' a guy named M once asked me, 'where the chick and the guy make out in an elevator?' We didn't.  But then, a guy named S got M's wish. O dear. All the way down six floors. Nobody's here to witness. All the sane have gone to sleep. "My room is empty," he whispers. Yes. After telling me we were going on a cruise, my dad spent the next hour outlining the various punishments we would suffer if we brought someone into  our  room. Apparently someone else's room slipped his mind. A boy named S. Whose sticky mouth tastes like sugar. And a girl.  I'm lost.
