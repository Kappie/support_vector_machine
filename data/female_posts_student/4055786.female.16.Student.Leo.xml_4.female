I joined the Ukiah Swim Team and I made a lot of friends there they all convinced me to go to Ukiah High and I said yes. I met all these nice people, I met Tess Pasternak, Wiltly Sassen, Jeremy Pollard and alot of nice and great peopl, the person that I think really inspires me is Elley Cannon she is the greatest frined ever and she is always making you laugh and well she always makes me laugh. Ilove her to death.
