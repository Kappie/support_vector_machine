The man was twenty one, I told him that she was fourteen but he wouldn't listen. Damn fourteen year olds they make me feel old. They're always trying to take our men! They're just like parasites, latching on to one man until he is sent to jail and then moving on to the next. Have you ever seen the movie  Crush ? I'm talking about crazy fourteen year old bitches like that. That pisses me off SO much. There was this one fourteen year old girl in rehab and she was a flirt. Fucking jail bait! Damn fourteen year olds. Its usually the blonde haired ones. I'm eating this rice soup I made. Try it, its pretty good.   Rice Soup   Follow the instructions for cooking rice, then add a little water and chicken soup base. Don't use Ramen Noodle Seasoning because it supposedly has some MSG chemical that fucks with your brain.
