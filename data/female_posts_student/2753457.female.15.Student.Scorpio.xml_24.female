So loud and annoying, and totally unnecessary in this case.  Then, I couldn't find my watch, which if possible made me even more angry.  I think my dad was a little frightened of me.  It reminded me of the way that I get really upset or sad, and my dog can tell that something's up.  She starts pacing the floor, and then puts her head in my lap.  My dad was a little like that.  He could tell that I was in a terrible mood. The temperature outside was nice, but it got muggy, and my hair didn't like it.  School wasn't very enjoyable.  I was stuck in Sra. Carr's room forever  because of the stupid 10th grade writing test.  The junior who sits next to me was annoying me.  She can be funny, but I barely know this girl, and after a while, I just wanted her to leave me alone.  She wanted to have a spelling bee, and pouted until someone read words from the dictionary.  At one point, she randomly told me that she loved me, and wanted to spend the rest of her life with me, and that we should get married in San Francisco.  She was probably just being silly.  But I was not in the mood, and decided to just be slightly weirded out.  I wrote a couple poems.  Today is a good poetry day, when I'm in a really bad temper.  It drizzled on me between third and fourth period, which was gross.  The rest of the day just kind of happened.  Not worth talking about.  When I got home, my feet hurt.  I have no idea why they did.  I didn't have to walk anymore than I usually do.  It's just today.  Now, I'm listening to Belle  Sebastian, to the song that describes me at this moment.  Ugh.  I need to get my homework done before 5:30 or so.  Concert tonight.  If I wait to face it until afterwards, I may have a fit. There's nothing to eat.  That sucks.
