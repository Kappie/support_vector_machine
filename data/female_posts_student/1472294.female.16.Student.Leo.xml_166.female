Ya, I know. i am not much of a night cat, that's why I am dragging my body and mind to school and dragging back a more smelly body and heavier mind  and   a heavier bag home..... Jeeezzz.... So, too tired to talk about how my birthday went. Just to tell you that I am experimenting with my 7250's camera and the photos, I must say, were quite good and professional.... But I cannot activate my GPRS, damn. Thanks to my brother who spent so much on his and my mother got scared already....
