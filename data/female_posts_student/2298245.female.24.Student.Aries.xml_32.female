       
           And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.      For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.      And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.      And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,      Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.  ~Luke 2:10-14  Merry Christmas everyone!
