And i don't know why? It was good and i hope he doesn't regret it, of course i still like the dude and i know hes taken, but yea, and Eliot and me have made up, i still don't want to hear anything from that guy about Jason, just everyone be normal and nice.  Not much to write, bit confused on the sex front, lol.  ~Lisa~
