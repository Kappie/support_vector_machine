If something exciting comes to mind i'll post it. I can't believe all my friends and I are going to be juniors, thats so crazy. Today i went to Red Robin with the group and there were 16 people there, only 3 of them weren't from H.B.Lee. I guess that could be good and bad. Good because we've stuck together and stayed friends for so long. Bad because we've stuck together and haven't branched out. Actually a lot of us have though, we all have friends from other social groups. Which reminds me, I'm going to go to the Zoo to visit a staff member from ODS with Lynzi next week! I'm really excited, the staff member, Casper, is the coolest guy and i haven't seen him since my spring week of ODS and i wanted lynzi to meet him. I don't know why i think hes so cool, he just is. He's my field instructor for plants. OH that reminds me, I'm going to be a CIT this year with Kari and Kaitlin at Namanu, and im sooo excited! Except a few of my favorite counselors aren't going to be there :-(. Well i think this entry is going to stop here, I'll write again soon!  *kate "ever so sweet, you baked it in cakes for me"
