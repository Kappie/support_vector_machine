And not really that 'I want to be in a relationship' type lonely, more of a 'I don't have anyone I can relate to anymore' type lonely, and that's not always fun, but i'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this at times, so I think I'll survive.  I have a headache, it really hurts, I am going to take some aspirin or something...because it's making me dizzy. I would really like to just not do my homework, but that would probably be a bad choice on my part and I would get stressed, actually it would just add on to the stress that I already have.  We pissed off my french teacher today, well I didn't do a whole lot of talking so I don't think I played too much into doing that. He's very upset that we have complained to the principal about the class and we were trying to explain to him today that we haven't really grasped anything in the class yet, and that's probably because he's taught very little. We have a test on wednesday, and I haven't learned anything in the class yet. Sad really.  I tried so hard to get out of that class but I couldn't so I'll be waiting for this semester to be over, well I'm already waiting for this year(and next year) to be over, so it just adds to my impatience.   I really want to give up on Northwestern.  Jesus.  My mother's making me cry, gahh, well it's not really her fault, she's just bringing me to reality I guess. I'm not going to be able to take a whole 3(and 4) years of french..i just can't do it.  And according to my mom that will help determine I won't be getting into Northwestern. I don't want to take another year of math, i don't  have  to of course but without it I won't even be able to  apply  to NW.  Now I don't know what to do, I need advice.  I don't want to be around my family members right now either...  I just had the most awkward moment.  I was allowing my mother to read an reply to an argument on homosexuality that was on a message board...and I forgot I mentioned I was bi in my response, and she was like "oh really?", not in a bad tone, and I was just like "uhhh..." it was weird. Now she'll prance off and tell my father and her relatives, because she always feels the need to tell her sister and mother EVERYTHING that goes on between us...grr. That's a bit annoying.  And to end on a happy note,  I'm writing a story, and I'm excited.  It's for my science fiction class, but I'm gonna make it good :) because I have some good ideas for it, and yeah...so maybe..just maybe, if you are privaledged enough you'll be able to read it...because I know you're just  dieing  to...
