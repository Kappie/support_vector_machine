Yesterday was very bittersweet. Sure, I'm happy I don't have to wake up early anymore and deal with little kids all day, but I'm really going to miss everyone.       I believe my friendships with Kristen and Chris E. grew this summer. And that's definately a great thing! They are two of the most awesome people I know.  We had so many great times, like with Chris and "the thing" and Kristen telling the kids about Sean and such.       ...And then there's the other counselors in my group that I met this year. Chris R, Andrea, Larisa, and Tim.  I remember last year, I only came into my group knowing Dyllan, Matt, and Stephanie and at the end of the year, the only people I got along with were Dyllan, Matt, and Stephanie. This year I thought I was only going to get along with only Kristen, Chris E, and Tom since I knew them before hand and yea, I ended up becoming friends with everyone basically.  Chris R is by far the funniest guy I EVER MET. Even if all of the choices for activities were 4 square or cards, he's still awesome. Andrea worked really hard this year and she's one of the nicest people I know. We had so many laughs, especially the whole "YEAH!" thing. Larisa is actually a really cool person contrary to what everyone says. Oh man, the whole Motel 69 incident, making fun of Brooke, and the MSI CD and other laughs. Haha, good times, good times. Tim is such a funny kid. Oh man, when we had to make sure no one steals the pizza and his attempt at singing the "Move Your Body Girl" song .       Then there's Tom and Brooke. Tom I've known for awhile and he's a cool kid. Brooke I don't really know too well, let's just leave it at that.       I also met some pretty cool CITs this year, like Angela, Scott, Andrew, and Kimmie. They were all so awesome and I hope theyall got asked back! YAY!       The two campers I'm going to miss the most are Patty and Matt, by far. Patty is so funny and Matt is such a sweet kid.       Yesterday was the banquet. I felt kinda miserable there, I felt unwanted and there was some weird vibe around me. The presentation that Andrew made was so funny! Especially when he placed Steve's head on top of Jeremy's (Jeremy quit camp and he appeared a lot in the video, so they just put Steve's face over him) Then awards were given out. Congrats to everyone who got one! You all deserved them! Then, I chilled with Stringer and Sam outside because we didn't want to dance (the whole rest of the crew was) Then, I got picked up early, feeling miserable that camp is over.       I made 150 bucks in tips. Not shabby, last year I made a wapping 40 bucks.       And that's all. Who wants to come to great adventure with me this week?!?!?!      -Jen
