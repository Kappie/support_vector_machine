Don't say 'We have come now to the end' White shores are calling You and I will meet again. And you'll be here in my arms, Just sleeping  The ships have come to carry you home..."  Such a beautiful song.  I cried when I first heard it, and hearing it now is even more emotional for me, because the lyrics make me think of Brandi.  I take the GRE on Tuesday, and needless to say, I'm freaking out.  Whether or not I have a substantial, logical reason to be worried is beside the point; I believe that one must be in the right frame of mind to take these standardized tests, particulary since I need to get a decent score to be admitted into my top graduate school choices.  And I am definitely not in the right mindset; all I can think about, nearly every moment of the day, is how truly ephemeral life is.   Everything I do, hear, or speak of seems superflous to the overwhelming feeling of sorrow and gut-wrenching pain that I feel in my heart.  Stupid, silly standardized examinations, along with every other complaint or inconvenience in existence at the moment, seem  trite and not worth my time or energy.  How can I possibly worry about a pointless exam that won't truly test my knowledge anyway if I'd rather be spending my waking moments with my dying cousin who might as well be my sister?  I need Tuesday to be over and done with.  I don't care about my score, nor do I really care whether or not I end up in Graduate School in August, because Brandi might not even make it to August.  What's the point?  I'd rather be fighting this battle with her than worrying about what I make on the damn quatitative section of the GRE that reflects nothing of my degree knowledge.  I'm not apathetic, I'm just angry that the GRE ass holes wouldn't let me re-schedule the exam for a week later.  I don't give a rat's ass about their stupid "you should have called a week in advance to change the date of the exam" policy; how was I supposed to know that I would need to reschedule while running back and forth between here, Houston, and East Bernard, watching over a cousin with a brain tumor diagnosed on Chrismas Eve?  So now you can't have an emergency?  I'm going to try and get some sleep; I've got to get my sleep schedule back on track, since I have to take this bloody test at 9am on Tuesday.  Wish me luck--I'll need it.
