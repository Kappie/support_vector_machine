I shall be scabbing many a lift in your sexy car :P      I wish i had my Ps :( but  someone  wont let me drive. pffff....      anyway, i just got back from hockey and i dead set got tackled, barged, shoulder charged and poked threateningly with sticks about 5 times. THANKS NATHAN. Some mature coach we have! now my shoulder hurts (you know it was coming...). oh well he smells. BUT we are coming 3rd on the ladder!!! not bad considering we came up from a division below and none of our for and against was included, we'd be killing it if it was. Nevermind....       on the topic of hockey, Louisa i hope you feel better soon... and your appendix-less-ness (lol) fixes itself up soon! you better come watch us play :P hehe      anyway see ya later dudes      oh, actually one more thing: sedan echos are seriously ugly.
