I promised myself that I wouldn't do this kinda stuff to myself and well, it just happened. Before all ya'll go out there and get a big head thinking I'm talking about you, don't. I'm thinking about my crush person. Yeah, that guy. I was going to wait around to talk to him at church last night but my parents wanted to go home so, I never got to say hi. In fact, it happens like that almost every week. I think I might actually have to trip right in front of him or something to get that speaking opportunity. I'm making a resolution:   I, Meghan, will speak to my crush on Sunday morning.  Now that I've said it, I can't go back on it right? Right. Here is the list of things I plan to do to either, A. Get his attention, or ultimately B. Get him to talk to me!  1. Smile. A lot: After all- smiling is like the universal friendliness gesture. 2. Get and Hold eye contact: My mom seems to think that's where I lose them at. I don't usually like to look at people for too long because I'm afraid they will see something they won't like. Or worse, something they do like. 3. Make small talk: Ok, I suck at small talk. Not afraid to admit that one. Which is really funny because I could talk forever, and then some. I know he likes cars... so... *mental note: I will remember to speak of cars.* 4. Give him some contact info: Yea, it may sound forward. But a little email never hurt anybody did it? Ok, well there was the occastion where people get a virus in their email but that is completely beside the point.  Ok, so I think I have it down. All I need now, is, what I like to call, "The Moves".   "The Moves"  What exactly are the moves?? I mean, I'm not your normal chick. I'm a social rebel. I don't mingle, I don't chase after guys, and I do not have the suave techniques to catch a guys attention. Sure, I remember every guy's birthday, give them a card and all. But I mean, do guys really like that stuff?? I don't know. I usually just do it to see the shocked look on their face. So, I don't have "The Moves." I'll have to compensate with my dashing wit and my bedazzling intelligence. *mental note: wear cute clothes*   And now the final question: Will it work???  Well, If I had any clue at all if it was going to work than do you think I would have posted it here?? No! Well, according to becca, yes. She thinks I am a blog-addict. But I'm not! I swear I'm not! Ok, maybe I am just a little bit. But that doesn't mean anything! All it means is that I like to rant about my life! It's a hobby, ok? So there.    I leave you with this.....Clean-up on aisle 2!
