I came into the office this morning, worked for about an hour, went back to my room napped until 12. Then went to lunch with Lisa and then out to Villa Vera, Spa 7 Resort to lounge by the pool, drink lots of bottle water and continue to work on my tan.  (Which by the way I am turning bronze already! Step aside Jennifer Lopez.)  I got back about 4, then had a wonderful conversation with Jennfier - not Lopez.  Jennifer Odom.  We were on the phone forever but it was so good to speak to her and hear her voice. Afterwards, I came up to my office and I have been searching the internet since. I just changed as I am going out to dinner tonight at Carlos n Charlies in Acapulco. We don't leave from this port until 11 so we actually get to enjoy the nightlife a bit. Mostly everyone goes to Paradise but it's just like a crew bar there so Lisa and I decided to not go tonight. We are on our own adventure. Tomorrow works starts up again. Busy busy as usual. But tonight all the guests are calm and are quite possibly griping out some poor mexican at port about the cost of their taxi.  These people are so cheap I swear.  Man o man.   Ok, I am off for the evening. See ya soon. Shellbell.
