A certain callousness complies with your charm  in your pride A hopeful look draped in despise.  I want to give you whatever you need. What is it you need? Is it what I need? I want to give you whatever you need. What is it you need? Is it within me?  It's hard to explain how I am getting by on so little from you. It's hard to believe that I would let myself get so wrapped into you. There's got to be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you. We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you. From you, from you.  The harder I push the further I fall. Well you don't mind me being headstrong. But you don't want to sing along. Maybe it's trite but I can always, always, always be wrong  Trying not to be . . . Trying not to be wrong     listening to old music... reminds me of all the good and bad tiems and i really wish i had the good times bnack where there wasnt so much fighting between everyone and like everyone was happy but me of course because ... i left the situation i was in and in return for a situation i liked better and now i dunno im kinda happy but eveyrone else isnt so now its making me sad... ooo thinking of the good times
