Jeff actually went into the room, I was surprised, because Jeff and I both have a low tolerance for things like that. He said it wasn't so bad.  Anyway, they had a girl. They have two girls now, and Rhonda got her tubes tied afterwards. Jeff named the baby Madison Nicole.....after me, his only sister. I thought that was sweet.
