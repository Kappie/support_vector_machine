IT'S FIXED! :) Anyway, I'm absolutely exhausted so, I think I'm going to go to sleep in a few minutes and sleep in SO late tomorrow. I really do need to get working on my psych project too though.  Hmmm. Eh, I'll get to it. I did alright at solo and ensemble. I got a 1 but...so did a ton of other people so, no big deal there. I had heard she was mean but she was really nice to me. Good times. not really actually. My Saturday could have been a lot more fun but it's ok. I helped out a lot. It was fine.   I'm getting annoyed with the boy. I'm not even sure why but he's annoying me. That's for sure.  Oh well. I think it'd actually just be better if I stopped liking him. Much easier on me. That's for sure.   I'm listening to French rap right now...it makes me happy. :)  At least I got to hang out with Bryan and Chris tonight. That was a lot of fun. Good times.   OK, apparently every shift key on every keyboard hates me. Grrrr. Boooo keyboard.   Anyway, I'm so tired I'm about to fall over so...sleep time...Ta ta...
