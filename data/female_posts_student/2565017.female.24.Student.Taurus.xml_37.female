I would have needed to sleep longer the next morning, I think, but I had a morning shift. Well, I can get loads of sleep now :)  Well, my surgical internship is now done, which is great. Only a few exams, and then I'm off to a summer holiday, wee hee =) So, now... Anne's visiting me for 2 days, staying at my place. It's kind of nice. But also kind of... lol, battle of the wills. Endless negotiation what we do, when we do, how we do... lol lol. But it's great to talk about all kinds of things. To bad she's probably leaving for good. I'll miss her a lot.  I just joined www.orkut.com. It's this "friends, their friends and their friends" network kind of thingy. Kind of interesting, except I'm not so good at networking. Well, there are communities I could find friends with similar interests but...well. Let's see if the whole thing is of any use. Found Breakbeat fans, which is great. BREAKBEAT KICKS ASS!  Now, all I need to do is find Beat Pushers: Murto. It's such a must, but it's sold out everywhere.... bleah! I wanniiiiiiiit :)  I think that now would be a great moment for a little nap...
