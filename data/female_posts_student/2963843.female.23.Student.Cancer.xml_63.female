I was kind of disappointed when I knew about that...   Woke up today to find that I do not have to prepare for work today. Don't have to iron my black pants and shirt anymore.. Don't have to pour water inside my gigantic nike water bottle that will last me for the whole day.. Don't have to wear my big round silver earrings... No more being forced into listening to N and her desperado for boyfriend nagging.. No more cleaning up the glass shelves and mirrors.. No more stocktaking, No more surviving on sushi.. No more taking bus 854, sleeping on the way. Don't have to inform the customers that we are having a storewide sale of 20% to 60% discount, and getting ignored at times.. No more making small talk with aunty customers.. No more laughing at N's naive ways with my manager and her desporado syndrome... No more listening to the advice of my mature and wise manager about the facts of life.... No more rearranging the shawls, bracelets, earrings, sunglasses, necklaces and pouches... Not gonna get to feel a sense of satisfaction when praised about my good service and clinching of a sale... No more greeting the nice security guards who showed me the way on my first day of work...  Sigh...  I actually miss those things! And I feel that I miss working in Sentiments more than I miss my ex! yikes! I actually wished that I could have worked longer there! Double yikes! What am I thinking?? I actually feel sad about leaving the shop, leaving heartland mall.. I felt a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose serving customers and having a job.. Having such a relaxing job as a salesgirl forever is so tempting...  Yike yikes yikes!!  Ok ok... I'm going shopping now, after serving people for twenty days, its my time to be served now... =p Maybe I'll feel better...  Take care blog...
