Romeo and Juliet was FANTASTIC!!!!!!!! I swear you have NOT seen a proper Shakespeare production until you see it done by the RSC (Royal Shakespeare Company) absolutely wonderful.. I'm such a nerd... but heh whatever... did NOT like the flood of schoolchildren (its the week before Easter so all the schools do the funny 'educational' trips.... so the entire plays was stuffed with rude kids (NO i do NOT classify as a rude kid... I'm cultured -coughs-) lots of french students....  Have I mentioned how crazy I think British drivers are? and roadways? the whole system is wack!  Did I mention we spent 2 hrs going around in circles trying to get from Stonehenge (I went there too) to Caernarfon Castle (thats Southern England to Nothern Wales.. a 5 and a half hour trip) because the Global Positioning Navigation system in the rental cars got lost? STUPID COMPUTERS!!!!! 2 hours.... we finally gave up and started heading home.... which it told us was the wrong way.... I couldn't figure out how to turn the stupid voice off.. CARS SUCK!!! heh....  Odd observations during that crazy drive...... driving down the Motorway and passing by 6 Military Tanks on route to the practice field.............Hour and a half later.. signs which read 'TANK CROSSING' hah........ Hour later.... BIG NUCLEAR POWER PLANT..... I find it disturbing they would put the practice field so close to Nuclear power... what if a stray missile........ POOF there goes England.....  Thats enough for today... more tomorrow...
