Or  urlLink here .   So, how has everyone's summer been so far?  Since our weather has decided to actually cooperate with us, mine has just been peachy. I went to the beach today and yesterday, and while I despise the ardous walk from the parking lot to the water, I still enjoy my sandy freedom emensely.  Michigan isn't so bad in the summer. Can't say the same for the winter.  However, I greatly need a job. I have been waking up around noon, and if I must say, that fact is quite depressing. I feel like I am sleeping my life away. But sometimes, my dreams are a lot more entertaining then real life.  I haven't been to Summer Celebration yet, but I plan to go to the Art Fair tomorrow or Sunday. I'm also looking forward to the Air Fair. What's that you say? Sky diving Elvises?   AWESOME....what more could a girl want?  Also, I finally got my permit certified. I have logged about 4 hours so far. (WOO! Only 46 to go!) I forget how much driving can suck sometimes. My ADD-ish brain can't handle it.  "SLOW DOWN!"  "SPEED UP!"  "LOOK AT YOUR BLINDSPOT!"  "curb... curB...cuRB... cURB... CURB!!!!"  "... awww don't stress about it, Katherine, the accident wasn't even your fault..."   Ah, the joys of learner's permits.  **** Song of the SUMMER (errr... Day...): 'Who Needs Shelter'- Jason Mraz
