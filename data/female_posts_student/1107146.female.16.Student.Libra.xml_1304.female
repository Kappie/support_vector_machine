Ummmmmmm.......I'm sure I could  easily  overtake and viciously rape all three of you  SIMULTANEOUSLY , with all those people around and all. My dad's gonna be there tho, and he's too cripled for rape, and if not him, my slightly gimp-ed mother will be there too. You should see my family assembled, me and and guts, which are killing me, my dad and his being sick and a born gimp, and my mom with her gray and blooded finger. And Katie. She'll probably be on her period and the motley crew will be even motlier. Er. Abby said so.  By the way guys, I have special permission to invoke the name of Abby every time I want to be right from now on, so if I use it to win a fight (and I will, trust me), I  WIN , since she of whom I speak has said that her word is natural mandate and thereby must be taken with the fullest of cares, thereby being respected, thereby meaning: BONUS, I WIN a lot more. God, what's wrong with my head? I blasted it on my headboard which I took down last weekend this morning and chipped a molar. And the blood! Good God! At least it's the end of the year. And I'm really sorry I said that, so I'm knocking the hell out of this wooden desk now.  That makes: me, Linds, Abby, Z, and my family...there's some Wharton and MLK people that are just going because it's the last day, and they'll probably stop me, but everyone's favourite person won't be there (in Australia tomorrow, I think), so it'll be ok.  Where'd you get all doze puns dood?  Word.
