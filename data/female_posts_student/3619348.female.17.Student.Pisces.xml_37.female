There were like five million kids here, trying to string beads into fantastic little mutated projects...heheh.  It was insane, but we're alive and the children of Vinton are happy.  It's FREAKING cold here!!!  It's July in Iowa, it's supposed to be at least 95 degrees, and we're wearing sweatshirts at 69!!!  What gives? This state has weather mood swings worse then a teenage girl!  Good cripe.  Well have to run, I hope compy gets back soon.
