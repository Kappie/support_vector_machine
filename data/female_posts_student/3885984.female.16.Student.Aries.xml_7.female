Well, I feel like I'm officially living the life of a junior in high school. I've only been back in school for one week, and I'm already stressing out. Well, first things first - I'm an editor for the yearbook! I'm the ' writing queen ' - or at least that's what my teacher called me. I'm in charge of creative writing and the clubs/organizations, and I'm so excited about it.  Dude, my grams just came in my room, and was like, "Are you done with your homework?" I'D BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A FREAKIN' HOUR! (I'm not done though ... I'm taking a little break!) But no she doesn't come in then ... she waits until I'm done and then comes in and acts like I'm a horrible teenage who never does what she's supposed to being doing. Grrrr ... I'm the type of person that likes to do my homework from one subject and then take a little break before I move on to the next one. My brain will hurt if I keep going non-stop.  Anyway, I GOT A JOB! I had two interviews for Old Navy this past week, and well, I got it! Friday night I was really freaked out about it too because it kind of hit me that  I actually got the job . I don't know why, but for some reason, I didn't expect to get it. I mean, I had the whole interview with JCPenny, and the guy acted like I definately had the job, and well, he never called back so I guess I didn't want to get my hopes up again. I have to go to this orientation thing on the 28th, and that's in like two weeks so I have some time to just be free! LOL And plus, the store doesn't actually open until September 9th, so I don't really have to worry about anything just yet.  I actually really like my classes this year. None of my teachers are like ... well ... those of you who know me pretty well will know who I'm thinking of   :)   I just finished working on two layouts for journalism, and man, those things are hard! I mean, I'm a pretty creative person ... but only with certain things. I also have this project that I have to do for SAT Prep. I have to research a college, and yeah, I picked Brenau. Now ... this brings me to the whole living the life of a junior thing. I really want to figure out - for sure - where I want to go to college and what I want to do with my life! It's hard though! And if I go to Brenau, it's going to cost me an arm, a leg and my right eye to pay for it! I'm po! ( Which brings me to the other day in school ... a girl actually asked, "hey Jen, what kind of care do you have?" I was like hahaha! ) I do think that I'm leaning towards being a journalist more than anything else, but I do worry about whether or whether not it's the right choice for me. I also like the ideas of being a psychologist or even working in a vet's office, (I went to the vet's office here in town, and all of the people in there were soooo nice! I was like awe, wow, I want to work here!) but I really have no idea yet what my final choice will be. I'll keep ya'll posted! And yeah, isn't it funny how the three things that I would like to do with my life have ABSOLUTELY nothing in common? LOL  Well, now I must go and do my chem homework ...  yippie!  j/k JKM - OUT!
