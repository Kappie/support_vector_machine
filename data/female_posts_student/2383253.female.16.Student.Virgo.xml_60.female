It's sad to think that it was our last real concert with Mr. Kohn, but somehow it feels fitting and resolute that we played  Carmina Burana  in our final performance. This band really went out with a bang. I also feel strangely inspired after some of the feedback I received just from Matt and my parents. We really did our best, and this band has come such a long way, it's really amazing to think how crappy we used to sound.  Anyway, back to this morning. I woke up and drove to school, arriving on time at about 7:20 in room 410 to take the AP English Language test. Reviewed really quickly with Matt (who so conveniently happens to always be in the same testing rooms with me since our last names are very close together), and we sat for three grueling hours of 54 multiple choice questions on reading comprehension and three giant free-response essay questions with accompanying passages. Boy, was that stressful. I have complete apathy and lack of respect for the little shits that actually write these stupid passages about "propriety" and "truth" and "heroes" and "racism." Been there, done that, we've heard it all before, and we don't care to hear it again. The only free-response question I liked was the one where it gave us, the students, a little ambiguous leeway--we had the freedom to write about any issue in the whole wide world, so I picked environmental pollution from cars and America's tendencies to waste gas and pollute with giant, gas-guzzling vehicles. That essay flowed ten times more freely than the two others.  After we made it over that hurdle, Matt and I went to the beach with Brenna where we had a good time watching Matt frolick in the water, discussing our "issues," and sunbathing fully clothed like a bunch of losers who hate their bodies. I love being an insecure teenager, it's awesome.  So then we stopped by Board  Brew for a quick bite to eat (never been there before), and then back home. Hooray.   AP Tests Tally:  one  down,  two  to go.
