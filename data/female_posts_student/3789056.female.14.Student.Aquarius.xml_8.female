Qingyuan was also requested by us to goon sourt but he refused, but it was natural for him to do this. i cannot describe why but i think it was just pai sei.... ... By the way, i was quite upset to not seeing gabriel and chenxiao back... well you know, they are my friends and i have not seen them for a very long ttime, almost a year i think!!!!.okay Hmm, a good news is i have saved the song sakura by zang shan wei inside the cmputer, this song is just so nice and i love it. Haha, my memory is improving as i had remember to bring the CD to return to yunli, Wow! Amazing! Wahaha.
