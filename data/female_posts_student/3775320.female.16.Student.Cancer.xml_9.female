I don't know how to change the font here so I am very pleased by the fact that I won't have to change it.  Aha. If you're interested, T MS is my fav- font because though it is default, it's nice for a default.  Everyone being able to read it plays a large part.  No point using a font no one can see.  -sigh-  I have many weird fonts I'd like to use.
