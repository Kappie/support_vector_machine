I am still working TOO much, and this week am doing a Kids Week with my church here in Derry.  It should be a fun sleep deprived week, geez, I forgot what sleep deprivation truely was.  WAHOO!  Well I am at just the begining, and I have a feeling that come next week I am just gonna crash.    I wish I had some juicy gossip to share about my life but I don't.  I highlighted my hair so now I have light brown hair (not dark brown)  I still have no prospects on the guy thing...but that is over rated.    And now I am just counting down the weeks until I get to come home and relax for a month.  (only 6 weeks and counting).  So that is my uneventful life.  The 12th of July parades are tomorrow ( SCARY!!! ) but oh well...I am not involved, I just hope they go on without a hitch.  Oh yeah the Ulster Final is today, but no news on the results.
