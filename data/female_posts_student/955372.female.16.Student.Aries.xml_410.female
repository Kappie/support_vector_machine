Yay! ok so that library woman that looks like she is dead (ya know she has the make up that they put on corpses for the viewing) came by and she was just staring at me and mallory staring at us desperately trying to find something we were doing wrong. She finally realized that we had a krackle bar and she goes "put the food away this is a library not a cafeteria" fortunately we had already finished it. Yay. we triumph over the administration once again. allie- 1 administration -0 ba ha ha ha. ok i'm done now. tehehe.
