It's all in Japanese but it's got a cool/scary game on it!  urlLink http://ribon.shueisha.co.jp/game/game.html  You're the guy in the fish head and you have to get the squid looking things without hitting the rocks or being caught. (Got it?) Yeah...whatever Katie. And the blue squidy things make you go Wooosh! Ehe...I'll go now.
