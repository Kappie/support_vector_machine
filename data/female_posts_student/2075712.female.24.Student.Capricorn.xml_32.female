Yesterday was nice...went to my boyfriend's house for their usual "everyone-in-the-family-come-to-the-house-eat-drink-and-have-an-easter-egg-hunt" bar-b-q.  It was ok..I wouldn't say it's been the best year though.  R's mom and his sisters had an argument which kind of killed the whole mood.    I'm on Spring BREAK finally!!  I was in need of a break !  The only thing that sucks about it...is that I don't have anything fun planned.  That sucks.  Oh, well.    I really need to lose weight...on Saturday I bought my first pair of jeans that are size..... 7/8 ...I can't believe it.  In 9th grade I was a size 0,1.  In 11th grade I was a size 3.  After I finished high school I was a size 5...but I've never been anything bigger than a 6.  I'm not disciplined though...I don't have the power to turn away my favorite foods.  Maybe if I just exercise a lot...I can continue to eat how I'd like and still lose a couple of pounds...I've got to try it.  This summer I am going to take another gym class.    ok, that's all for now..=)
