The den of materialism and overstuffed sofas was to be our only coffee shop visited in London, our not-all-that-closeted elitism showing just a bit.  Soon enough, though, we found ourselves back in the city, heading into the gritty mean-streets of the Soho district, historically renowned for its debauchery and drug dens.    The neighborhood has evolved into the hip, happenin' fashionably bohemian and supremely gay heart of London.  The "heart" is basically two streets lined with sex shops, boutiques with sex shops downstairs, bookstores with sex shops downstairs and restaurants flying the rainbow flag.  I'm sure they had their own version of downstairs sex shops, though.    Heading toward the more sophisticated, more cleanly, National Portrait Gallery, we took a hurried stroll through a decidedly Asian community.  The population suddenly shrunk in stature, and nearly every storefront had Asian writing and dead chickens in the window.    "Is this like London's Chinatown?"  "No, this is more like ChinaBackAlley."  "Thank you, Grant."   That's it!  The trip's first iconic joke!  We might just be able to have a smooth ride, after all.   Tomorrow's really good, just you wait.
