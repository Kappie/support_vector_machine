Science:   1st period, the day started us off with Science. Annie decided 2 not be here and be sick, so she left mel and I up to our own devices! Muhahahaa....... Mel felt like being random and vague, and suggested that she would hate if something she invented was named after her - she decided to tell me the non-existent example of "John Camera" heheehee, so Mel. Mel also wanted to know what her "scientific" name was, so here it is: Melanofades, the interesting creature that no-one can tame. We were attempting to finish all these sheets we had 2 do, and Mel was in a random I'm-gonna-write-everything-in-full-sentences-mood, which is realli strange 4 her! So me, being in the hypo mood I was, attacked her so she wouldn't finish the sentence she was writing, Mel then tried to escape and we ended up screaming and chasing each other around the Science lab, while she was still trying to finish the sentence! Where was the teacher? U may ask. Our teacher is sooooooo cool, she is totally used 2 us mucking up so she just kept on going on with the usual buisness of teaching the class while we ran around like lunatics. She's the coolest, u can get away with anything in that class!   PD:   Well good old Mrs. Irwin. She always makes PD, well how can I put it?  Interesting...  She decided she would like to tell us the details of her menstrual cycle when she was 23 and how the travel affected it, it was quite traumatic! (she's about 65 now!) Visual detail we don't need. And she always likes to mention how great sex is - and i quote - "it's quite exciting actually", "im not saying you shouldn't have sex, i mean just wait, because it is soooo wonderful when you finally do it" and many other equally scary things coming out of her old granny mouth. Quite hilarious actually, of course, only in hindsight, after you hav got over the shock!   Art:   Art, with Criddy. What more can I say. She makes the class intersting each time. Imagine an old, scary, "voluptuous" as Han would say, lady who has 2 sons called Bead and Darcy! I mean, shes truly a physco. Once again, Han and I decided to do the physco dance that we did last lesson and ended with her banging her hand down on the table and screaming because we were doing this while she was trying to talk bout the conceptual framwork  (boring!)  So anywayz, we were doing the physco dance again, and she turns around, and says in this really high-pitched voice, "Turn It Off" (refferring to the radio - which she has sum major thing against) and Han and I once again burst into fits of laughter. Haha, Criddy u make our day :P
