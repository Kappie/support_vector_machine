How'd you like that Daf? I took the last word from your movie title -- neat, huh? By the way, I just wanted to let you all know that I'm bowling for Big Brothers Big Sisters 2003 Bowl For Kids' Sake and I'm taking pledges.. If you guys could spare $10 or 10 cents per pin (the minimum pledge) or more, please email me your name, mailing address, phone number and pledge amount. If I can get $250, I get a Big Brothers Big Sisters sweatshirt which is way cooler than the free t-shirt that you get for collecting $135 in pledges. Plus I'm the team captain so I don't want to be outdone by the other members. One of the people on our team,  Sarah ,  has already collected $100 and we only got our pledge sheets today! Anyway, it's for a really good cause so email me -- okay?
