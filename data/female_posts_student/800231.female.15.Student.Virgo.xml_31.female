As Alice pointed out earlier, I've been making sarcastic or otherwise cruel comments at everybody today. Even called my math teacher a "hemorrhoid in the rectum of humanity" when she refused to give me my missing assignments, needless to say it didn't really help. Oy vay... I'm such a moron.   I have to get my ass in gear on that kid's book thing. It's all written now but I've barely started on the illustrations. Bugger.  Mr. F touched me. *shudders* Alright, it was only an hand on the back sort of thing but still. Steph wasn't even there to scare him again, she only showed up for the first few minutes of class and then left. I couldn't go with her though, it was a test day and I can't afford to miss any major parts of that class.  Bah, I'm tired of the planet. I'm off to work on my book... Wish me freedom from my boredom.
