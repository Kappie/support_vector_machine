I went with Allison and Michael and met so many people there (some were really cool and some just sucked). The three of us had a great time together though. And it was in spite of the fact that it was hot and we were all dehydrated and hungry and poor from spending all our money on beer and tickets. Somehow we managed though. We skipped over the part where you pay $4.00 per 8 ounce bottle of water by filling up our left over beer cups with water and then begging the vendors to let us have a few pieces of ice. I thought that it worked pretty well.
