Another gorgeous day - I will set the scene: I am surrounded by fields  forest, blue sky, a glimpse glistening lake and mountains on both sides.      but.. there's Paleo....fete de Geneve...there are even jazz bands playing in Nyon! Lainey is back! yay!!! It had been five weeks since I had seen her - with trips to N. Ireland, Tanzania, Nottingham, South Africa in between, so lots of catching up to do. And I leave on Wednesday again, so it will be a short catch up. We going to have our boggle rematch, bike to the lake, swim, then go on all the upside down rides in geneva. fun fun fun :-) It is scary thinking how we first met when we were five years old...:O Now we're signing up for our driving first aid courses  theory courses  applying to university!! how time flies.   right : walk dog  work. (although, don't think I'll get much work done:) )
