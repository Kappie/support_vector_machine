I fear your perfection You fear me and my affection Pretty Little Lady  Purple-Hearted Lover I'll say you're mine although Purple-Hearted Woman I know you'll never know You'll be my dream lady My real-life fantasy Follow your heart, please follow it to me Purple-Hearted Woman  Purple-Hearted Woman Go drink your whiskey and rye 'Cause Purple-Hearted Woman You're mine 'til the day we die Just say that I'm your man And I'm doin' all I can for Purple-Hearted Woman -------------------------------------- Alright, if anyone steal this song, I have official documentation MWAHAHAHA.... Just kidding. Seriously, though, email me if you or anyone you know is interested.
