My life isn't all about  urlLink The OC - just 75% of my life is. Just kidding. But I do love the show- and especially  urlLink Ben Mckenzie . Anyway, enough about The OC.  Let's see....about me....I live in Maryland and have a twin sister. I have a dog that is a Westie. I play piano and love fashion. And that's basically it.   ON Friday I saw Fahrenheit 9/11. I cried during some of it. Like, the part where they just played the sounds of people and ambulances during September 11. After seeing the movie, you will basically hate Bush and his administration. Yeah, I know it is a biased documentary, but the republicans really have nothing for a rebuttal.
