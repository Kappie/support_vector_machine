Randy was to call me and never did but hey I am not going to hold anything aginst him.  Maybe he had to go somewhere.  I will hopefully talk to him soon and I hope he feels the same about me as I feel.  Because I would like to date him.  And Josh and I do feel the same for eachother.  But he made a valid point.  We should not date,  we should just be friends, until school starts that way we can see eachother more.
