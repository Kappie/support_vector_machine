It apparently forces you to take teeny tiny, Scarlet O'Hara bites so that you can lose weight. It's just some sort of mouth gear that makes it impossible to shove huge forkfuls of food into your mouth. You could also, of course, simply do that on your own without putting a giant retainer in your mouth. I'm sure it makes you look really attractive too.
