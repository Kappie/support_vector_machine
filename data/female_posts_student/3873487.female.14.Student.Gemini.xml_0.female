Mood: depressed.guilty 
___It's crazy that the relationship I had over the weekend only lasted 2 days... yet everything that had  happened  seemed like it would have been a 2 month or 2 year relationship. I admit I still do feel guilty and I am depressed over him... but didn't I only take this relationship as an experience? So shouldn't I be feeling slightly guilty and depressed? We had perfect moments, and his personality really did fit mines, but he could never be who I want... We watched the stars, and I could talk to him as if he was my best friend, but when the next day came around, I knew he could never keep that part of him with him at all times. That sweet, understanding, loving side of him... he'll never be able to show it or keep it. By day he's thatcocky black man... but OMG! Once you get to know and talk to him, he'll care about you like no one has... well at least for me. I guess it's a really great feeling for some else out there who isn't supposed to love you, to care for u... bcuz I was never really cared for in  that  way. His kisses didn't feel as good as I had dreamt they would. It's odd bcuz only a couple days ago I had a dream that I kissed my ex boy very unprofessionally... and then on Saturday night when Brandon tried to teach me how to kiss, I couldn't kiss as great asI had in my dreams.But how?! I mean I've kissed many guys in my dreams, and  trust  me I could kiss. 
 Do kisses really have to be experienced to be learned ?  
   ___Why can't everyone's good and sweet personalities follow them around everywhere? He was so sweet and understanding the hours we spent talking on Saturday night. He asked me questions thatI've always pondered about, in those quiet momentsI have,but never really bring up to discuss. It's weird how he's probably and practically everything I've wished for, yet I know that nothing I do will mean anything to him. He'll break up with a girl, and find another one to put in her place. Like he said: 
" I can't keep a relationship for that long... I mean don't u get bored looking at the same face everydaythat your together?And kissing the exact same face... Ooo, I can't do that... "  
 It's not  that  hard... I mean now that I come to think of it, it is hard to not be bored of looking at the same face everyday. But you can't be that shallow bout stuff like that, I mean once you love or care about someone truly, nothing like that shit would matter. Too bad all my relationships always end up with a lost friend...   
 " Money easy come easy go, especially when you spendin' it on a ho... "
