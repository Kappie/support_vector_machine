The entire city was in a state of catastrophic construction today as it always seems to be.   Not that drilling into, widening, or repaving those roads is going to somehow transform them into anything that even remotely makes sense.   We spent what seemed like hours attempting to navigate our way along routes that switched back, hooked, and then met up with other roads without signage of any kind.  It was a blast.  What is nice, surprisingly, is the area around Worcester, namely Grafton, where  urlLink Anne's school  is and where she took us for lunch today.  I even could warm up to rowing out of  urlLink Holy Cross's  boathouse on  urlLink Lake Quinsigamond .  But jeez, someone needs to do something about the traffic conditions.
