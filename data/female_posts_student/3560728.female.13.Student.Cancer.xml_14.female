(I'm writing this somewhere on this neverending highway! lol!) We just travelled through this enormous storm. Frozen rain was streaming from the clouds, but after driving for 2 kms. the suns muffled rays reached us. Funny how things like this always seem to happen in the Cariboo. (sp?) So we R driving from 70 Mile House back to B.B.L. I can't really remember why we drove here, but there was probaBly a reason...but it's just been constant road work and car accidents all the way, which is making the already lengthy drive 10 times longer and 20 times more tedious. I got a really big fudgsicle tho...which made it all worth while. :D All of the houses and stores around here are either totally run down, abbandoned, or for sale. It's depressing seeing everything just you know, falling apart, hence the sort of bitter tone in this entry. I did get to fraternise (hee hee!) with the locals...well if a couple "Hello's" and dogs trying to eat my food counts as fraternising...and I'll just say that it does. The people in the country are so different than city people. This hot 14 year old guy bumped into me and actually said sorry. It was really bizarre...city guys would just say "move" or whatever, but that's probably because people in the city tend to be a lot more judgemental. Like I doubt those guys would say "move" to some blonde girl wearing slutty clothes and too much make-up, because that's what they consider "attractive." But because I'm just a freak standing around wearing chokers and band T-shirts I don't seem to matter. North American society is so shallow.
