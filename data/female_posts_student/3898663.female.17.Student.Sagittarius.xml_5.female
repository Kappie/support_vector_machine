If I was smart I would strip off all my clothes and run around the house naked, but I still don't think it would help much, because I am still sweating from every oraphis...  The parents are still gone, and the thing is, they didn't plan to be gone this long, normally I so wouldn't mind the continued quiet...but they didn't leave me with enough food, and if I tried to cook. Hmm, lets not go there. I am still hungry though and I might brave Hamburger helper for the sake of I want to finish my Bronchitis medicine which must be taken with food and I have discovered that it doesn't really work with cereal.   Mathew needs to be saying more than one sylable words to me...  I think I am going to go make myself some dinner now because I'm hungry and crap.  Ciao~
