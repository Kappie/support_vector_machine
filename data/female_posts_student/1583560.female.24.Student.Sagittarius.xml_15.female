We are trying to get together at least 10 people to participate in a yahoo fantasy football team.  Fantasy baseball was a lot of fun and we are looking to carry over the fantasy craze into football and make sure we have more distractions from working. There may be a $10 per person entry fee that will all be used to reward the winners.  If you are interested send me an email message (any of mine would work but try jdunlap959@hotmail.com) or post a comment here.      Ok... Now back to tweaking my fantasy baseball team...
