Mood:   Tired from helping Monica and James move to their new apartment today. Payoff? They're going to help me move into MY new apartment in a few months!   Woo Woo! A Federal District Judge today struck down the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban as unconstitutional! Take that, you evil fetus-loving conservatives.  This lead Monica and me to discuss the legal basis behind the constitutionality of partial-birth abortions as well as gay marriage. Both of us obviously feel that both should be supported, but as far as developing a legal argument as to why these should be protected freedoms, we had a bit more difficulty reconciling. American Law is, of course, based off the Constitution and the courts use stare decisis in order rule on legal matters before it.  It goes without saying that there isn't much precedent for supporting these issues, and the constitution does necessary have a lot of evidence that would indicate that these should be fundamental rights. Hmmm...I must research this a bit more.
