Game of boggle (i beat erin. And tracy. And allison.)  We watched The Lion King, Chicago, Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (which was TERRIBLE), The Wild Duckie Chase, Three's Company, and a bunch of music videos. My computer COMPLETELY made Martina McBride sound like a guy in slow-motion, along with Keith Uhhhban. We played Scrabble (I won, Erin came in second, and Allison quit. Ashley was the consultant.) Wrote dirty mad libs, wrote nearly-porn stories, dowloaded a dictionary, listened to music, went to the Marquis picnic. We chucked balls at people, played with my rabbit, and talked about sex (baby, talked about you and me. Sorry, couldn't resist.) of course, my mother had a nasty habbit of adding to the conversation. We talked about the gestation period of an elephant and how chicken eggs get fertilized.  At 1:30 we finally went into our room, which used to be my dad's, and stayed up till 4. Oh, I forgot, between the makeup and the picnic, i opened presents. This is what I got:  Erin: School supplies and a gift card to Old Navy Allison: Purse and coin purse of my DREAMS (With me wherever i go!) and a gift card to Old Navy Ashley: 2005 Orlando Bloom Calendar (Replacing the kittens in my room) Tracy: Madlib and hemp-and-seashell-necklace (wearing it right now!) Emily B: Didn't come, but gave me a card and two cds at marquis. She gave me her music, which is like the Dashboard Confessionals and other stuff like that. I was surprised how much i like it! It's not as good as musicals, but close! (Listening to it right now!)  It was sooo much fun! Except for when allison's hearing aid battery died, and we called her mom, and then her mom got mad and grilled my mom, and then my mom grilled us...vicious cycle, I know.  With love, April
