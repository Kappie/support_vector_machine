So now, I'm here, thinking about my meaningless life. Do I Mean Anything To Anyone? I wish I could think of something, just one thing, meaningful to say right now but I'm drawing a blank.  Well, back to school tomorrow and I'm actually happy. Aside from the classes, school is fun. I mean, I get to hang out with all my friends so I'm not bored and thinking on overdrive.  Why do I write in here? Does anyone even read this? Oh, well, doesn't matter.  This will be my last post for today I think so g'niters to everyone.  Song:  I wish there was a photograph that showed me here with you And I could kiss the photograph and make my wish come true   I wish I was a humming dove so I could sing so sweet   I wish that I could steal the moon and kiss it with my feet   I wish I was a remedy that you wanted to take A product of a recipe that no one had to bake   I wish I could forget the day the hurting in my heart And wash our mouths with listerine to make a brand new start   Watching the rain fall down Watching the rain Watching the rain Watching the rain fall down Watching the rain Watching the rain fall down   I wish there was a fairytale that turned into my life So I could kiss Prince Charming man and be his princess wife   I wish the voices in my head would leave my ears alone   So my eyes could stop their water bleeding and I could find a home   I wish there was a ruby rose where I spread my wings and flew So I could inhale the perfume and be the morning dew   I wish the raindrops on the glass would let me join their dance I'd spin and twirl and laugh with them and drown my thoughts per-chance  -Watching The Rain- Katy Rose
