It's been a long time since I've been close to you It's been a long time since I've been sad. It's been a while since I've really spent time with you Wish I could take back the times that I had. The only thing that you ever really did for me Was make me oh so miserable.  And the hope that I never see your face again Is anything but questionable.  I hope this is goodbye. I hope this is goodbye.   There was a time when I thought you were a friend to me I think those times I was probably just drunk.  And if they offered a test about being a good friend I'd put money down that you'd surely flunk. The only thing that you ever really took from me  Were my records to sell them for dope.  Now all I have left is this heart in my chest  And my happiness helping me cope  I hope this is goodbye [x4]  It's been a long time since I've been close to you. It's been a long time since I've been sad. It's been a while since I've really spent time with you. Wish I could take back the times that I had. The only thing that you ever really did for me Was make me oh so miserable. And the hope that I never see your face again  Is anything but questionable. There was a time that I thought you were a friend to me I think those times I was probably just drunk. And if they offered a test about being a good friend I'd put money down that you'd surely flunk.  The only thing that you ever really took from me were my records to Hawk them for dope. Now all I have left is this heart in my chest,  Your dishonesty helping me cope.   I hope this is goodbye. I hope this is goodbye....    Great song, awesome lyrics.  AIM is still being gay. And I'm still procrastinating.  Keep it clean, crazies.
