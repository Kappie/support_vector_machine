I'm looking into getting a new photo hosting site and probably using many of them so that I never go over my bandwidth on one.      I watched Connie and Carla the movie last night. It was somewhat funny, but pretty amusing (well, it kept me amused for an hour and forty minutes, approx.). If you have nothing better to rent, then rent it, but if there's another movie you want to see don't bother.      Also, APPARENTLY, by September 1st $500 must be into my France account. It's my graduation present and yet I'm supposed to pay for it. Thanks, mom and dad. You're the GREATEST. SAID WITH SEVERE SARCASM.
