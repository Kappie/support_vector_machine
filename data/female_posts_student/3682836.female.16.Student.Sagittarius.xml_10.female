I hate hate hate everything thats going on. I love my mom, until a few days ago.. I considered her a best friend of mine, shes so cool..  treats me like an actual human instead of a baby like my grandma. I love my mother, so please let her stay with me. I wish i could have a normal family just for a few days to see what its like. I dont have a dad, and in a few months, years.. decades.. whatever I wont have a mom either. I can only wish. Dream on Ashly. Nothing that great could happen to u. If I lose my mom, I will go into a deep depression and that will be it, no way I can live my life without her. Everything FUCKING SUCKS NOW! Unbelievable that someones life can change in one minute.    ASHLY
