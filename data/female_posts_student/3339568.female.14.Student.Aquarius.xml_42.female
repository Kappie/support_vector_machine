Thanks God  I think He's finally helped me to put it into perspective bf/gf relationships really don't matter that much In time, it will all happen It'll follow his divine plan I just have to be patient  I've honestly had a great week I'm elated at the tiniest things, that I usually took for granted. Mi happiness is back. :D
