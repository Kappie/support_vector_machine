I think it's a stupid question, why would I only want to live in one place? What if I move there and hate it, or there's a change of plans or dreams? What if I have a mid-life crisis or something? Stupid people... I wrote about Scotland. It took me 20 minutes to even think about a topic, then I couldn't decide between San Diego, California, staying in Minnesota, or Scotland. When the teacher told everyone to start, I was the only person who didn't start writing. I know I'm not the only one who feels like this... like I don't know what I want to do, or I feel lost, but why does it always seem like it?  I know I could have done better, but I hate the topic, it's too restricted...  Now I'm bored... and hungry.   I hate forwards. I hate the people who send them more. So I asked the person NICELY to stop, and they automatically assume I'm having an attitude at them. Makes me laugh. I'm so sick of their bullshit all I can do is laugh anymore... even though inside I'm crying. Burn in hell. I wanted to scream at them at the top of my lungs, and shake them until they screamed so hard that their voicebox broke inside their throat, choking them in their own blood... I can hear the gurgling of saliva and blood now... and they closed their eyes so hard that their eyes popped into the back of their head. Kind of disturbing... makes me laugh, even though I hate feeling this way.
