I don't need my old work, and there's all that stuff I should have deleted and didn't. Of course there are also many inconveniences, but it's not deadly. I'm gonna lose lots of artwork and writing and files in general that mean things to me, but it won't kill me...  I'll just pretend I've been robbed.  and this preparing myself for te worst and only end in good. If my hard disk is intact [it won't be], then I can be happy.  But I don't hink it is.  I'm not in the middle of writing some huge paper, so... yeah. Won't hurt.  Too much.  I've also written a time table which I will try to follow tommorow.  That means I gotta go to bed. Now.
