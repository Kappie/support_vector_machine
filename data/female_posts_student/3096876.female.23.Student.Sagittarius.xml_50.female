I am feeling absolutely helpless, without recourse, and utterly confused.   * * * Before anyone reads on, because I know I have a few loyal readers, this is not a shiny, happy post. It's gonna be dark, and you're gonna want to hear this from my mouth. But I need to get this out. So read on if you must, but read carefully. * * *   On Monday, work people gathered together to witness the committal of our friend Steve to the earth. The service was long, and sad, and bitter-sweet as funerals always are. They are the times that people, long-lost friends, come together again. But it's always the worst time for a reunion. In honesty, the thing that kept me together, the thing that prevented me from airing out all my sadness in public at that service was that jack-ass guy with the radio-announcer voice.  Buddy, you are far too earnestly enthusiastic about our dead friend. For Pete's sake, please shut the fuck up , I wanted to scream on half a dozen occasions within that two hours. I held my tongue, because not everybody hates radio announcers.   The reality really hasn't set in yet. It's probably because I'm still only part-time at work, and even then, only seeing my part-time hours, part-time. Making it to work has not been my forte as of late. More on that in a moment...   Yesterday, during my very brief stay at work, Ashley came and talked to me. He has not been handling this well, I know, and I avoided talking to him first because I didn't want him to feel pressured to talk about anything he's not comfortable with yet. But he came and talked to me. He actually got choked up a couple of times, and I felt terrible telling him I had to leave. But I had to leave...   It's a very odd situation, this thing at work. How many people there am I really tight with? Mona, of course; Ashley, a bit; and that's really it. No one else really knows anything about me, I don't really know anything about anybody else. Nothing really personal, anyway. And death, and the way it can affect you, is such a personal thing. Here we are, this group of strangers united by a common employer, having only each other to rely in this dark, sad, confusing time. No one is talking about it, but no one has yet denied the truth of Steve's death. His friend, a pastor, called it a sickness, his sadness. He said that Steve succame to his sickness like anyone else might. His friend, the pastor, also used his time at the podium to deliver a little conversion sermon. This also, I found, to be extremely inappropriate, just like Mr. Radio Announcer Voice. He made me question the existence of god more than ever. He said that the light and goodness in Steve was special. I agree. But he said it was special because it was the light of god. That's bullshit, as far as I'm concerned. Steve wasn't a good man because some omnipotent power was controlling him. He was a good man because that's who he is. Just like some people have allergies, or blonde hair, or a limp--that's just who he is. It's not a random formulation, but the sum total of innumerable factors. I guess when people can't count high enough, they forget the numbers and just call it "god". But I wonder, if Steve's goodness was god, what was Steve's sadness?   Is it only our weaknesses that belong to us, and our strengths only to a higher power? That makes no sense to me. It's all or nothing, and if it all belongs to god, then what the fuck are we even doing here? We're here because it all belongs to us. The good, the bad, everything in between. Anything we can experience with our senses is 100% fundamentally human, mortal, and belonging to us.   God doesn't choose who lives and who dies, there's no choice at all. Choice is an illusion. The most important, the most life-altering things in our existence completely supercede the realm of"choice". When, where, how you're born: not your choice. Whether you're born blind or limb-less, whether you live a fortunate life or an unfortunate one: it is beyond our choosing.   And I can say that because my life has been altered in an entirely unforseeable way by a single act that happened one night in the summer of 1997. Had I been able to see forward to this day, many things would have been different. But we don't have the gift of foresight as humans, only hindsight. We cannot learn of the future, only of the past.
