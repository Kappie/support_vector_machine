The Oral Comm Class was behind in lectures and time was running short, so the class taught by  Dr. Coons  met at 7am to have a two hour lecture. The front wall of the classroom was completely covered in easel paper with notes, and the dry erase board was also completely covered with notes. That class left at 8:55, and my class came in immediately for our class w/ Dr. Coons. One stupid girl and a sidekick decided to write "cues" on the board among the notes for our exam. She wrote, he stood guard. The rest of us were in such shock we did nothing. The prof returned w/ the exam, and we started. The prof copied the notes from the board to have what the class had.... and found the cues. Not saying anything, she ran to  Cates  office (dept head) and mass media to get  Frank B  (film prof). In her absence, another fellow ran up to the board and erased what he could. They returned, and turned on the camera, to find mostly erased notes.... Cates said that those responsible for the cheating would not graduate from VSU. The exams were collected. The class left. A few of us remained and told the prof the "who's" to protect ourselves. In this case, honesty was the best thing for me to do. The  Institution Review Board of VSU  recommended that the entire class be expelled from the univ. Dr. Coons decided that was a bit excessive - and is now pursuing punishment for only the 3. The class did lose points from the exam - which I must say was deserved. I may have to go to  court  to witness for the class, b/c there is more than likely going to be a number of law suits stemming from this - and being that I did witness already I am in the hotseat.  Not a fun week.    2) VSO   Two  VSO  concerts, and my last. While I will say that I often bitch about VSO, I will miss it terribly. It was a truly fantastic concert, probably the best I've ever heard. The problem was however that the AC died on Sat. morning.  Sawyer  theater next door was at an astounding 86 Degrees F during our theater tech run through, and I'll get to that in a moment. With a full orchestra and an enthused audience, things in Whitehead got hot fast. Theater, the attorney managers and I, AND  Dr. Harding  called Plant Operations to get the problem fixed to no success. When  Dr. Zac  (univ. pres.) got there, Dr H and I approached him and told him to get it fixed ASAP b/c our crowd really can't take heat like that. Meanwhile, I'm running around to get things fixed  done wearing a business suit BURNING UP!!! It was extradinarly hot. The AC did, however, come back on during intermission.  Thank God.     3) Theater   I was asst. stage manager for  "A Final Showing"  - which was a improvisational theater show involving lights, music, visual art, dance and rhythm. that was created by a faculty member  (Mr. Pat) . We had our tech run through in Sawyer in 86 F heat on Sat., and the show was on Sunday. The show was an awesome 3hr success. It was truly amazing. However, towards the end, the stage crew - not used to moving concert grand pianos, ran the damn thing right over my foot.  OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was really cool to work in the theater dept, and I had a blast.  SAI  and  PMA  performed on the last number, a non-traditional percussion ensemble. We had a post party at  CJs . What was really funny about it was that when I sat down, already injured, the chair gave way and down I went. Oh well. Everyone got a laugh, and that is important.    3) PARTY!!!!!!!!!    VSO stage crew [Me, Beth, Jonathan L., Andy B., Amy B., Todd, and Russell Brown as guest]   had a party. A $150 bar tab at Vito's. Holy cow!!! We then went to Bill's Bayou and partied and danced there, and then went to  Prof. Todd's  house to watch  Something About Mary . Awesome, awesome night.   4) Another PARTY!!!!!!!!   We had a party here at my place after VSO. [me, Prof Todd, Debbie, Jerry, Kevin, Lainey, Laura, Ken, Andy B, others??? - I don't recall] I can never ever just come home and crash after a concert - I have to unwind. Anyway, I had alot of fun.  SouthPark  the movie was on, and there is nothing like  semi-drunk music people singing along to the entire movie. Then, we brought out the guitar and sang to oldies as  Prof Todd  played, and then we moved on to making/writing sexual poetry on the fridge.... hehehe. Hilarious. Anyway, it was a blast, and I have moved into a whole new realm of partying because you know it rocked when you have faculty crashing on your couch!   5) SAI Stuff   SAI had a sister social on Thursday, yardsale on Sat. morning, and senior farewell on Sunday. I didn't think the farewell would hit me as hard as it did. I love you girls!!!!!!   6) Job Shit   I lost my job... yeah my beloved job at  International Programs  is no more... However, I must add that I am first on the "re-hire" list. The reason I am out is b/c there is absolutely no money left to pay me with. When the new fiscal year starts, there will probably be more money. That will be mid-June at the earliest.    7) Senior Presentation Comm Arts   Basically, it is what it sounds like, and I aced it! YIPPPEE. Thanks to  Toni  for letting me use her class as the "guinea pigs".   8) Persuasion Theory in Music   Did a special lecture. Went very well - I can't believe I pulled that off!!!!   9)  Other notes   Had a great dinner with  Debbie, Martyne, Melanie (SAI Mel)  at the UC. Thx  Deb  for buying! Great convo w/  Martyne  - played 'the soulmate game'. Apparently  Jarrett Glass  is my soulmate.  Caroline  is in town, and living with me, or am I living with her? Either way, she's here. Had dinner with  Greg Doke , great to see him! Went to  Miranda's  new apt., its awesome! Bought a new book, Glenn Beck's The Real America. I'm really looking forward to reading it, I love his radio show. I think that is all........ I know I'm forgetting something.    Irene : Hang in there!  Jarrett : I'm happy for ya!  Martyne : I'm doing the Happy Dance for ya!  Scott  Rick:  Where the hell are ya?  Toni : I thank ya!  Russell  Greg : Good to see ya!  Miranda : Great apt!  Mr. Pat : Great show!  Liz : GET SOME FUCKING REST!!!!!!!!!!!!
