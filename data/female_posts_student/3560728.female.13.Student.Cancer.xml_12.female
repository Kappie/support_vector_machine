There's this neverending chorus of crickets coming from a hill nearby that's kind of irritating, but it also reminds me of time spent in dingy hotels where crickets chirped endlessly all through the night. I travelled so much when I was little, and it's all sort of a blur. I really miss it though. Now all I do are these five hour drives back and forth to our cabin. I think I'd rather go to Europe...
