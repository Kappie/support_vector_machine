Yesterday and today have been horrid, and You ordained them to be that way... well, You probably ordained them to be good despite all that's happened, but it certainly doesn't feel like it. All my expectations have been shattered, and it hurts! I really need someone to hold me tight right now and tell me how much they love me. Please do that for me... it says that You draw near to the brokenhearted - please keep that promise. Help me relax and enjoy the rest of my evening, despite the fact that it doesn't look very good... and help me shake that attitude. I'm ready and willing for things to start looking up... please make them better! You promise that You will wipe all our tears away, but mine keep flowing. You are a God of peace and love and comfort... gosh, I need that so much right now!! My tears pour out like a garden fountain - swiftly, profusely, and never ceasing. You can change that, and I ask that You do. You heard David's cries and rescued him... rescue me! Save me from the pain I feel right now! I need You more than ever now... please comfort me.
