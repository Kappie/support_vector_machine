So I got there at around 9 ish and I went to the "lounge" and there were like 11 people in there and I got stuck with the older people. One table had 4 people, kids, that were hired and the other table had three people on their mid-20's. So they made me sit there. I found out that I was the youngest one there! Everyone introduced themselves like I'm a junior at Cal State Fullerton, I'm a freshman at USC, or crap like that and I was like.."Um, I'm Julia and I'm going to be a senior at Walnut High" lolz....we all started laughing. Yea and then Three LONG  hours started with listening to policies and dress code and filling out papers and such.  Then I ate at like 1 for the first time that day. I had a salad from Burger King...It really is good. But then I got hungry at like 3. I don't think I ate though. Then I went to Anna's to swim with my sister and Anna of course. Then we went to Jack in the box where it smelled like ASS. Then we went to Old Navy, Mervyn's, Marshalls....and any other store that was in the strip mall. lolz, but mission accomplished i got some clothes for my job.  David said he'd call so I hope he does.  P.S. I have to go to work at 8 manana....
