Shane and I hit the Hostess/Wonder and Entemans outlet shops then headed to my mom's.  On the way there she called asking if I could pull over on the side of the road somewhere and find her cattails as a gag gift for the musical they were doing that night.  I wound up at Verchio's (a wholesale produce stand) looking to see if I could find any there.  Well $25 on fruit and veggies later alas, no cattails.  Got to my mom's and my sister, Krista, was on her way home with some.  Hung out there for a while till my sister came home.  She was scheduled to watch my son Shane while I went and saw the musical my mom and sister, Jaclynne, were involved in.  Went to the musical and oh my god.  Now keeping in mind that i was watching a theatre group of kids ages 8-16, I tried to not be too critical.  I couldn't understand a thing they were saying, the kids that needed volume (mics) didn't have 'em and the kids that didn't need them had 'em.  Costumes were awesome (great job as usual Mom!!) and all the stage and set parts were perfect (Jac is the best!!)  but after saying that, I want the 2 hours of my life back!!  There was so much left to be desired with the coreography and the blocking was alittle awkward at times.  I know what to expect from kids, but I didn't get nearly what I thought that group should have done.  Oh well!!  So that was my exciting day and night.  TTFN B
