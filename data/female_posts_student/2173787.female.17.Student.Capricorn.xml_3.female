It all seems so fake and unoriginal, everyone posed and proper (or improper depending on the person...), we all know that and yet it seems many go through the picture day morning ritual.  I know I did.  It seems so pointless yet still valid.  What I want to know is what I'm trying to prove by it all.  hmm....things to think about.
