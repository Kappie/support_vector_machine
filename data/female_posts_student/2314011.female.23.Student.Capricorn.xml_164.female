The Boy met a nice guy who loves Allison Janney.  And that's a good thing.    Sadie laughed until she snorted while reading Contracts flashcards.    I've convinced myself that I will do well this semester.  (Props to the Oracle for the affirmation)  Karen reached between my legs.    Sadie got caught checking a girl out.    The Grind became not only the cool place I hang out on lazy weekends and flexible work afternoons, but also the cool place I study for finals in with my peeps.
