AFI - The Last Kiss  - One of the best AFI songs ever. Fast, hard, good lyrics. I can't say I'm not sad more AFI songs were like this.   3. HIM - Gone With the Sin  - I don't listen to very much HIM because it's too popular now and I can't deal with that very much but I still love this song. It's very smooth and soothing.  4. Interpol - Hands Away  - I don't know what's so great about this song exactly. I like how calm it is. It almost sounds mysterious. "Oh, what happened." I love that.   5. Vanessa Carlton - Twilight  - I was wondering if any of my Vanessa Carlton songs were going to come up. I should have known. I love the girl. I love her voice and her piano. Some songs aren't so great but some are amazing and gorgeous. This is one. I'd go to a Vanessa Carlton concert.   6. Anti-Flag - Bring Out Your Dead  - I love putting songs on shuffle - I go from Twilight to this. I like this song for the same reason as the first two. Fast and hard and intense and a little raw, but not like Sparta. I like best when the title is sung. "Bring out your DEEEEAAAAD."  7. AFI - Crop Tub  - Oh man I love this song. Brings back loads of memories. "Fuck you very much." I thought that was just about the greatest thing ever, I still like it alot actually. Then after all the bad things from the song directed at whoever at the end is, "Have a nice day." I would say that it "tickles me" but I know that doesn't quite fit so I'll just say I like it.   8. Cursive - Sink to the Beat  -   I like the ending best but the whole song is totally awesome.   9. Generation X - Dancing With Myself  - This is on my Generation X CD and Billy Idol's greatest hits but I ripped it from Perfect Hits (Generation X) and it is a little different so I just put that. I love Generation X and Billy Idol and this is one of the best songs. Billy Idol can make me feel giddy as a schoolgirl. (I am a schoolgirl, really...but you know the expression.)  Useless note:  In Latin class we wrote Valentines for V-Day and I didn't have a Valentine so I decided to do someone famous and did Billy Idol. Ha.   10. AFI (cover) - Demonomania  - I was on a roll when I was putting all these AFI songs on and I just copied the entire A Fire Inside EP. This was one of the first AFI songs I heard and I like the song no matter who does it but I like AFI's version, they did good. Horray.  11. AFI - Of Greetings and Goodbyes  - What's up with all the AFI songs showing up in the first 25? Anyway, this is one of AFI's finest if I do say so myself. I used to always leave my computer when I went to bed so I could leave the away message of, "Go kill the lights! We'll glow til morning comes. I'll say goodnight and bow to everyone." It was great. I try to save electricity so I don't leave my computer on at night anymore. The little light on the CPU annoys me, too. It's too bright.   12. Refused - New Noise  - Oh boy I love this song. This band was so innovative and unique. I love all the crazy and experimental things they put in their songs. This is one of the best. I especially like the beginning, "CAN I SCREAM?" and the end, "THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS THE NEW BEATS" and so on and so forth then he says, "Thank you" and drops the mic. Good stuff.  13. Blondie - Call Me  - Show me somebody who doesn't love this song.   14. Danzig - Am I Demon  - If Glenn Danzig had anything to do with it I'll probably like it.  15. Interpol - Say Hello to the Angels  - I like Interpol. The away message I use half of the time on AIM is the first few lines on this song, "I want your silent parts. The parts the birds love. I know there's such a place. I had my back turned. You didn't realize I'm lonely." This is one of my favorite Interpol songs (notice it's on my playlist).  16. AFI - Girl's Not Grey  - Gah. Who doesn't like this song. I don't care who you are, even if you don't like to admit it (>me  17. I Hate Myself - This Isn't Tenka-ichi-Budokai  - I love this band. I love this band a whole lot. This was the first song I heard and it's still one of my favorites. It's so sad and powerful. This guy can scream. Whatever broke his heart really did the job.  18. The Cure - The Lovecats  - Best Cure video ever.   19. The Damned - Fan Club  - This is my second favorite Damned song. I like how Dave Vanian's voice is so laid back sounding.   20. Alkaline Trio - Mr. Chainsaw  - I love the lyrics to this song. Most of Alkaline Trio's lyrics seem just like good poetry. This is one my favorite song by them. Favorite lyric parts of the song: "I found out recently that you're leaving. For good, I hope, I softly tell my ceiling." "I took a hammer and two nails to my eardrums long ago before that steak knife took my eyes." "I guess I should be one to talk. There's nights that I can't even walk, there's days I couldn't give a fuck and in between is where I'm stuck." Then the last lines. "In case you're wondering we're singing about growing up, about giving up and giving in."  21. AFI - A Single Second  - Gah. More AFI. Honestly. I like the harmony with Nick13.  22. System of a Down - Spiders  - Only one of two songs I've heard by SOAD. Are all the songs as great as this one? This song is amazing. I love the guitar solo. Love the guitar solo.  23. Morrissey - Irish Blood, English Heart  - Horray for Moz's new album. I know this is one song from You Are the Quarry alot of people are talking about. It's very good.   24. The Misfits - Teenagers From Mars  - I have so many Misfits song on my playlist I was wondering if any would show up. The Misfits are like AFI where it introduced me to alot of stuff that I got a kick out of because it was so "bad" or whatever. That sounds stupid but I guess it was kind of stupid. "The insemination of little girls in the middle of wet dreams." Far cry from Billy Gilman. Ha ha. I'm surprised I just admit that. He's a country singer, if you don't know.  Note:  I had to look up  insemination  when I first heard it. It's okay to laugh.  25. AFI - Mini Trucks Suck  - Woah crazy ending this with my favorite song of all time. I still smile when I think about the time I had it on my AIM profile and this guy said (I'm pretty sure this is exact), "Sweet mother of god child" and I was like, "What?" He said, "Your profile." I'll put the lyrics because I'm bored and they are the best AFI's ever written. "Mini trucks suck. Cross the street in your mini truck. Mini trucks suck. Stupid piece of shit. Hip hop fuck. Cruising with my new whore. I'm outta beer and I need more. Marijuana has got me high. Can only be heard when I need pot. Look at me, I said you're a prick. Flip off me - you wanna suck dick? Stand right there I'll fucking hit you. I'll take this hit you back, hit you back, hit you back and slam right into a pole. Mini trucks suck. Cross the street in your mini truck. Mini trucks suck. Stupid piece of shit. Hip hop fuck. Like to cruise when I know I'm poor. I'm a regular at the liquor store. Max out the stereo, pump up the bass. I buy girl shit. Wanna drive in a race. Think I'd rather fuck a chump. Need my beer and a little joint. Friend's are easy - they don't shit. Down and suck, down and suck, down and suck...at least I'm getting laid. Yeeeeah boyeeeeeeee. Mini trucks suck. Cross the street in your mini trucks. Mini trucks suck. Stupid piece of shit. Hip hop fuck." That was from memory, I'm almost positve I didn't forget anything but I was doing it while distracted.
