I have to go to work today, I think a couple people might visit me though, so that might help break up my day a little bit. I have a song on my mind:  This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  I'll tear us apart  Can I be your enemy  Losing half a year  Waiting for you here  I'd be your anything   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  Tearing out my heart  I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings disappear  Can I be your memory   So get back, back, back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back, back, back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   Can I be your memory   -Sugarcult  Carpe Diem!
