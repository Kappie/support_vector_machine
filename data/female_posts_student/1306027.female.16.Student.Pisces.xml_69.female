I've been happy one day and depressed the next. Normal teenage life you may say.... hardly. I have so much crap coming down on me it's not even funny. Let me just list some of the stuff I gotta do the next 2 1/2 months.    Prom Promo pic.... yep, It's gonna be in the paper so all ya'll who know me- look for it on April 2nd.  Pagent Interview- Who me? Yea, Apparently someone nominated me so I decided to take a dive. For me it may be more like a plunge.. but hey- there's always hope, right?  Prom. Yea, it's right around the corner. Get this! I get to make a speech! Isn't that awesome? Yea... I thought so too...  Standardized Tests- man those suck. And guess what! Daniel is totally ditching on me this year! Well... not really but, he's not testing at the same school I am... *grrrrr* He was supposed to be there so he could draw attention away from me!  The Secret Thing. Yea there is actually a secret thing. Well... It's a big secret and boy are ya'll gonna be surprised. I may even make a new layout on it just for this blog! Some of ya'll know what it is...but most of you don't so just you wait! Hint: It's gonna take an enormous amount of work.   And that's pretty much my life for the next few months. Not to mention my appointment with an allergy and asthma specialist. All this a sick for 4 months straight. Ya, my life is no fun.    Guess what else I have been doing  Answering the first hate mail for the prom. I was fired up too.... I'm gonna post it so ya'll know exactly how I feel. Feel free to comment.
