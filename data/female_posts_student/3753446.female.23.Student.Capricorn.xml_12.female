A lot of times I wonder how I present myself I only really know how I see me And never really how you see me But I do wish I could climb into your head At every moment that you are you And really find out when I am there And what fancies, colors, settings, and memories You have put me there with Because really, there is a bond Outside of us, but what is it inside?   It was amazing to see Everything I loved about The world The sunshine, stars, waves, Touristy people, attractive young men,  Sandy beaches, city life,  Culture, sunsets on the  Horizon, mountains, villages,  Childish song, and dance In a tiny speck of an Island in the greatest  Of the oceans All in four days with you. I can’t think of anyone else I could have created those particular Memories with Mahalo, my friend.   Freewrite on the beach  Five shades of blue Crystalline see through The odd sailboat The odd white foamy wave Total lack of hot men Except the gay one next to me I wonder why they call it diamondhead I love the natural distribution Of the palm trees As though they are not Artificial There to be seen but not there out of someones showmanship Beauty that doesn’t know it Fobiness extends everywhere and I don’t know hardly what to do with it I wish I could see a sea turtle Or lose this belly Ohmigod if I could lose this belly Battle of a lifetime I tell ya Maybe I could lose the flab and somehow use it to make the sun come out from behind the clouds again I love the slow rhythm of the waves hitting the beach   Sad day poem  There are times I feel I can’t keep up Or don’t belong It’s a world that I am not accustomed to that  Occasionally my companions are swept into And then I just want to go away And hide Or pretend it doesn’t matter if I’m there And I try to force myself to stick it out Be patient and dorky and dumb Fake energetic and happy Try to jump into the joke Because that is how I feel  And I know you don’t intend it But it is part of the dynamic And I love people too much To just leave them  But you know what I worry Sometimes that if I left Few would notice Or know me deeper than the surface It’s counterproductive and safe  To be social and antisocial at once And now it is written down
