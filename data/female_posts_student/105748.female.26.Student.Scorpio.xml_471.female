I think I'm going to try and move my files from geocities over to goldensushi, maybe to try to get away from the stupid ads that show up all the time. Anyway, for those of you who don't know me, I'm Jimbo, I'm 18, just graduating from High School...(Commencement is in 8 days!) and I'm one of Ching's Pinoy friends from Wichita, you could say, a friend of the family.  Glad to join the group!  -Jimbo
