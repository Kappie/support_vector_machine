Or that government researchers still swab burning chemicals into rabbits’ eyes and onto their shaved skin? Or that some government tests kill 3,000 animals every time they are conducted? This site will give you the information that you need to help the millions of animals suffering in chemical toxicity tests.  Right this minute in laboratories across the U.S., rabbits are confined to stocks while chemicals eat away the soft skin on their backs, right down to the muscle and tissue beneath. After the chemical does its damage, the rabbits are killed-their lives snuffed out in misery for just one more meaningless number on a chart. The tests are completely unnecessary because there are now cheaper, faster, and better non-animal tests that can replace them. If the U.S. followed the example of European countries, the suffering and deaths of countless animals could be prevented PETA has identified five tests on animals that could be stopped today without any threat to public health and safety. Click on the numbered links on the left to learn more about these tests and their non-animal replacements (or  urlLink click here  to download printer-friendly factsheets). Then check out the what you can do link to find out how you can help pressure U.S. agencies to turn their backs on animal testing once and for all.   Corrosive agents are chemicals that cause irreversible damage and destruction of the skin, often burning through several layers of tissue. Corrosive reactions are typified by ulcers, bleeding, bloody scabs, and discoloration.Corrosivity data are mainly collected by regulatory agencies concerned with the transportation of hazardous substances, in the event of a highway accident and chemical spill. In the U.S., the Department of Transportation requires the submission of skin corrosion data consistent with the standards of the United Nations Transport Authority. Corrosion is also an endpoint in skin irritation studies mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency in its assessments of pesticide formulations and ingredients. In this case, corrosivity represents the most extreme form of skin irritation, in which the skin is literally destroyed beyond the body’s ability to heal.  Rabbits are locked into full-body restraints and a test chemical is applied to the shaved skin on their back.The wound site is then covered with a gauze patch for the duration of the exposure period, normally four hours, after which the patch is removed and the degree of skin damage is read and scored at specified time intervals. Untreated skin areas serve as the control.A chemical is considered to be corrosive if, by the end of a 14-day observation period, the chemical has burned through the outer layer of the skin of one or more animals, leaving visibly dead tissue in its wake. No painkillers are provided.Despite their years of use, animal-based skin corrosion studies have never been properly validated. In fact, evidence exists that animal studies are highly variable, of limited reliability, and generally poor predictors of human skin reactions.For example, a comparison of data from rabbit tests and four-hour human skinpatch tests for 65 substances found that 45 percent of classifications of chemical irritation potential based on animal tests were incorrect. (MK Robinson et al., Food Chem Toxicol 40, 573-592, 2002) Human skin equivalent tests such as EpiDerm™ and EpiSkin™ have been validated and accepted in Canada, the European Union, and virtually all other member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as total replacements for animal-based skin corrosion studies. These methods consist of normal, human-derived skin cells, which have been cultured to form a multi-layered model of human skin.The reliability and relevance of human skin equivalent models has been established through rigorous, inter-laboratory validation studies overseen by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), and these methods have been accepted as an official OECD test guideline. However, their acceptance as stand-alone replacements in the U.S. has been undermined by several members of the Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), most notably the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which insists that “confirmatory” testing still be carried out using animals.Corrositex™ is another non-animal method of assessing skin corrosion. Using a protein membrane instead of skin, Corrositex™ can measure whether, and at what rate, a chemical is capable of penetrating the simulated skin barrier according to a color-change reaction. Corrositex™ was pioneered in the U.S., assessed by ICCVAM to confirm its validity, and subsequently accepted by both the U.S. Department of Transportation and European Union as a partial replacement for animal-based skin corrosion studies.   Skin absorption studies are carried out to determine the rate at which a chemical is able to penetrate the skin. A chemical’s dermal delivery rate is mainly of interest to regulatory agencies concerned with chemical exposures in the workplace. U.S. federal agencies that require the submission of skin absorption data include the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.  Rats’ backs are shaved and a chemical is smeared on them for an exposure period of up to 24 hours, after which the rats’ skin is washed and the animals are housed individually in “metabolism cages” to permit the collection of their excrement for analysis. Animals are later killed and their skin, blood, and excrement are analyzed, after which the rate of skin absorption is calculated. Despite their years of use, animal-based studies of skin absorption rate have never been properly validated to establish their relevance to people. Other disadvantages not mentioned include the potential for biasing the results of the animal studies by the process of washing off the test chemical from the animals’ skin, thus facilitating absorption of the test chemical. Various tissue culture methods have been rigorously evaluated and accepted in Europe as total replacements for animalbased skin absorption studies. These methods use skin from a variety of sources to measure the passage of a test chemical into and across skin to a fluid reservoir. Absorption of a test chemical is measured over time by analysis of the receptor fluid and the treated skin.The reliability and relevance of in vitro skin absorption studies have been thoroughly established through a number of international expert reviews, and these methods have been codified and accepted as an official test guideline of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).The non-animal tests have a number of scientific advantages over the animal tests, including the ability to study a broader range of doses, including those at the actual level of exposure that occurs in the occupational or ambient environment. Despite these clear advantages, however, most U.S. agencies continue to rely on animal testing to measure skin absorption.   Irritants are chemicals that cause skin damage that is reversible (unlike corrosion, which is irreversible). Clinical signs of irritation include the development of a rash, inflammation, swelling, scaling, and abnormal tissue growth in the affected area. A number of U.S. federal agencies require the submission of skin irritation data, including the Consumer Product Safety Commission (cosmetics and household products), the Environmental Protection Agency (pesticide formulations and ingredients), and the Food and Drug Administration (pharmaceuticals).  Rabbits are locked into full-body restraints and a test chemical is applied to the shaved skin on their back. The wound site is then covered with a gauze patch for the duration of the exposure period, normally four hours, after which the patch is removed and the degree of irritation is read and scored at specified time intervals. Untreated skin areas serve as the control.A chemical is considered to be an irritant if it causes reversible skin lesions, such as inflammation or other clinical signs, which heal partially or totally by the end of a 14-day observation period. No painkillers are provided.Despite their years of use, animal-based skin irritation studies have never been properly validated. In fact, evidence exists that animal studies are highly variable, of limited reliability, and generally poor predictors of human skin reactions. For example, a comparison of data from rabbit tests and four-hour human skin-patch tests for 65 substances found that 45 percent of classifications of chemical irritation potential based on animal tests were incorrect. (MK Robinson et al., Food Chem Toxicol 40, 573-592, 2002) Government regulators in Canada accept the use of a skinpatch test in human volunteers as a valid replacement for animal-based skin irritation studies. Human patch tests offer the benefit of being directly relevant to people, thus obviating the questionable practice of extrapolating the results of rabbit tests to humans. However, before a chemical is considered for a human skin-patch test, scientists first confirm that a chemical is not corrosive (using a non-animal method described in  urlLink the Skin Corrosion factsheet ) and carry out computer modeling and various test-tube studies to be certain that a chemical does not possess other harmful properties. Only chemicals that appear to be non-irritating move on to a human skinpatch test to confirm their safety.   Phototoxicity, or photoirritation, is an inflammatory skin reaction caused by exposure to a chemical and subsequent exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet radiation. Phototoxicity typically appears as exaggerated sunburn, which is characterized by the presence of a rash, swelling, and inflammation. This endpoint is mainly a concern for drugs and pharmaceuticals that are either ingested or applied directly to the skin in the form of a cream.The only regulatory agency in the U.S. that routinely requires phototoxicity studies is the Food and Drug Administration.  Mice or guinea pigs are locked into restraints and different concentrations of a test chemical are applied to patches of shaved skin on their backs. Half the animals are then exposed to ultraviolet radiation for two or more hours, after which the chemical is removed. The animals are then kept restrained for several days while experimenters examine their skin. Swelling and sores are common. No painkillers are provided. Despite their years of use, animal-based phototoxicity studies have never been properly validated to establish their relevance to people or even codified into a standardized test guideline. In fact, the only internationally recognized guideline for phototoxicity studies is the non-animal, cell-based test described at right. The 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) Phototoxicity Test was developed and validated in Europe and has since been accepted at the international level as a total replacement for animal-based phototoxicity studies. In this test, cells from the 3T3 cell line are exposed to a test chemical in the presence and absence of light. Photo-cytotoxicity is evaluated by the relative reduction in viability of cells exposed to the chemical in the presence versus absence of light, where cell viability is measured by degree to which they are able to absorb the dye, neutral red.Although the reliability and relevance of the 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Test have been established through rigorous, inter-laboratory validation studies overseen by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), and this method has been accepted as an official test guideline of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences continue to rely on animal testing to assess the phototoxic potential of new drugs and pharmaceuticals.   Pyrogens are fever- and inflammation-causing agents that can pose a serious health hazard, especially in the case of intravenous drugs and pharmaceutical products. The only regulatory agency in the U.S. that routinely requires pyrogenicity studies is the Food and Drug Administration.  A rabbit pyrogen test has been in use since the 1940s. In this test, rabbits are locked in full-body restraints and a test substance is injected into their bloodstream while their body temperature is monitored. The animals can suffer effects ranging from fever to breathing problems, circulatory and organ failure, and even fatal shock. Despite its long history of use, the rabbit pyrogen test has never been formally validated to establish its reliability or relevance to humans. In fact, there are a number of well-documented drawbacks to this test, including marked species and strain differences in sensitivity.(T Hartung et al.,ATLA 29, 99-123, 2001) An In Vitro Pyrogen Test has been developed and validated in Europe as a total replacement for animal-based pyrogenicity studies. As an immune reaction, pyrogenicity involves an interaction between a contaminant in a drug formulation and cells of the immune system. Using human blood donated by healthy volunteers as the test medium, this non-animal method is able to fully model the interaction between the immune system’s white blood cells and the test drug, thereby confirming the presence or absence of pyrogen contamination. Additionally, this determination can be made in vitro with greater speed and sensitivity and at a lower cost than animal-based methods would allow. Despite these advantages, the Food and Drug Administration continues to rely on animal testing to assess the pyrogenic potential of new drugs and pharmaceuticals.   January 15, 2004, marked the official launch of PETA's "Give the Animals 5" Campaign with a reception hosted by Congressman Jim Moran (D-Va.). Rep. Moran is taking the lead in making Congress aware of these non-animal methods and urging his fellow legislators to end the use of animal testing where internationally recognized non-animal methods can be used instead. In a letter to his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives, Rep. Moran wrote: "We have enacted landmark legislation to protect the public from harmful chemicals. To carry out these laws, our federal agencies require pesticides and industrial chemicals to be tested to measure their toxicity levels. This is not cruel--this is good policy. "What is cruel, however, is to treat animals like test tubes. While no one is intentionally cruel in crafting measures to protect the public health, unfortunately, that is the result if we are not intentionally aiming to incorporate non-animal test methods. "I doubt any member of Congress believes that an animal should be subjected to pain in a toxicity test if a non-animal test would give an equally accurate result. I hope that you will review the information on the reverse and agree upon the same goal: The U.S. needs to take the lead in developing sophisticated, scientifically sound, non-animal toxicity testing methods." On February 23, 2004, Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Bridgeport) joined Rep. Moran in writing to the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In their letters, the members of Congress invited the head of each agency "to improve the science underlying your agency's regulatory decisions while also reducing animal suffering." They also posed a number of probing questions regarding the agencies' ongoing reluctance to embrace existing, validated non-animal test methods.  urlLink Click here  to find out how you can help pressure U.S. agencies to turn their backs on animal testing once and for all.   Contact Your Congressional Representatives Please contact your U.S. representative and senators and explain to them that there is no reason for federal agencies’ continuing to require the use of animal-test methods for skin absorption, skin irritation, skin corrosion, phototoxicity, and pyrogenicity tests. Other member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have replaced these tests with non-animal methods. Ask your representative and senators to urge the following agencies to do the same—please note that different agencies have different testing requirements, as indicated in parentheses: Environmental Protection Agency (skin corrosion, skin absorption, and skin irritation)Food and Drug Administration (skin absorption, skin irritation, phototoxicity, and pyrogenicity)Department of Transportation (skin corrosion)Occupational Safety and Health Administration (skin absorption)Consumer Product Safety Commission (skin irritation)Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (skin absorption) To learn who your U.S. representative and senators are,  urlLink click here .

When Reese Witherspoon’s character in Legally Blonde 2 takes on the cosmetics-testing industry, everyone in the audience roots for her success against the cruel animal experimenters. In real life, too, most people agree that smearing hair color into a rabbit’s eye and pumping shampoo into a guinea pig’s stomach is idiotic. The European Union recently made its distaste for the practice public policy by voting to phase out all consumer product testing on animals. In the U.S., most people believe that this is a battle we won years ago. They are wrong, and their mistaken belief that no one kills animals in order to produce a new cosmetic or toiletry item means that they have stopped using their consumer dollars to protest this most despicable animal abuse. If we are to achieve the goal of the EU (and Witherspoon’s character)—an end to the use of animals in product testing—this must change. I understand where this myth of total success came from. I led People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ campaign against product testing on animals from 1989 to 1993. They were heady years, when the giants of the cosmetics industry fell like great oaks, one by one, crashing down amid undercover investigations documenting horrendous suffering in the testing laboratories. Videotape footage of a kitten convulsing after being doused with a chemical, a rabbit whose tender skin had been eaten away by a corrosive substance, rats in death throes after huge amounts of soaps were pumped into their stomachs, a beagle cowering alone in her box-like cage. These images blackened the eye of the consumer-product industry and sparked massive change.First Benetton cosmetics, after weighing the benefits and drawbacks of its animal tests, came to PETA and announced a permanent ban on all use of animals. Then came Avon, Revlon, and Estée Lauder, in rapid-fire succession. When I began my job, PETA listed fewer than 50 companies that refused to test on animals, most of them small, mail-order manufacturers that were the ethical leaders of the industry. Within three years, that list had grown to several hundred companies. For the first time since the animal tests were developed in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, consumers could go into any department, grocery, or drugstore and buy mainstream brands from companies that did not harm and kill animals.On the scientific side, many non-animal tests were developed. Instead of measuring how long it took a chemical to burn away the cornea of a rabbit’s eye, manufacturers could now drop that chemical onto donated human corneas. Human skin cultures could be grown and ordered for irritancy testing. These and dozens more tests now in use today are cheaper, faster, and more accurate at predicting human reactions to a product than the old animal tests ever were. Despite these amazing successes, which translate into less suffering and death for animals, there are holdouts in the consumer-product industry. They are huge multiproduct manufacturers, including Unilever, Procter  Gamble, Johnson  Johnson, and others, driven by fear of lawsuits (though animal tests have not proved effective in a company’s defense when a consumer sues) and, inexplicably, inertia. Their reluctance to change in the face of consumer demand and superior non-animal test methods is difficult to understand, but one company CEO once told me that companies that continue to blind and poison animals do so simply because they have always done so and don’t have the vision to try a new and better way. “And,” he added, “they don’t want to prove PETA right.”Who would want to buy and use the products of a company whose executives are more interested in “winning” against a consumer campaign than in sparing animals miserable, caged lives and agonizing deaths? The European Union recently voted to phase out all product testing on animals, but the U.S. government is not following its example. The best way to stop companies from using animals is to refuse to purchase their products and to write and tell them why you won’t be applying their eye shadow, cleaning your clothes with their detergent, or washing your child’s hair with their shampoo. Now, as in 1989, the power is in the hands of the consumers. urlLink Click here  to learn more about product testing on animals.  urlLink Click here  to see behind the scenes of a product-testing laboratory and other laboratories that use animals. urlLink Order your free pocket-sized version  of PETA’s Cruelty-Free Shopping Guide.
