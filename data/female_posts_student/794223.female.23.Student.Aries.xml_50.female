We have some very good news about Brandi: her 2nd surgery is scheduled for Wednesday, February 4th, with Dr. Raymond Sawaya--one of the top neurosurgeon's in the country.  Her entire surgical team, in fact (anesthesiologist included) is the best of the best.  It's terrible that all this has happened to Brandi, but we can feel confident that she is in very good hands.  Her surgeon feels quite certain that he can remove a significant portion of the tumor without damaging any critical areas, which was the first surprise we heard.  The second was that he "was not unequivocally convinced" that the tumor was a grade 4 Glioblastoma; rather, he feels that it actually might be a lower grade in malignancy, and that it could have been in her head for 10 years or more.  (This would be a good scenario; the lower the malignancy, the slower a tumor grows)  The 3rd surprise was the kicker; in discussing all this with Brandi and her mother, Dr. Sawaya said something along the lines of "Now a few years down the road you'll probably have to have surgery again, because these tumors do have a tendency to re-appear."  Everyone was like, "A few years down the road?!  I thought we were talking in terms of months, not years..."  So bottom line, we're all feeling much more hopeful.  And Brandi's case simply illustrates the power of prayer!  To quote one of my aunt's friends regarding these strange turn of events: "It's not odd...it's GOD!!!"
