I am completely used to being tired...SCHOOL... and tests that I forget about don't surprise me.  But this whole unsureness about Kenneth is driving me up the wall and I was irritable today and I didn't mean to be. *If I offended anyone today, then I most certainly apologize* Thank heavens I have a friend like Steph to listen to me and completely concur with how I feel.  I love it that she understands what I'm going through and will talk about it with me, or if necessary *not nesecary* not talk at all, and just leave me to my thoughts.  Steph, Carla and Holly have been lifesavers throughout this whole thing, and I owe much of my sanity in the last week to their lovingkindness.  Thanks guys, I love you much   You know, I  always  wanted to know who I was supposed to marry.   ALWAYS . But now that I think God's telling me, the thoughts that pervade my mind are "Is this really God?", "Is this my imagination, or what I want?" OR, WORSE, "Is this Satan trying to distract me from how close God and I are becoming?" ...I'm not so sure I actually wanted to know after all.  Keep me in your prayers  Ruth
