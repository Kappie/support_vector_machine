Im not really sure why *you* want me, but I know you do...so.... you should tell me why you want me! and that might things a 'lil bit easier! anyway....I had a really good day. In first block we did absolutely nothing, 2nd block Mrs. Shelton was gone, and I got to see *you*, 3rd block I have spanish. That is the only class I got a progress report for, and I have a B in there! That sucks major ass, but Im in such a "good mood" right now, I could really care less. I got to sleep out in the sunshine with jess in 4th block today!*love ya girl*  I almost threw up and that sucks.  Im still feeling really sick, but I guess its just nerves, or *something* Lacretia brought me home and from there....well, Ill just say interesting!  I kinda watched switched.  Dont ask me what happened b/c I really dont know!  I watched MXC on Spike television! I love that show...its so freakin hillarious! Its one of the funniest shows I've ever watched.  It makes me kinda sad though cause me and josh used to watch it together, but we dont really talk on the phone that much anymore! :(      I hope things are gettin better for me.  It seems as though when I get what I've wanted for so long, it doesn't seem as important to me anymore.  Im enjoying how things are playing out though.  Shout outs for today....um...Jessi *cause you like him* Dusty *cause you're awesome and Im pumped about "yall"* Cody *cause you kick some major ass* Brandy * cause you make things understandable* love to all yall...post a comment
