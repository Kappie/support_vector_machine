Once again it took everything I had not to laugh through. the. entire. movie. Here are some highlights I missed or forgot about since the last time i saw it. 1. "I can feel his blade"- Frodo 2. "We can share the load *share the load echos over and over again for way too long*"- Sam 3. There are no straight people in that movie 4. Pippin gets raped by pretty much everyone, especially Gandalf 5. That random guys runs off a cliff while being on fire which can only lead to one reaction everyone in the theater going "WHAT?!" 6. In the beginning that hobbit thing has a fishing pole right at his crotch and it's sticking like staight up in the air and he says "I've got one!"  I'm sure they're is more but that's all i can remember now.  oh yeah then my parents looked around forever for some place to eat out while the whole time i'm like "why don't we just go home and eat" and they kept telling me "no, we want to eat out and I don't want to cook tonight." and i'm like "we can all make our own food we've done it before" we ended up not eating out, coming home, and making our own food. I chose not to say "i told you so"
