I have my own opinion thank you. Second of all, i just A LOT of though into the meaning of life and the abortion issue (or pro-death as you called it, pretty inacurately). Third of all, i don't think it's all that easy to convert adament non-christians. And many scientists and philosophers are christian. You can't just bombard an atheist with "evidence" and think they'll convert, just as an atheist can't bombard a christian with their beliefs and expect them to give up their religion. And in fact most christians have been turned off christianity because of the set-up of the religion itself.   ok. calm it down now. Sorry, got a little carried away. Point is, many things wrong with the results of that quiz.
