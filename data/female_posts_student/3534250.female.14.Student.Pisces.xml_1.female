It is categorize into 3 parts, which is rejection,discipline and loss.  -->Rejection You will feel pain when you have marital breakdown, because you will feel regret in some ways, and you need sometimes to recover from it,so you will feel pain. And u have a child, it will lead to parent and child problem,also will cause pain. it means the parent reject each other,the child will feel rejected. When the child grows up,the child will reject the parents, so there is pain. Another pain cause by rejection is general rejection for example non-communication. If there is a new person in your class, and he or she is left out as everyone in the class has their own good friends and group etc. So the person has no one to talk to and he or she will feel reject. So the person will feel pain. -->Discipline Discipline is taught at home and in the country. If a child is from a family is violent, and the child is always being cane or whatever for nothing, the child will feel there is no love in this world.So the person will feel pain. -->Loss You will feel pain in ways of separation and etc. When one of your love ones die or leave, you will feel pain because you are so close to that person that you don't want them to leave. If the person which die is not a Christian, you will feel more sad as they are not save, you cannot see them in heaven.  About Situation pain, it is categorize into 4 parts, displacement,improvishment,injury and old age.  -->Displacement If you lost something which you 'treasures' very much, you will be very sad and you will surely feel pain for cannot be able to find your things. -->Improvishment($) Improvishment means those who don't have enough or no money.And without money,they not be able to buy food etc. -->Injury You will definitely feel pain if you fall down or etc. -->Old age If you grow old, and when you are all alone, you will feel pain inside as you think no one cares for you. Or in the world, they will not care for the old people as they think old people is useless etc.  Ways to win over pain is to admit that you have pain, you can do nothing if you hide the pain. Remember the 'formula' which is "I WILL WIN OVER PAIN WITH PRAYER,PURPOSE AND PERSEVERANCE."  -->Prayer Prayer is the first thing in the formula. So next time if you are in pain, called to God. Removing the pain is God's first answer,so you will not feel pain. But if God did not answer the first time, maybe He wait you to wait, or He do not want to take away the pain first. So the second and third thing is purpose and perseverance. -->Purpose and Perseverance Purpose and Perseverance is the second answer from God. As it is written in II Corinthians 12:9,"My grace is sufficent for thee". Therefore, we must remember that what God has given us is enough. We also must sometimes let go the things which we think is the 'best' as God will give us something better than what we think is 'best' if we let go. So don't get angry with God if you experience pain and don give up hope, every pain has it own purpose. God's answer maybe ask you to wait, or he take it away or let it be there for a while.  So now or next time you is having pain, examine the pain and pray(prayer), discover the purpose of the pain(purpose)and keep on praying until the pain is gone.(perseverance)
