Those are the 3 things that if we got rid of, the world would be a better place. Anyways I got to call Tregory at like 12 or something, I don't know why. Anyways I found this nice little poem site. www.creative-poems.com Kristian told me about it. I'm glad she is finally online, now I can talk to her. She is one of my many best friends. Anyways maybe if I mow the grass, and stuff, maybe my brother just might take me shopping. I want school clothes. NOW. Poopay. 3Cherry
