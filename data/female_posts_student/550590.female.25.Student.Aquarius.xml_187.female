On our last day, I made the mistake of attempting to visit the internet cafe by myself. I walked around red square because it was blocked off...and I walked right into a huge communist protest outside the Kremlin. After all that, the internet cafe wasn't even open. Luckily I ran into some other students who were out and about so I didn't have to walk BACK through the protest by myself. Of course, they had to stop and take pictures in the middle of the rally. Meanwhile I'm thinking "don't make eye contact, don't speak English, just keep walking!"  The train was a nightmare. I was rooming in a cabin about 5 feet by 6 feet and there were 4 of us...the other three girls included the one who ditched me to room at the hotel in Moscow and they are...Let's say high maintenance. That is, they brought 2 rolling bag carry ons and 2 suitcases larger than mine each. Keep in mind we had to keep our luggage in our cabins on the train. It was an experience.  Also on the train while I was napping everyone got very drunk and were throwing up in the spaces between the train cars. I was so sorry that I missed that experience. Last night at dinner Dr. Maiden got so drunk he threw up at the table and had to be carried to the car. I'm so glad I discovered that my camera allows me to take video (thanks Mom and Dad!!) Then we had our own little adventure getting back to the hotel because the bus left us there and we had no idea where we were going.   Volgograd is much better than Moscow. The people are so nice here and they try to speak English and give directions. They don't seem to hate Americans at all whereas the people in Moscow just glared and pretended not to speak English.  Tomorrow they are having a huge welcoming ceremony with the media and everything, so I'll have to figure out newspaper and TV websites and let you all know.   Write when you have time, I will try to post as often as my schedule permits.  Dosvidaniya!  Danielle
