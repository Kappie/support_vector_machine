He gave an entire sermon on how if you don't believe in EVERYTHING the catholic church teaches you will go to hell.  I shit you not, he said that.  He went on to give examples such as abortion, I think another might have been same sex marriages, one was the use of birth control ex: the pill, condoms, and another was living with someone before marriage and having sex out of wedlock.  I will tell you now I am pro choice, have nothing against same-sex marriages because it has nothing to do with me, am all for the use of birth control, think that it is necessary to live with someone before you marry them so you know what they are really like, and the whole sex before marriage thing is for some people but others find it more special to wait.  So ladies and gents, it looks like I'll be seein' ya in hell!  The catholic church is so conservative, geesh it's the 21st century, join us!  My mommy has been annoying me lately!  She says I don't do enough around the house, which is bullshit.  I do everything she asks me to do.  GRR...Sometimes, I tell you, she just...pisses me off.    45 more minutes and I'm 17.  Only one more year until I'm legal.  I find it sad that I'll have graduated high school before I'll be able to stay out past 11...Legally.    enough whining, It's raining outside and it's the best to fall asleep to so goodnight, Kay
