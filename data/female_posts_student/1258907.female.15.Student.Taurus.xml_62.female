Why is it me that you cant seem to hear?  All I need is for you to reach out Show a  sense that our friendship is alive Do memories mean nothing? I just hope our friendship will survive  Im sick of reaching to the past I dont want to be on my own I thought you were worth the effort I suppose I'll just stay alone.
