I've just been so busy with my socials project and homework and studying for a science exam.  *Sighs* I'm glad that stuff is now behind me.  During the past week and a half, I've been so busy with school that I've been going to bed at 11:30 (I usually go to sleep at 10).  Anyways, now that I am free, I am going to write in my blog and relax.  Next weekend Jasmine is having a birthday party.  She said that I could invite a friend over to help host it. I invited Michele but she told me shes hanging out with another friend that weekend and has a soccer game/practice going on.  I wouldn't blame her for not wanting to come because I've been boring lately (Yes I admit that doing homework is quite dull).  *Sighs*  Robin wrote in her blog that she is going snowboarding on that day.  I don't know if kevan will still be grounded that weekend or not.  I don't know what I have planned for that day.    On Monday, my uncle Ron had a massive heart attack.  It was apparently very bad and he was taken to the hospital and is now in critical condtion.  I'm not sure if he'll make it but I really hope he does.  I don't really feel like going too deep into this subject because it is very odd speaking about life and death situations.
