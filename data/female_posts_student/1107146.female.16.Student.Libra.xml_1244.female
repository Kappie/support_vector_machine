I don't think that there is anything wrong with you, but I've only been on the blog for like...not very long.  I'm just going to stay out of this problem, but I would choose choice number three.  It sounds like it would be the most helpful.  It will be hard, but I think that its the best.  If you need a house thats neutral territory, mine is always open.  Anyway, got Church tonight, so fun stuff right there.  Another lecture on what I'm doing wrong.
