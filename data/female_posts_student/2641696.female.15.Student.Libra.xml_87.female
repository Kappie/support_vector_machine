I think it's because I'm running out of interesting titles. So I'm improvising. But whatever.   Today was alright. Except various well-loved people missed the rehearsals this morning, much to my chagrin (OMG people can't just  skip  that!!), but other than that, it was good. However, the well-loved people were there for the rest of the day, so the various classes I had with those well-loved people after the rehearsals were quite amusing and interesting.   Comp sci is just infuriating though!! Apparently, though only Component 3 is due, we're supposed to have like half the coding finished -- and I'm not even close to that. WTF?? Grr. He is making up the rules, man. Totally going against proper teaching etiquette. Doesn't that bug you when teachers start going against what they originally said and all that jazz? I mean, now I feel terribly not up to scratch and inadequate and all those other unsatisfactory words.   Let's just call this the big vocab day, k?   Hey look, I'm a poet and I didn't even... *gags self* lol.   Music was hilariously fun. We did nothing, yet again. Music is my favourite class   of all time   lol. If the exams turn out to be easy, I might even switch from economics to music for next year. Just cuz I'll miss the whole damn class so much. Who's taking music again next year, BTW? If A isn't I don't know if I'll bother... she's my music buddy ^^;   So anyways, a few well-loved people played the piano, which was fun. Didn't know they could, actually, so it was a pretty cool surprise ^^; Then we just hung out for a while. And when A left (her grandfather was glaring at her... spooky...), I hung out with the jazz band. Since they were packing up to go to a Ronald McDonald's thing. I don't know either; don't ask. That was pretty fun. Saxophone is still great *g* And so is C. And all those other fantabulous and well-loved jazz people. *g*   Then afterwards, A and I did our scheduled math tutoring thing, seeing as I have a math test (DAMN YOU MR. M!!) tomorrow, and I got 69% on the in-class assignment... we did actual work for maybe 15, 20 minutes. Then T showed up, all the way from the middle school, and we just talked about guys and unpronouncable last names (mahabsldfjakjs!! ^^;) and how T is a stalker and Avril Lavigne sucks. Then T left, at like quarter to 4, and A and I just doodled in her agenda... All in all, quite a productive hour ^^;   Anyways. I'm just mad I didn't talk to him more. Suuch a coward!! But that's ok.   Oh! And one last thing -- C prank called Jerry... whoa. Funny shiz goin' on there, folks. Hey you know those rap/hip-hop/whatever they call it these songs? Where they pronounce it "thurr" and "hurrr". Here is what I have to say about them:       LOSERS!!
