Why is he killing them all anyway? Just to dance? How strange.  Anyway, I watched Ryan last night! Yaaaaay!  Debut on UK TV!!!!! Waaaaaaaahhhhhhoooooooo!!!!!! He died.                                                     That was relaly scary actually because you could hear him screaming and I was like nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Mind you I actually screamed at one point because the alien dude scared the bejeebus outta me. I'm so silly, I spend the whole program hiding behind my hands. LOL. Now I am off to town soon to go shopping, with Angela and Jo C. Hoepfully. If they turn up. I hope. But first I must go post on el forum. Chal.
