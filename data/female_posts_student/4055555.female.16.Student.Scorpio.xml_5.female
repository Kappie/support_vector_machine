Anyways a few junctions later and we were still stuck behind him, we'd been behind the fella for a good 5 minutes, it appears during all this time he had never bothered to use any of his mirrors, because suddenly at one junction he decided he had taken a wrong turn, no problem he thought, the nearest car is oh i dunno 3metres away, so he jsut slipped it into reverse, reversed backwards from the junction and then shuffled forward so he was on the correct side of the junction to turn.        At this point I had to slam on and was close enough (i.e. a good 15cm) to figure out it was an old man [Shock!]. Kudos to him to realising that he had to change his position in the road so following cars will know what direction he is turning, cos after all he didnt use indicators, my only problem is if he would have actually looked, a mere glance for less than a second he woiuld have seen a learner driver coming up behind him at 60mph. So really Boy Racers? What ever, I'd rather have a nova boy revving his engine thinking hes cool however driving carefully because He and everyone else knows that if he crashes his insurance premiums will go sky high and he wont be driving again till he's 24.        The Real boy racers are the gits who are fifty years old theyve been driving longer than ive been alive so they obviously own the road, and no matter how expensive their BMW is even if they crash they can afford it! Despite the fact that they havent seena c opy of the highway code in 35 years!
