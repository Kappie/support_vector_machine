But I was interesting to watch them on the floor, debating and voting and stuff... It was so much cooler than watching the Senate or House feeds on CSPAN... (Yep, I actually do that...)  The first time that I got sodas for a guy, a regular coke,(and the guy sitting beside of him, a diet coke)... When I brought them back, the man beside him, who was a average-looking healthy guy, asked me  if he needed to drink diet soda. Of course I said no, because, well, he honestly didn't and it would be unkind to tell someone that they need to... (unless it was a 300+ pound cow shoving his/her face with a cake... then it should be a civil duty..) He chuckled. And the other guy, who was a, um, bigger (not disgustingly obese though) and older--definitely out of shape-- asked me if he need to drink soda. I replied, "No! Of course not!" and gave him a huge semi-sarcastic smile. He just started laughing, the guy beside him was laughing also and he shouted, "She lies! She lies!"  At that point I just lost it and started cracking up...  Haha, It was pretty funny!  ...Sorry that I suck I telling stories...
