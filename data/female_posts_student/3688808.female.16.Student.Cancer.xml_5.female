I sit and force myself to smile somehow, Trying harder to push the pain away, Braving the torture like the girl I was, Living to fight another 'perfect' day.     They see the girl I'm trying to be, All they see are the lies, They don't see the girl who bleeds Or the girl that cries inside.    So tell me what can I do to make you see, That what you're seeing ain't really me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.    What can I do to make you believe, That you never knew the real me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.    These cigarettes burn down so fast, Alcohol doesn't soothe the pain, I've been down every road, Tried it all And now I'm back to square one again.    I've searched so long for a perfect high, Something to try and wash away the shame, No matter what I do to change my life, Everything always seems to stay the same.    They see the girl I'm trying to be, All they see are the lies, They don't see the girl who bleeds Or the girl that cries inside.    So tell me what can I do to make you see, That what you're seeing ain't really me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.    What can I do to make you believe, That you never knew the real me, What can I do to make you realize, There's torture behind these pretty blue eyes.
