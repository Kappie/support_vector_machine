He thought I was in college.  His two favorite movies of the year were Eternal Sunshine and Lost in Translation.  He is working on his Ph. D. in psych.  He said I looked like Scarlett Johansson.  He got accepted at NYU.  He is a socialist.  He has lived in Rome, been to Sweden, and perhaps would like to live in Stockholm.  He is smart.  He wears black.  He has a crooked nose.  He asked my dad if I could go to the bar with them.  He has a cool girlfriend...
