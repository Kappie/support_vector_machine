Tia is coming over for a night on Saturday, and Yaya and Yayo and abuela are coming too. oh and Amir, the cutest one! luis hates Amir, i think its b/c he follows him around everywhere. but AS hates luis coz he follows him everywhere.  its a young role model type o' thing.  i made a smoothie too! it was so good, i cant really remember the ingredients though, i just sorta tossed stuff in as i went along.   TS went to a concert w/ her friends. and i've got to clean my room. i think im going to do a ritual on the full moon - it just seems like a special occasion.   note - ask MR if she'll mind if i turn in my packet late -make another date for lotus moon. -tell MR about help wanted job  love gina
