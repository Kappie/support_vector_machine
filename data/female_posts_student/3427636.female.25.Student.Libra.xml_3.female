     
      After much pointless searching and avoidance of the problem, I have finally selected a new alias. Thankyou to  urlLink Seventh Sanctum  for suggesting it. It was a 'random' name and I've done a little searching to make sure nothing untoward is associated with it. It's a real name apparently, but the results were mostly in polish and one was a footballer.  All I have to do now is find a suitable last name...
