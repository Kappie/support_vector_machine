On the one hand, I have Brazil: applying for the Fulbright, and possibly researching in SÃ£o Paulo the effects of new technology on education.  On the other I have Cuba.  Where do we start with Cuba?  Where I spent an entire semester and have invested a year of my work and scholarly research.  Where I left my heart.  I'm trying, though somewhat unsuccessfully at the moment, to do a comparison study between the two countries and how they differ in their educational systems.  Basically, if I could create utopia, I would transplant Cuba's mass-education to Brazil, and keep it that way in Cuba.  You know what scares me more than not getting the Fulbright for Brazil?  Actually getting it.  Where would that take me in life?  I can't just drop Cuba if I get the Fulbright for Brazil.  Why can't I just jump between the two countries?  Why would I have to specialize in just one?  Furthermore, at some point I'm going to have to choose an academic area to specialize in.  I want to eventually get my doctorate in international relations, but as Joe put it, I'll have to sell myself to a discipline.  I can't get a job in Latin American Studies; I have to specialize.  Whether it's economics, education, anthropology, or communications, I'm going to have to make a choice.  I hate that.  I want to study everything.  There are moments when my nostalgia undulates, waxes and wanes between Brazil and Cuba.  From Havana to Bahia, and back.  I feel deep down as if my ultimate purpose is to deal with Cuba, and yet there's this other part of me saying, "Wait. Give Brazil a chance."  Both countries have astounding things to offer, in different ways.  Fulbright does offer you the option of doing dual-country studies.  But due to the embargo over Cuba and current travel restrictions, I can't do that, at least not under Fulbright money.  That's very frustrating.  I've pretty much decided that if I get the Fulbright, I'm going back to Cuba anyway before heading down to Brazil.  I have no idea how, or when.  I won't be a student, technically, so it'll be next to impossible to get my hands on a legal license to travel there.  But I don't care.  I have too much that needs to be finished there to not return.   In sum, I have no idea what's going on.  I think I'm interested in far too many things at once.  It's almost 5am--better get some shut-eye.  Just got back from a party at Sarah and Jenny's house.  It was so good seeing them again--my dear, fellow Latin America enthusiests.  There's always the best music at their parties.
