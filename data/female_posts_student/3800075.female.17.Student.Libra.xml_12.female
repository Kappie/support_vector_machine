I'm addicted to South Park."  then the guy in the back will be like "Thats nothing, I suck cock for crack"  lol.  I think Michelle and perhaps Jessie (?) and I were discussing this the other day.  But i seriously have a problem.  We'll be sitting there calmly talking and I'll start talking like Cartman... or some other character on the show (not that you can tell, because my impressions are mediocre at best) but weird shit that is,or should be on south park comes out of my mouth.  Aww so is life.  It always seems like at least sometime in the year, once or nine time, Leslie or I goes into south park mode... ha i remember she watched the move everyday like 8 times... i bet she could recite it even now.  Some peoples kids... i tell ya.  Ive been on a serious nintendo junk for a few weeks now... grr.... the bad part... i dont have a nintendo.  i got this chair though and it sits there and i think god damn i need a remote to play with.  the remote to the fun just aint cuttin it anymore.  Maybe ill get my Super out- its been awhile.  I only have like 3-4 games though and i either cant get passed one spot and spend hours, days, nay weeks trying to beat it or i play the other ones i know by heart.  its a crazy world we live in.  I say it to you now.  ANYONE BUT BUSH 2004!!! Please folks... if youre reading and you intend to vote, remember these words.  The man is an idiot.  It boggles my mind that legal US citizens who lived most of their lives here that just happened to be born in another country cant be president (huh hmm.. michelle) but we can have a rich- dumbass oil man  who cant speak the language as the leader of our country... you cant speak the language- get the fuck out of the oval office.  crickey! Well enough from me.  I bid you adu or whatknot.  Until Time Next
