She doesn't go to my school but me and my friends were introduced to her (and a few other people that will be mentioned later) via Fran, who went to the same middle school as her. It has to be the best party I have been to, all because of the complete randomness of the whole night.  Guest List:- Me Tasha Laura Megan Beth Lizzie Fran Tom Adam Fisher Nick Alex Jonny Dave Heather Jess Ben (ChaChi) Danny (Fifi) Denise Maria Chloe Laura Lucy Heidi Chris Susan Alice Debbie Hannah  The party started with just Me, Kat, Nick, Tom and with his prediction for the night "Homosexuality - Because that's what tonight's all about!", Fisher. He couldn't have been any closer because there was indeed a number of homosexual activities throughout the night, Extreme Trampoline Humping, Gay Porn, Trouserless Country Walks and a surprise 'Gang Bang' in the conservatory. I chose not to get too drunk because I took my video camera along to film the entire evening and I didn't exactly want it getting damaged but I also love staying sober to re-enact the events to those without any recall of the previous night. (It's also rather fun to get information out of people). One of the main features was drunken trampolining and I injured myself doing so. I decided to do a somersault resulting in me going to far and not actually landing on the trampoline. At the time it didn't hurt, possibly because I was numb, but because of the un-natural position I landed in, my right hand felt somewhat dead the morning after.  Sublime was declared the official music for the night by myself, Tom and Fisher. Well, it wasn't really neogociable considering we hijacked the sound system. I have some great footage of various people jigging to 'Ebin' but all you can see are random body parts under the 'epileptic fit light'.  Later on, Fisher and Tom also took over the computer and decided to download some very interesting pictures. Bestiality, Hermaphrodites, Naked Fat Woman, you name it, it was there...and it's still there, in my mind.  All of the guys decided to go for an evening stroll at some point, trouserless. They were met by an oncoming cyclist so had to jump in a ditch, chuck the vodka and hide...merely to avoid confusion but Jonny was to slow, met the cyclist, offered him a pringle and carried on walking. We all shared a very magical moment when we decided to crash on the trampoline for an hour or so. We were in the middle of a meaningful conversation when a shooting star appeared overhead! It truly was a magical moment and although it sounds cheesy, a rather special one at that.  Myself and Fran also found our hidden talent, MCing. We spent the whole night rapping to the likes of the Misteeq Ladehs, Big Brovas and Black Eyed Peas and we have decided to do a compilation with Slo Mo, the rappin' retard. Entah! Fisher and Tom, who seemed to be the life an soul of the party, decided to fall asleep hand in hand but they should have been a tad more cautious about sleeping, what with the rest of us wide awake. Out comes a pot of nail varnish and all of a sudden, the guys nails are 'Flushing Fushia'. We then decorated them with pretty much everything we can find, with the main object being birthday cake. That's when Fisher started to sleeptalk, saying something along the lines of "You sick mother fuckers!". I don't know what he was dreaming about but he obviously could not remember the things he was looking at on the web earlier that evening. All in all, it was a fantastic night! I've only mentioned a really small proportion of the occurrences and these were only the high points! The same with every party, there was a lot of drama way too complicated to start writing about but the main thing is, I have everything on film. I can use it as evidence or to remember the great time we had but that my friends, is for me to decide...
