I should be chechin the HTML tag first before hittin post n publish.     Visitors signin in wait for my approval before the guestbook publishes it. Thanks for signing, i'll be postin it after I blog. Can u pls explain more about the golden sushi thing. Is that a free space for a site? or just an add-on to my site like the guestbook? My problem is, I don't have a landline so I can't access the net at home. I do it here in school but in a network so the ftp program won't work. Only the MIS people know the IP address. Is there any other way I can upload it? via site for example?
