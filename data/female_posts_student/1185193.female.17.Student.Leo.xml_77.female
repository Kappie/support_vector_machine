I have improved so much with all that crap I had to deal with (aka the Big D).  Professionally, I've been told it's over.  And after reading that first entry, I believe it. I wouldn't classify myself as happy, but I'm dealing.  I'm doing that thing called life.  I have been having horrible anxiety attacks over work.  Every night before, I get so anxious and panicy about going to work in the morning.  I am afraid I'll do something wrong (there's the perfectionist inside of me).  Moreover, having a job is a sign that I'm growing up.  Which scares me within itself.  Admit it, we all sometimes long for the innocent days of childhood where summer consisted of all-day pajama days and cartoons.  But I think I long for it too much, and that worries me.  I mean, I can't wait to be an "adult", raise a family, and be a teacher.  I guess you never feel ready.  Ready for the big world with too many responsibilities and no one to stay home with you when you're sick (aka Mom).  But I can't stop the process, so I might as well embrace it.
