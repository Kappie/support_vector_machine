I couldn't give it to her because I don't have it on my computer (I delete stuff after I load it on msn because it takes up place on the comp).  Michele got mad and than blocked me.  This "fight" we had is very childish, It's a freaking picture!  I just typed in "The Oc" in google and found it in less than 2 minutes.  Just because I didn't give it to her, she said "Your a great friend".   I want to know, who is being the friend here? Is this argument stupid? Who is right?  Leave your thoughts in the comment box.
