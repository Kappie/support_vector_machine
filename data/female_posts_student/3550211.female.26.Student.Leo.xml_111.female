Finally, something positive coming out of the Senate.  urlLink Senate Vote Blocks Effort to Ban Gay-Marriage in Constitution    Backers of a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriages suffered a stinging defeat in the Senate today as opponents easily killed the initiative for the year in a procedural showdown.  Senators voted 50 to 48 against a call to cut off debate, 12 votes short of the 60 required and even below a simple majority of 51. It would have taken 67 votes to approve the amendment itself.   Money quotes:   "This is an unnecessary amendment that wrongly and certainly prematurely deprives states of their traditional ability to define marriage," said Senator Joseph Lieberman.  "No matter what one's position is on the socially divisive questions of same-sex marriage, civil unions and other nontraditional arrangements, the Constitution is not the place to engrave social policy - as we should have learned eight decades ago with Prohibition. Some true constitutionalists of both parties, to their credit, realize that." -  urlLink The Plain Dealer    "This is a symbolic but important blow to the agenda of the far right. They have divided their party, and tarnished their reputation for fairness - but the Constitution remains intact and unviolated. That's one reason to cheer." - Andrew Sullivan
