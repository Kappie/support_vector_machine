DREAD!! oh yeah, just remembered that practically all answers are in back of book. might only take me 1.5 hours as only half of the answers are in the back of the book.:( mucho sadness but still hope i guess. well, really must pull myself away from the computer now. i must not forget my lovely blog and my fans(ha!). promise will write again soon. -stace.
