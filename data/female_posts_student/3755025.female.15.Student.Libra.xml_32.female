(i am never bored at ur house bud! lol)...i got some news...that i wasnt so thrilled to get, but there's nothing i can do about it. my friend -nameless- apparently ditched me to go to someone's house (who they dont like) to see their significant other. and it is a big deal to me at least.. because they dropped out of plans that we had for a long long time...and now it is too late to fix it--at least they could give me some notice!--but this person made a 'deal' with their parental...that if they went to 'so-and-so's house..that they would give up the plans they made with me...and i didnt know this.         ..................UNFAIR!                i know for a fact that if i did that to them...i would be bitched at and a fight would emerge and i wouldnt hear the end of it....but since i just dont care anymore...im just not going to say anything...because in the last few days, even though it hasnt REALLY seemed it--i have other friends that like me for who i am...and dont get mad at me when i dont act how they want me to act. and i realized this and i am thankful. so to those who know who i am talking about...those friends who wont leave my side......thank you and i love you.
