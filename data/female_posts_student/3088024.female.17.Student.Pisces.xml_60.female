You have never made one right decision since I met you.  Yet I stand at the end of the road.  Waiting.  Standing.  Dying.  Wishing you would let me help you.  For the foolishness of my heart turn around.  I love you.  Please don't do this anymore.  I wish I could do something-anything-to turn you around.  I pray to God.  I cry while you ruin your life and the Plan that should have been.  Vulnerant omnia, ultima necat.
