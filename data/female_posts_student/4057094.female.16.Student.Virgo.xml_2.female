I have no idea why. He just did. He seems to always be doing that kind of stuff. Sometimes I wonder if he likes me...but then again I think he doesn't because he has a girlfriend. I would ask him but I don't want to look like an idiot when he tells me he doesn't. Plus I don't want to feel this awkwardness between us when we talk. So I just don't know what to do. The reason I think those things because he calls me very late at night and really early in the morning...and I'm the only one he does that too. Plus he told me awhile back that he liked me...nothing escalated from that. And then he told me that I was pretty on the phone this morning...I just keep thinking that maybe he's delusional or verrry tired when he's saying these things. Oh well....anyways, after that I listened to music and then sat there doing nothing. So I went back to sleep and then I woke up around 12. I watched the news...and watched a movie...then I got ready...and then I went and watched some more t.v. Then I made dinner and went to my room and texted my friend. All of a sudden I got the urge to check my email...so I did and to my surprise I got an email from someone! Woohoo! Just kidding. Well anyways...after that...I decided to do this. So here I am. Well I guess I better get going...talk to you all later!
