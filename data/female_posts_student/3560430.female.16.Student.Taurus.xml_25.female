Oh god that was the 9th and this is the 12th. Disgraceful.   Well let's think about what's happened since then...   June 10   Oh that was a horrid day! My mandarin teacher forced me to go to bethie's house again. Now we wonder how my mandarin teacher could have possibly forced me into going to Bethie's house. Well it's simple and confusing all at once, let's begin (best pay attention).   I missed a dictiation test the other day due to the fact that the day before that class I had been performing in a play run by my school called the Chrysalids. Good Play, and Book. Well I had asked we had home work due next day or a test, I was told no. So I went to class completely unprepared thus I would do a makeup test next day. First thing that day I went to class and said "Ms Z. I missed a test may I make it up right after school today?" She said "Yes" so class ended and I went up to her desk but two other people were there with head sets. I said "May  I do the test now?" she said "No these people asked me first so I will deal with them first" UN TRUE! I asked her in turn if I could use her phone to call my father and tell him that I would be late (The test takes about 5 minutes not even). And she said no! No because she generally didn't let students use the phone, also untrue I've used her phone before, with permission. Huuug. My dad doesn't like when I'm late because that means he can't get as much work as he would like done, done.   Understandable. Well I'm sitting there like shaking because I don't want my dad to be pissed off. Beth being the friend she is sticks with me the whole time, I told her to just go home. Well I finally get to the test and all that after waiting for about twenty minutes, and Beth is waiting outside for me! I asked her why she was there and she said that when she went down dad had been waiting in the parking lot and starting to move stuff over so that the two of us could jump in when he looked up and there was only her. Very confused he asked were I was and she said that I was still up in the mandarin room where my teacher hadn't allowed me to use the phone. It doesn't cost anything for the teacher to let me use the phone, it's the school's bloody phone! Well he got pretty ticked off and Beth offered to take me to her house where I could call him once I was done. he said ya and I ended up at bethie's house, playing hours o tetris and spending way too much time trying to determine what to eat. I didn't get home till about ten. And dad is still threatening to call and complain to my mandarin teacher because he didn't know where his daughter was.     June 11th   This was an intriguing day. Nothing really big happened for the first while. I talked to Mr Arthur about a work safety seminar that everybody going doing work experience this summer was supposed to go to during block C or D. Turns out I just didn't get the letter what do you know? Well I went to the block C seminar where we watched a movie with really bad music that tried to creep me out. It didn't need creepy music there was people enough getting limbs amputated and paralyzed. There was this one guy who now needs to use a bowel stimulater to go to the washroom. It was pathetic and freaky. Well I left that freak fest and went to the library. From there I started going to Socials class when one of my friends cornered me "Susan is there any way after school that I could talk to you, it's about [friend's name]." Well I didn't really think about it then, I just knew it was really important to her to talk to me. By that time I was ready to buckle down and do my other homework in socials where we would be watching Lord of the Rings. Not as interested in watching Lord of the Rings as I would normally be due to the fact that I was having a Lord of the Rings party that night I asked to go to the library where I could focus on other homework. Mr B is one of my favorite teachers so of course he totally agreed offering the option to go to the library to other students as well. So about seven of us went to the library and worked quietly, where Actress was working at the computer, I would have asked her about how things were going but she's beginning to frustrate me and she looked busy so I didn't bother. Well it got to the point where the lack of posting was getting to me so I started a blog, and finished it inbetween laughing my ass off at Shorty and Actresses wise cracks about their futures and how shorty wants to get on second city and from there on SNL. But by the time I was ready to officially post my school bell rang and I had to leave. GRRR I think I mentioned this last post. Well I really had to get to friend so I abandoned the post and hoped for the best. Once I found friend we talked. It seems other friend has been trying to kill himself lately. Lovely hu? And he's been getting closer and closer to succeeding. Friend's friends phoned her and said that other friend phoned her to talk about it. I know that this drama seems too much and that Other Friend probably won't but I'm worried and think I'll probably take him aside on Monday. It seems people come to me about this sort of stuff a lot, so I have lots of experience in this sort of thing. Needless to say I was rather occupied throughout the movies, as was Beth due to the fact that she knows Other Friend as well. It was hard to deal with but I've been surviving on chocolate and other such things since (there goes Atkins until Monday).    Today       Today's been pretty standard did some editing, and some English. I'd best continue editing and englishing. I may post later to give myself some thinking relief.
