Yesterday in the media center was enough to want make me want to hurl. First off, the downloading of the video of the U.S. soldier being decapitated... that's too much right there. Okay, what kind of sick fuck do you need to be to search the net for that footage? Then watch it not once, but twice. If that was, say, your brother would you want that video put out on the net? Would you want the world looking in disgust at one of your closest friends or family members being publicly humiliated in a foreign country? I think not. So why did you do it? Curiosity killed the god damn cat... do you have a death wish? Because I can grant you clearance to an afterlife if that's what you please. Or perhaps you'd like your head chopped off in front of a camera only to have the footage posted in the internet. Secondly, poking fun at the rape situation at the school in the media center was not even cool. Not in the slightest. Please, for the sake of those around you, put your morals higher and grow up a bit... at least to the point where everything isn't a fucking joke. No one is laughing anymore.  Yeah, that sounded bitchy but that needs to be out there. And she wonders why the hell I don't want to talk with her. Just because we both apologized for the falling out doesn't mean I want you to run up and converse with me every time you see me. I don't want to talk to you. So leave me the hell alone. Please. I have enough shit to deal with... I don't need any of this.
