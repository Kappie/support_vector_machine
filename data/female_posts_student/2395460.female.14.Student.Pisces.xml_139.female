Call me high maintenance, but when  urlLink Archos  first debuted the Pocket Video Recorder, my prayers were answered. My life with  urlLink Archos  began with the purchase of a AV340 recorder. Despite it's bulkiness and lack of refinement, I was in a new world. Not only was I able to store vast volumes of music MP3s to take with me, I could also bring along my favorite TV shows and movies! When I was bored with listening to  urlLink Annie Lennox , I could switch to a rerun of  urlLink Friends ! Soon to follow were lesser quality or lesser featured players, like the  urlLink RCA Lyra .  Now comes the next generation recorder from  urlLink Archos , the AV400 series. The improvements over the AV300 series are like a wish list come true: smaller form factor, removable battery, drop-in connection through a cradle, scheduling, availability in larger capacity models, external speaker, and (on certain models) a larger screen. So, if you're not already on the bandwagon and you, too, are the fidgety-when-flying type, take a closer look. This may just be your saving grace!
