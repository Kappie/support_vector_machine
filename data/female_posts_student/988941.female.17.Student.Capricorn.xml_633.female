Study in quiet rooms, get latestest sport results while cooking and many other things - but does my mother do something that sensbile? No, of course not. "Wireless internet? Does that mean I can play computer games in bed?" Mothers hey? Tut tut. Blog more later, she's just got onto Level 2 of Lego "Stack It"...
