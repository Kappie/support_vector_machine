I think the reason google has become so popular is all because of me.)  *You see, there are cameras that follow me around, and the jokes on the other end copy everything i do...I swear!*  It's a drizzly fourth of july.  My mom is running around in a silk cheetah print nightgown and oversized slippers dodging the rain to grab her ashtray.  Another morning cig for her.  As I was reaching for some water to down my overrated antidepressants this morning, my cat starred at me dead in the eyes.  I think she knows I plan to betray her.  I just really want another kitty.   So far this morning, I've: laid in bed, dialed random numbers on my cellphone, tried in vain to get my boyfriend to wake up and talk to me, and squeezed my fat.  Ah, another day begins.  For some reason, I think that my midget-like grandmother (whom I love, but she does look like a midget) is having some fourth of july party.  Which is great.  She always has good food.  And the newspaper.  (So I can find myself another job, while I pack on those pounds)  You know, my mom kinda of looks like a very large midget.  I guess that's not really good news for me.  We look a lot alike.  Hhhhmmm.  Only she's a little more crazy than I am.  Right now it's in the wee-hours of the morning (like 10-ish) and she's been up cleaning, cleaning, CLEANING since god knows when.  Besides the nicotine, she's definitely addicted to laundry, ironing, vacuuming, dusting, MAKING BEDS!!, and everything that goes along with it.  *sigh*  She's nuts.  I just read the last few sentences to my mom.  She thought it was great, except for the "she's nuts" part...which she got all offended by.  You would think after how many years, she would get my playful, cynical humor.  I just don't think her mind can comprehend that type of stuff though.  She's too into the ~**(daisies and kind words and sunshine)**~ aww!   My little brother just walked downstairs.  Now we're having a lovely, family conversation.  Minus my dad, who's hard at work with the crazy people (seriously, he works at a mental hospital).  I went there once because there's this big controversy going on with the building.  I wrote about what I saw/experienced.  It was great: it was all the truth, nothing sugarcoated.  I should have sent it into the papers.  But then my dad probably would have gotten fired.  His early county retirement and pension whizzing out the window.   Well, I think i'm going to enjoy this gray fourth of july now.  Maybe grab myself a cigarette as well.  Ahhhh. matsen
