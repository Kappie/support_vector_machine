If hes there in the hospital its not really my fault....yes i should be feeling bad or sad or whatever way you want to put itbut i just dont i dont feel like hating him but then i cant help it and i know its a sin to hate him...  Hes my father and tahts why i have no right to hate him...hes earned everything i have today. Then why?is it beacause whne he goes from this realm to another ill have 4 half-siblings after our blood?or is it beacuase of his ego which didnt let him make the right choices and put us all in this situation...it makes me sigh it make me cry its all hopeless theres nothing to be done ...u cant change luck can u?i just wish i was in a different place at a different time and most of all i wasnt a stupid 13 year old who cant change her life just wish that things would change for the better and that i would stop crying.  I cudve called thsi blog sanaas wishes instead of naked intensity..
