Well, not really, but I spend the majority of my free time playing it with Beex and the boys at Hillcrest Suites.  I have 2 guys(both are pink).  I'm starting to get better and jus trying to stay low on the radar and hopefully I'll be able to just hide out and snipe people.  There is nothing more satisfying that a single headshot to take a bitch out.    This weekend I traded in my game cube and Andrew and I both traded in some games and we had enough credit to get a second XBox for the house.  This one's name is Stumpy, but I call it Stimpy in honor of the fabulous Stimpson J. Cat.  We linked Stumpy and the Caboose and now we can have 8 people playing at one time.  It rocks.  I hope One Brown Eyed Hank comes home sometime soon so we'll be able to get 3 vs. 3 going and some capture the flag or something cool like that.  When I stand in the shower at Andrew's house the pipes make this weird sound like when you're by one of the portals.  Sometimes his washing machine sounds like that too.    I haven't played in about 10 hours.  I'm starting to get the shakes.  I don't know if I can make it.  In other exciting video game news I went to this store (where we got the XBox from) and I bought 2 games for the original Nintendo: Ducktales (stop laughing, thats my fave Nintendo game ever!) and Battle Toads. Ducktales was $9.99 but the games were buy 1 get 1 free so I got them both for $10. Not too shabby.  Thats all for now.  I'll be back laters.
