Are people really that bored with life that they need to be screwing stuff up for me?  Can anyone just learn to GET OVER IT!  Furthermore, can people get over themselves and leave me alone?  Am I not 22 and capable of living my own freaking life?  Aren't you in love with someone and having this big "emotional connection" with them, so big in fact, that you're MOVING TO BE NEAR THEM?!?!  Of course you are, so why do you care what goes on in my life?!?!
