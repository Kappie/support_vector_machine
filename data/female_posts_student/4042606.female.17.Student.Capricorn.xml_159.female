It is funny, because she hates wearing dresses so much, because she can't hide her "endowments". I know for a fact that this is going to be the most uncomfortable night for her in her entire life. I also wish that Ian and I were there to see this monumental event.  Ian and I have been ridiculing Abby for two days now, and we won't stop until the night is over.
