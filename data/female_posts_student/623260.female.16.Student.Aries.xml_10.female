       
      I don’t want to hear about yesterdays The good old days when We could be together When things remained naught but Me and you Simplicity You talk like We could go back like Things could be erased And we could put up a crystal Stopper and pretend that Nothing happened and you can Be my prince again and I can be A beautiful princess trapped  In this crystal room Things sparkle and reflect but Behind the mirrors there will always Would always Be the pain of the present And the less distant past and Eventually we would realize how Sick it is and shatter the walls And in would float spirits Of agony and realization And shards would rip us apart  Shards that turned out to be simple plastic And clothes would tatter Food would rot And we’d be forced to once again Confront reality. You can’t go back  You can never go back.
