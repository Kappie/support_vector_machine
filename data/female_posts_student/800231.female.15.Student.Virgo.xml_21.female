Mainly because that first guy that tried to walk me through it was insane and didn't know what he was doing either. Anyway, I decided to get off my arse and actually do something today. One of the advanced students had been asking around for someone to teach so went over to  the counter he was standing at. It was only supposed to be one beginner per advanced person but he ended up with three, me and two other guys. He had managed to procure a huge reel container though so all was good. The only problem was that the two other beginners were absolutely incompetent to put it lightly. Well, that and our teacher-dude had the strongest accent ever and we could really only understand him when he was insulting us (which was pretty much constantly). Anyway, we were standing down in the darkroom waiting to use the smaller film loading room off to the side and teacher-dude was going through the steps of loading a reel. It was quickly pointed out that I the only other person that knew what she was doing. The other two beginners were far too busy trying to figure out why they couldn't see colours properly, in a room lit only by amber safety lights. Jeeze. Anyway, when we finally got in the film room and the lights were completely out all hell broke loose. Loading film reels involves locking yourself in the utter darkness and using things like scissors and pliers all while handling very delicate film. Definitely not a good thing to be doing while trapped in a tiny room with three other people. Anyway, passing the scissors around was a laugh, one kid stabbed himself in the hand, nothing serious just funny. I got my film canister open fast considering I'd never done it before. Problem was, I dropped it and had to spend several minutes crawling around in the dark looking for it. I did finally get it and load it though, way before the others. Anyway, I was leaning against a wall waiting for the others when I feel hands feeling about my breasts. "Vat is this?" (obviously teacher-dudes voice) "That would be me." "Oh, I thought so..." And then his hands just stayed there, I kid you not. No apologies, nothing. Just his hand... on MY boobs. How amazingly embarrassing. I feel so violated.
