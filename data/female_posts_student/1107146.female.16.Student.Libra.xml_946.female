Our DI team might be really screwed (you and Z out, me in a stupor, that leaves Rosie, Josh, and Sarah, nothing personal, but Rosie and Josh don't know much and I don't think Sarah can lead us alone)  most of the classes are coming to a near standstill because a third of the people are gone.  Sumner County got out on friday because of illness.  I hope you all get better soon.  see some of you on monday.
