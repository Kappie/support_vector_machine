Seriously though, she's so cool...even her music is cool.  bis, Lucious Jackson, the Cardigans...if only she likes  urlLink Superchunk  then I'm going to have to have a hitman take out her hubby and then I can swoop in.  Okay, maybe this is turning into one of those single white female dealies.  You can all watch dimentia set in as I slowly obsess over her and rename this blog to "Musing about Tina"...  Ok I'll stop I'm just  insanely  bored at class.  My teacher is stiing here trying to explain the point of fonts and how people hand draw them and a ton of other shit no one cares about.  When it comes time to learn what we're here for (Microsoft Word, for business no less!) she literally knows nothing about what we're supposed to be learning.  She just told us the only way you can select text  to reformat a document is "format -> font and scroll thru the font list".  Bah she's a fucking idiot.  I wonder if I brought a blowgun and darts next week I could take her out from this seat.  Hmmm....  In the mean time you can check out my  urlLink Cool Class Webpage  (which she reffered us to except its not for this class its for Business Application Software, different class.  Todays interesting class facts: Fonts with serif are best to use when writing to people over 40 years old because it helps them follow the type. Computers shouldn't make fonts of your handwriting becuase then someone could forge a nasty note to your boss, and he wouldn't know it was printed out and you'd get fired.
