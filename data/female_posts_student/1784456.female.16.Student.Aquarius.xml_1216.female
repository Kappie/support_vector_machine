(I didn't think that you could do that) Well hell, I can. I'm going crazy though, bored out of my mind! I'm reading the whole fushigi yuugi thing again! Geez, I even finished Maya for gods sake! Help meeee! Aahhh what the heck, I'll be back soon enough (god now I know I'm really ill, I  want  to go back to school) I might not be able to go to the Victorian Fayre though (snooy) but even if I do, I can't stay for long otherwise I'll cough all over you and then everyone will have the week over! No matter how fun that could be... *imagines one-ringing izzy all day long* Muhaha.
