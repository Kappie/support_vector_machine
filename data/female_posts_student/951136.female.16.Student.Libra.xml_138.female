And the book i'm reading isn't helping much- she gets initiated/lose her virginity by her brother, lusts after her cousin, and women dont have to get married, they just pick men they want to sleep with... i'm not in a very wholesome place right now. good thing i'm going to watch Harry Potter and not Troy again. I'm SOOO excited about H.P.!!!!!!! SATURDAY!!!I can't wait to see everyone again! i've felt so disconnected since school let out. I have really done nothing the past couple of days besides read. I've wanted to watch some movies, but i've been even too lazy to do that. Starting summer school on monday. I hope theres someone in my class that i know. As for my grand master plan, i had to put it on hold. i completely lost all heart, and i knew there was no way i'd have it done by Sunday and still look good- so, for christmas?...sigh. But i've also got to make alyssa's birthday present! rar!  sigh...all i want is to go dancing  :(  its 9 pm.I have nothing better to do. i guess i'll try to go fine something on TV. or go back to my lecherous book.
