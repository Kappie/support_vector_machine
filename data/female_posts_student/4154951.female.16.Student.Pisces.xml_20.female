But it's okay because it's a good song ;o)       Listun...do you wunt to know a seecrit...         *squeal* I love the 60s stuff. I wanna go back in time and scrump Paul McCartney. *goes into daydream mode*      *snaps back* Ah...that was nice. I have a free next! Woohoo! My Math teacher is away... there are like, ten teachers away today.. Must've all been on the same diseased bus or something... >=o/      I finally finished that stupid English essay on identity.. I changed the font size to 12 so it fills the page >oD  Honestly, who the fook wants to write about a bloody country's development?  Not me.         I'll blog again in my Math free. (Which is.. 10ish minutes from now. Start timing.)
