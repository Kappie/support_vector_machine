Here's a pic of Andrew and I from Duckapalooza 2004 (if I'm motivated I'll blog about it later.  Yes, I realize I'm blogging now, but I don't feel like typing a lot.  This is getting lengthy isn't it?[GET ON WITH IT!] Ok, ok I'm going)  Not the best quality ever, but thats what happens when my lazy ass scans a really dark photograph and just tries to halfass lighten it up.  I probably should have just emailed Andrew or Megan to fix it in Photoshop as thats basically their jobs, but it'll do for now.
