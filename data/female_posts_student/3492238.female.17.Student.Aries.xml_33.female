But now what I need is the stuff to STOP the peeling, sinceit has already started. I think I was too late with the peeling prevention plan. Yes that's it. I think that's exactly what happened. Peel it off? I guess so,keepers! Not cool. Sure, I'll have a tan now, but it comes at a price.   Lick! . . . Gulp! . . . Suck!
