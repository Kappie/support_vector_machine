To make matters worse my Great-Grandmother (my grandfathers mother) died with in the same 24 hours... I feel soo bad for my grandfather. I haven't stopped crying since I got here. This summer sucks so much. Why is it going so horrible. Everything is going wrong... my brother-in-law, my parents, my family dying... my sister did get married which was awesome, but I came back to some... unwelcome news, and more pain and misery. I hate my life. Nothing ever goes right, when things seem to be looking up something terrible has to happen... my sister gets married.. AWESOME, her husband breaks his back on their honeymoon, the day I find out, I find other things out as well. Then I get to go to Maine to see my family and get away from Florence, the day I get there my grandmother dies three hours before I arrive, and I also find out that my Grammie Abby dies as well. WHY?!?! That's all I want to know WHY? You know what FUCK THIS... FUCK EVERYTHING! I called my grandmother half an hour before she died, and they wouldn't let me talk to her, they told me she was doing fine, and everything went well. Why does everybody lie to me? Everyone that I trust lets me down, I'm just done trusting people. The people I hold closest to me are the ones who hurt me the most.
