I know that sounds tremendously dorky, but I'm still on a high from being outside and not under fluorescent lights.  I wish I could work outside all the time, just soaking up the rays on beautiful 75 degree days.  My Dad gave me the spiel on how I'm lucky to have this job because there are layoffs going on in his work, but that doesn't make me feel much better.  So I got an email from Alex today labeled "free porn" because I told him that seems to be all I ever get, but it wasn't porn--- and I got a real email!  Alert the press. Boo-ya grandma.  If any of you people out there want to write me, feel free I love a good letter.  I keep up with 3 peoples blog because I love hearing about others lives.  And how they different they become sometimes when they're typing without an audience.--Dinner More later
