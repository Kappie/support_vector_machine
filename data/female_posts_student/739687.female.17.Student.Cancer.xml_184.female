Things to do this week:  1)  Get my permit!  2)  Abolish all stupid/ditzy people from the face of the earth.  3)  Go to...that place...for...that thing.  4)  Work out and go running and such...more than once.  5)  Your mom. :-P  6)  Have something interesting/important to say in here.  7)  Not piss off  too  many people.   Well, I'm off to go study or something. See ya laters crazies.
