I was so glad because I had spent all day in Tifton babysitting Carrie, Katie, and Jack. I did get to lay out, so I'm getting a fa-huh-huh-awesome tan. I just didnt want to stay out to long to where my face got red. I have just been so tired lately. I fell asleep for about an hour at the dermatologist's office yesterday morning waiting on my grandpa, and then while the kids were watching Blue's Clues and running around, I completely fell out. It would have been terrible if something were to have happened while I was passed out. Those kids are into EVERYTHING and they are always fighting so I am suprised nothing did happen. But just as we were leaving my mom invited my seven year old cousin Katie to spend the night with us since her mom would be bringing all three of them to Chuck E. Cheese the next day. So I was really pissed, but I didnt even have to deal with her, besides her using all of my spray and pretending to curl her hair with my curling irons while I was. That was cute though, I can live with that. So, me, Sara, and Katie got up and went to Chuck E. Cheese today. It wasnt that bad actually. It just sucked for me and Say that time we stayed there for 5 hours. Then we went shopping. Oh my gosh, I have got to stop spending money. I bought the CUTEST purse at American Eagle. Oh, and I got some fun panties from Victoria's Secret. It was all 50% off. I was SO excited. I had to control myself though...yeah. Well I have been on the go non stop it seems like, and I am kinds nervous about the show tonight since we havent practiced in a week. I saw Tim and Rach when we were leaving the mall. I hope the picture call doesnt take too long tonight. Hopefully no one will complain so we can get it done faster. Well, I think I'm going to go listen to my fun new CD in the living room or take a bubble bath..yum
