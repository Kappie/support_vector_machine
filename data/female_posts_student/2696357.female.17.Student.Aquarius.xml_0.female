I dragged Laura along because i didn't want to show up by myself.  Well, I got there and was surprised to see Tom, Boghard, Mike, Alex, Patrick, Teddy, Jimmy, and Will there.   I was prepared though because i dressed up in a short frilly jean skirt, a purple tube top, and a jeweled dangly belt, which was SOOOO hot!!   WEll, needless to say, I immediately went out on the dance floor and started to shake my thang!!  Kevin was ALL over me...like his hands were up my skirt..ummmm, just a little too forward!! i also danced with jake and joe  then of course by myself to give all the hotties a show :)  Anyways, Kevin left with his friends at like 10 pm  he called me wanting me to come over to soren's house.  Laura's parents wanted her home so I managed to find my way to soren's house by like 10:30 pm.  As soon as I got there, Kevin came out of the house and started making out with me.  He was like, come on amy, let's hang out in your car.  Knowning what that REALLY meant, well...i was like i need some alcohol.  Therefore, we proceeded to go inside and i took 3 shots of vodka....which kevin claimed would "loosen me up".  Every 5 seconds he'd be like amy, come upstairs or amy, come to the basement with me.  At one point I did come upstairs...and all the guys (tom, boghard, jimmy, teddy, soren, chris) all gave me this "u're gonna give him ass look" as i went upstairs.  WEll, to their surprise, I came back down 1 minute later and was like I'm just gonna chill with you guys.  Kevin, being mad that I rejected him in front of everyone (basically I told him i didnt wanna hook up with him again) decided to go off somewhere.   Meanwhile, I sat down on the couch and jimmy started to spin this crazy looking owl on soren's table.  Its eyes freaked me out so I decided to kick it off.  Teddy was fighting me to leave it on and we began to wrestle.  *DRUMROLL*  While we were wrestling, my tube top (I WASN'T WEARING A BRA) came completely off and I flashed the entire room.  At that moment, I was convinced that only teddy saw and it was only off for like 2 seconds.  However, I found out later that it was off for more like a couple minutes and EVERYONE saw!!!  On monday, I ran into boghard and we talked about kevin being an ass.  He was like, "Im glad u came...at least you made some new friends!"   Well, later that week I find out from Frances that boghard thought my boobs were the perfect size and my nipples were perfect too because they weren't "off kilter"  and were the "perfect color and tone".   HEHE, I'll take that as a compliment then.  Little did I know that the guys not only saw my tits, but they studied them too!    Then, that friday, April 30, my art teacher, Mrs. Shark, asked me to pose for my art class because we are working on gesture drawings.  Since she knows I dance, she wanted me to get into my ballet gear and do dance poses for the class to recreate.  OMG, i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO nervous.   I ended up standing on a platform in the middle of the artroom in my leotard, ballet shoes, and tights for a hour and a half performing various moves.  To make matters worse, Jimmy is in my art class as is Sam, who constantly flirts with me (as i do to him).  Well, Sam kept screaming "Amy is hot" when I stood up there, especially when i put my leg over my head.  I guess they were thinking i would be good in bed.  Anyways, I got even more attention from Kevin's group of friends.   Well, I'm off to dance.  Just wanted to recap on the important/ memorable events in my life.  Lots of love :)
