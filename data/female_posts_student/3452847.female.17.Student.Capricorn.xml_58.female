I need him and i want him and i want to get him. I need to have him. Why does he have to have her? Shes so desperate and clingy and so blatanly still cares deep down for Marc and Jason you are second best, she has run to you because she couldn't get what she wanted... Can you not see it? I can, maybe thats because i'm trying to be negative, but you shouldn't be second best to anyone, your the best, and i have a fear shes just with you because she doesn't want to seem alone and unloved, so she'll have you because she knows you'll tell her you love her because you feel insecure and need to be loved too. I wish i didn't care, i really wish i did. I really wish you would care about me too. I just wish i was good enough, wish that all the shit that had happened hadn't and we could try again, never say never, but its been nearly 10 months, 10 months on the 16th of this month, it sucks so much. I wonder if he ever thinks of us? Or me or anything like that? I mean he must think of me a bit for him to do what he did with me, i just wish so hard that things would change. For the better, for me. Hopefully we'll be mates again when he comes back as we were kind of talking before he left, mind you he was pissed off with Laura and down about stuff, but they sorted it out, and he won't come in to the shop to see me as he feels guilty, bastard shouldn't have done it then should he? But i can't take away this overwhemling feeling of jealousness that is crawling all over me.  ~Lisa~
