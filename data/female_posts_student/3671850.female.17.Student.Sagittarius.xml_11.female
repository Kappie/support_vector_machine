Sooo much has happened since then.. I went to New York, registered for school, appeared on  prime time  TV (okay.. so it was like 3seconds on the Today SHow.. but whatever), and ... got some kind of disease from the nail salon.. sounds delightful, right? This morning i went out to breakfast with just the girls --watched sarah turn her coffee into a solid with 10 packs of sugar... and i realized how much i missed them ... I dont know what i will do in college.. but lets not go there again. I also registered for school.. I got good classes, but none with  my monkey  :( tear... I also got a very very crappy parking space.. but atleast i will stay in shape walking with my 100lb bookbag every morning from space 231... grrrr. I miss Chad (still in L.A) hangin out with the BIG stars... sigh, but I'm sooo excited that nikol, jess, and sarah are home.. for good, i hope, for the summer. I'm tired of hearing bull crap  froma particular person of the past.. why won't he just let me rest in peace.. ButI realize that(thatparticular person, who will remain nameless) just wants me back... wah haa haa *evil laugh*... thatsatisfies my spite... Okay.. i sound horrible, I'll stop hear. Until next time--
