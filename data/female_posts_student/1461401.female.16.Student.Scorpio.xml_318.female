I thought I heard a music box playing the harry potter theme this evening before the play, and for about a week now I keep hearing people say my name. I swear to god someone just leaned over my left shoulder and whispered "kristin". Dark shadows out of the corners of my eyes never cease to entertain, especially when I continuously think someone is walking up the front way to the door! Yay! Fun fun for everyone!  ...  the play is over. isolation insues. call me. for the love of god. call me.
