Now I don’t know if everyone or just a few of u hav this kinda of idea in ur head- wot I mean is u hav a time whe u were little more confident, and little more chatty and a little more happier and that. Or some thing along those lines. Now im not  going down a self pity road or anything- this is actually meant 2 sound really positve- but anywayz 2 actaully get to the point with out this infantile rambling which is common of me in speech and when I bloody writin/typin wot ever. But I do remember in yr 9 just sittin in southfields against that building this (toilets I think) and just sittin chattin 2 joe (hope u don’t mind me sayin this joe), just a couple of mates just getting on well and chattin about absolutely everything. And just the general feel of that time (as in like the beginning of yr 9….bloody life story this is….send u all2sleep-lol), but yer I actually felt confident (may hav something 2 do with me being thinner and actually havin ppl like me which I wont go in2 cos they might not want it 2 b known..lol)- but anyways now I actually feel really bloody happy- I actually feel confident and not like a complete and utter fuckin idiot…just a bit of a twat who does speak shit (not 2 b confused with spreading shit I just mean as in ramblings) am v happy with simon :) and most things in my life seem 2 b goin pretty gd (with the exception of the weight lose thing- a minor obsticle which willb conquered if I put a lil more effort in- wil up date u on the situation-lol) ah- that feels better….any1 still there….ah we…lol Now 2 talk about yesterday DRAMA I woke up yesterday like it was Christmas- it didn’t even feel like Christmas on feckin x-mas day…but anywayz it was like x-mas cos I was just thinknin about the day- I wasn’t nervous at all- all through the day and even b4 the performance- I don’t get nervous-hehe-lol  WELL DONE 2 EVERY1: SANDY, HAZ, TARA,CAT.G AND SAM who all performed amazingly. Every1 done really well :) I think actual performance went really well- there a few cock ups but not on our part- there was meant 2 b a black out at the end of scene 1 but there wasn’t so we just kinda sat there (I think every1 had frozen) ansd then sandie just went in2 here joke and that went ok- there was meant 2 b a blackout at the end of taras death, but there wasn’t- and I don’t really know  if mrs a actually knew cos in the technical rehersal she didn’t do the lights and the point of the tech was just that-lol. Theaudiecen seem 2 like it as I hav had really positive feed back not just above my self but I mean about the play itself cos every1 did fab. Somje bits were funny in my head. At one point where I grabbed cat g (Irina) cos she was goin 4 sam (zulieka) she was struggleing so much (which she was supposed2) that iu actually pivoted round in a circle still holding on 2 her. And wen I was “sleepin” that was good cos I was just thinking 2 myself “its nearly over and I haven’t got hardly anymore lines 2 say –yay – (cos most of my lines were in scene 2 (which is actually scene three- I will explain in a mo) lil at the end and the rest kinda meaduium 2 small ish at the beginging- but then that was the build up of the character- she didn’t say a like at the end cos that was scene 1, and tehn she said more in scene 1 cos that was scene 2, and she said loads in scene 2 cos that was scene 3 cos it did an overlap thing- hence why we repeated the same bit at the beggingin again- some ppl got it som ppl didn’t- gemma (both Goodyear and bridger) thought that she had been reincarnated and came back from the dead which I liked and cld give an edgey feel 2 the play- rich actually got it which I was kinda impressed with- the rent didn’t get it and neither did ryan (my lil bro) my rents were really supportive and they sed that I did well evern tho they were obviously kinda bioust . although I wasn’t expectin the audience 2 laugh when I went 4 cat (Irina) the second time kinda sneakily- was kinda good tho cos I suppose wh  u look at it was kinda of a lil comedy moment cos she doesn’t really im goin 4 her and sanide (mariana) and sam (zulieka) havin 2 restrin me yuet again cos im like a bloodty physco- but an educated one- kinda scared my self a lil at one pint cos about 2 mins b4 the audience came in a went brhind the curtain and punched the clothes on the rail thing and shouted (quietly so no1 eklse cld hear) u fuckin whore and just general rage words or wtoever and then came out comempletely pissed off as the character which was cool- but the thing that I was sayin about scarin me was when I was staindin looking at haz (Cyzarine) with a knife in my hand I was actually picturing her screamin in pain as I kinda stabbed her with a knife and blood goin everywhere- which Is only gd in the scense of getting inside the characters head and that. Btw haz I dotn want 2 do that 2 u btw, don’t b scared-lol- mwhahaha….lol – my mum said that she was cared of me cos when I looking at haz at the bit that I just said she was thinking “oh god Ive had that look a few times” lol- oopppsss probably will think of some other moment in it that made me laugh (not while I was doin it just in my head) 	The tattoos were fukin amazing even if I do say so myself- a giant thank-u 2 chrsi 4 stayin after school and doin them 4 me- every1 else was impressed with them- was funny cos after the performance I got changed in2 my clothes 2 go down the pub with simon, gemma and rich. Thing is I had a strap top on- so all my tats were on full display- I like the attention tho-lol- I actually like the tats- I like the skulls or the way they looked- so I walked down hill raod and these boy racers were kinda just gawping out of their car and some lil kinda were lokin at me a lil weird- and then I was waiting at the end of hill road 4 about 15 mins cos simon went home after the performance and I was gona meet him- but ppl weer drivin past looking at the and that kinda double takin me-lol but I did hav a jacket tho which I put on when I met up with them cos I thought-“ well u hav starlinh on ur arm and a fukin ss mark and all u need is some drunk guy comin over and thinking they r real- Ignoring the smudgmarks and startin a fight- or just getting un wanted negative attention- the tats took about 2 hours 2 do- simon lent me some facepaints which chris worked wonders with- gona by him  some chol8 2 say thanks- under the condtition that he shares it with stefie cos she stayed behind with chris just 2 tag along- but that was cool- she kept chris entertained…not in that way u dirty ppl-lol :P but she halped do the epaulette on my arm and she did the spiders web on sams neck which looked really good- 	Speakin of stefie- we hav this thing with a Rastafarian goat – a whote goat with a rasta hat in with a spliff, some big fuck off 1980s black rimmed  blues brothers sun glasses, a gold tooth and a big grin in his face…on a beach- and I am surprised that I canot fina a pic of a goat  on a beach let alone with all of the description above-bloody internet 	Went 2 the poub with simon like I sed b4 and was kind weird cos I knew most of the other corwd , (but we didn’t sit with them) cos of their lil brothers, like adam gs brother, Lloyds, damiens, joe mate “matan”-lol – adam ls sister and these other ppl- had this guy just come and sit in riches seat cos he was up with bar with simon getting the drinks in and I thought gemma or leane knew him but the just kinda laughed at him and I cld c they didn’t- and he said 2 me about three tiems with long pauses “should I go” and I said sorry cos he kinda said it really quietly- but he was just sittin starring at me- he wasn’t scary or freakin me out- and simon lloked a bit protactive over it-lol- but then he just got up when richj came over and asked him if he cld hav his seat back, then he moved round 2 simons next 2 me and then rich said his m8 was sittin there and then he wondered off (he was realy drunk btw if u haven’t already worked that out) and he went and was just kinda talking 2 any1- 	God I hav written shit loads- I hav verbal diorea (can spell it 2 save my life) im still on a hi from last night cos of the play J dunno if we will performe it again- I think som ppl will want 2 and others not-  well that was quite a big update- erm…………….  Hope u r all ok  love u all my lil chicken nuggets :D KAT :D
