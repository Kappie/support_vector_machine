Everything went pretty well, I finally have the dance part down.  Sweet action.  Its going to be really good…  I also found out Katie and I are going to be rooming together when we go to Florida next month, she worked it all out that little schemer.  She also got this new chick named Kelly in with us, she seems really cool so I hope it all goes well.    Other then that, not too much today.  Watched kids, cleaned house, talked with Donna, made bead kits, talked with internet people, talked with Zach on the phone….blah, blah, blah…  I feel bad because I skipped my walk this morning, and then I had pizza tonight, GAH!  Not good!  But I PROMISE to walk tomorrow.  Ahem, yeah.  Man, I really want an adventure right NOW!  I want something to come and drag me away, something that I have to adapt to, and make myself comfortable in.  I need a project, something to pour HUGE amounts of myself into, gah, I dunno…maybe the summer is just making me edgy.  I would like to go trek through the Amazon, or climb a mountain, or scuba dive….ANYTHING!  Join a band, direct a play, shave my head….move to Venice….just something I have never done before!
