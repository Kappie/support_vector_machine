I fell really bad ... these guys in my health class stole some chicks pictures and photo-copied them and taped them all over the library. I wanted to say somthing but then I just didn't. Ugh thats really stupid of me I know but I can't really change the past ya know? So my Reset cd came in the mail today it's alright but I thought David Desrosiers was on in but guess not... ;( oh well Pierre still is so yeah! : ) I want to do somthing big. Like just go out in the spur of the moment and get my nose pierced like I've wanted to. You know whats kinda good Italian Ice.. But I don't get why it says "Real Italian Ice"? If it wasn't real what would it be?! and don't say "Fake" because that was predictible. Again I'm rambling..... and about Italian Ice what is my problem? GOD! okay I'm gonna not speak or "type" until I've got good stuff to say... bye!
