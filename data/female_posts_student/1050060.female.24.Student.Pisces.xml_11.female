People here are such ass and now i know why i left here in the first place. Just because i am not 100% french i am being treated different then the others.   I have to get to Fredericton as soon as possible. I have been thinking about going to Fredericton and going on welfare but i really don't want to do that. I need a job so bad. Maybe once i get a job i wouldn't feel so out of control with everything. Its my control issue coming out again. I have talked to Brenda in Fredericton and we have talked about getting an apartment together and also with her daughter. Linda who is Brenda's friend is also looking a roommate.   I was suppose to live with my aunt but she lives to far away from town and the university. It would take and hour and a half just on the bus plus and hour or so to walk to the last bus stop. Just to much for me!   Anyways i have to go because mom is going to pick me up in a few minutes so i have to be ready when she gets here. Have a good day and God Bless you!
