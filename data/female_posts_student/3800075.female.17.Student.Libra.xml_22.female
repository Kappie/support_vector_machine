My part burt so i cant brush the hair and eventually it will peel. yay. And now ill bitch about something else. Hmm........... Tonight is numero dos without human contact. Ok so i did see the birth givers briefly, and i did go to work tonight but that doesnt count- just talked to spenser who proceeded to tell me that my sister was hot. Yes Tricia Hoiland, formerly Leary, was a fine bitch but now shes older and less pretty, not to mention a wife and mother. And i dont really care for High School freshman to think of my sister that way.... its great. Im sorry im such a fucking dog but hey. Im livin my life better than she did. No Im not..but i like to think i am- better for my self perception. Im mean. listen to me. Oh well. I love the sis but i hate being compared to her, im no comparison. anyway. i did see the parents tonight- guilt trip number 90,000 from good ol double D. (heh that makes me laugh) Faja- im sorry the phone was off the hook and you thought i was dead so you had to travel 27 miles back in to town deciding on whether or not to make my funeral a closed service. Shit happens eh. I talked to michelle today, briefly, so that was good- some friend contact. ? GD 2 days jacklies been gone- this is gonna be a tough week. I'm old and bitter. somebody buy me a lexus. ha. (it works) Nathans cousins from cali are in town so who knows if ill see him this week. he said we'd hang out sometime.... but who knows. i havent heard from him since friday. Arg its only sunday! AHHHHHHHHHH    I'm so tired of being a fucking statistic!  So I'll change my ways..... only to become but a different statistic  . yes. the fucking glory of america right here. Tonight that fat fuck janitor called me a liberal. Well thats makes person # 2 so maybe i am a liberal. its odd though the 2 people accusing me of being liberal id say are conservative bastards. Michelle made a good point though- she said that they probably dont consider themselves conservative either. who knows eh! Well ive bitched my frustrations out. well some of them. Bitching is stupid. I shall resist in the future. Theres no point to it really. So i figure ive watched a total of 16 and a half hours of tv since yesterday. Bwahaha. im loving it. Maybe if i didnt watch any tv i could convince Ralph Nader not to run for president. Haahaha i kill myself. I love the nightlife i like to boogie... bla bla bla bla all night long. hmm flashback. i think thats from Srg. Bilco. which i havent seen in a coons age. (Note to self: Dont say 'coon' at least i wont get shot here theres no black people- im not racist i swear that word just comes out) Now another movie begins on tv.. opening credits.... its greek, opening like my big fat greek wedding...but what is it. This is a new one to me. Hmm ill change the channel when i get off my fat ass. Aww jesus its a woody allen film. Im glad he hasnt made anything recently he pisses me off. Im glad betty stayed with me. I love my betty shes the coolest! She should have gone to the cabin though, she likes it there best and probably resents me now because she had to stay here to 'protect' my pathetic self. She could be out there roaming the lake, taking big shits that i wont have to pick up. (for those of you playing the home game shes a dog- and i think im dyslexic because i literally just spent a minute trying to type dog...kept coming out god) Hmmf anyhoo ill wake up tomorrow and double D and the mother and my betty will already have been at the lake for 4 or 7 hours. and ill watch more tv hooowah! But i am gonna get off the comp and back to my couch. "Thank you jesus- Im thankful for my faithful companion Betty" Until Time Next
