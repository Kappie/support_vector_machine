She had an awesome bunt, and couple really good catches, she scored a run, and she batted 2 for 3! And they won 4-3! yay! That makes me happy for them. Then I went back to Carol's and played around-the-world with Carol, Kim, and Sarah. It was muchos fun. Then I came home and watched Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill (  Today- School was actually funnish. Weird huh? Well, I had fun study hall today, and basketball in gym, and a almost-not-bad-math class, and Dan got to teach me, Heidi, and Hilary a buncha stuff in chem cause the teacher wasn't there (I actually know stuff now!). And I am Ann Putnam for our play in English class. I have one of the main parts! yay! It's fun acting infront of the class because I get to forget about my problems for 40 mins and pretend to be someone else. So now I've just been watching tv and waiting for my mom to get home with food so I can eat dinner. Later, I'm doing nothing.   I gotta remember my prom ticket money tomorrow and I gotta remember to ask Sarah about going to battle of the bands with her. It would be cool to go and some of the hott-guy-in-a-band type of guy. lol  Song:  Something missing  Left behind Search in circles Every time I try I've been here before I've seen you before I can't escape walking down these halls  Hard to find a place where there are no walls   And no lines begging me to cross  Only straight ahead better move along Like Clockwork I commit the crime  I pretend to be everything they like  I've been here before I've seen you before And I trade everything for this And I trade everything for this Why do I read the writing on the wall Why do I read the writing on the wall I won't lose my place in line I've been here too long and I've spent too much time I won't lose my place in line I've been here too long and I've spent too much time -These Walls- Trapt
