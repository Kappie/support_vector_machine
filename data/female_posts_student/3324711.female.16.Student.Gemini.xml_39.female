I mean there was celebrate canada and the festival and concerts, and then all of a sudden Im at the cottage, having a blast doing absolutely nothing. Now Im here, after working 2 shifts at GCB again. And family reunion. Wait, what?  Its all giving me a headache.  Anyway, from what I can rememer, the cottage was awesome. Monday we had crap weather so me and Jess and Mom went to Dunes [crazy artistic gift shop type thing.] We spent 3 hours in there and I think it was the highlight of my week. Besides the cottage itself I mean.. it was better than my house.  But going back to Dunes.. amazing. It was amazing. Mom even bought us dessert, which was orgasmic. I got this chocolate mousse with raspberry sauce cake thing [drool] and raspberry tea.   So good. [drool again]. Anyway back to reality, Jess got a wooden mask thing for her room and we all got free rings, made of seashell. Pretty damn cool.  It makes me think about what I want to do when I grow up. No office job for me, thanks. I think Id kill myself if I ever had a cubicle. I wonder if I could open up a shop like that? It would be very very cool. And fun. Oh, the possibilites..  But knowing me I would go backrupt in weeks.   Rejection.   Lauren I miss you so much. And Kyle. And Lydia! And Bryce and everyone that I havent seen so far this summer. What am I doing?  I need some Tylonel.
