Megan and I think Maria saw me. I only cried for a bit. I don't like people seeing me cry. Then I went to 5th hour. Jenny made me cry again. This time Anthony Schuller saw me. I swear to God that kid thinks I'm so retarded. So yes My day at school was awful. I came home and went to Melissa (Malow) and Saras (Bemis) track meet. Malow won by one point. Mel you did really good. I'm proud of you. This Saturday I'm spending the night over the Scallys. Yay. Maybe I can do something with my friend's on friday night since I haven't been out in awhile. That would be fun. Well I can't really think of anything good right now... -White-e (Ask Maria and Chelsea)
