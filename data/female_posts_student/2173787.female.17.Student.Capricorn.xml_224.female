I am standing there, trying desperately to make plans to see everyone in my few days home for the next few weeks and trying desperately to disguise my tears.  I'm really going away.  Not for too long but, still, long enough.  Long enough to miss all of my friends, long enough to be left out of the loop, long enough to miss Erica all together before she leaves for New York, long enough to know that you can never return to find things the way they are today.  Today things were perfect, well almost perfect.  Even getting a C in calculus for the year won't damper this day in my memory. I don't want to go.  I didn't know that before tonight, but at this moment I would rather stay home more than anything else.  I didn't know that I would be hit so hard with emotions, hard enough to make me cry on the way home, hard enough to make my body wrack.  I never knew how happy I am beneath all of my griping, how much I feel I need the dynamic around me even though I complain. What will I do without you?
