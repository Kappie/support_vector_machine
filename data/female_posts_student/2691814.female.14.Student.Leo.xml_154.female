But on her side of the cards they're all turned up and i was reading reversed from my side. So while i was reading what i thought where hers...she was reading my cards from her side. Everytime she'd talk about changes in my life she'd look at the cards and try to hide it. At the store we went to we'd start talking about dreams and things*francesca* and she kept giving me these stares that were just...wow. I'd be like 'what?' and she'd say 'nothing, just your eyes' what about my eyes? she'd be like 'well it runs on our side that we all have vibrent looking eyes' she also said to start reading body language books. But she knew what i was thinking the whole time I was with her. Scary.  God francesca we have so much that we dont know about our families but atleast your mom will tell you about it...i have to have my aunt do that for me. These dreams are getting scary for me. Last night, i had a dream that i was walking down a long hallway looking at paintings. And then i saw a friend *not saying who* flickering on and off like she's not there and then she's there. Which has happend in alot of my other dreams so i wasnt suprised by that. But, i dont know...its just...weird. Francesca..u have to tell me what your mom said...you told me when i came to your house that your mom is hiding something, im dying to know just like you are. okay well now im gonna write back on the e-mail.
