It wasn't bad at all. of course it was simply a bunch of us "d.i.'s" being used as free child labor. it was fun tho, i have to admit. i hadn't seen most of them in two months. and i'm going to be spending alot of time w. them soon so, might as well look on the bright side of things.  Ok, so. I've been thinking- and talking to alyssa. and ya know what? people are  weird .   and i dont mean just, different. i mean, where the hell did we pick this stuff up...? I was reading a conversation i had saved from over a year ago- dot dot dot. and i freaked  myself  out. I mean, i barely remember having this conversation, and it justamused methat i would have said these things. that i was that way. That i could act that wayaround someone. I guess it's little surprise why alanahwas worried about it there for a while.and i'm talking " Mark " conversations. the kind where you dont want your father walking in and reading what you've just written ...anyway. besides what alyssa has been saying about the way she is, and things other people have on their minds, its just making me look at things in adifferent light. Not new, b.c. i've been there, andi understand that. but just forgotten. Do any of us know what we want. Do any of us really even know ourselves? and if we dont, then how can other ppl know us? Really know us. as in a relationship, you learn things everyday that surprise you. but what about things that shock you. that would change your mind about someone? or even turn you to them. Things are so complicated. People are complicated!i think its worth figuring out. even if we never will have a singluar answer. i'm just asking myself questions...b.c. i'm curious, and i listen to all my friends around me talking about similar stuff, and its all so alike, yet completely on seperate pages.  ok, well, i have to go to the grocery store now and then make dinner. talk to whoever whenever. boi.  -"Get out of the carin case it blows up!" --"are you serious!?" -"No........  YES!!!!" Patty, that was too funny....
