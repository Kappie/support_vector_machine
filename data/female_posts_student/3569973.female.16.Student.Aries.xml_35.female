Today seems soo long...I woke up at about 9...I know I should wake up earlier...but ya know...bump that. Well I did kinda wake up early today because Jake called me at 6am to tell me that he was up and was gonna get ready to go to football practice and then again when he got home. Then we went to cleburne to get Jake his guitar and to go to wal-mart to get some candy for the parade. Then I went back to Jakes to eat lunch and stuff until he had to go to football practice. Then came home and took a shower and hurried to get dressed and my hair dryed and then Tracy came to pick me up so that I could go back over to Jakes so that she could get ready for the parade and so that we could wait for Sunny and the kidos to come over. We got there kinda late and me and Faith watched the whole thing together. I was really excited, but then my butt started to hurt and then I thought that it would never end...so ya know. Then after the parade was over we went to get something to eat and then headed over to Brandons. So for about and hour or so me and nikki sat there and watched Brandon, Clint, Jake, and Justin play pool for awhile. It was soo funny. I dont think I stopped laughing. Then we all headed up to the carnival and watched the queens contest, which my cousin, Jennifer Masters was in. It was neat seeing her up there, next year is Kellys turn, and then mine...lol. But well it was fun getting to see some people I cant wait, I think this whole week is gonna be great. But well here I am watching TV and dont really have much to talk about...just hope I got someone to go with to the carnival tomorrow since Jake has football practice until 8pm I think. So Till then, Later Days.
