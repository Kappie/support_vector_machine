Unfortunately, due to whatever voodoo blogger do so well, it is the only browser I can use. Yeah. Teh sux.  Other than that, I'm feeling a bit alone in the world right now. That's how it goes, but it sucks anyway. I am also without any apprecciable funds, job, whatnot, facing an uncertain future at best. Okay, that's life. But it sucks anyway.    Sorry if this all seemed a bit bitchy. I'm in that sort of mood for the moment.
