Didn't mean to make you cry If I'm not back again this time tomorrow Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters  Too late, my time has come Sends shivers down my spine Body's aching all the time Goodbye everybody - I've got to go Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth Mama, oh...(anyway the wind blows) I don't want to die I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
