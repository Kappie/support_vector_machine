They both really liked it, and I liked it EVEN MORE the second time.  I dunno why, but it was much better!  :)  Then today I bought the soundtrack.  :-)  It's really neat... I had downloaded the songs from the broadway show, but it's just not the same.  I really like the way that Catherine Zeta-Jones sings the songs.  I think she does a really awesome job.  And so did Richard Gere, oh my gosh... *sigh*  :-)  And truthfully, even though she had to be taught, Renee Zelwegger was a surprising talent!  So, anyhow, I'm making a copy of the soundtrack for Jennifer and sending to her in England.  I doubt she'd be able to get it very cheap there, so I'll save her a few bucks.      Valentine's Day     Valentine's is probably the WORST holiday ever invented!!!  To this day, I haven't had a good Valentine's Day.  Ya know, the sad thing is that I haven't spent all that many Valentine's Days alone...!!!!  Which means I always have CRAPPY boyfriends.  Anyhow, I think this year will be decent.  I'm not doing anything, though.  I have no date... but that's probably for the better.  I think I'll end up watching a movie.  I get to sleep in that morning, though.  My Politics professor cancelled class for that day because we're so ahead in the lectures.  Anyhow, back to Valentine's Day.  WORST HOLIDAY EVER!  It only gives room for let downs!  Well, in MY experience.  However, this year may turn out different.  Because I'm getting a card from Druck... and I may actually get some cards from others.  :-D  So, I think that this Valentine's Day may be a SPECTACULAR day!  At least I know I can watch  My Big, Fat, Greek Wedding !!!  I just bought it today!  It was such a FUNNY movie!  I really like romantic comedies!  I actually started to buy  So I Married an Ax Murderer !!!  Had it been on sale, I would've bought it... but I wasn't going to pay $20 for it when I knew I'd probably find it at Wal-Mart or Best Buy for like, half that.  Circuit City is GREAT for sale prices, because they usually have the lowest price.  But when it comes to regular, everyday prices, they're HIGHER.    Sick or not?    I'm feeling better, but I actually still have a twinge of ache in my stomach.  I don't know why... the only reason I can think of is that I didn't eat much yesterday, so maybe my stomach is starting to eat its own lining?  I dunno... it hurts, though.  Yesterday was CRAPPY!  I ate a LITTLE bit of soup, but not much.  Then for dinner, I ate some toast.  That was it... so then I ended up getting a headache from not eating.  It sucked.  Then I hardly slept at all, and I still got myself out of bed to go to class.  I was dragging all day long.  I had my first quiz in Music, and I aced it.  It was SO EASY for me!  We don't have class on Thursday, and we have our proficiency exam on Tuesday next.  I'm sure I'll ace that, too.  Everything's easy right now for me, and actually for many others.  Anyhow, I'm feeling a bit better, but I think I'm suffering from some insomnia.  But I've always had problems with insomnia.  It sucks.  A lot.  I hope I sleep well tonight... and I'm actually thinking of not going to early childhood class tomorrow....  We don't ever do anything in there!  We STILL haven't gotten a syllabus... and we don't do anything in there!!!!  Anyhow, it's a pointless class.  And I'm upset because I found out that Dr. Jacobs isn't going to teach after this semester.  So there goes my whole plan of taking 4 early childhood classes with him this summer.  :(  DAMN IT!  Oh well... I'm faily certain that the other ECE professors are equally as cool and demanding.  Anyhow, that's all I have for now... so I will leave on this note, and update later.       urlLink  postCount('11Feb2003');
