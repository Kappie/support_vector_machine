It was a little frustrating today because I've been having trouble making agar plates (I don't know why!). The first time, somebody autoclaved my flask without my knowledge. It was all solidified by the time I came back. The second time, I *thought* I was making LB broth, but apparently I used LB agar instead because the contents of THAT flask solidified too. I wondered why the color was so funny for LB medium. The third time, I did not mix the agar with water well enough because it didn't dissolve in the autoclave. Just big clumps of burnt agar, which I poured out into a bucket, waited for it to solidify, and trashed. The fourth time, I ran out of agar - so I just had to make a really small batch. Thankfully, it worked, and I hope my 10 agar plates will last me a very long time.  Then I came home and had spaghetti wrapped in bread. Talk about carb-loaded. I tried to take a nap, but it was too hot. Ate more spaghetti, then came downstairs to get away from the heat. I lay on the floor of the living room staring at the ceiling for quite some time. I thought that was a bit pathetic, so I proceeded to reorganize my Netter's anatomy flash cards, taking us to the present moment.
