But I tried, just so's you know. And also so that you can have sympathy when you're sitting there going, "YOU WERE MY RIDE AND YOU DITCHED ME, BIOTCH!" Actually, that would be really funny to see happen, altho not at the time, by any means.  I'm sitting at my dad's waiting for the inevitable flood...  Wish me luck, all....
