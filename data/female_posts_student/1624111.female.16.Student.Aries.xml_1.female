I'm kinda mad at myself right now cause i was gonna look up something on el internet and i dont remember what it was. i hate it when somethings right on the tip of your brain but you cant think of it....hate that feeling. Anyway, im entertaining myself with this while my brother Alex has his birthday party. Theyre in his room right now. Its pretty dangerous to be outside of my own room...theyre all hyper and boyish and they already shot me with a nerf gun, so im avoiding them until they leave to go see thier stupid movie. Hulk or something. big deal to them. Why do men like movies like that? Some big muscley guy that gets angry and smashes things...i know i sure wish i could turn into one of those. if only I had been hit by gama rays! Oh... but, seriously, the hulk is one superhero i just dont understand. First of all, what kind of superpowers are these: jumping, greeness, bigness, strongness, anger? oooh, thatll keep those criminals at bay. And arent superheros supposed to be all noble and courageous and righteous? sorry, i just dont find anything all that admirable about some guy who gets angry and strong and makes things go smash....ooooh, noble. People like Atticus Finch are 5000 times better heros. Finchy made the list of top 100 heros of the movies too...guess which place he got! #1! cool, eh? Not that he's exactly a SUPERhero...but hes sort of the quintessencial good guy, almost superhuman in his morality or something. i dunno, maybe im just crazy. probably am. ive been told that many many times. So anyway, whats nwe with me? um...i just got back from Tucson AZ on vacation...emily came with me. we had fun. saw some movies, spilled some water, splashed some water, drank some water, (there was lots of water), saw the fires, played some truth or dare, had a fun and exciting day, played some 20 questions...fun stuff. we learned some great lessons from the wise Malfron...good old malfron. i miss him. um, what else? Im almost done with Catcher in the Rye but i havent been taking notes so ill have to reread it. poor holden...so lonely. Thats one of the reasons im so lucky. I dont feel terribly alone and misunderstood like a lot of teenagers. I got some good friends that keep me pretty sane. :-D. I'm really very lucky. I mean, i dont win the lottery and all that crap, but im lucky. I've got a loving family and everyone i love is pretty healthy, and ive got great friends, as previously mentioned, and i go to a great school, and i have a roof over my head and i live in a nice neighborhood and im not facing a lot of pressure at school to do drugs or have sex or any of that, i dunno, lifes good. Even if i do get bored a lot. Im very lucky. i try to be grateful for that. and im not saying all this so i can brag about how much better my life is than yours or anything, cause being so lucky kinda bothers me in a way. Ive never really believed there is such a thing as luck because...everything happens for a reason right? people get what they deserve in the end. God. all that. and if i get all this already, well, i havent been any saint or anything, so why? what do i have to do to be worthy of all this? gotta live a worthwhile life and do something great. thats scares me... i mean, what makes me more deserving of all this...this "luck" than some poor, starving kid in india? Why do i get it and he doesnt? I dont think im a better person than he is. So i guess i feel like i gotta do something extrordinary to perhaps make myself more deserving. scary though, scary. makes me hope life is fair. i figure the leats i can do is live my life trying to make it fair...not just for myself either. for those of us who deserve that night on that hill, and everyone else. Um, anyway, that got a little deep, didnt it? well, i only got like 120 spaces left, so i guess ill end this now. Maybe this would've been better as a nitwit. oh well. bye all. never stop thinking. Mood: "thinking....always." Music: "Seven Nation Army"  "Hardest Button to Button"  "Love of my life" (damn you emily, you have way too much influence on me)  there you go, theres my sub-journal i wrote earlier today.
