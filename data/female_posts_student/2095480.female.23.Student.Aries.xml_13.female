After VSO, the stage crew sat down in the dimmed Whitehead Auditorium and ate the left over reception food after striking stage. We have alot to transport this time, being that we have a 150 choir and a 65 orchestra - and the concert site has no chairs or stands.   VSO was definately interesting. Everyone was walking on eggshells, and yelling - rather strange combination. I did not see Dean Gaston - which is very unusual. He is usually first in line to get in.  I will save you the pain of the evening. What I will say is that overall we did put on a good show - it would have been a great show if we didn't have to repeat it all tomorrow.  I am very tired. Very, very tired. There was something that I wanted to write about, but I can't remember it. So....   Goodnight.
