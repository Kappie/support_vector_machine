I think its so cool Hilary Duff let her sister be included, since Haylie was the one who actually wanted to be the famous siger, While Hilary kinda just fell into that role! And Hilarys newest movie, A Cinderella Story, with major HOTTIE Chad Michael Murray!! It premieres only in theatres on July 16. I can't wait!! So mark your Calendars!!
