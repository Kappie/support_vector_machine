This is the funniest movie I've seen ALL summer.  It reminds me of nights in Cleveland where we'd pack a couple of cars and set out trying to find Shaker Square or an open grocery store after 9 PM or the "Denny's off Richmond" that we STILL have not found (!). We always wound up somewhere in the ghetto or the boonies, but of course, we didn't run into NPH (Neal Patrick Harris) or runaway cheetahs or Freakshow (so yeah, you'll just have to watch the flick). The moral of the adventure of course is, the value of the destination comes from the journey--and the company. I also have to point out that although its not a huge part of this movie, it really takes 1st generation humor, which is so often "insider,"and makes it known to the world. Parent pressure, social stigmas, language barriers, cultural expectations, etc.; I love that this stuff is hitting mainstream media. It makes an ABCD like me feel more at home. ABCD (American Born Confused Desi).  And as for its funniest movie of the summer ranking, that is in competition with White Chicks (B+) and Dodgeball (C+) and Saved! (A-).  Check those out too.
