Actually, they episode that came from, The Regina Monologues ("The Simpsons are going to Great Britain!") is coming on tonight, Fox, 8:30. I suppose I should explain the title.  I had a dream about horses last night.  In it, my dad robbed a store and got my sister and me a horse and I was riding it all throughout Colonial Williamsburg, and then I saw a bunch of TD teachers and I returned the horses out of convictions.  Sure beats some of my "other" dreams. There were two very scary moments last night.   First, we were playing hide and go seek. (Yes, I do still enjoy it occasionally...got a problem with that?)  I was trying to outrun "it" and I put my hands out to tag the door and I fell through the glass.  Luckily, the glass didn't break.  My dad made me really mad cause he started screaming at me about the door, and didn't even ask if I was ok.  My mom says I'm extremely lucky...she knew a girl who went through a full glass door too and she got cut in half.  It's eerily similar to my accident ninth grade year.  I went through a glass door then too, but the glass did break and slit my right index finger almost to the bone...I needed seven stitches.   The second scary thing that happened happened to Jenni and Kayla (another one of my sister's friends...Maisie couldn't spend the night).  They were riding their bikes around the block, and these guys started following them!  They had to call my mom to pick them up, and then they followed them home.  That's really creepy.  I don't think my mom reported them, so I'll post a description on here (I'm going to do the same thing in an e-mail to the Virginia State Police).  They were riding in a dark colored jeep, and my mom got a partial license plate: KSK --72.  One of the guys had dark curly hair, sunglasses and an orange shirt on.  No one really got a good look at the other guy. I'm not sure what we're doing today...we did most of the housework yesterday...yes, Jherrica, we did the laundry (once, I wore a skirt because my mom hadn't put away the laundry and I told her so when she asked why, and every time since then that I wear a skirt, I tell her my mom put away the laundry).  I do know that my grandparents are coming over today for dinner...normally I love mac n cheese, but my mom used ordinary cheese, and it doesn't taste very good.   Well I don't have much else to say for now (translation: I want to read the Dave Barry column for today), so I'll leave you with my usual quiz result.  Normally, I don't care for Lord of the Rings, but this quiz result was really cool (and long), so I'm posting it anyway.  Later.    Your ideal Middle-Earth parents are Faramir and Eowyn!  Do you have any idea ho difficult it is to find pictures of your mom and dad together? Thats because Faramir usually holds the camera. Anywho, they are the prince and princess of Ithilien, which will naturally give you some sort of impressive title.  Your uncle omer is the king of Rohan, so when you were little you actually got that pony you asked for.  And a beautiful Mustang on your sixteenth birthday, too!  Considering who your parents are, youll probably be tall and attractive.  Your Middle-Earth mama is Lady Eowyn of Rohan. Shes one of the coolest women in the history of ever!  She faced down the Witch-King of Angmar and his fell beast for her uncle, so you know she will do just about anything to protect you. She will probably teach you to ride a horse and use a sword and spear properly, not to mention letting you visit your uncle Eomer and aunt Lothiriel all the time.  Your Middle-Earth dad is Faramir of Gondor.  He has a lot of official duties, but when he is finished for the day hel will spend quality time with his family.  Faramir is very intelligent, so he can help you with your homework.  If you are rambunctious it will probably remind him of his brother Boromir, so he lets you get away with an awful lot.  Word of advice: don not mention your grandfather Denethor.  Your dad doesnt want to talk about him.  Also, insanity runs in your family. (Maybe you will get lucky)  I hoped you liked my quiz.
