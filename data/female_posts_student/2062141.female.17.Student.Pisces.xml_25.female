I didn't realize how inconvient it is not to be able to go places. What the hell did I do before my license??? See yesterday, we didn't have school right. My sister and my parents went to Bellingham for a Western campus visit (I got out of it). I promised Jeana I'd take her out to lunch because I missed her birthday last week cause I was camping with Caitlin. We went to Old Country Buffet (lol!) which Jeana loves and I'd never been to... Charlotte called me all upset about something so I went over there... but I wasn't needed because Nick was already there, go figure. Me and Josh made plans like three days ago to go to the mall, so I went to his place and we put together his bed (Josh: "It just makes everything a celebration!") then we went to the mall (oh yeah by the way, I told Jeana i was gonna hang at Charlotte's and then get a movie.... weird how that took 4 hours?) But hey she's 11! And I called to make sure she had locked the door. And I don't feel bad cause we had lots of fun. ("Okay he just crossed his legs... he's mine. Sorry Natalie.") Hehehehe.. But yeah I kept getting calls from my mom over and over ("I'm getting a movie!!!") and then when I got home they got home and grounded me because I didn't ask if I could go out. ... Though I'd be SOO much more grounded if they knew that I've been driving people around since like the first day I got my license. It's just not a big deal to me. But yeah so I can't drive til next monday. Which isn't that long, but what am I supposed to do with myself? I mean right now it's 3 in the afternoon and I'm in my pajamas.  But anyway I'm not horrrrribly bummed about it, cause it's just my car... arggh... But I still had fun last night at Charlotte's. We didn't even do anything, we just laughed hilariously at stupid stuff for a few hours and were too tired to finish Groundhog's Day. I spilled chocolate milk on her uncle's bed. Crap. "YOU BLEW TOO HARD, NATALIE!!!" Tonight Charlotte and Nick are coming over and we're gonna watch the Jetsons Movie! Yeaaaah.
