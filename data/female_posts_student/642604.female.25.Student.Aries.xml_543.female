I can't remember the last time I saw your face Or heard your voice Or made you laugh  I can't remember Taking a walk Talking till dawn Writing you a letter  I can't remember Hearing you sing Holding your hand Watching you cry  I can't remember Seeing you drunk You being out of control Hearing you yell  I can't remember Missing you much Thinking I'd never see you again Wondering if you cared  I can't remember Saying goodbye Turning away Letting you go  I can remember Laughing aloud Smiling till it hurt Feeling loved
