I can choose my friends. I can be myself. If they don't like me or our lifestyle then fine. If that's how they're choosing to behave, then there's absolutely nothing I can do about it. No one talks to my mom like that.   I can accept my grandparents for what they are and move on, perhaps een laugh about the ridiculousness of theur so choosen behaviour. I am not going to pretend everything is fine when it is no where close to being fine. I can however put it out of my mind, and when it chooses to come back, I will be ready for the rush of emotional feelings that will follow.   If she calls, I will answer and talk about nothing in general.. smile and nod.. on the phone.. if in fact that is possible..   As for visiting the rest of the family, nana and uma included, I honestly do not see myself ever going back there. Why put myself through that? It's not fun to go there and be glared at. Its not fun to walk into a room, and everyone stops talking. You walk into another room and hear your 'beloved cousins' speaking of no one else but your sister, and why she would ever go into engineering, let alone dye her GPA purple. They simply do not understand.   If they cannot accept the fact that Holly and I are growing up and are living our own seperate lives, then that's their problem. They dont come here ever, so they will have no chance to really get to know us again.   You think you know someone, but you have to realize that when you're that close to them, everything seems normal. But once you move away from it all, you also take a step back and realize.. man this is one fucked up system we have here.   If they choose not to talk to me, then they're the ones who are missing out. I will no longer beat myself up with the question of why. There is no explaination for their chosen behaviour, and I have to admit I will never understand what's behind it all. I now have to fill my life again, and also fill the now empty voids my family and my grandparents have created with friends, my parents, holly, marilyn and bill, and most importantly uncle ken and aunt joan. i can't explain how happy and greatful i am that they moved here. they're more like grandparents to me than nana and uma have ever been.   I am moving on. With or without nan. It's that simple.   I am moving on.
