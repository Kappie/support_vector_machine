The rain pounded on the rooftop next door and I watched it for a few minutes as it died down. I wanted so badly to run outside in my pajamas that I'm wearing right now and just stand alone, bare-footed, in the rain. I longed for the feeling of the raindrops on my face and soaking me. I hadn't felt that since the last time I was outside with Moses in the rain. It felt so good. I see the dark clouds clearing ever so slowly and the rain has stopped. It looks so depressing outside. Like something out of an Evanescence song.   Speaking of that, I wanted to go to an Evanescence  Three Days Grace concert on July 18 in the Molson Amphitheatre downtown. For Priss, Tiff, and my birthday. Hopefully Nima will get to come. Dunno... he might be in Montreal, Cali, or camping. I hope he could come though cos I know he loves rock. I forgot to ask Will... I want him to come too. I hope he won't be busy. He's a really cool guy. I was feeling kinda down 'cos of looking outside and I took a nap but after talking to him on MSN I felt a lot better. Thanks Will. :)  Thinking of this, I just realized that I took so many things that GOD has given me for granted. Like what I just saw outside... or my friends... and family... So many things. Freedom is one of them. The freedom to feel what I wanted. The freedom to think what I wanted. The freedom to say what I wanted. All these things I took for granted. I took Erica for granted. She's my best friend and she's always been there for me... through thick or thin. I took Nima for granted a little... I've been so sensitive about the littlest things. I took so many of my friends for granted... I realized how much I loved each and every single one of them. But most of all,  I've taken God for granted.  I was so wrong to have done that... He's done so much for me yet I took it all for granted. I've ditched Him too many times for my own selfish reasons. Please pray for me y'all who are reading this. I can't do anything without GOD and I've taken so much of HIS credit... THANK YOU LORD... for making all of us so beautiful... because every piece of work that YOU've done... is beautiful.  The clouds are really clearing up now... I see a litle bit of sunlight and some white clouds instead of grey... do you know this makes me think of? Sin. That 5 minute storm was our sinning and now the light overcoming the darkness from the storm is God's mercy and grace. This is so beautiful. Can't ever forget it.
