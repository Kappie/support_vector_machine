Like how when i write/complain about Emily its a violation of her privacy...cept i dont care as much cause shes waved most rights already by willingly befriending me and continuing to asosciate with me, despite my annoyingness and other less enjoyable qualities. But anyway, my point: Andrew = new friend. Emily = old friend. New friends are easier to scare, piss-off, freak out, and lose than old friends. They arent used to you yet and theres not as much unconditional trust, you know? Not that this is a big deal, whether i explain about Andrew, but im just justifying the lack of information.  Ill just do it shortly: This week has been amusing because i found out a foilist from Marian Central has a crush on me and hes been talking to me onlin3. He's nice. funny, actually.  not saying anything beyond that. not to you. you public, you. if you want to know, ask me.  talked to emily yesterday. was happy. good thing, too, cause if she hadnt gotten online i mightve had to be serious on her today and complain and look sad. which wouldntve gone well cause there wasnt time to talk in english, as it turns out.  ive been discovering this week and last what its like to unwittingly be too forceful with people you love dearly and would never, ever, ever want to hurt. I never really believed it...you know, like in books and stuff... when the man is so frustrated with things hes just squeezes a little to hard and the wifes like "let go of me!" and hes like "i didnt mea-im sorry, i dont know whats wrong with me" you know what im talking about? yeah, i always thought that was weird, but.... man, its true. Sometimes when you get passionate about something, and youre so frustrated and theres so much intense emotion bound up in it and you care so much about something, not knowing what to do or feeling helpless or unwanted or something, it can really make you be more physically violent than normal, even to people you would never want to hurt. and im not talkign when youre mad at the person and youre trying to contain your anger, i just mean...if youre mad at a situation or at the fact that you cant change something so incredibly important thats ruining everything. So yeah. I pulled emily sweatshirt harder than i should have and i did some crazy shaking gesture last week that was totally uncalled for. No, i didnt hurt anybody or anything real like that. These are just small things and i realize a second later "Whoa, what the hell am i doing?" and you know what caused both of those? caitlin's talk of friends changing too much...and my fear of my friends changing... and then emily saying she thinks aim is a waste of time...implying that shes not going to get online very often anymore. so when the hell am i going to talk to her!?!? never! thats when. huzzah.   but anyway. im not a violent kid, i swear. sometimes you build up so much frustration and so much intensity and passionte emotion and stuff... it comes out in ways you would rather it not. story over.  i imagined graduation again today... dont know what makes me think about that. i decided i want my friends to write me letters--real, physical letters-- once were all in college and stuff. I mean, maybe not  all  my friends, but the really good ones. Because letters are cool cause you can keep them and reread them later and stuff.   hmm...what else to say? i have a crazy euro test tomorrow that i dont want to take. but its an activity period. so 40 fabulous minutes to get yelled at to stop distracting emily from her physics homework. i have hope.  and assembly friday! huzzah for wastes of time!  and yay for no more fencing and free time for amanda!  nothing else to say. 'cept that i want to learn random things to tell emily to tell her frenchie. cause im weird like that. oh well. maybe ill get lany to help me in english.   oh, and if i ever do end up falling for this andrew character, i decided i will write "Andrew Shirman rocks my socks!!!" on my profile. sexy? definitely.  weird out of context comment of the day: amasochisticsock: there are only so many inappropriate things you can do with a banana
