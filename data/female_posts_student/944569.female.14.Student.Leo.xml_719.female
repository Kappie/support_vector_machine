It had been one week since she lost her voice.  Tears stinged the back of her eyes as she recalled the times she had spent alone in a prairie near her home, singing her heart out and telling the world how she felt.  Music had been like oxygen to her.  She could never live without it.  When she sang, everything else was of no importance.  She let her heart choose notes and words as she wove a story with her tongue.  Her voice soared to the highest notes effortlessly.  She had been so happy.  That little prairie was her world.  She whimpered lightly as she pulled the coat tighter around her body.  Shivering, she wiped her eyes with the back of her hand.  She felt something wet.  Was it melted snow or tears?  She did not care.  She sat down on a bench.  Daemon would be here soon.  She could not afford to let him see her like this.  They had been best friends since grade one.  She smiled as she remembered how they had met.  She was ready.
