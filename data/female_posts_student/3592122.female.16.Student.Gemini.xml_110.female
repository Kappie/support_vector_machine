(i know im weird, lets not remind me lol) well anyways i got it out by writing somehorrible poem that just popped in my head, its defintley not beautifull or anything but i know im not a poet or anything so i dont really care if its not good!     wellwe went to johnny carinos today(one of my favoriteresturants) for my moms Birthday its tommorow but we decided to go out to eat today! i ordered the low fat lemon rosemary chicken!! its was good, like everything ive tried there! but the low fat part was ruined because of the desert, it was good but i really need to stop eating so much junk food, not that im saying im fat, which everyone assumes im implyingwhen i say that, but its not cause i think im fat its simply because im unhealty, and i want to get in a habit of eating healthy and excercising! its as simple as that! it really irriatates me that my family forces me to eat food that i dont want to, they know im trying to get into a healthy habit but i guess they just assume im just trying to lose wait! grr... there so stubborn! hmm... well me and my sister are planning on going to astroworld tuesday....not sure if we will but we want to go 2 in 2, she asked "who are you going to bring?" my reply "good question" lol its not the promblem of who i can bring, i can think of alot of people to go with, but the question is who would i have fun with?!so i asked my sister if she had any friends she wanted to bring so she mentioned jerry...to updateyou, jerry is a guy that i menttwice once lastyear we stopped byhis house for like 10 minutes to say hi to my sisters best friend (greg) alsoknown as my unrelatedbrother, and the second time was i think last week we went over to gregs houseand my sisterbasically dropped my off with greg, jerry and justin (justin was1 of my ex crushes/and i was one of his, and we might be together at this moment if either of us had known we liked each other at the same time) my sis went with dontae's to hishouse for whatever reason and me and jerry kept me occupied by making conversation with me and he kept staring at me (a bit odd but whatever) and wejust keptlaughinand ofcourse he kept saying shit to impress me (guys just to let you know its annoying, dont try to impress, just be yourself seriously!!)anddoin all that flirty shit but it was cute! but yeah i dont know i dont really want it to be a first date thing... were its like the flirting and the whole get to know you conversation, but i might take my sister up on that idea, might be good for me,kinda get me moving past my previousdilema with endrew..whom if youd read this blogfrom the beggining you would have read about but ive deleted his post since then, i think i might give it atry, i guess ill justsee what happen's!
