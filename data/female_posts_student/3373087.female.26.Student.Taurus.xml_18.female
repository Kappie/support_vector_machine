Why can't girls just pee in a bag like guys can? I don't know any guys who actually do that, but still, they have the OPTION of peeing in a bag whereas girls don't.  Well, I guess girls can technically do anything, but it would be a whole lot messier if girls tried do that.  Sometimes I feel like God gave girls the short end of the stick when it comes to our bodies.  Just think:   1) Monthly cramps and mood swings 2) Weaker upper body strength 3) Inability to pee in a bag 4) Having to push something the size of a watermelon through a hole the size of a walnut...   Well, to think on the bright side,  1) Boys smell and they sweat, girls don't (unless they have a sebaceous cyst) 2) Girls don't have cooties 3) Girls can tell a boy to lift something heavy and they can't say "no". 4) You can kick a girl in the crotch and it won't hurt that bad  After all the rhetoric, I still have to pee.
