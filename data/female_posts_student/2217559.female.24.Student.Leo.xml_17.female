(I know but I won't share that info here). I think I will share some of my funniest times with Paddy:  1. The Missing Bevo - Paddy had a litt e plastic bevo stuck on the side of his cube during the entire he worked with me at ECI. One day, Bevo was mysterious gone. Paddy began getting Polaroid photos of his Bevo in different places around our office, building and parking lot. Bevo was seen dangling from our balcony, laying in the grass by our company sign, wearing an A sweater, stuck in the FedEx drop box - it was just awful.  Every few hours another picture would surface on his desk.  This was probably the most I have laughe din a long time. Finally paddy made Xerox copies of dollar bills and paid the ransom to get his bevo back. Everyone in the office was privy to this game of steal the bevo from Paddy. It was great.  2. The UT/Oklahoma Game - Lisa and I went to Paddy's house to watch the game in his huge living with his huge TV and eat his mother's food. We get there and Paddy is so nervous about the game that he can't even sit down. He was just pacing the floor.  It was so funny. I got to see Paddy in his home environment (which I had never seen before).  I got to hear the google noises he makes for his dogs. It was really funny. When UT got the crap beat out of them (was it 65-13??), paddy was devastated - although - I must say, his mom was in more disgust than Paddy. She was just over it! Completely over it. I laughed so hard.  Anyway, paddy rocks and I am going to miss him.  He can't get on my ship though. Because then I would kill him.  I can just see it now, "Shelly, can you get me this? Shelly, I need you to pick up some of this." Blah blaah blah blah...
