She brought me a teddy bear that we named Howard and Abby-made chocolate chip cookies.  Yum!  Yall, I think i'm getting better so if you want to come visit me, just drop on by.  I'm not contagious unless you drink after me or kiss me ( ha hahahaha!!!!)  Yeah, like any of yall would do that.  Anyway, tomorrow I'm going to call Josh and figure all this out.  I probably owe him an apology.  Note:  I'm not good with those.  So, I'll see yall later.
