It probably won't mean anything to you if you aren't into ballet, but people do seem to be familiar with  The Nutcracker , if nothing else, for it's holiday tradition and charm.  This article provides a very nostalgic look at a very nostalgic ballet for a very nostalgic season.   FYI:  If you only read four people from the  Times , these should be the four:   urlLink A.O. Scott  (movies), Jennifer Dunning (dance), Linda Greenhouse (Supreme Court), and  urlLink David Brooks  (opinion).  You need a good sports reporter too, but you'll have to go elsewhere to find one.
