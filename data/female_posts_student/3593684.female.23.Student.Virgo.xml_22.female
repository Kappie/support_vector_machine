I am still nervous as hell.  Wanting to die every time I have to give a practice cross-examination, or be a mock-witness.    Added to that stress is my memo.  My precious 13 page memo that was reduced to a 8 page overview.  Yes, yes, only five pages cut.  But try doing that to something you've worked weeks on.   Maybe it was because I was tired (I did stay out until 3 the night before).  Maybe it was because I had low-blood sugar (only ate two slices of pizza all day).  Maybe I am just depressed (like  urlLink sev  aks, where do buy serotonin?).  Or maybe I am just an overdramatic cry-baby.  But for whatever reason I was crying in my office.    So I packed up my things, went out to my car, put the top down and started driving.  But not very fast or very far.  Traffic was unusually heavy.  As I sat at the stoplight before the freeway the homeless man who is always there came up to my car.  I didn't give him anything.  And then the guilt set in.  You see, I don't like homeless people.  That may sound cruel or horrible, but I suspect it's a common sentiment.  You see the problem with homeless people (now hear me out before you get offended) the problem with homeless people, and I am talking about the chroniclly homeless ones, the problem with homeless people (aside from the fact that they are usually unattractive, unhygenic, often drunk and/or high, mentally off-kilter and smelly) is that they ask us for money.  And unless you are really cold, really unsympathetic or really stupid, that should make you feel guilty.    So there I was, sitting in my cherry red convertible (it's not an expensive car, but it runs and it looks good), having just come from my posh job (that pays 2400 a week), with my posh education (one of the finest law schools in the nation) and I am crying because my mock-trial makes me nervous, and my memo wasn't perfect, and Mr. david hadn't called in two weeks.  And this homeless man, who is there every day of the week, asks me for money and I turn him down. And then I feel guilty.  Because I have everything and he has nothing.  And it's just dumb luck that it turned out that way.  I have everything and he has nothing and he could have just as well have been I, and I he.  And then I started feeling angry.  Angry that I felt guilty.  Because after all, I still have problems too.  It's not like money solves every thing.  It's not like just because you aren't in a really shitty situation that you have no right to feel bad at anything.   And then I started feeling guilty for being angry at the homeless man who made me feel guilty.  See, this is why I don't like homeless people.  Damn it. they make me reflect on the good things when I just want to sulk.  Luckily the light turned green and I drove away.  But not very far and not very fast.  Traffic jammed up again.  This time it was a three car accident. Two girls were standing on the side of the road crying.  And then I felt even worse about feeling bad.  Because, hey, that could have been me too.  And at least my car is working.    Traffic eventually cleared, it gave me time though to work myself back into my melencholy state.  And I drove on.  But not very far and not very fast.  Traffic slowed down to ten miles and hour.  People were doing weird things up ahead, weaving around some object on the road.  It was a very large rodent (perhaps a rodent of unusually large size?)  Seriously, as big as a big fat cat.  It's tail had been managled and it stood rigidly frozen right smack in the middle of a four lane freeway, it's teeth bared at every passing car.  For now, people were managing to avoid hitting it.  But I knew that soon enough some cruel asshole would (trying to show off to his friends, or just to busy to be bothered) would run the creature over.  And I actually felt a great deal of sympathy for the animal's plight.  Probably more so than I had felt for the homeless man's.  And once again I felt guilty about feeling so down.  then to top it all off:  My brother called to tell me he loved me Shahin called (I ignored him) Jack called (returning my phone call) And David called (he said he missed me)  So I have people who love me, care about me, like me.  So you see my life is perfect.  So fucking perfect.  So could some please explain to me why I feel like shit all the time?  ------------------
