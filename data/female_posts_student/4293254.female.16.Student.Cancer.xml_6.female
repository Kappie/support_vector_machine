Well at 4pm I headed over to my mom's work and about 5 mins later headed over to Carrboro for my writing class. I was late for my writing class by about 20 mins. as usual. After the class ended around 6pm I had to wait around for an hour. During that hour I was learning or rather attempting to learn how to hemp... geez I suck at hemping. Sorry John, I had a cool idea for a new bracelet for you too... That's another thing, I was thinking alot today about how it turned out I wasn't going to be able to go to game night right after I promised John S. I'd come. My mom is having issues though right now with what John and I had talked about. Hmmm.... Anywho .... I'm really tired and I have to go to school again tomorrow to continue working and organizing the newspaper stuff so I better go to bed... hehehe GO TO BED... With who?? no one :( lol love,Nikki
