He really liked this, and so did I. My daughter found it too lemony for her taste. She likes her desserts sweeter than I do. I used a generous amount of blueberries in this recipe because I was lucky enough to have a large container of them on hand. This produced ample sauce, which I later realized, would have been lovely over a big scoop of non-dairy vanilla ice cream.   I will have to remember that next time!
