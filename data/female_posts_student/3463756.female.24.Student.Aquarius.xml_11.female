Life with K continues pretty much the same with the fighting, the making up and the adjusting that is required of two people who live together and who are so different in their tastes and lifestyles.  and now we have K's Bro-in-Law. Technically he is not his in-law as yet, may never be if things go the way they do with the legal system being what it is and all that. But my bro-in-law (well he might be,I don't know but it seems simpler to call him that for now)and his 'partner' were to be here for summer for a month. Instead sus couldnt come and just P came by. It was kind of awkward to begin with. Truth be told it still is to some extent. After all, being an Indian and not having dealt with someone so at ease with his sexuality its a little different and difficult especially when said person and I are the only ones at home most of the time. so with K working and me at home playing Suzy Homemaker,and P helping me out, I really don't know where I am headed. Life seems kind of hazy at the moment. As if the heat is making all reality shimmer somewhat. Maybe I should blog more about this. I know this cannot be the most clear thing I have ever written.
