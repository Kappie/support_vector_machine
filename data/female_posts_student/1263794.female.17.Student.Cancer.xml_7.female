A lot of people like this just annoy me, but he doesn't flaunt it and is just a really admirable person. I hope when I grow up I can be somewhat like that. This man has always liked me as a person, and has always told my parents he wanted his daughter, which has always been like a little sister to me, to be like me. Coming from him I find this to be a huge compliment but tonight while leaving, he kept telling me to "be good" and was acting like I was some rebellious teen. I found this strange seeing as how I AM the "good child". I thought about it and I realized it was probably because I started fighting with my sister in the middle of dinner, and since she's "pregnant" everythings automatically my fault. I've realized the only time I ever appear to be "bad" is when I'm with my sister. I turn into such a smartass with her, and I cuss a lot more than I normally do, and I admit it I can be a real bitch with her, but she deserves it all. I never start anything, it's all her. As if I didn't like her enough before, I have realized tonight that she even ruins my image.   Anyways back to my neighbor. He is one of the only people I know that actually amazes me with brilliance and makes me want to learn. I mean there are tons of smart people but he just seems to have this understanding of everything and makes it so intriguing. He's fascinated with the littlest thing and turns them into somthing truly amazing. I find myself just fixated on what he's saying, and just wishing I knew as much as he did. He knows all these nitty gritty details as well which is so cool. His musical knowledge really impresses me. He can tell you the artist of anything,  from any time period, and everything about them. I swear a song comes on and he knows the artists death date, how he died, where, when, where they went to school, everything. It's really cool.   The point here is this whole thing really just made me realize how important it is to have a good understanding of the world at large. It also made me realize how ignorant some people are. It actually made me WANT to pay attention in class. It's amazing how the best teachers really aren't teachers at all.
