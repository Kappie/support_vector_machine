I'm getting kinda attatched to them, i was sitting on the grass with Ying and having a good old chat with her, and I'm sure she was listening to me! She does what Russell does and sits there looking at me strangely and twitching her nose! Awww!!! But it was scary cos the neighbour's cat was trying toget into their run!!! and they were skeaking and they were really scared! AWWW!!! But I came to the rescue and the cat ran away. Ha! I had erm, lots of fun cleaning them out this morning, you would not believe how many poos they do!
