I went with my all time subway standby: the subway melt with provolone, lettuce, cucumber, honey mustard,  and of course extra bacon .    After having a gabfest, I protested coming over to his place for a back massage. But moments after I was home, I saw the error of my ways and thought  "hey, that back massage may really help my geography project".  And so here I am, still working on the damned geography project. The victory, however small it might be, is mine.
