With a name like Faulkner, I thought he'd be from somewhere European or at least New England. It's simply a mindset, and a terrible one. I discovered that I really don't know anything about the southern region of our country, because I really didn't think any literary lights would emerge from a place like Mississippi.  Oh, I am horrible.  But now I really want to read this Faulkner, the "greatest twentieth century writer of fiction." And the time period's just about right, so would I study him this summer in modernism and postmodernism?   Back to work.
