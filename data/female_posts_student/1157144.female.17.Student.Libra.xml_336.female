So.. everyone come and visit me or soemthing? pretty, beautiful, gorgeous please?  Also! Friday, Laura Kassovic was (hopefully) going to take some of us a) shoe and garter shopping and b) to the cowboy bebop movie!! I know at least Maggie, Valerie, Billy, and I think Jessica were interested, but I don't know about availability. If y'all wanna go, let's, yes! Whee....i'm excited!  Tomorrow, it being Thursday: If you are really really bored or something, you should go to the Leigh fashion show, at their school, at 7. It helps their senior class and stuff.. and Brian and Conor are modeling the clothes... so we get to make fun of them onstage. =) Anyone want to go, if you do let me know becuase I can get 50% off tickets from my boyfriend. whoppe i suppose. By the way, in case you were thinking this was some serious fashion show thing, umm it's not, cause they are just models to make fun of it, and i suppose that's exactly how it will be. Heh, who knows.  LET ME KNOW... about all things mentioned. danka!
