That helped a bit. It's too stinking hot out.       Well I'd best break into the serious writing issues music. Ahhhh. Blogging always makes me feel better becasue I always know what to say. heck it's like a journal. If you have nothing to say make it up. I have yet tohave todo that. Still writing writing is so much harder, you have to creat these little worlds and then stay consistant with them, it's hard. Well I love it anyways.       My parents are probably going to be home soon so I'd best be going. Why should that matter. Becasue I'm half naked duh!
