I even brought home a piece of corgi fur and I put it in a bagto be worshippedby me!I'mnotobsessed. o.o Okee, maybe I am. I took lots of pictures, I might put them up here, when we get them developed. I got to play with corgis at the show, one of them really liked being scratched behind the ear. I'd scratch her ear andher head would tilt and her tongue would loll to the side... SO KYOOT!I can't wait! My puppy is due in one to two weeks!! ^___^ I'm so HAPPY!
