I am propelled forward, I am no longer in control  I can't hide. you wait, silently, until my patience is found. Quietly watching  waiting until I come back around. how long will it be until I can finally feel regret? wishing that you  this moment were something I could forget. I am distracted by a place where I can escape my own head where I can look away from you,  erase all the things you said. It beckons me, to chase after, enticing me to stay. but everything looses its luster  I would never be content anyway. I wish to be surround by wild flowers, the sea  the moon. But most of all God, sometimes I just want to go home. So often I sit alone  watch these moments slip by, nothing really matters to me anymore,  again I start to cry. my eyes  senses could never fully appreciate the beauty that surrounds me. If I could just let go of all of these vices  fears, I might just be free. But freedom is not something you can really loose, or find. Its something that is always with us, it resides inside of our mind.
