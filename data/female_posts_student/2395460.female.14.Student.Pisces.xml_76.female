If it's employees you want to track, you can use  urlLink Nextel's Mobile Locator .  You can also track pets with a  urlLink dog GPS collar , which could be very useful since most dogs don't have cell phones yet.   The locator services are different from the  urlLink Telenav  service which provides audio and visual turn-by-turn navigation through Nextel phones. If you want a full-featured Telenav enabled phone, you might want to wait for the new 7520 Blackberry phone, due in the fall.  Related Links:   urlLink Korean Kiddie Tracking
