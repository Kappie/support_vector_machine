I woke up this morning and I felt all shaky and I could hardly walk. But I figure once my body gets adjusted to ketosis, then I shouldn't have that problem.  I haven't been doing much lately. I've been lazy...really lazy. I'm sort of on this mission to recreate myself. Mentally, physically and emotionally. It's a project that I hope I'm able to accomplish.   I HATE FAKES.   Keep it real, crazies.
