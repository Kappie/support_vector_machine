When school starts come mid-august, I guarndamntee that I shall not be posting as much. I will end up tired and stressed and hating teachers all over again with my "undoubtly" luck, I'll get the worse. Currently I'm watching 1 life 2 live. Its hillarious. Gotta love when the blonds get into a cat fight. and then this HUGE, HUGE mob story.
