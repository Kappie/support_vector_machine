I really struggled to get out of bed this morning and I am pretty sure that I did finally roll out because I have a meeting later today. It's not a required meeting for me, but I was told that "it would be nice" if I attended. So, I'm caving.  Did not have too much of an opportunity to watch the entire convention last night. As I mentioned before, my mother spent much of her cheer-up time yesterday talking about politics. She was so excited about Obama and Sharpton, I felt like I had to see the two in action. I have been following Obama's campaign in Illinois, so I know a lot about him and his views. And Sharpton, well... he's Sharpton. But a pizza party, complete with margaritas and poolside chats kind of eclipsed the DNC event.  Good. I have the opportunity to listen to some West African French.  Attends! Je viens. Snicker.
