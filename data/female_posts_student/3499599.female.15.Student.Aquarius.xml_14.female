One of the few left =p The first movie was "13 Going On 30" at 9..which my mom thought it was starting at 7..we still went, though. That movie was okay..it was cute..and all sweet 'n stuff..with just all..cute-humor and stuff..ok can't really explain it.   But the movie I really wanted to see was "Mean Girls"..ok still dunno if quotations are right for movies or italicization so just..enh. Mean Girls was really good ^_^ Really funny. The best part was at the beginning, when whats-her-name described homeschooled kids and there were those kids sitting on a tractor, explaining parts of religion and..yeah..ok that was just the best. There were a lot of really good jokes. I laughed...a lot =p  So.  Like I said..some other time..I go to tennis camp..well, today. I leave around 2:30..and..will be back home sometime this coming Saturday. I think. And then I go to journalism camp. And..yeah. Ok. Busy week. Er, busy week(s).   I'm looking forward to tennis camp ^_^ I just got new Rook cards since I lost my old deck..and a new deck of normal cards..one of the best things about camp is that everyone knows a lot of card games..well, normally. And we just play cards..a lot. Yaaaay.  Well, we all need something like that to just..have fun and play around. Considering we play about four/five hours of tennis every day..enh x.x;   It looks like it's supposed to rain a lot this week in Woolwine...heheh..Woolwine, Virginia is where the camp is at. If it rains a lot, that means we'll probably play on the indoor court or go see a movie or go bowling or go to the skating rink or..well..we have a lot of options. The great city of Martinsville is close by the camp, so we have plenty of stuff to do =p  Ok..since  urlLink Jeremy  is a "cute but psycho" happy bunny and  urlLink Jacob  is a "kiss my ass" happy bunny..I had to find out what I was..so..I am..     you are the "I hate you so bad" happy bunny. You hate everyone and eveything and your not ashamed of it.     urlLink   which happy bunny are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Whoo hoo.  Ok. I really need to finish packing now >  Arrivederci...Adi√≥s...Vaarwel...Au revoir...Auf Wiedersehen...etc. ^_^
