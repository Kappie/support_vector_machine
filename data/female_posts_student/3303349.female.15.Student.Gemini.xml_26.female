Anyway...yesterday was the last doy of my freshman year (Reminds me that I should probably change my profile)...oh how sad...Anyway, it was very eventful...we basically did nothing in all of my classes which was so amusing, I actually enjoyed my science class because there was food and I knew I would never have to go back there again!!! Then Tony, my stalker, called me from a pay phone...it would be really stalkerish but I gave him my number...it's all my fault...oh well, he actually was remotely sane most of the time...Now I am in Kalispel and my brother's team lost his games in the tournament...so sad and then there was a thunderstorm. Yeah...I am amused...I am not actually trying out for all state band after all...it is stressing me out way too much...And drivers ed starts on Monday!!! Yeah well I have yet again run out of things to say so...good bye people!!!
