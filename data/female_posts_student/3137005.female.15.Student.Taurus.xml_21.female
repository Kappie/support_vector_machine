Lovely man, French Canadian, a friend of the family. Tries to teach me Morse every time I see him. Very shy, kinda like my grandad but about 10 years younger. Can speak like a billion different languages. Lives in Coventry. And we've just heard that he's got mugged on the way back from asda, for like his wallet, which had about £20. They put him in hospital for like a month! A month! and he still needs checkups, coz he can't walk right. They damn nearly killed him for £20!!!!!!!!! And he's such a nice man!!!! They've found them and are charging them for attempted murder, that's how much they beat him up! Some people just make me sick! Bloody communists!!!   All for now, coz I'm too mad! Dani
