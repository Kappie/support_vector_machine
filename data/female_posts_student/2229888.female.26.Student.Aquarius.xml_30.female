I feel ok, but my throat is hurting a little and i woke with a   fever blister on my upper lip  . . . i am going to do something i hate and that my mom is always trying to convince me to do . . . i am going to gargle warm salt water . . . it's a great way to cure a sore throat, but i am usually adamently against it . . .    you know what's funny??? I even talk alot when i'm not talking . . . geez . . . i might wear out your poor, little ears . . .lol . .    i've been working on a new life time work type novel . . .it's about my bros and sis and i. You know a little about our lives, but not much . . .trust me this will a thereputic endeavor . . . i am calling it The Chick-a-dee Club . . .   i've begun by writing sporadically . . .different memories here and there. bro and sis are going to sift through and help me arrange the dates and events, correct my mistakes, add some of the things they remember, then i am going to take the little scrap book of memories we create and piece together a 4 person biography . . . cool, huh?   I hope telling you all the stuff i throw on you isn't a burden to you . . . it just helps to say stuff sometimes . . .  my mom and i had a huge arguement yesterday . . . she's decided to bring her guy over for the weekend .  we have a big problem with this because mom and dad just broke up a month ago and we're still trying to deal with everything.   we don't have a problem with her dating, but we told her from the beginning that we would be uncomfortable with her bringing guys home, just as we would if dad brought girls home . . .   we are already plannning to get our own place once dad moves out . . . that's a good thing. we are too old to live at home anyway . . . lol  as soon as i get my contacts i am going to get a new job . . . i might work at waffle house again until i find something else . . anyway, i am going to save money for sis and i . . .
