Then again, I could cut down on the me-time and not read, watch T.V. or go on the internet, post a blog and whinge about my life like an ungrateful brat. Which, by the way, I hope I am not. On the upside, BATS has become considerably more enjoyable now that there is an extra element involved. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy it before, but Adam sort of makes it a little more interesting. Last night was lots of fun. To raise money to support our little theatrical company, BATS organises a pizza night for the cast and this consequently leads to a party which means lots of dancing and laughing to songs that everyone knows. Even if you don't know the songs you dance, and I had an absolute ball. However, I am also starting to notice a downside to BATS, and that is the dire effect the makeup is having on my already less-than-perfect skin. -sigh- Oh well, the prices we pay, hey? In other news, I started exams two days ago. I think I have passed them all, and my Indonesian exam I think went particularly well. I had to write an essay, and the topic I chose was a letter of complaint to an imaginary hotel manager. (My mother said, 'Complaining? But you're terrible at complaining.' I guess sarcasm is below nobody.) I called the hotel, Hotel Bau, which means smelly hotel in English. I went on to talk about certain things that were amiss, and then as a flourish put in a part about me trying to contact the staff by ringing room service, the manager, the reception with no decent answer except for reception finally ringing me back, but only to ask me to stop ringing people. My amount of study has been quite negligible, and yesterday instead of studying the format for a commentary I had to do for my English exam I wrote Cedrik (ooh, a new character in the plot...more about him another day) a 500 word CAS essay. He thinks he owes me like 100 favours, and he's probably right. I do indulge him more than I should perhaps, but he's one of my closest friends, if not my closest, and I don't care about who owes whom. Anyway, he has an essay, so I don't have to worry about him failing the CAS component for the moment. Anyway, I should probably go study...or at least find something to do that is closer to study than this. Later.
