Today was his birthday so my mama and I went over to the mall when he got home...I realized why I don't go to the Sherwood mall very much...We pulled up and the creepiest guy was parked next to us!!! HE LOOKED LIKE A CLONE OF MICHAEL JACKSON!!! ahh!! Not when he was cute and black...but when as he is now...white and ugly! BLAH!! haha!! But other than that Champ's is one of the greatest stores ever!! haha! I love their shoes and their headbands and socks!!!! Haha (you know we ghetto Ü)   YAY ANDY'S COMING HOME TONITE!!! HOORAY!!!!!!!!!!! I am so0o0o excited!!! I think he is just coming home for like two days but I love when he comes home!! He is awesome..I think I have more fun with him cuz he is so far apart in age from me and I don't have to live with him everyday!! haha!! I'm excited about that! I think tomorrow he actually wants to see the house we are moving into...he hasn't seen it yet so I think it would be nice if he actually saw it!! haha!!   Okay well today was a pretty good day except for the fact that the people who are buying our house...their realator (who...I'm not trying to be mean...but doesn't know how to put on eye makeup...she looked like a CLOWN)..and the home inspector were here for 3 hours!!!!!!!!!!!! IT WAS CRAZY!!!!!! And then Maxo came over and he didnt know they were here cuz they were in the back of the house and we were in the front and he was like yelling at us from the bathroom that we didnt have toilet paper and the people were like WHAT?!? it was pretty funny!!!!!   Oh well....my brother is coming home in awhile...he just called and said he was on the road and wants Dave Wongs (but of course my mommy wont get it for him cuz  hes a big boy  lol)...and two of my mom's friends are over to visit scooter...they are so0o0o funny!!!  Call me later tonite on my celly (if you want to)...xoxo Ü
