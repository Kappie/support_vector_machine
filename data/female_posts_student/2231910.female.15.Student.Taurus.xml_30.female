But come on,15yrs old is still consider 'a small kid'.I remember the last time i went shopping with my dad and mum, i ask them to buy me a milk-bottle.Hahaha.. tat bottle is damn cute ok.And i love it!!Hmmm... faezah say my layout is nice,of cos why not i am the one who choose it.Hahaha.. fine,i sure pple will say i am thick-skinn while they are reading this.I had watched SpongeBobSquarePants 4 times just now.Cool... I like the way how SpongeBob laugh it is so lame and funny.Tonight i am going to watch the Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets at HBO!I noe this is lame but i just wants to say out.*smile
