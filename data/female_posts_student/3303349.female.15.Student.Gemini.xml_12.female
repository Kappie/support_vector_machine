And Sarah said that she thought there was something between us...which I can't all together deny...and that we flirted with each other alot. Then she decided we were going out. (For the record we aren't). Then he misunderstood something I said and wrote "I like our relationship" and then that just set everyone off. So they are all convinced that I'm going out with him but I'm not because it is a long complicated story. (Which will also be revealed one day!)  Moving on...I only messed up once n my solo today and Jen wasn't in band so I was really happy! Then I got a 94 on my history test. So today was insanely good. Now I have to go to Helena for the weekend because my brother has a soccer tournament. Humm...more soccer moms and 12 year old boys...how fun. Au revoir! Deux merci c'est vendredi!!!!
