(sorry to confuse you if you read this but i understand what i mean.)   im going to tell you some big highlights:  1.) Haley and Nathan got  MARRIED!   2.) Ravens lose their season championship game for basketball 3.) Dan has a heart attack and then the whole niki thing that was awesome!  Wow! those were some big twists and turns they were so awesome! i cant wait til next season.
