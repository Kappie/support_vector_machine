Passers by only see a wisp of smoke rising from the chimney and continue on their way." --Vincent van Gogh  There aren't many things I regret in life, most of the one's I do, were just plain old carelessness. I usually hold other's feelings at a high point and try my damned-ist not to make anyone hurt intentionally. But things happen in this lawless universe. But perhaps things happen for a reason; that would be the way of the Optimist to view things, but some of us less loyal Susie Sunshines approve more directly the Gloomy Gus school of thought that "It could have happened and what if" scenarios. I tend not to ask too much of what could have been, but at times I feel the pull of curiosity, "what if I took the long way home that night?" But what purpose does it really serve? It won't change anything. Just like an armchair enthusiast criticizing the plays when he refuses to partake. who am I to be selfish enough to end one thing and get upset when the other is more content. For example, I may quit my job and speak to someone who still works there, and find out business is going well. I can't curse them for enjoying their job when I voluntarily left! But this is the problem of being human. We are fascinating creatures but our fancies change a little too quickly from time to time. We have no one/thing to blame but ourselves, unfortunately. Especially speaking existentially; what ever fortune or misfortune is brought on by your own hands. No one is given a great hand, you merely must make the best of it and hope for the best and prepare for the worst. But, for what its worth, Love comes quickly, but it seldom leaves abruptly.   Ok, now lame commentary. The more I write on here the more I realize my life is quite uneventful. No offense Rob... but I don't have floods of goings on.. except Rob and the "teaching me of facts not on the IQ test"... which makes me shutter, and my stupid accounting class that makes me respect my CPA a lot more now. Let's see if I can not make Rob upset with my retardedness.... he is super silly. Well, anyone to put up with my bizarreness should get an island... Here I declared it!!! Send me your requests and I will see what me and my eccentric brain can do!!! Arrivederci!!
