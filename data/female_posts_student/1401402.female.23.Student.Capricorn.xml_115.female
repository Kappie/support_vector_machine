The ghetto thing was that we didnt have a chaser, so we had to chase it with a tangerin. That was so unfullfilling.  After three whole shot i was good to go. Once we enter the club found more friends then, had two more shots. Dance alittle, i took two more shot.   By this time i'm having so much fun, i didnt really car who's there and who's not there anymore. i got my groove on and shake my ass like i've never have before. i was dancing with so many hot girls that wasnt my friends. then they had to bounce, i was like oh man, and i didnt even get any numbers. lol.   Spotted my crew, drank some more, this time i had two sex on the beach. I didnt know how this happen but i was dancing with the girls and than they took off but Linda, she asked me to dance with her cousin. i think his name was Twan, his pretty cute.  at first i was like  eh, i dont want to dance with any guys. Just to be nice since he bought me so many drinks. Dancing with him was really fun. i enjoy myself from the inside out. maybe because i didnt really care because i was so drunk by this time.    After danicng with Twan for Two whole hours, I had to pee, its already two but i dont want to leave. After that, before i can even get out of the stall i started to feel everything in my throat. i was hogging the toilet quite some time. I couldnt stop yeaking. Then, i started to cry, Linda came in, i was talking to her telling her about my drama with my mother. she started to cry. Man, it was bad!!! Both of us kept hogging the sink throwing up. After a short a amount of time we walked outside.   Twan and Calvin was waiting for us. Linda walked into Calvin's arm which was okay because their dating rite there and then she fainted. Me? i started to throw up somemore. Twan was looking after me. He walked me outside. Sat and waited for everyone. HE was comforting me but i didnt feel a thing with him, i just thought, oh his really nice to be taking care of a dumb ass like me.   Throw up some more. Before i even notice everyone was outside and i was knock out. Laying on Twan's lap i was so cold. He escorted me into Calvin's car, i was gone gone gone. I've have never like this before. Damn, i must be really fucked up to be ko. Got home by three thirty, fell asleep in the bathroom until Linda got me out and tuck me into bed.   Nine am this morning, i couldnt sleep anymore. I had to blog about what happen. I can still taste alcohol in my mouth and i'm still pretty much very tipsy. I'm so weak, I'm so stuck, i dont even know what to do.  I just want to sleep but i cant sleep. well, thats the end of my story. I've always wonder how well with i do blogging while being kinda tipsy so here i am. Man, i really want some pho. i'm hungry. Note: I am still tipsy so I'll correct my blog later for spelling and shit.
