The night before last, Patrick and Dustin called me and wanted to come over but mom was goin' to bed soon so I told them I'd have to come outside to talk to them...so they asked if I wanted to jus go with them and get some food. Sooo I did. It cracked me up so bad bc when they got here, I got in the back and Dustin was like "Do you want me to drive and you sit up here and make Patrick sit in the back?" I looked at Patrick with an evil smile and said "yeah sure!" lol he was like *hmph* :D Dustin's so great! I haven't known him long at all either, but I know I'll like him more and more if I keep hangin' out with them! Well, when they dropped me off, they wanted to know if I wanted to go to church with them the next day..Wednesday...and I said yes...and I told them if Monica couldn't go, thennnnn I'd have to have one of them pick me up. They said that was perfectly fine.  Anyways, Monica comes and pix me up for church Wednesday night and we sit with Dustin *smiles*. Patrick was mostly on stage playin' guitar. They usually have some youth service but their teacher wasn't there so we went upstairs anways and they talked about some trips they're takin' soon. Saturday they're goin' to some thing. I don't even know what it IS and Dustin's mom (the one talkin' to us about the trips) asked who all was goin' and Dustin had her put me and Monica on the list when we don't even know if we can go yet! I'll have to ask mom and Monica's gotta see if she can switch hours. *sigh* lol he's so crazy! He's like "if ya'll can't go we can always scratch ya'll's names out"! *smiles again* He really wants us to go though. And they're goin' to Six Flags, August 5th! He wants us to go with them there too! lol.. Six Flags WOULD be fun though. I'll see if I can go...but I'm not sure if I can or not..depends on if we have enough money for me to go. I hope I end up goin'....I'll be sad if I can't..*frowns*! Anyways, after church, me and Monica watched their band practice...they are so good...I love the way they sing and some of the songs they sing crack me up ;) !! Well, after they practice...we go outside and stand at Monica's car and they all start writin' on her car hahah!! It was funny!! BUUUT it upset me! B/c Dustin wrote "Alicia likes Brandon" I was like "noooo Alicia likes Dustin!!" oh, aww! I was standing on Monica's car..like on the side where the door is opened and he was standin' behind/besideme and he had his hand on my back and I just thought that was so cute b/c I was about to fall offa there :0 !! Patrick finally went over to Monica's side and wrote "Dustin likes Alicia" on there and I was thinkin' "ahh! thank you!" ;) Ohhh no. And the other night...I don't remember where this was but I wrote "Dustin is hot" on Patrick's window and it was still on there last night and Patrick showed it to him! haha I said..."Patrick! now you KNOW you wrote that" He knew I was jokin' and that it was me *smiles*... Well, we're going on our double date tonight. Hope all goes well. For me and Dustin.
