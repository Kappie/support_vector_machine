The thing is, I am on my period and well things here aren't that great...well financially speaking and we try not to make a big deal out of it, but it sucks when you can't even really go out without wondering if you are making some kind of mistake by going out....like damn, should we be using this money?  Trust me, we HARDLY go out.  That is why I am so happy when people give us gift certificates for any occasion, it is the one chance we get to go out and do something for ourselves.  How sad is that?  Anyway, I had so much fun with my in-laws.  Things weren't always that great, in fact things were pretty bad.  But thing are great now and that is what counts.  IT was a very long and rocky road.  I haven't been sleeping all that well because I know Ed is going back to that hell hole they call Iraq where our soldiers are dying left and right and now that the marines are taking over and taking care of business, that means Ed is there too.  I am scared because this time he won't be posted on some base (headquarters) like he was last year during the war.  He is going to be in Iraq with the crazy people.  I am so overwhelmed that I am beginning to cry when I think of that place.  I am so sad for those people, the way they have lived their lives, the fear they felt and now the uncertainty that surrounds them.  Yes, we are westerners.  I see why they are skeptical, we could bring more harm to them than Saddam (in their eyes) but I honestly don't think that is what being a REAL American is really about.  The heart of Americans isn't beating to dictate the world.  I think they really don't even want to have to regulate the world...unfortunately our politicians do.  Unfortunately for us family members of these military personnel, wait and wonder what will be next.  No one sees our loved ones, they see what they stand for.  They don't see the fathers, mothers, sons and daughters that they are....the family that they sacrifice for not only our freedom, but for the freedom of others.  But is it worth it when these people do not want to be freed.  So are we freeing them?  I don't know.  A bunch of rambling of a tired mind.  Sorry.
