(best friends over boyfriends- we're gonna pwn j00 Josh!!)  So, yell at me if you want to, but that's the situation.  Just thought you might like to know.  Now I've got to go tell my parents...not half as hard as Abby, let me assure you.  But she took it   really   well.  I knew all along she would.  (Right...that's why I sat dying in the back corner of Ms. Calhoun's English)
