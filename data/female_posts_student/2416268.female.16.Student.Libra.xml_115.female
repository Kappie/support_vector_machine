Not of me you understand, for I live in a world where the sun in shining, the birds are singing and the summer is in full flow! But I have noticed that the moods of others tend to be grey on days like today!!…Oh I don’t even know what I am talking about anymore! Don’t listen to me I talk utter bollocks, but it is bollocks that makes sense to me, just not others, and so if it makes sense to me I shall carry on writing. I would stop if it didn’t make sense to me, because there would be no point in ME writing it!  Yes………………………………………………I have had too much time on my hands today, it is official, I am getting even madder, if it is possible, than I already was!!  I need to think of something…something to do…..I cannot sunbath, I cannot take a walk down the beach, I cannot go shopping, I have been running, I have been cycling, I have drunk tea, I have watched films, I have taken the piss out of my sister…..hmm I think I will go read! Lately I have done nothing but read, and for the first time in years, I again love to read!  Ok so I am going to read (wow)  Love ye Nat xxxxxxxxxxxxx
