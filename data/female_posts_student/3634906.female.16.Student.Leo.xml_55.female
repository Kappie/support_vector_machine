AHHH thats the bad part... the good part... i saw my babies... DASHBOARD i love them more than anything in the world and i cant wait until they come back and i can see them up close... because we were way back in the middle of nowhere... hopefully my pics will turn out... another thing that kind of bummed me out was the fact that all the shirts for sale were only in large. so me being the big lame-O i am bought a dog tag... yes that is what i said a dog tag... hahaha oh well its fucking awesome because its DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL!!! and i plan on wearing it all the time until i lose it because i always lose everything i love!!!  well i must go and im not going to be around much because i am at my dads for 3 weeks and i hate his computer...
