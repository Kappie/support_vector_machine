Well, the bad weather didn't stop me and my friends from going.   We  were at the venue, Baker Field to be exact, at around 9ish. The line was pretty long and lots of people were milling around. We got in at around 10ish and the front act bands were pretty good naman except for that one band that i found strange... different.   Southborder came on at past 11 na. I swear, my view (approximately 5-6 feet from the stage) almost caused me to faint. All throughout, i sang my heart out with them and screamed my lungs off whenever Duncan would come near. I think I lost around 5 pounds that night.    Anyway, MR.IDON'TWANNAMENTIONHISNAME made my blood boil. All he did the whole night was cough, sniff and yawn. He did a fantastic job of keeping his mouth shut! Argh. Whatever.   Basta, for only 130 pesos, the concert was super sulit!!!
