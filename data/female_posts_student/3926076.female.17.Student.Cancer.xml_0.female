He didn’t seem like he liked it at first, but the most we walked around, the more fascinated he seemed. He took lots of fun pictures. We didn’t stay back there all that long cuz the bugs were eating me alive.   urlLink      urlLink      urlLink     After that, we came back and donked around at my house so I could show him pictures of my week with Doug and such and so we could get caught up since it’d be over two weeks since we’d seen one another. Later, we headed over to his house so I could drop him off. I really wanted to see Gretchen and Marty. They weren’t there when I got there, but by 8:30 they had both gotten home from work. I was so glad to see them. And they were glad to see me. I had originally only meant to go over there for a few minutes and it ended up being over an hour and a half. Oops!   =) Lydia
