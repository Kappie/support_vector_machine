Cause I am! 9th grade is...scary! What if I get beat up? What if my classes are to hard? EEK! I'm in all the AP classes, the problem with that is that I'm pretty lazy. I'm supposed to read "The Chosen" before school starts, there's going to be a test over it on the first day. I'm so screwed, I'm only on page 8. It's just so...boring.      LaLaLa. Ew, my mouth is all dry. I'll get some water in a minute. I'm trying to become a vegitarian. Isn't there different kinds? I am not sure. So far the only meat I still eat is chicken. I have "Moshi Moshi" by Brand New stuck in my head. I have no idea what Moshi Moshi means.      Hmm...I should probably say a little about myself. Um...my name is Karissa, but i prefer Rissa or Kris. I'm 14. My favorite movies are Breakfast at Tiffanys, The Virgin Suicides, Fight Club, and Donnie Darko. The person I most admire is Audrey Hepburn. I am at the moment trying to not cuss as much. I'm working on loving myself. I'm currently in therapy for depression and cutting, but I've been doing really well and I'll be done soon. I'm kinda dorky, slightly paranoid, quiet, and I don't know what else. Hehe. I like punk, rock, emo, some indie, some pop/rock music. I also like stuff animals! My favorite animal is a kitty kat. Uh...hmm. That's all I can think of for now! Ta Ta ladies and gents!      you know you love me,   Spazz (my nickname)
