I think I'm making the right decision in using this district- I think that between my mom and I, I can have some strong connections to some top-notch informants.   So, that's what I did yesterday. On their website, there were four teachers aid positions, and three were Title 1. I have to say that the application process is a little ricidulous. They need recommendation letters, a copy of my high school diploma, back ground check stuff, proof of employment from former employers, college transcripts. All this for a job that only requires a high school diploma or GED. As someone who is working on her masters degree, I even feel slightly intimidated by this process. I wonder if that discourages people from applying?
