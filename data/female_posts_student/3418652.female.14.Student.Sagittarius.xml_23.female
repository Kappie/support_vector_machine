TMG, was formed in the year Jan 2004, with 10 members.  -History- TMG... formed in the year 2004. With 10 members, but actually is 9, coz Sophia, was not really as crazy as us. But we still counted her as one of our members! hahahax. Initially, our name, TMG, stands for Ten Mad Girls. After all the 'conferencing', we decided to change it to The Mad Girls, in case TMG members found anymore 'gila gila' gals to join TMG.  -What do we TMG usually do- We will crowd around at each others' tables, laughing loudly like nobody's business. Hold hands together, which may be misunderstood as LESBAINS. In fact we are all NORMAL. We all like GUYS, not GALS. Recently, one of the TMG member, Eliza, go on steady, with CEDRIC.   Other than that, we will hold our hands together. Not simply hold hands. Remember? We got about 9 people. Normally, the famous TMG les is Eliza and En Ci (which is me), followed by Vanessa, Sheila and Ann. If we all hold our hands together, then we wld block the whole stair case, which may invite troubles. We will joke and talk nonsense, totally senseless things. We will organise outings... birthday parties etc.  -TMG Servant Association- This was actually TMG members. As our 'main branch', 3E2, was as dirty as a pig sty, and SOMEONE, whose name is ........ will sweep all hers' or may not be hers, rubbish, to Sheila's place. Thus, we invented this Association. We even came up with a pledge, both english and chinese.  -TMG Members- =Cynthia Tan =Eliza Tan--- BF.. Cedric -_- =Nellie Tan =Vanessa Loy aka Jay Chou =Jessy Yo  =Loretta Heng =Sheila Cai =Ann Lam =Sophia Tien =Zheng En Ci, which is me...  PEACE TO TMG!!! MUACKX.. I LOVE TMG MATES. MAY OUR 'TMG SPIRIT' LAST ETERNALLY...
