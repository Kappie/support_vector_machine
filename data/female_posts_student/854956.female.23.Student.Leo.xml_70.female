Well, my room is getting the finishing touches as we speak, and then by tonight I'll be moving back in...!  :-)  If I ever get a chance, I'll take a couple pictures of it when it's done and post them on here via a link to a website where I'll have them so ya'll can see.  I really like it!  Believe it or not, it actually makes my room feel colder... I guess because it tricks me into thinking I'm in some shade, or something... :-)  The colors are so lush... I can't wait to get all my stuff back in there tonight, and really make it look awesome...!!!  Anyhow, I'm off now with my Mom to get some fabric to finish my windows with... so I shall be off now... keep a look out for pictures...!  : D
