But all of us "grown-ups" played as well. Man I miss being a kid. Even though I still kinda am. Then we went to downtown Bethlehem, PA. I liked the environment of everything. After all of that I was ready for nap. Then my cousin Katie came over to Beth's for dinner. Yummy-it was baked Ziti(spelling?). Very cheesy. Right now I'm listening to the Gin Blossoms, I was actually suppose to go to their concert, but my sister waited like an idiot to get the tickets and then they were sold out.   Tomorrow, we're suppose to be heading out to my Nana's-back in New Jersey. audios
