This never happens at all. I don't know what to think at all.   And I'm in pretty good mood. I was looking at my 5th grade class picture.  MAN . We all look  SO  young. And back then we thought we were all old and grown up. It's so funny and strange. I don't know. It's weird. But I was looking at Amanda. She was so cute and sweet and dorky in 5th grade. I wish she was still like that. Instead of so concerned with seeming the best and cool or whatever she thinks.   It's sad.   But whatever, I still love her to death and if that's how she is I have to accept it no matter what and I do.
