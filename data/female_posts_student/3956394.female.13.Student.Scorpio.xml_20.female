Well i dont care  but i have rights you know =) Anyways, yes, i did chose this layout cause i liked it and i bet that someone will auto thing that i copied it off them.I didnt.I changed my layout then checked some other blogs and found out they had the same one.Anyways, i cant just assume things but its a guess.That brings me to my "too many" topic.Ok, if 5 million people are talking behind your back .... is that too many? In my opinion, even 5 would be to many.I want people to say comments to my face and not write them - Say them.I have to admitt that i dont like mean comments to my face but i rather have them to my face then a paper,diary or blog.So come on, dont wimp out.If you feel a way about me, say it to my face.NO dont write it in your little diary.MY FACE.Ok? I think you get the point now. =) As you can tell, im in an ok mood.The reason is that i might have friends over tomorrow and i cleaned my room and gave it a fresh new look.If you knew me, you dont im not tidy at all.My beds not made, the clothes in my closet is scattered everywhere, my shelves are full of crud. (Paper that i dont even use/need anymore) BUT! I cleaned EVERYTHING.My bed is always made starting from today, (I should keep a chart or something) I threw away two bags full of paper from like 3 years ago with schoolwork on it, I dusted everything and best of all i cleaned my closet and everything is in place. I got a new thingi that also says stay out and come in just to make my room better =D I found some long lost items =P And i put this cute little office thing witb stickies hanging, pens in a pen holder and paper with numbers and paper for notes around.I really like my room and even better is the fact that my pc is in it!
