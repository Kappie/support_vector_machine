Well, yesterday I came to class, and mine you, that was my FRIST lecture of the semester and I was 30 mins late. Oh well, thought I was the only one who cannot make it but Evelyn came in 45 mins late. Haha.. I think we are just born late comers..but hell, I dun have her intellectual genes. Damn it. Talking about my 1st day, after like 15 minutes into settling down and listening to the lecturer talking about Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis, I succumb into screen saver mode. I was practically bored to death. I think in the row of seats I was situated, my note book was the most empty of the lot. Well, it sure personifies the blank look on my face. And guess what?? Lecture ended only half an hour after I arrived! TMD  Same goes for today. I came to sch for a TWO hour lecture which ended one hour in advance. Geez man. And my lecturer was teaching us, how to interpret the CIP structure of chiral protein carbon atoms. Wah lao. That was like year one's work. I'm totally losing faith in NUS lectuers. Not to forget his heavy dose of   INDIAN   accent.  Had tuition 2 days straight already. Erm...actually, its 3 days straight. Sunday, Monday and today. Shack? Let's just say I never used to be so hard working earning money. * Wendy Wendy, you haf changed..luffs* so after lessons today I rot for an hour in sci canteen and headed for CCK for tuition. I kept yawning through my tuition today. Haha... when I headed back hme, I dunno why but strangely I feel emotionally disturbed.. Seems as though I have a lot of thoughts running awry in my mind. This time not old ghosts that used to haunt me, but seemingly my sub-conscious have realized something that my conscious have yet to fathomed. Fucked. I guess my brain knows the answers all along..just preparing the deadful proposal then one day presenting it in flambuoyant colours to my consciousness that drops the bomb on me.   Cheers to myself babe.
