It was a blitz visit, but while I was there I suddenly realized why I've been missing it so much recently.  Ann Arbor is a quintessential college town. Small, but with lots of restaurants and shops. Residential, but with transient college students. Lots of great music of all genres - folk, jazz, rock, and classical. Low crime rates. Academics everywhere. Basically, an ideal place to live.  Of course, it could just be massive doses of nostalgia tainting my vision with rosy colors. At the moment, however, I'd love to go back.
