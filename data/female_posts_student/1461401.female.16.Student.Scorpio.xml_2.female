If you have the chance, you need to come and see The Complete Works of William Shakespeare Abridged. If you can't, I sincerly pitty you. Seriously, it's one of the funniest plays I've ever seen in my entire life. Trust me on tis, and just go see it. Things are still different, not that I expected them to change back... I guess I was just hoping. Oh well, theres still time. Not that it will ever be the same again, but there's always hope. Band gets to play at Kobacher (sp?) on tuesday. That'll be cool. I still hate band, but I don't know if I can really quit or not. And I'm not just talking about whether or not my parents will let me, I mean whether or not I'll let myself. Oh well, there's still time to think on that too. My left arm hurts, so I'm going to go now. Ttyl ya'll Me
