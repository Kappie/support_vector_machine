Through perilous journey’s Over land’s covered with temptations I have triumphed my way here To the gates of heaven. Through eyes once clouded And a heart once jaded, I have believed my way here To the splendour of heaven. Through words confessed with my mouth And deeds done with my hands I have prayed my way here To the glory of my father’s kingdom, Heaven.
