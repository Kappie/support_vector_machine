I pulled you down to help you cope  I’m holding you with the thought of hope  You lay there helpless in my arms  How was I supposed to guess your harms?   As I sit there and begin to weep  You awake from you frightful sleep  Almost disappointed to see my eyes  This is the last time I will fall for your lies  You turn to me your body so weak  Softly I begin to hear you speak  “You don’t understand how hard it is  Trying to be here when you don’t want to live”  I don’t get how this has come about  Speak to me, let it all out  Please help me understand what your going through  I cant do anything without the help of you  You need to understand how much I care  Don’t you know what you have to share?  I cant figure out how you got this way  You never told me what you needed to say  Now its your turn to listen and my turn to share  You can pretend not to believe, but I know you care   Life goes on even though its hell  You’re so loved, but you just can’t tell  Your life is so precious and dear to me  I still don’t get why you tried to flee  I’m so glad that I wasn’t too late  Open you eyes just listen watch and wait  As I look into your eyes they begin to pour  All the emotions unseen to me before  The life you live is what you own  And I will always be here when you’re alone  Never be worried that I don’t have a clue  Just remember one important thing -  I LOVE YOU    This poem means the most to me out of all of them...i guess its just something in the words that just lets everyone know that they are always thought of and with out them life wouldbe totally different
