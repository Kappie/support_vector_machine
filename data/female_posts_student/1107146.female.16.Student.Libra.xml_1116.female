Anyway, sorry about 5th, yall.  I went home.  I think tomorrow I'm going to skip 1st and 2nd, and then go 3rd-7th.  I'm thinking that might be the best way to do it.  I went to sleep when I got home...some dreams are not pleasant.  I thought I'd gotten over that period in my life where like every dream is a bad one, but apparently not.  I thought for a while it just might be the mono, but now I don't know.  It's not like they're nightmares (scary) so much as just bad dreams (not good.)  All right, that's it for me.  I wonder if this post actually makes sense...
