Thank god that love triangle fued thing is over.... for now.... [ Sun May 11, 12:51:17 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] So I started Weight Watchers two days ago. And it's not so hard I've noticed except for I've gone over my alloted points both days. Now the first day I had the excuse of the fact that I didn't sign up until after lunch and had already eaten too many points to salvage for the dinner I was eating at mom's house that night. By the way I am doing Weight Watchers Online because I cannot plan my life around meetings and such. So then yesterday I was doing so good, I even had 18 points for dinner which is plenty, I had drank more than my share of water and I snacked on an apple (which I never do cause I'm not a huge fan of apples) so we go to happy hour and I have planned out how many beers I can have but the problem is, when you get drunk everything goes out the window. I didn't drink over my share of beers but there were two shots and then there were appetizers. I only had a little of this and that but when I came home to calculate my points they had skyrocketed through the roof.... oh well.... I start monday with a clean slate of points and then we'll see....
