Our apple tree in the backyard grew a whole bunch of huge, red apples so we used them to make a good ol' homemade apple pie! Mum made the crust pastry and then we peeled like 50 apples, cut out the bad bits and mixed them with cinnamon, nutmeg, flour and sugar to make the perfect apple pie! We actually made TWO today and also another two tomorrow because there are so many damn apples. ;) Anyway, we had some for dessert with vanilla bean ice-cream (OMG! new obsession! you can't get it at home and it's like vanilla in a brand new tasty way for me) and it was fantastic.   We also made some biscotti  stewed some apples (well, attempted... they burned..) We also ate the carrots  beans fresh from the market - tastiest veggies ever.   I slept in way too long today but then that's not so unusual. I'm off to  urlLink Food Lifeline  tomorrow.. I'm growing a little tired of volunteering, I have to admit. I won't miss it when I get to actually be paid for my work again.  xo
