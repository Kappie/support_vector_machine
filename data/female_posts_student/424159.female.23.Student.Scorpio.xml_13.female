If I was a character from the movie  Hackers  I would be:   urlLink      urlLink Which Hacker's Character Are You?  Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty    If I was a character from the movie  The Breakfast Club  I would be:   urlLink      urlLink Which Breakfast Clubber Are You?  Find out @  urlLink She's Crafty    My analysis:  These silly quiz things are dead on.  Like Joey, I'm naive, clueless, and I'm generally a screw-up.  Like Allison, I'm neurotic and unbalanced.  More findings later.
