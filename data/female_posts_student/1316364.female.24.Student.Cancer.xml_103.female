Work has been keeping me very busy and I am actually praying for a slow day today, which is unusually strange beings that it usually slow and I am usually praying for work to do.  The FRG meeting Tuesday night was very good, even though not that many people were able to attend. I nominated myself for a position as photo historian, which is an unofficial position that the FRG made up.  I figured that this would be a great position for me to have beings that: A) I always have my digital Camera with me B) I am going to be taking a Beginning Photography course next semester and this would be a great opportunity to practice.  I love taking pictures and it seems that pictures of FRG events are the only things the ARMY hasn’t found a way to regulate… yet. Any way the meeting went great and we were able to get a lot accomplished, at least in deciding on nominations for positions. So I feel that it really wasn’t a bad thing to have been a part of.  In other news, I got A’s in my two classes for this semester. I am so happy about that. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to recover from all of the time I had to take off due to out of state travel to see Jesse, 1 ½ weeks, then ½ week when my Grandmother/Nana passed away. 1 week when I got sick, so I was behind a total of 3 weeks in class. To top it all off I had to finish a total of 10 chapters of homework the last week I was sick But I managed to do it and I was very grateful and pleased in the end result of all of my hard work, A’s in both of my classes. Next semester I am taking on a total of 13 units, which is 4 courses. I haven’t pulled a full semester in a long time but I feel now is probably the time to do so. I love learning new things and now seemed like the best time to do so. I plan on surrounding myself in school and taking a little break here and there to earn a little income. My school schedule will take over most of my Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays so I will have Wednesdays and Fridays to work. I am also thinking of doing some sort of home based work but am having a hard time finding something that will actually be worth looking into.  My goal is to keep myself busy, not so that I don’t think of Jesse, but to help pass my time faster so that I can get through this time away from him a little easier.
