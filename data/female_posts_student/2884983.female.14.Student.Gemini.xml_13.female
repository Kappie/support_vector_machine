[ 6:00 a.m. ]  I almost fell asleep while I was reading. And it is only  around 7:30!! thats  insane.  I locked my friends in their lockers today. It was...interesting to say the least. lol. we are whacks. but thats ok cause we like whacks don't we?  yes yes we do. Curly's yet to get back to me on what she wants to be called. I have nicknames for everbody. it is a good way to keep you  anonymity . :) thats a big word...I like big words. it is too bad I can't remember the two big words i learned today...I liked those big words. *..will I choose water over wine and hold my own and drive....* is blog even a real word? I like the word: foudroyant. it means "faster than lightning." yay for the lightning!!
