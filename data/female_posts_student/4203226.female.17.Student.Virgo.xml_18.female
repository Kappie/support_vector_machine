So if you want to post a picture like i did of my rez room, click on the picture icon (second from the left) on list in the Create New Post area. A little box will pop up and say  Choose A File To Upload:  -You browse and find the file Upload Path: type "/images/" (without the quotes - just type what's inside the quotes) and then rename the file if you want - but don't do this unless you remember to keep the .jpg or the .gif at the end - or else it wont work.  ok then it will go "uploading" and it will ask you to do an inline photo or a link to the photo. Inline is like what my rez room picture is. the link is just where you have "some text" and the words "some text" have a link to the picture which is just the picture all by it's lonesome on a page. (Does this even make any sense??)  If you want to make your comments  Bold , or  Italics , you have to put:      bold:   ‹strong› whatever you want to type‹/strong ›  (YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER TO DO THE BACKSLASH - / - before the strong at the end. that's what closes the tag - or else everything else on the page will be Bold.)       italics:         ‹em›whatever‹em›  - again, you have to put the / before the em at the end of the tag, to close the tag.        Also, if you're quoting someone/something, there's a funtion called the blockquote that you can use. What it does is it indents the text and makes it look a bit different, so the people reading will be able to tell the difference. (I used the blockquote function on this paragraph.) This is what the " button is. So you just type type type and the highlight what you want to be in the blockquote, and press the " button and it will go indented. you can do it before you write too, but it's a pain in the butt to get out of the blockquote format when you're done. Hope this all makes sense! Also, right under the box where you do your typing is where you can choose whether you can allow people to comment or not on your post. If you don't want to let them comment click No. Beside that you can change what the time of the post says - if, say, it took you an hour to ACTUALLY finish typing the whole thing. Or you can forward post - so i type this at 11:34 a.m. and i don't want it to show up until 5:30 the next day, I type in 5:30 August 15th and that's when it'll show up. You can also Save your writing as a draft and continue writing it later.  So have lots of fun with it - and if you want anything edited, just e-mail/IM me. I'd give you guys the Admin abilities, but I don't want you to accidentally delete it or change any of the important stuff on it - not saying you  would  or anything. :op
