I'm desperatly tired...i did zero homework tonight...was supposed to read a bunch of The Great Gatsby but...didnt...I like the book but oh well, its easy to find other things to do besides read.   Why do i make myself stay up late. I'm going to make myself eggs and toast tommorow morning. Yum! If i go to sleep now...i'm that much closer to my eggs and toast...  GOOOD BYYYYEEE -jessica. kjfkalgfgkjgklgjkl;dklah;  Oh yes, tommorow is nate and I's 4 month anniversary(?) Should be interesting as to weather or not he remembers. I doubt he even knows what day of the week it is today.   Volleyball has got me down. My team is a whole bunch of nothing.
