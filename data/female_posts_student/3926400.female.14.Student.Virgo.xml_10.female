They were by far the best I have ever seen in my whole life. I was in awe at the notes, the beats, and the patterns in general.   I love good live music.    To add to the pleasant mood of last night, I finished one of the books I'm reading ( The Virgin Suicides ), and this morning Jessie left me home alone. On the note she left to let me know where she was (I was alseep), she wrote: "I know you need your alone time so I'm going to hang out at Andi's for a while." Yay for Jessie, she  might  actually know me after all.
