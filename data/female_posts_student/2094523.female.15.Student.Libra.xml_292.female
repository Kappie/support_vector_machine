I should never be blamed for anything because i never do anything wrong and its always other people's faults, but never mine. If you ever feel down and think that the world sucks and its all your fault, well yea, yeah it is ok? everything is your fault u suck @ life while I rock @ it and everythign in between. I'm a genius and I kick your ass at everything because what can i say im perfect! its simple being perfect when everythign about me and i have everything that yuou dont have but wish you did have. Coz guess what? its me. I have no flaws. ----> anyways i wish that was all true because it d be fun to believe in,, its fun to play pretend sometimes.. pretend your something u cud never be.
