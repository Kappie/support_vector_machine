Things have happened that made me realize I  am  strong, I  am  weak, and I  can  pull through.  Sometimes it's hard to open up to the one person who means everything to me, and shutting her out is my only choice. But that one person knows how to crack open my shell and crawl into my mind and soul within a matter of minutes, something that comes easily to her, but is quite a challenge for others.  I've changed. No. Not on the outside. And I guess that's why my friends have never known what I'm really capable of. I've changed on the inside. A revolution, a turning point for my thoughts, emotions and most importantly, my soul. And that's another thing. My friends have never really seen  me , who I really am. They can't look into my eyes and see my core, unlike the popular saying. That immortal part of who I am, is off limits, a barrier built up over time to shield me from the fire that I know will kill me. That I know will haunt me.  I've learned that no matter how high those walls are, someone always has a way of making it tumble to the ground, leaving me with nothing more but a heap of heartache, pain and sorrow. But I've also learned a way to deal with that crumbled wall that left me exposed and seemingly helpless. And this results in the inevitable question...why? To be honest, there is no answer that will ever satisfy the human being. All I have to say, to give, is advice. Once you start trying to kill the thing on the inside, by hurting yourself on the outside, there is  no  going back.  Never has the gentle wind caressed my face, nor has the sun shone brightly on me, leading me to my rightful place. Instead, I'm left to be consumed by this inalienable darkness, this restricting force that forbids me to breathe and dream freely. I know I've got an old soul. I also know how purely my aura glows. It's the only light that reminds me of how brave I've been these sixteen years, and how much pain I've gone through.  As I watch droplets of stardust rain down upon the slumbering city, I can't help but smile as the moon engulfs us all into her warm pools of serenity. It's times like these when I know I'm going to be alright.
