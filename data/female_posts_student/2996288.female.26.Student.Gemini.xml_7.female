I don't ever actually believe any of it, but that doesn't make me stop.  Why the fascination?  Why try to hurry everything along?  I'm just impatient, I guess - I want to know what's next right now!  It's all very exciting.  But I think I'm glad that the 8 ball isn't always right, after all.  In other news: my parents purchased a new house.  I knew this was coming - that didn't even take the Tarot cards.  They've been looking at houses, and talking about this for a long time now.  My baby sister is about to graduate from high school, and my mom is dreading the empty nest.  My dad is just a gypsy at heart, I think (like me) and gets bored of the same place.  I'm intrigued to see what my parents have gotten themselves into.  It is a 'fixer-upper.'  And not of the "Money Pit really-nice-but-falling-apart-watch-out-for-the-hole-in-the-floor" variety.  It's more of the "Sling Blade bury-your-dead-baby-brother-in-the-backyard-shed" variety.  According to my sisters anyway.  Actually, it doesn't sound bad as all that...quite.  I'll be home in April and I'll get to see the new house.  It comes with a farmer.    I've never owned a farmer before.  I don't even think that my Fisher Price barn had one, although I may have been too hypnotically attracted to the mooing sound the barn door made when you opened it to ever notice presence or lack of Farmer.   I suppose technically, we don't actually OWN this farmer - just the land that he farms.  Maybe it is a she?  I wonder if the feminist movement reached the farming industry.  There are so many important things to do right now, but they just don't interest me.  I need a Magic 8 ball and a Fisher Price barn... that'd be fun...
