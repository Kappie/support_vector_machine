What a great deal. I could have lived without one, but I really wanted to get one for Mike seeing that he needs one for his line of work. There are some really funny sites out there with people looking to swap g-mail addresses. What lengths people will go to, to get the name they want. Well, I guess I am in no position to talk, I BOUGHT one. How pathetic! Oh well....
