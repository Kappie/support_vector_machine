Three and a half hours of being on my feet in high heel shoes... We won the first game and then lost the next three... I had fun though. I scored a goal and I got to play everywhere. Except goalie. Then at dance we learned a new dance. And I had so much fun... I am happy right now, so don't do anything to ruin the moment... I am really hot right now... It is like 80 outside... Oh well, I am just talking to my friend Tricia right now. She has been on vacation for the past week. Well, I am a bit exhausted, so I am going to go rest and read.  ♥Jeanne♥
