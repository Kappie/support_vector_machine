Mood: content and pissed 
   ___It's exactly like the title says, more of my random rants about things that happen to always bother me. Let’s rant about... my weight! I hate it. Especially last weekend when I wore a bikini to the beach, I mean I want to lose my  TUMMY !!!  I HATE IT !!! I’m not fat, but I’m not on the weight that I want to be on!!! It was weird how I lost 5 lbs bcuz I’ve started to starve myself the whole entire day, making dinner is my only form of a real meal. I think I might go anorexic or something. Even when I was on the trip to NYC, I felt like throwing up every time I ate. It’s not that hard, and plus my best friend said that she’d probably follow me into doing it too. I know I know this is madness, but hey I’m ranting! This is me ranting… so agree with it or fuck off and leave.   
    ___I’m waiting for Gene to come home from his summer school… it’s weird to have these feelings of waiting again. Seems like a long time ago when I actually waited around for a guy. I’m growing up ain’t I? I no longer feel scared for things that will have to happen to me once the future decides to snack me in the face like it always does. But how come the topic of relationships always freaks me out so? It’s always the same topic that causes me to end something that could have been worth keeping, especially with friends. I admit I do miss have Tim and Jacob around, but they were only friends, and well… sometimes you just had to let them go. I just wish that life for me wasn’t all about losing old friends and gaining new ones that I will lose also. Sometimes I wonder if I’ve left any  impression  on anyone so that 10 years later they can remember me as the/that ________ .   
    ___You guys fill in the blank. Tell me what impression I’ve left on you,  good  or  bad , I want to know what you think.
