I started to say, the luggage it was lighter I left something big in Miami...huge in fact.. I landed and the humidity in Miami just clung to my thighs as if to say welcome home...He pulled up and ofcourse had a mild confrontation with some pedestrian traffic controller on a head trip..confrontation settled with some fancy manual transmission maneuvering...which trunk would I go to I thought.  How could that be the first thought I have..I thought...I was thinking too much, much the way a puppy gets when you show it a chew toy and a treat...simultaneously...  Oh my god to have his touch meshed with his words after soo long...all my anxiety melted into his maroone leather seats, either that or the humidity sticking to my thighs just condensed...either that or now I was thinking about all the meshing that would end up happening...hahaa  We spoke so openly, maybe influenced by alcohol, maybe I'm just letting go of these barriers to getting hurt I don't know, but I wanted him to know that our distance may be good for us now, that every hurdle he or I ever placed along the track to where we are RIGHT NOW...was worth it...that even if this is where it plateaus...I could never ask for anything sweeter.  We laughed, laughed so hard he almost left with a concussion after knocking his head into the bannister behind our table so many times, we ate and drank at these beautiful places but it was his skin and his lips that tasted like perfection..So many close encounters with the threat of being arrested for lude and the other "l" word acts in public, a lot of meshing, exciting, tantalizing, sensual meshing...  I saw my babies too, the whole clan..it was amazing...those women I have as friends they had me rolling on the floor, and I know that no matter where time or planes may take us all away to, I will always see their warmth, they looked at me differently you know like with a lot of respect and maybe even pride...It also felt really army like because well, we all had on creme pants and pastel tops for Divvy's bridal shower, we were on a mission for pure fun and quality time, Mission accomplished...on to the wedding...I hugged her with all my strength, I told her in a card ofcourse, because sentiment rolls off my tongue with an anchor attached to it...straight to the floor, my belly says this is a good thing...that feeling we all get when a family member or family like friend meets someone new...you get this peaceful or disturbing rumbling in the tummy, like is he going to hurt her, is he going to respect her...my belly had the fizzes, alka-seltzer style, very relieving the moment Mr. Jefferson looked at Divvy, he was enamoured lost in her, I loved it, I felt she was safe, I didnt have to worry, it's not like my worrying would protect her like a bubble, but it's selfish I could close my eyes and know she's going to be ok forever...and ofcourse I had to include the staple side of sarcasm by saying it could've been the fact that I had diarrhea...but otherwise it's all systems go....she laughed her contagious giggle and I remembered that she knows how much I care..  We read the paper together, that was amazing, I'm the biggest weirdo...these god forsaken old couple things are appealing to me...I like fighting over sections of the newspaper, having him look at me quite perplexed as to why with all my might I could swing and completely miss the golf ball...Brunch was dreamy...he perfectly combined food and flattery...he knows too much, including my ninja status...The proudest moment for me was when he swept everyone off their feet including some potentially fake British guy with his amazing wit and charm...I got annoyed at one point, because I wanted it all for myself...I need to take a stab at sharing...One of the partakers in the being swept off of their feet activity, squeezed my hand and said he is so amazing, look at how happy you are, you guys are beautiful together, a comment which we heard in NY, and also from the Brit...I always let these comments roll off my shoulder (on the outside) right into my heart...I just reached around him and squeezed him like an empire waisted cloak...We discussed in crude terms my needing to take a stab at sharing, and letting go of insecurities...How can he be younger, the farthest from thinking like we're in a pseudo relationship, yet he is the one who makes all the sense..who says things that really just make sense???  He has brought something out of me that hasn't surfaced since a wild autumn night in 1997...I wanted to share everything with him, wanted to take care of him, not just party my ass off, but make sure he eats well...See, I'm a natural babier or motherer whichever makes more sense, it's a little bit of the humanitarian in me but also a lot of the narcissist...like "I know what's best for you.., don't worry I'll do it..", these last few years I have been self indulgent, like fulfilling my every whim for selfish reasons, but for all the jokes I make about him being a full grown baby who doesn't have salt in the house :), damnit I almost bought salt at the grocery store...Even if this ends up being the demise of our whimsical friendship/love affair, I am so happy to see that side of me reemerge, because I was banking on being the really cool aunt for my brother's kids who orders take out, travels non stop, and drinks martinis after a hard day, maybe now I see I have room in my heart for other people...  Enough..I'm made myself gag now...
