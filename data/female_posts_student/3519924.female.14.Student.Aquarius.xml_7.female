People who are loved and love people shall argue this statement to the death of it, but deep down inside we all know it is true. You're probably right (Not naming any names), the way I think will leave me dead by the time I am 15. W/e, you can't blame me for saying everything that you all are thinking deep down inside. I hate you all now, everyone..."and sooner or later you know I'll be dead"  Phrase of the day: (obviously) Love Is Destruction  Song Of The Day: Loser-3 Doors Down  Event of the day: Giving my dog a bath....haaaah
