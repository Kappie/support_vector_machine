So, I got there and brought my stuff in and me, Ricky, and Druck watched 24.  :-)  Then Wolf got home from work, and we all decided to eat something and the plan was to go see Drumline.  Okay, so we ordered Papa John's... Druck almost burned the pizza boxes in the oven cause he switched the heat from "warm" to "broil" which, any person (who cooks) knows can make bread into a burnt mess in a matter of 2 minutes.  Anyhow, so we left later on to go over to Pflugerville to see Drumline at the discount theater.  We got all the way there and Drumline wasn't even playing there.  It was playing at a theater down the road.  We then had trouble getting OUT of the parking lot in Pflugerville (due to the small spaces AND the small amount of space in between rows of cars).  Ricky was a traffic controller!  :-)  Anyhow, we finally got out, and hurried up to get to the other theater.  Once we got there we found out the movie had already begun AND it wasn't a discount theater.  OY!  So we just went back to the apt. and had some birthday cake.  We watched tv, too.    Saturday Ricky's parents came over and picked him up to go visit Jeff and Marta with them.  Wolf and I planned to leave later.  We ended up leaving earlier than we had planned because there was nothing else to do anyway.  So we got to San Antonio, and he watched sports with my Dad.  Then I got ready to go to BLAST! and we left early to eat at Jim's.  Both of us ended up getting our usual Jim's meals... then we headed on downtown.  We got to the Majestic and got some souveniers.  Then we took our seats (which were AWESOME by the way).  We were pretty much DEAD center.  We were 2 seats in from the center aisle.  It was awesome!  I think the show here in SA was better than the one in Houston.  The trumpet soloist was better, at least.  His chops were AMAZING!  We had an awesome time.  Then we talked to a few of the performers after the show... though we didn't get any autographs OR photos!  :-(  And I had wanted to meet Nelson's friend Kevin Brubaker... but he was off doing something else.  And so was Vincent Oliver!  :-(  He was an awesome marimba player, and I had really wanted to take a pic with him... but he was gone doing whatever, too!  :-(  Anyway, we left and got out of downtown, and then stopped to pick up Ricky.  He came back with his parents... he got his keys and other stuff he needed... anyway, after a short time there, we packed back into my boat to drive back to Austin.  We got there around midnight, and we watched tv a bit.  Then Druck came out and said he was hungry, so we got TCs.  YUM!  Nothing better than TCs at 2am!  haha  It was weird.  Anyway, we then all fell asleep.  Well, actually I was the only one that was TIRED before 3am.  So, everyone left me alone in Ricky's room and I slept.  I slept very well, actually.  His bed is comfy... Friday night I had fallen asleep... and I didn't change my sleeping position at ALL during the night.  Which is weird for me, because I usually wake up several times during the night.   We all woke up around 12:30pm today, and we decided to go eat.  Since today was Wolf's 21st, we let him decide.  He wanted Jim's again, so we all got ready to go.  We drove over to Jim's and ate.  Ricky won a Betty Boop from the crane machine, and we then all took turns trying to win Shaggy.  But we couldn't.  Damn bastard!  Anyhow, we went back to the apartment, and Wolf wanted to do something.  So, we played ImagineIFF... it was SO MUCH FUN!!!  I will have to buy the game, because it was great, and I think it'd be fun for me and my family to play (like, my parents, brother, and Kathy maybe).  Anyway... we had fun... then we just all sorta bummed around.  After awhile we watched some more 24.  Then around 5:45 Alexis and Phillip came over to see if we wanted to play frisbee.  I dunno... they ended up playing... but I left at 6.  I don't know if Ricky played or not... Wolf and Druck were playing w/them though.  :-)  I got home and ate a bit and had some pie with my parents (for their 33rd anniversary).  It was great fun.  They were watching a movie, so I finished it with them, and then we listened to some of my BLAST! cd that I bought.  Anyway, it was a very fun weekend.  And there's still tomorrow.  Who KNOWS what I'll do once I'm done reading for World Lit?!  ;-)     One last thing:  H A P P Y   B I R T H D A Y,   W O L F ! ! ! ! ! !       urlLink  postCount('19Jan2003');
