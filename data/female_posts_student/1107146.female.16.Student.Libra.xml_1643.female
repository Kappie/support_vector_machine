Especially Scott, who was so wise to post it for me.  (Don't flex.)  Anyway, now I have a question for yall, and don't yell at me, but Michael wants the address to the blog.  Is that ok with everybody?  He doesn't want to post, just to read.  If you don't want him to just say so, but I told him I'd ask.
