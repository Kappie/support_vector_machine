Here enly the highlights/details/main events of my weekend.  11.27.02   *seven hour drive to bradford, after school. Of course   *stayed up til 4 am watching Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Arc. I am such a Indiana maniac. It's a bizarre obsession, i know.   *forced to sleep on air matress with my sister   11.28.02 (thanksgiving day)   *slept til about 12:30 ish   *didn't shower til around 3 ish   *aunt oliva arrived just before dinner   *ate WAY to much. I had a traditional italian american meal. Polenta, potatoes, lasagna, and 5 different kinds of pie. mmmm pie....   * p.s. cousin becoming increasingly too close for comfort   * watched the elvis thing on TV, lots of good music babe.   11.29.02   *slept in til about 12 ish   *aunt bonnie and nona oliva came over, wish uncle luke came with them, he's so cool and he has the greatest car EVER. Its a convertable porshe thingy. Its amazing. Plus I haven't seen him in a while.   *sat around and "talked" to nona oliva even though she is old as dirt and only speaks italian. Fun stuff.   *watched "the brady bunch in the white house" with cousin and lil sis   *ps any movie in which one or more of the brady's are president/vice president of the united states is automatically the WORST movie in exsistance. bar none.   *went to bed pretty early since aunt oliva was sleeping on the couch, hahaha nona oliva kicked her out of her bed.   *was awake for about two hours in bed because it sounded like there was a harley convention on the other side of the room. aka MY PARENTS SNORE LIKE BEARS. they were like alternating snoring too, so it was like one continual *ssssnnnnnnnnnnngggggggrrrfffffhhhhhhh!@#$%^((^%$hfasklfj oaseiru owfuaseiof useiofu* from the both of them.   11.30.02   *slept till around 11:30 ish   *mum and aunt oliva went visiting while i was in the shower. They went and visited my aunt bridget and uncle tony without me! Bridget being the only tolerable person in the FAMILY. But hey its not like i said "i really wanna see bridget this Trip" or anything like that, OH WAIT A SEC! hmm anyway no hard feelings...   *i watched Meet Joe Black with my cousin and sis. It was pretty good. We had to stop midway though because bonnie's friend donna came over and we had to be all polite and talk to her.    *A couple HOURS in to the conversation it turned to dream analasis. Apparently, according to nona oliva, if in your dream you see a fuit or grain growing on a hill when its out of growing season, then someone is going to die. And if you see a dog barking in your dream, then whoever its barking at will die. I was like wow, this is morbid.... and insane. But it was kinda scary because nona oliva dreamed about grapes on a hill before uncle tulio/nelo (dont ask) died, and before francis's cousin (?) died. I was like alright new topic...   *After everyone left we watched the rest of Meet Joe Black only this time i got to here it in italian to because my gramma was translating it for nona oliva. It was kind of distracting after a while actually.   *After that movie we watched "holiday inn" some old movie with bing crosby (ps bing is just the greatest name ever) and fred astaire. wasn't bad. It was kinda funny though, because it one of the songs bing is the only person playing an instraument, the piano, but the piano is the only instraument you can't here in the song.   *went to bed, made a point of getting to sleep BEFORE my parents did so i wouldn't have to hear their snoring.   12.1.02   *woke up to dad lecturing me about something. Only heard half of his droning. Stupid man, maybe he should wake me up before he yells at me so his speach has a better effect.   *I had a mosterous breakfast, thank god my gramma can cook   *nona oliva/bonnie gave the family 150 dollars, total. It was in check form. Thats 37.50 each. I figured that out QUITE fast.   *looooooong drive ahead of us.   *yeah so about two minutes in i got sick of talking to my family, dad was just pissing me off to a massive degree, so i listened to scarlets walk. sigh, the batteries didn't last long though.   *a couple hours in we passed a truck carrying all these calves, off to slaughter. I almost puked.   *We stopped to get some food, got vanilla coke *yay*ate for about half an hour, then left.    *We were immediately hit with 30 miles of stand still traffic because of a 25 car pile up. I dont think anyone was seriously hurt though because they cleared it pretty quickly, well pretty quickly for 25 cars.   *a couple more hours in the drive we hit 6 miles of backed up traffic. We later found out it was because people were slowing down to look at a flashing sign. *puts hand over face and hangs head in shame for the people who cause six miles of backed up traffic just from looking at a sign*   *got home, gramma sent us home with MUCH extra food. Immediately found the marzipan and inhaled it.   *got online and typed all this up.
