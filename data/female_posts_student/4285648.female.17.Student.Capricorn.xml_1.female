I got another little purse/bag dealy, they're becoming my new must-have-lots-of item.       I feel sad again today. I know its not my fault, its the stupid "chemical inbalance" shit, but does it have to suck this much? I'm not the kind of person that cries easily, but i was too close to bursting out into tears tonight, over the stupidest reasons, such as someone didnt sit by me at dinner, or i was kinda behind everyone while walking in the mall and felt a teeny bit left out. I didnt really want anything to do with anyone for the most part. for instance, right now, i'm isolating myself by going on the computer instead of being social. i hate this, i really do...but thats what therapy is for hopefully i can improve. yay for Sharon my therapist. She's kayla's therapist too! I still find that a bit humorous, one of my closest friends that i can tell almost everything too has the same therapist as me. that rocks, but i'm gonna stop isolating myself and be social now.
