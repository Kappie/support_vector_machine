So I've wasted most of my day off, but I slept like a BABY, so it's OK. :D  In other news, I'm going SHOPPING later. I'm getting a case for my iPod, so I don't scratch it up, and a trunk for college. Yay. Also whatever else I seem to find at the mall that I may want. I may finally get the All Stars I've been wanting for TWO YEARS NOW!!!  Black with red and orange flames....hellls yes.   I'm off to go and shower now, lol. More later when I actually have something constructive to say.
