"It hurt like a rusty spear tearing through her chest, its jagged edges ripping at her flesh, decemating muscle and bone in its path.  She gasped, fighting for even one breath against this invisible enemy but just wanting to give in to the pain.  How could one person not say anything and manage to destroy her whole world with a glance?"
