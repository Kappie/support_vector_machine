There is absolute crap in town.The only half decent womens clothes shops are:     New Look     Dorothy Perks     Select     Etam     Next          But all of them are either full of crap,cheap looking or expensive.Arghhhhhhhh.The council really should get a move on to get some other shops moving into the area.     I was trying to look for something really purdy for 'Lauras' sweet 16th prom style party, but i found nowt.     Instead i came home with some fairy wings and some milk free biccies which taste like powered crap.     But then what do you expect really..............          So for now     Byebye             Image by  urlLink FlamingText.com
