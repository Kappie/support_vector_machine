The only thing I'm not excited about is having to face Ashleigh, but, I guess I'll just have to learn to block her out...  So, on a lighter note...I got my schedule like 2 weeks ago and I'm going to follow the hip new trend of posting your schedule for the whole internet community to see and have their mouths drop in awe over.  1st Semester:  1. Gov't  Economics - this is weird cause every other school around us takes world studies first, but no, we take this first.. 2. PE - should have taken it in the summer... 3. French 2 - maybe 3...hahahaha! Take that, Wade! Lol 4. Lit 5. Phys. Sci 6. Lunch 7. Study Hall 8. Religion 9. Algebra - yes I am taking it over cause I SUCK at math!  2nd Semester: All the same except... Mod 2: Choir Mod 7: Health  A lot of things are still pending on my schedule, but yah, I'm  really excited!!  Till next time all, (B)uck (F)ush!!  A village in Texas is looking for it's idiot Bush - go home!! Save the environment - Plant a Bush back in Texas I am a full-fledged Bushwhacker and damn proud of it!!!
