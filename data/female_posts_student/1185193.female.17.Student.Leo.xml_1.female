So I bought this really cool tech toy called Virgin Something-Or Rather (I can't remember the whole name, and no, it's not what it may sound like).  Anyways, I bought it for when I go to the gym.  It is a compact am/fm radio..or so I thought when I bought it.  Actually, it turns out to be the most amazing little apparatus I've ever discovered.  Not only does it have the radio, but it has t.v. stations and some other thing that is supposed to be cool that I don't understand.  So when I'm working out, I can listen to live t.v.!  How cool is that?!  Anyways, the bad thing is that it came with those piddely-ass earphones you are supposed to stick in your ears.  Except my ears are deformed because they always fall out.  When sitting.  And you can imagine running.  People probably think I have some kind of rash in my ears because I always touch them to keep the earphones in.  Or if they were intelligent they would see cords hanging down and realize it was a little walkman.  But then it comes back to the issue of deformed ears...*sigh*  So I need your help...I have been given two suggestions to solve this problem:  1.  Hold them in with scotch tape.  (Interesting idea but if I am sweating, won't the tape come off??) 2.  Wear REAL earphones.  The kind that has the band over your head and outer ear covers.  (But isn't that dorky these days?  All the cool people [I'm cool right???] wear the petite, posh ones).  So many choices.  Any suggestions?  Please leave them in "La Caja MÃ¡gica" (for those linguistically challenged, that means "The Magical Box"  :)
