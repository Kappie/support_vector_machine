This guy sounded atleast 17-18, typical "yeah mate i fucked yo mum" and i know that there are alot of these kinds of people out there and most of them are probably great pople but being a girl i only seem to have encounters with the ones who aren't like that, and constantly harass. I cant imagine what has put it in males heads that this would be the way to flatter or even pick up a girl. how insulting, yeah we love being whistled at when were going down the street. I really wish the intellegence levels of some males would increase in this world. Its not like i'm anti-male or anything i just think there should be point where the line is draw, but these guys go way beyond any existing point.  This guy was making empty threats aout how hes going to 'run me over' and 'stab me'. calling me a whore just becuase i was there and the obviously had nothing better to do then harrass some poor little nerd.  The reason he wanted to 'bash' this kid anyway was becuase he, get this 'wrote a text message to his sister'. geez man lock him up and throw away the key. some of these egos need to be let down a bit i reckon.  anyway just wanted to let u all in on a bit of the immaturity going around within teenages these days. have a good night team win members and any other fellow readers.  p.S. pearl, eliza said harry potter was real good..... 'sick' p.p.s. its my brothers birthday tomorrow so i think i might have to have some 'family ting'  (hope my sister isnt there) P.p.p.s. WOLFIE SAYS HELLO
