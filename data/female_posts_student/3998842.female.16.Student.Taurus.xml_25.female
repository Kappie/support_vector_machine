Exhausted.  physically, mentally, emotionally  Dead.  You’ve chosen me.  Your Angel.  Your victim.  Your always.  You’ve brought me down,  stripped me down,  tied me down.  You laid me bare.  Made me open  Made me trust  Made me vulnerable.  You kissed me gently.  You whispered softly.  You touched me slowly.  And then you bled me dry.  Kissed me and consumed me.  Loved me and emptied me.  Filled me and spent me.  2:28 and I remember.  Bloody pages and scarred wrists  from the last time I was bare  the last time I was opened  the last time I trusted.  Tear-stained and blade-weary  My hands,  my pages,  my mind  can take no more.  No more love  No more lust  No more pain.  Blood and chocolate and endless cell phone calls.  I can’t get to you.  Can’t make you see.  Can’t make you understand.  Can’t  understand.  Please don’t leave me  I can’t live without  the luxurious pain you bring  I’m only happy when it rains  Blood, sweat, and tears  my eternal nourishment.  my only nourishment.  2:35 AM.  Lonely and cold.  Dead in the dark  with only the cat to trail  small, bloody footprints  up the stairs,  down the hall  to the room where we kissed  where we loved  where we slept,  where she’ll curl up next to you.  You’ll wake in the night  to her small, frightened body  curled in your arms  and my blood on your hands  at 2:43.
