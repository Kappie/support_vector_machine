I have educated myself and actually did learn the essential thing about education, which lots of people absolutely miss. That is, what I really learned is just how much more there is out there that I have to learn and will never know. I did learn that. But I thought it applied to like books and politics. Certainly not my heart. I did imagine I knew something about loving, but I'm not done there, apparently. I guess if I were done, if this right-here-at-this-moment really was all--I'd have to jump off somewhere. Which I would never really do because I haven't got near the mustard or experienced near the pain I imagine something like that requires. But I was more than prepared, didn't know any better, to go off and live a smart/activist/literary sort of life. And continue being bored to tears at least once a week, for the rest of my days.   Anyway, who I thought I was...would be forever, resiliently, in every situation is not, actually, who I am. And after I told my boyfriend (now ex-) that we couldn't be together anymore, I thanked him for teaching me some really marvelous things. In just a short while. I mean...everyone always says you should never stop learning, trite, trite, trite...yes. But I have to really understand that some day. I have to stop being so surprised when things I could never have conceived happen to me. I think if I could find a perfect little stone somewhere that looked as though the meaning/glue keeping its bits of composite together was "Wait for it, miraculous things will happen to you" I would put it in a little baggie and tie it around my neck like one of those freaks who do that with crystals. Just kidding. Those people are not freaks. Are, actually, nice/cool/upstanding/open-minded characters who have every right to wear whatever they want around their necks. Yes. Good for them. Good for me. We'll wear what we want around our necks to help us have wonder close to our hearts.  Things I used to do:  1. Say, "I don't say that word. It is not in my vocabulary. I don't think people really understand the history, or else no one would say it." And then I heard it, and somehow, I really think it meant love. And so I used it, in love, everyday. AndI was surprised because I liked the way it felt rolling around in my mouth. My lips purse in such a way as they don't for any other word, and I like that. It is possible for things to sound sweet when they weren't invented to be. But as I handle them, put my own tongue and teeth and lips to these words--this one particular word--it is my own. And his. And then we loved one another with it. Imagine if I didn't live in the world whree lots of things are possible. Because what I have learned, and I ingested, is that this word should disappear forever. I'm glad I've tried saying it for a while before I die.  2. Say, "I know how to move on--easily." Before I ever tried anything like it, I never understood people who were in relationships and there were moments that were not as fantastic as, perhaps, the ones right before. Then I got up off my ass and let myself pretend I was this other kind of girl--who is more someone I like than that other and we may have to keep seeing through her eyes for a bit--and got myself grabbed up by this boy who saw through lots of my shit. And me getting into his arms wasn't easy. But when I was comfortable there--fairly squeezed to death in a good way-- sometimes, I knew it was worth that particular daily struggle to be that surrounded. That adored. That unfathomably desired. So, to have never known that someone could feel quite that intensely about oneself, it is easy to see how I thought that it is easy to walk away from being with a person. I simply had no idea. So, he was not perfect. But he was divine for a little while, at certain moments, he was all I ever wanted--right then.  3. I used to believe I could think my way out of falling in love. That reason had something to do with it. And it just sat there, quietly laughing at me, I guess. Falling in love, that is. Knowing that when I was hit--I was going to really be hit. As I am. As I hope to be again, whenever. I'm so open right now.  4. Think that everything was according to my time scale; that I would always call the shots.  5. I used to say, all the time, that I was always falling in love, but I guess not really mean it. And I do, I think. Ushering one thing out and maybe tinkling with another thing so soon is...nice. And young. And not as serious and end-all as I have a tendency to make things.  Hi. Nice to meet you.
