My dad did put a timer on the internet now though, so I can only be online for 1 hour a day, which sucks really bad. Ah well.  So tonight was Halloween. I went to Beth's and we went to that haunted house thing. It was FREAKING SCARY! I screamed every two seconds. And my eyes were closed half the frickin time! I just held on to Kaci and Emily. Haha. And there was this one part where I saw this little opening in the wall that led outside, so I jumped outta there because I thought you were supposed to. I was all relieved because I saw Jack and everyone out there, but turns out, I wasn't supposed to jump out of the hole, so I had to go back in. Haha. Yeah it was a lot of fun. Sorry for screaming in your ear, Kaci!
