Angels vs. Tigers. We lost...again. *sigh* I went to two back to back games against two different teams and the Angels lost both times. Oh well, they're only a game and a half out of the wildcard race so I'm not too worried but still...I like it when the halo is lighted as we leave. It was a close game too, except they kept Lackey in too long and he gave up three runs...ugh. Terrible. Then even Perci didn't do his job last night...he gave up the final two runs...and he's our closer...eh, whatever. I still love the Angels and I'm not going to let go now just because of two measley losses. I bet they do better soon.      It was really fun last night because there were fireworks afterward, and it's always fun spending time with Jason.       I haven't told you about Jason before. We met almost two years ago and we've been dating for fourteen months now. He's absolutely the love of my life. We've talked about marriage but we're not going to get married until we're both older (I'm 17, he's 20) and through with college. I know that some people will always say things like "How can you know that he's the one if you're only 17?" And I thought so too. I was really unconvinced that I could fall in love with someone at 16 (which is when I told him I loved him) but I just knew that I did. It is something you just know. It always annoyed me when people said that but now I totally understand. They tell you that because it's the truth. I've had crushes on other guys and I thought that it was love once but compared to what I have now, it wasn't much.       Anyway, I just wanted to drop in and give you a hello again.      All I want is one comment :-p      ~Katrina
