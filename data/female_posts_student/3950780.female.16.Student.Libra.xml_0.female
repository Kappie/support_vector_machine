And due to lack of sleep I really havent been able to get ontop of doing this.  Well, we brought our students to the airport at 4am yesterday..I cried alot, Im gonna miss them soooo much, I am going to see them in 10 days anyway! But still, they are such awesome people. But Ive been staying up till the wee hours of the morning lately cuz my sleep schedule is really thrown off, thanks noel...lol jk...you know i love talking to you.   But i have to work tomorrow...at the bayview from 830-2, then i have a japan fundraiser from 230-430, then jake is coming over at 5. So im gonna be pretty busy tomorrow. but i really have nothing left to write...and im busy talking on msn messenger... So laterz... love espresso
