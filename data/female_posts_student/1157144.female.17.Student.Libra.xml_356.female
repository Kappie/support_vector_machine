Girls:  Seriously, what is the importance of knowing what a dress looks like?  I don't mean to be...  mean, but I just want to try and understand why it is so important? Jason:  I pity your soul, because I'm sure that Anne will develop a crush for you, you know, you being in your tight suit and all. To All1:  How was the cabbinning?  oh and by the way, Ryan...did you enact our devilish plan? To All2:  I want to see the Cowboy Bebop movie also, I like that show.  Oh and by the way, what happens (in the DBZ series) once Bu is defeated and Goku goes to live with Ub? To All3:  I like the snow also, I hate DBQs, and I love FinalFantasy9  (has anyone played that game?) To All4:  So Cal was so murda, but I don't think I can get into any of the schools now...
