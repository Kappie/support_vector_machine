And since I won't be writing in this blog for personal reasons, then I decided to post it here to at least make it look like I wrote something. There'll be 3 parts to it, since it's just so fuggin' long, so it'll take up the space of three days. It's actually entertaining to read,and it killstime.Behold! My AR "editorial"!  Saturday, November 8, 2003 - All-Region Tryouts Phase I  Worst. Day. Ever. A pain in the neck, and those AR tryouts were not worth at all. But I'll start from the beginning. Since these tryouts were on a Saturday, it ruined my whole weekend. I put my alarm to wake me up at 7.20 'cause I had to get to the band hall at 8 AM. Of course, I woke up earlier than that because I was nervous. I always get nervous before a contest for some reason. Some time before we went to the AR tryouts, Ms. Fedynich and the band made a promise that 32 of the whole band would make it to an AR spot. We had to get to Mensfield at 9 o clock, and I think that the tryouts started at 9.30 or so. Once we got there we had to warm-up a little bit, then we had to find out what room we were supposed to play in. For those ignorants out there who don't know what the All-Region tryouts are, I'll tell you: they're crap. Ok, so they're not crap most of the time, but usually they are. I'll explain what they are.  Some time in September, your band director gives you these two pieces (three if you're in high school) which are called etudes. They give you a fast etude and a slow etude (a medium etude if in high school). You have to learn the etudes before you can go to the AR tryouts. I really don't know if they're mandatory or if you can decide if you want to go, but Ms. F made us go anyway and we didn't have a choice. Anyways, when I was gonna try out for an AR band (8th grade), they didn't make us learn the whole piece. We just had to learn half of it. I'm guessing that if you're in hs, you have to learn the whole thing. Learning those two etudes was a pain in the neck. We had chair tests over those, and heck, it was a lot of hard work. The etudes that the flutes got were: fast etude - BourrÃ©e Anglaise (Sonata for Flute), written by Bach. The tempo of this etude was quarter note equals 80-92. The slow etude was Selected Studies for Flute, C Major written by Heinze. Tempo was quarter note equals 72-90. Of course, we had to play it at 72 because a slow piece is not supposed to go at 90. That's just too fast. Not only do you have to learn those two etudes, but in middle school you have to learn the 7 major scales and the chromatic. Out of those 7 major scales, the AR people will choose 2 scales, and you'll always have to play the chromatic. The scales have to be memorized, and you have to tongue them up and slur them down.  Once you try out and the judges decide what chair you're in, you're put in a band. There's two kinds of bands: a Symphonic and a Concert band. If you get placed in the Symphonic band, then that means that you kicked arse during the AR tryouts and you were one of the best ones. If you got into the Concert bands, then that means you played good, but not good enough to be in the Symphonic band. That doesn't mean you suck, though. If you didn't make it to either band but the judges think that you played good, you'll be an Alternate. If someone from the Symphonic or Concert band can't go to the rehearsals, then an Alternate will be picked and you'll play in their spot. Once it's been confirmed on what chair and band you're in, you'll receive this folder with pieces of music that you have to learn before an All-Region concert. But, I'll explain more about that later.  Depending on how many people of your instrument try out for an AR spot, it will determine if there will be one phase or two phases. Instruments like the flute and clarinet had to have two phases, because there were about 300 people from different schools competing. Bigger instruments like the tuba and bari sax only have one phase. The first phase will consist of playing two scales, the chromatic memorized, and parts of your fast and slow etude. Once you're done playing the scales, you have to play the parts of an etude that the judges choose. If you play the tuba or a bari sax or a bigger instrument with not too many people for competition, you're done for the day. You go outside (by outside I mean the "cafeteria"... we were in a school-sort-of-thing) and wait for a lady to post the results to see what band you made it to and what chair. But, if you play the clarinet or something like that, you have to do the second phase. Once you're done with the first phase, you have to go outside and see if your letters are posted up to see if you made it to the second phase. Now, let's talk about the letters...  As you can see, this AR stuff is really confusing and it takes a while to get done. When you arrive to the place where they're gonna held the All-Region tryouts, you have to look for the room that you're gonna be in and play off your stuff. In each room there's a monitor. You have to talk to that monitor, give him or her your name, and she'll give you two letters on which you'll be known as. The letters that I got were DE. When you're playing your scales or whatever to the judges, they won't know your name. The only thing that you're known as to them is the two letters that you got. Of course, the judges will be behind some kind of curtain so they can't see who you are.  Now that everything has been explained, let's go back to my crappy day. As usual, I was nervous and I couldn't warm up. I guess I was excited. My stomach felt weird, but I knew that this day would be over. I was trying to get a better chair than Michelle. Yes, folks, I was competing against her. I was determined to beat her on AR since she had beaten me every single time that we had a chair test in our school.  My good friend Sally and I play about the same level. As I have mentioned before, 89% of the time that we had some kind of chair test, we'd be sitting right next to each other. Sally-chan told me that if I did good on the tryouts, she'd do good. If I did bad, she would do bad. Who knew that would be true at the end?  The only person that I had in my room and that I knew was Sarah B. The other people were just... unknown to me. I was the first one to play my scales. I thought I did awesome! Of course, I had to wait for everyone to play their other scales. Then the second part of the first phase started. Now I was the last one to play. Yet again, I though I kicked arse. I have never played so good before... If I kept this up, I would easily get a top chair. I was so happy right then.  By right now, for a lot of people, AR tryouts were over. What made me upset the most was that Regi didn't make it to any of the bands, much less an Alternate. What? But she's a good player! I could see that she was disappointed. Goddess dang it! I'm sure the judges were fugged up, 'cause I just know that she's a kick arse player. To make things worst, Rona had made it to the Symphonic band. No, I'm not saying that I didn't want her to make it, it's just that Regina had some competition with Rona... she wanted to beat Rona, but it turned out she didn't get a better chair than her. Dang it! >.  I had also found out that So-Young, the best saxophone player you'll ever hear, hadn't made it to the Symphonic band, but instead, she had been first chair of the Concert band. What?! I was sure that she'd made it to the Symphonic band but... I mean, Concert band? I now knew for sure that the judges were extremely fugged up to the max! Ugh... I was just... shocked that she hadn't made it to the Symphonic band... She seemed kinda disappointed, too, and I remembered she said, "Yeah... well..." I know it doesn't say much, but dang it, I could see she was upset. What the heck was wrong with these idiotic judges?!  If you didn't make it to the second phase or you were done with the AR tryouts, you had to take a bus with your director that would take you back to your school. I anxiously waited for the results. When I saw a lady go and post a piece of paper where they post the results, I ran over there to see if I had made it. Boo-yah, I made it to the second phase. By now it was around 11.30 AM or so. Maybe 12 PM... I was starving. So I decided to eat. I was so happy that I had made it to the second phase. Sally, Yaqui, Michelle, and other people made it, too. Most of the flutes did pretty well, and a few had to take the bus back to school.  I don't remember when the second phase was gonna start, but they gave us quite a long break. Once I had finished my lunch, all my happiness was gone. I felt tired, and I wanted to go home. I was sick of all this AR tryouts crap. My back was hurting and I was sleepy. At that point, my excitement to play was somewhere else. I was starting to think that I will not be playing as good as I had done while inthe first phase.
