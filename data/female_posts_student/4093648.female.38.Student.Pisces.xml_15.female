He appeared to just be in the mood to find fault with me and wasn't picky about what.  Every few sentences he would change his complaint to something new and by the end of the conversation had criticized me for just about anything one can imagine.      Solving whatever the problem was didn't seem to be the point.  Finding something to make me the bad guy about was his focus. Last night he gave me flowers and today I was source of everything offensive in his life. I'm tired of this kind of abuse. Why should I be his punching bag any time he's in a bad mood.  I don't take it personally, but still. Enough is enough.      I hoped we could be friends and partners if not spouses, but he's not being much of a friend.
