Comcast is really friggin' expensive compared to Time Warner cable, but when you've got one channel 'a la carte' at $5.95 a month for 3 months, and then the price jacks up to $20.95 - FOR ONE CHANNEL, PEOPLE! - you start to think, if I've been paying $20 extra for the past 3 months because I've been too lazy to call and cancel the channel (and face it, we kinda like the channel) I may as well make this work for me.  The Platinum package is $20 more.  So basically I could get ALL the channels for the same price as what I was paying for one.    So that's just what I did.  Now there's a gazillion channels to watch about 3 things.  heh.  So anyway, we watched  The Four Feathers  which wasnt good enough to see in the theaters or rent, but it was good enough to stay indoors on a hot saturday afternoon.   Saturday evening was a party for Steve's Uncle Eli all the way out there in Long Island.  It was a surprise party for his 60th birthday (aww). Steve's Aunt decided to get all these estranged family members over to celebrate and bond with the rest of us.  It was really great.  Irish/Scots and Puerto Ricans together.  It was a fun time.  I got ribbed for not knowing how to dance salsa, and as per usual at a Spic party, the cake didnt come out until 11:30 pm or so.  HAHAHA!  Eli was very surprised and very touched that everyone came out for him.  Aww.    It got me thinking - my mother is going to be 70 next year and it  would  be kinda nice to find some long lost relatives and have them come out to celebrate it.  Of course I have NO IDEA how to get in touch with all these people nor do I know whether or not they'd travel from DR or Alaska to celebrate.  We'll see.  I have a year to work on it...  Sunday I decided, 'dammit if I have this big ass yard, I may as well use it' so I took an old sheet, threw on some tanning lotion and layed my ass out there to get a little color.  No self-respecting Dominican should be as pale as I am.  I was having such a good time... reading my  Entertainment Weekly  and listening to Lenny Kravitz's  5  album when the CD started to skip!!  I was SOOO distraught!!  What am I to do NOW?!  I guess I have to maybe see if I can burn it (and maybe the skips wont come out).  I also can't find my Maxwell's  Urban Hang Suite  CD anywhere.  And my brother took back the Marc Anthony  Contra La Corriente  CD that I kinda stole from him about 2 years ago.  That's like, the ONLY Salsa album I had (even if it wasn't MINE) and I loved it.  Yeah, I know I shoulda burned it but I didn't.  So, yeah, I have like, NO good tanning music right now.  But I digress.  I was only out there for about 45 minutes by the time I felt like my skin was frying and I went inside.  Since I'm so pale I used an SPF 8.  I still feel white.  I think I may have to use baby oil, fry, get red and THEN get tan in order for this shit to work.  And, of course, its going to be rainy all week so no sun for Dy-Dy!  On another note, saw this new USA show called  urlLink The 4400  which was pretty good last night.  I'm sure they'll re-run it this week.  Check it out if you can.  Its a pretty cool concept and show.  Try it, you'll like it! :-)
