There is no property common to all houses which you can use to say “If x has P, then x is a house.” So what makes a house? And, what tells me when something is a house and when its not?   Consider all the things we might in certain situations point to and say “That’s a house”: (A) A house built in a museum for an exhibit, (B) A family living in a heavily modified abandoned gym, (C) A house built but never lived in…  And the things we don’t call a house: (X) A pile of sticks beavers have assembled to live in, (Y) A family living in an abandoned gym, (Z) A homeless man’s cardboard box…   What could possibly be common to all houses? I think there is a property common to all houses, however only in an extended sense of the word. Here it goes: A house is anything that we will react to by calling it a house. This definition of a house probably depends heavily on the social use of the word “house” more than individual use: One person reacting to a bobcat with “that’s a house” would not make bobcats into houses.  But what if we started using the word “house” to also apply to: (D) chairs. Don’t we want to say there is something natural about the grouping of (A), (B), and (C) under one word and not (A), (B), (C), and (D). That “house” in the first sense labels one abstract thing, and that “house” in the second sense is a conjunction of two abstract things (i.e. houses and chairs).   Following where this feeling leads us, we get dangerously close to an abstract Essentialist Platonism.   So, my able peers, I ask you to ponder what is it that makes (A), (B), and (C) a correct grouping and (A), (B), (C), and (D) an incorrect one. If indeed a house is just whatever we react to by calling a house, than what is wrong with us suddenly reacting to chairs with the word “house” as well?
