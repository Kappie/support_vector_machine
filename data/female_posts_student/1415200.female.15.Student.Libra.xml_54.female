Im the ephiphany of a geek.  Theres a new kid in school. Got a good sense of humor, nice personality. Someone I need to get to know better. Yeah. Valentine's Day is in three days. Oh, joy. Another Valentines Day wasted on my own self loathing because im too big of a loser to have anyone. Go me. And me and sarah's buisness hasnt recieved any customers. Yeah. Thats what I thought. If I could see into the future when I was 6, and see just how I turned out, I would killed myself then. I'll take 'X' for the block. School does nothing but bore me anymore. The only class I actually enjoy would be Algebra because it's a challenge, Public Speaking because Kozar is a riot and the people are awesome in there. And French is above all because it owns. Dont listen to "I love you, Not" by Homegrown. Its nothing but a flashback. Yeah all my entries are like I have ADD. Random Comment here, there. There everywhere. I'm thinking about everything wayy to much again. When that happens I start feeling sick. I feel sick. Why cant anything good ever happen to me? I think I've paid my dues. Something good hasta happen. You would think. You would also think wrong.  Yeah Im gonna go. I need to work on this gay template and figure stuff out.  I dont care anymore.
