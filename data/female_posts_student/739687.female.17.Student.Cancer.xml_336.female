Well, anyways...I finished my homework at 6:30 this morning and I felt really sick because of my allergies and the fact that I have no voice...so I slept. Until 4. Oh boy.  "Sunday was a day of rest, now it's one more day for progress, and we can't slow down, 'cuz more is best, it's all an endless process..."  Boy is that ever true.  I still haven't written this english paper that was due today. But I know what I'm writing about, and it's going to be...great. It's awesome stuff. Like my TAKS essay...boy oh boy I wish I had written that for something more important than some gay standardized test shit.  Tic Tacs are addictive. The orange ones mostly. Yummy.  Got my pictures developed yesterday...fantastic. Fantastic that SO MANY DIDN'T TURN OUT!  Oh well, my mom still has to get the digital ones developed. That's good.  I don't know how I have such great friends. They're not just those high school buddies that will party with you and hang out and chill and stuff. I mean, they do, but they're more than that. They'll watch my back, and I'll do the same for them in a sec. They kick some major ass.  Boy summer is coming upon me fast. I can FEEL it on it's way. I'm really connected to the summer.  It's MY season...I mean, I was born in summer, I grew up in summer, I've laughed in summer, I've loved in summer...I live for the summer.  I'm definately gonna party lots this summer.  I need to start getting a freakin' tan! And working out. God I suck.  Ehh, I'll get to it...as for now...homework and I need to mess with this template cuz I have no links to my archives.  Shine on, crazies.
