I now do it every hour under the sun! It's terrible, apart from today though I have only done 1 hour today, and nothing yesterday, I have promised on this computer and hereby in writting that I  WILL  start tomorrow!  Are you going to the thing @ the Grove next week end, Saturday 14:00 @ the Grove to mess around, leave whenever??? xx
