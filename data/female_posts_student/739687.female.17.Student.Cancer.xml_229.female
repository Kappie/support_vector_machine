I don't like having to start all over. I wish I wasn't running around in circles all the time. Which is why I have to just move on. Again.  I have something to do today. Something important. Well, not of some amazing importance, but something that is gonna help me get up on my feet again. And it's going to make me happy. I need to take care of that today.  A day off can really be refreshing. I'm definately feeling better than I was yesterday. I think another part of me moving on is figuring out who my friends are. What's funny is that my friends are who they've always been...I've just failed to take notice in all the chaos of everything.  I want to get back to being content. *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  On another note, I've done nothing exciting lately. Nothing is really that exciting.  God, I am sick of posting about all this stupid shit. All this blah blah life sucks but it'll get better...who cares?  Things are fine. Everything is fine. People overreact about everything. I'm very VERY guilty of that. Haha, ahhhhhhh, whhhy do I overreact?   No more overreacting.  That's my goal for the rest of my life. No more freaking out over stupid shit.  Well, crazies, I have things to do today. Later.
