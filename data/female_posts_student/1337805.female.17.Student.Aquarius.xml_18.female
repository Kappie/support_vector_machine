You blow you english teacher away last year with your talent, and she says you'd better be planning on taking honors for the rest of your years, its a waste of talent otherwise.  Next year comes around, and you walk into your new, english honors class. You dont feel as smart as everyone else, but the teacher still encourages you and you try your best. You get the lowest grade in the class, and later, in the mail you get a letter saying "Sorry, but we regret to inform you that you are not accepted into honors next year." Suddenly you doubt your great ability to write, and then everything else..Are you really that talented? Are you really that pretty? Smart? Funny?  Funny how one letter for english can change your entire outlook on life. Liam, I still love you, even if you don't know whether you still love me.
