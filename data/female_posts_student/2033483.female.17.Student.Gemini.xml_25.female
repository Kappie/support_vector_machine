I've been working my ass off to catch up on everything that I missed on Monday.  Today the Nationalist finally came out! YAY!  The Band Folk were all very pleased with Jessica and my article which was uplifting and Mr. Powers couldn't say enough good things about it.  This makes me very, very happy!  If the Band Folk hadn't of liked it, that would have been awful!  Newspaper was fun...but it always is.   And Renae...1.  I don't like him ;-)                     2. Why do I need new crushes?                     3. I'm a dick...I'm addicted to YOU! And Erica.....1. You do not have to make it your personal mission to get me a date to Winter formal. OKAY?!  I really have nothing much to say b/c my life has been uneventful the last few days.    toodles~
