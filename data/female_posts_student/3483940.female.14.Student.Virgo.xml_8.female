I think they understood it too, which felt kinda good. Everything is just so complicated, so complicated you cant even explain it. Its funny how one thought can lead right to another and continue to many more thoughts. Or how one thing can have so many different meanings just from the thoughts or feelings of different people. How one simple thing can mean so much. People are wierd. When you think of people, you can think of so many different things. Its crazy. Today has been an alright day. In a split second tonight i went from happy, feeling good, to straight pissed at the world. but now im not sure how i feel. I dont know if im happy or not. Its kinda odd. i just need school to be done. i have 4 days to study for finals. i havent started studying yet. but i honestly dont care. I feel like im going to puke. And i have a headache. and its not makeing it anybetter being on the computer. But im going to go to bed soon. its wierd how i feel right now. because i dont know. and its making me mad. And i know that no one is perfect, No one is. People just annoy me when they think that they are better then everyone else... and then make them feel stupid when they have to say something. haha. hmmm... goodnight.
