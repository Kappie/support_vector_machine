Promises are much likely like butterflies, Beauty Butterflies but then it will also disappear, But I believe the promise you gave me, Just like the spring that will certainly come.   I will always bring the smile you love, Looking for the beauty I lost on the road, When tears flow to your eyes, Just use your hands to wash it out. And even more sadness will come, I’ll just look for the beauty I once lost No one can clearly say when. But no one can replace it.   Promise is much like a butterfly, Beauty Butterflies but then it will disappear, But I believe the promise you gave me, It’s like the spring that will certainly come.   In the second of every beginning , Even sometimes determines to fail.. And although fate likes to be joking But it the end,.. True heart will meet true heart..    ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
