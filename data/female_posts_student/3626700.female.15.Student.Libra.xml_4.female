I have been praying and praying all week for them to be easy enough for me to pass and for me to have the wisdom to understand what im doing and to be able to let this week pass by comfortly without stress. I totally put everything in God's hands, leaving it up to him to carry me through all of the exams. Well ive gotten through two today, actually 1 4/5 but i can finish that up tomorrow because of my charming witts--and of course her not knowing how long she made the test. but all in all, i feel pretty good about them. there are 2 advantages to Giving everything to Christ to handle and having faith that he will pursue. One- It is A LOT less stressful then holding the world up on your own 2 shoulders. and two- It pleases the Lord.  "But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him"- Hebrews 11:6  The bible talks a lot about having faith and about people who had faith. In the world, you don't often see much faith. In fact, some people are negative almost all the time. Any time you presented them with a big idea, they will start rattling off reasons why it wont work automatically. That's not faith.  In order to please God, you've got to have faith. You've got to be sure of "the substance of things hoped for" and to believe in what you can't see. God does give people dreams and ideas; and most of the time they seem bigger than your abilities and resources. He wants you to be absolutely positive that he can make it happen.  Start by believing in the bible. Faith can really grow as you begin to get confident in  His Word. Dont just memorize some verses. Get them into your heart. Try them and let God show you he means business. He's good for His Word. Believing Him is crucial, and no one else can do it for you. You have to develop your own faith and determine not to be shaken. You'll see it work and Gow will be pleased.  "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a Good testimony. By faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that the things that were seen were not made of things which are visible."- Hebrew 11:1-4  "behold the proud, His soul is not upright in him; But the just shall live by his faith." - Habakkuk 2:4  "Have faith in God."-Mark 11:22  "Your faith has saved you. go in peace." Luke 7:50  " watch, stand fast in faith, be brave, be strong.Let all that you do be done with love." - 1 corinthians 16: 13-14  "For we walk by faith and not by sight." - 2 corinthians 5:7  "We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is fitting, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of everyone of you all bounds towards each other, so that we ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your patience and faith in your persecutions and tribulations that you endure."- 2 thessalonians 1:3-4  "Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses."- 1 timothy 6:12   Carried by christ,  Samantha.
