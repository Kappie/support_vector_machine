Like all kids across the city, fifth-grade classmates Tasha Baxter, Rodney Green, and Octavia Harrison were discovering that back-to-school now meant special safety lessons, indoor recess, and being thrown into a world their parents couldn't comprehend, one in which the everyday challenges of growing up were coupled with constant fear -- the news of the murders of one's peers."  That's from the book jacket of  urlLink "Leaving Atlanta," by Tayari Jones.   Get this book now, people.
