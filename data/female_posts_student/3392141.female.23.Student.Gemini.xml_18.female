BUT it's not as exciting as MY BOLSTER!!! it's covered with a million teddy bears! *hyperventilate* i love my bolster... but not as much as my boyfriend *grin* (sorry Bobo {my bolster's name} i still love you more but don't tell him when he lies next to you tonight ok?)  anyways, back to reconciling with my notes and books... *groans*
