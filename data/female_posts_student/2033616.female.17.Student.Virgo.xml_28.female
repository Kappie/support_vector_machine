Speaking of which... i really really want to see that movie, Love Actually, oh but it's rated R... and there are only so many people that would be interested in going, or able to go for that matter, so sad... and takers????  Back to my week Tuesday.... well tuesday was Sam's birthday.  Sam and i havn't been speaking for a couple of weeks, however it wasn't just her... none of my friends had been talking to me for some time, no one really knows what happened.  Well I was delivering Meals on Wheels with my mother on tuesday, there being no school, and we were dropping food off at a house just two blocks from sam's.  It hit me that Sam's birthday was going to go by with out a word from me about Happy Birthday.  I hold birthdays as a very very important day, and i feel like it's a day that should make you HAPPY, to be you.  So i wasn't going to let the fact that i wasn't invited to her party, or that i was upset with her, keep her from not hearing that... even though i was upset, i still cared.  So, my mom dropped me off, i went to the door... the doorbell wasn't working so her dad, who was outside, told me to just go in, they're in there.  So i did, i opened the door and was facing Sam's mom, sam aris jamie lindsey and megan, it was like being on trial.  I told them hi, and wished sam a happy birthday.  At first i felt like i was getting this look of "why are you here" but then when i said happy birthday, she actually smiled... so i thought that was a good sign.  I told her I was sorry, whished her a happy birthday again, and left.  I was shaking for the next 10 minutes.    It apparantly really really surprised Jamie and Aris and I have hung out with them every day since.  However i havn't heard from anyone else, not even sam.  Apparantly she saw it as some act i put on to try and upstage her birthday party or something.  I had no intention of doing anything but saying I'm sorry for the last time, and wishing her a happy birthday.  If she wants to accept it, that's up to her, but i've done all i can do.  So, Wednesday, voice lesson.. which went really really well.  I'm going to be in a recital on the 6th of December at 10 am... more on this as it develops.  After lessons i went to Jamie's house, we had planned to talk things over, but it kinda seems that a combination of sunday and tuesday sorta cleared up things.  I'm sure we'll talk about it eventually.  After Jamie's, i went to the Cell group at Sara's house.  It was a lot of fun, i got to see Sara, and it was kinda cool seeing how well another cell group was working.  Kudos to Josh harmon for inviting me.  Thursday... MY FORMAL DRESS IS HERE!!!! woo woo.  It's so pretty! i love it. i put it on 3 times, once to see if it fit, then twice and three times for aris and jamie, who stopped by to hang out.  I love it I love it I love it.  Oooo i love to get all dressed up.  I can't wait for formal, now if only i could figure out who i'm going with :-/  (Jack's not the MOST reliable guy out there, i don't know if it would all really work out)  Friday, it wasn't the greatest day, but i was still happy... for some reason.  Isn't that I sign of insanity?  Anyway, laura and i got in an argument with Kyle.  It was about 3/4 just joking around, but it still is bothering me.  I get the feeling he really does think i blame MK for everything.  He doesn't see how MK and I joke around.  He doesn't get that I'm joking.  No, me makes me out to be this horrible brat, and it hurts.  So afterschool, he was working in the auditorium, and i was very very close to going to talk to him, to try and clear stuff up, but I decided not to.  That was the second person to run away that i really needed to talk to.  So I was a little stressed out and the 50 pounds of junk i was carrying was really starting to hurt.  So I then MK ran off and i found out she was in the library... doing nothing but bothering Brandon Van Westen.  So i left school in a very very bad mood, then Kurt needed a ride home, so i calmed down a bit, i can't be mean to my friends... but my sisters.. that's different.  Drove Kurt home and brought MK and Laura home. I was exauhsted and I decided to finish the movie i started a week ago.  I didn't finish it b/c at 7 i decided i was going to go fins someone and talk to them before i go crazy... well i didn't talk to them b/c i never found them, but Aris called.  So i went to Jamie's V-ball game at OG, they lost and Jamie was very very very upset.  So we went out for Chinese to try and cheer Jamie up.  No state for Washington :-( sorry Jamie.  Then i came home... fell asleep, woke up, went to bed... couldn't get to sleep.. but i suppose i eventually did.  I woke up around 10:30 and wrote this, now i'm going to go do homework for the rest of my life.  Have a superb day everyone
