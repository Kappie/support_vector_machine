Ever since I started this running program and following it pretty regularly, I have not had an appetite. I don't like forcing something down just because I haven't eaten. When I do eat its usually a quesadillia and some milk. I stopped eating red meat about 2 years ago, and I have chicken on an occasional basis. I do eat pasta for dinner when I get hungry. I also drink water.  I use to be full of energy and always willing to do anything at anytime. But since this training I find myself sleeping all day on the weekends and when I do wake up in the day I am ready to go back for another nap. I have taken 2 naps today and I am exhausted. During the week I am tired and I don't' get the luxury of taking a nap. I know its not because of depression because I was diagnosed a year ago and have been on medication ever since. I guess my question is, could I be exhausted because I am over training....(I run maybe 2-4 times a week, about 3-6 miles during the week and my long run on Saturday's) or is it because of my diet. If its my diet how can I eat when I am not hungry.
