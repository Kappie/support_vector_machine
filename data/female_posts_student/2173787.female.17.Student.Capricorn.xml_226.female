So instead I am relegated to this house, to this room.  I look out the window and it looks beautiful-sunny and still lush- but the second you step through the door it hits you, draining everything from your body.  How can we be expected to do well on exams in weather like this?  How can we be expected to be motivated and to complete late calculus assignments?  What happened to the cool weather?
