We're planning a thing to celebrate the end of the school year. So far, we've figured that it will include the beach and guacamole. I have two APs tomorrow. This day was the calm before the storm. But at least I don't have to go to school tomorrow :) And now I'm off to study a little, and then go to the beach again with my mommy and my brother. Bye. Love, Insha  P.S. Happy Mothers' day. Remember to tell your mom you love her and give her a hug. Or I'll hunt you down and kill you.
