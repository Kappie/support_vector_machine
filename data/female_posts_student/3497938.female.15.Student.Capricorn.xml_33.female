So that is kinda fun. Drew and Kayla are going out now. Yeah, did anyone tell me? No, I had to find out by joking around with him.*dont ask* So yeah, my "best friend" couldnt even call and tell me. So, whatever. Im happy for Kayla and Drew. They deserve to be happy. But what about me? I deserve to be happy, too. Dont I? I like a guy, but he is 2 years younger than me. I dont know if it would work or not. Plus, I know I would get made fun of by someone. Dont know who, but someone would. But, maybe it's worth it. Maybe not. He doesnt feel that way about me...I dont think. I got to drive alot today, thats a woohoo!!! Tomorrow is another day of driving school. Im kinda lookin forward to it. But that means its almost over. I'll have to get numbers from people so we can all chill. Yeah, thats it for now. But, whatever...
