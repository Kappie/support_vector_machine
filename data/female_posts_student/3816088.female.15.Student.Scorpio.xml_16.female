How come whenever you think you have something really really really good coming your way and is in your grasp there is always something that has to come in your way. Sometimes it is a really good thing and sometimes its a really bad thing and sometimes its just annoying like mine. Annoying because you dont know what to do. You dont want to do one thing because you afraid youll look like you want something and you dont want to do the other thing because your afraid you will hurt someone. i am soo clueless and have no idea what to do!
