We were hoping that a few of the newbies would come along, but it ws just the usual crowd.  Even Liz and Rob turned up and they held hands while they were running to get a drink, it was so sweet (urgh!).  Ah, young love!  The AUG/Committee meeting was held at John's last night, althought it seemed like a lot of theorising and delegating and not many decisions.  The minutes are very entertaining though :)  We got our fundraising chocolate and I sold $5 worth to Bart a) because he thought that he wouldn't sell any so it wasn't worth him getting a box and b) I had no change and he only had fiver.  We went to throw the firsbee in the park, in the rain and Bart slipped and landed on his arse.
