He's telling me I'm basically going to get raped and/or kidnapped because I'm going to a concert thing in a dangerous part of town. Did he care last week when I went, when I wasn't the one driving??  Nooo....he didn't. Huh. Interesting. "Back in my day..I wasn't driving in downtown Grand Rapids...no, I was helping my dad prepare his sermons for CHURCH!" That was a little exaggerated but it's pretty much the truth. I mean, I don't really want to be abducted TONIGHT but if I stay here, in this dumb-ass town for much longer, I'm sure that will change. It's like I can't be killed by a drunk where I live...noo....Because drunks only live there. They can suck it.  Until we meet again...
