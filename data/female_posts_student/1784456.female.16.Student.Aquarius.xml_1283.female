I tried to be smart and plug it back in but I was afraid my computer would go 'kablamo!' Yeah, so ahhh I'm ok I guess. I've been thinking too much again. Kind of hard though cause it's soooo COLD! Geez, winds of -9 oC? What's with that! Aaargh, I'm all soopy again *sad even*. The reason why I look so angry all the time is that I have no reason to be nice. Weird huh? When I was younger, people that I didn't know were horrible to me, so if I'm angry around them and they don't want to approach me then they have no reason to pick on me. I'd rather be a small insignificant blotch then a big spill.
