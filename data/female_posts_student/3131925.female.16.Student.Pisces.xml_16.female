Especially Strand Rats. -E.T. almost got me and came through the fucking computer. -Marie was abducted by aliens, raped and impregnated then given an abortion, then they put a tracking divice in her, like Truman Show.  It was one hell of a night, always interesting on Strand with the girls..can't wait till summer! More partyin to do of course..
