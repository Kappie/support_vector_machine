I'm always reminded during Moscow summers when a small rumbling that sounds like the upstairs neighbors' dishwasher rolls over the...well, rolling hills of the Palouse.  Always wish we could have a good storm like we used to have once in a while in Poky.  The kind that woke me out of a deep slumber in my cave in the basement and shook the entire house.    Barely beat the "storm" this afternoon, walking home from work.  But the lightning, when it appears, puts on a pretty good show up here.  Remember lying awake one summer night two years ago, losing yet another battle with insomnia, watching a storm form and turn into a great light show.  Took some comfort in the knowledge that even had I gone to sleep hours before, when I went to bed, I wouldn't have slept through this.  The next morning in my American TV Genres summer school class, my professor yawned and said, "Yes, I was up last night, watching the lightening with my cats."    And this afternoon, the apartment did a slight tremble after the bright flash slashed through the dark clouds, all of which was impressive, for Moscow.  But now, three hours and a cheap movie ("Mean Girls" with Calamity Jane; we love you, Tina Fey...keep making non-SNL-character movies, please) later, the skies are clear and the hills are just a bit greener.
