Who in god's name could have seen this coming?  There's more to Jerse than the Sopranos, Bruce Springsteen, Sinatra and the shore, though.  Stay tuned.  [My graduate school professors warned us this would happen, but I thought they meant like, with our dissertations or whatever. Not with our blogs.  Jesus!]
