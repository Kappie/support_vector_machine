(for those of you who aren't familiar with my random thoughts on hell, i separate various hells.  for example, people who are bad friends go to friend hell.  people who are bad with their families go to family hell.  and so on and so forth.)  so, it is currently dating hell for me.    see, there is this guy at work who is fun and who i do like, but only in the short term, let's hang out and not be serious sense.  certainly not in the "wow, you are awesome and i want to spend lots of time with you for an undetermined amount of time."  so, while i am interested in short and low key, he appears to be more interested in the more serious option.  so....what do i do?  oh, it's easy.  i say yes when he asks me to do something, regardless of if i want to or not (it's easier than saying no and making him feel badly...frelled up, i know, but one of my issues) and then if i decide i REALLY don't want to do whatever it is i have committed to, i just call and cancel.  case and point - i was supposed to go to a movie tonight with him, but i just called and feigned a friend emergency that necessitated my attention immediately.  now, i wouldn't normally mind going to a movie, but i did just hang out with him last night for several hours (a long time) and don't really feel that i want to hang out with him again already.  but instead of telling him all of this, as clearly i should have, i fibbed.  or lied.  thus, i will be in dating hell.  in case anyone is looking for me.  on an unrelated note, i didn't make it home last night, due to some alcohol consumption.  so, this morning, when i rolled in the house, stumbling in my jeans, pointy shoes and tank top, reeking of a mix of miller light, oberon and jager, seeing maggie in the entry way waiting for me was the last thing i wanted.  but yeah, she was there anyhow.  arms crossed and scold securely fastened upon her face.  agh.  yeah, she wasn't really mad, just more concerned.  (bear in mind, i live all the way across the country eight months out of the year where she has NO idea what i am doing or when i am coming home, but that appears to be irrelevant.)  anyhow, instead of going promptly to bed (i had accumulated TWO hours of sleep by eight am) as i really really wanted to, i sucked it up, sprayed some perfume and joined family sunday morning, which consists of getting chai (me) and lattes (mags and carrol) before wandering through the grocery store buying various things for the large family brunch that followed.  yeah, that was a real treat.
