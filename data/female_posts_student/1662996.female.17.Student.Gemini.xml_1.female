But he cheered me up, so thats good.   My france trip is 29 days and counting! I'm really excited but the trip home is gunna be a little scary. I guess I have to take a train from Brest in Brittany to Paris (which is like taking a train from the very far west edge of texas to the middle of texas)... by myself... take a taxi from the train station to a hotel... by myself... and check myself in to the hotel where I'll stay... by myself. eep! I need to improve on my french because i dont remember anything from french III. 'Je voudrais beze' is what i was told to say when checking into the hotel. for those of you that know french, thats the worst thing you can say to check yourself into a hotel and for that matter, the worst thing you could say to any french speaking person.   Here's a lesson for all people: don't make assumptions of people you don't know and haven't taken the time to get to know them. It will lead to people getting frustrated. Also, dont go along with what people tell you about someone. Most of the time it isnt true and it just spreads incorrect information about the person. So please, grow up, punch yourself in the face, and stop making assumptions.  ::kuff::
