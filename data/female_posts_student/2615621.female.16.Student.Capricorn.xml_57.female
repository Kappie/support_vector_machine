REALLY EXCITED! i cant wait. i'm gonna be sooo happy to see my older brother, because jack and i have this bond that i dont have with anyone else. we never really get into fights, we can have serious intellgent conversations and joke around. i miss the times when he would come home from wake forest and sit with me in the basment. he would bring up the topic of his latest gf and he would ask me questions about what he should do or say or think about something she had done. jack was always living away from home since he was like 13, so we didnt get to "grow up" together, even though he is my brother. i pretended not to enjoy it, but i loved having those chats in the basement with him. *..feeling the tears coming on* it was like words werent needed between us, we could just be in the same room. then he goes and moves to hondoras and i dont see him for a year..fun stuff. im excited about seeing him for a whole month or month and a half and then im excited about leaving the country, leaving my friends behind and going by myself. i change the most when im not around everyday people. lol dude i'd give anything to come back all nice and tan and looking totallly different, hello-nasty ass hond. food, i may come back 50lbs lighter. lmao  i have this new crush...hehe he does my nails! haha hes hot. oh and i broke a nail the other day when i fell UP the stairs..but if he asks how i did it while he fixes my broken nail, i broke it during a soccer game. :D   SPEAKIN OF SOCCER something pissed me off last nite. we had a soccer game against south stokes. the other nite we also had a soccer game at east wilkes. well there are these 2 girls on the team that are sisters, pang and mia. ugh. they both play the same postion as me. well, i hate to say it, but they both suck at soccer. mia's problem is she doesnt really understand what to do..she looks lost out there. pang's problem is she think she has to be right beside of her sister mia...ugh, pang does not stay in her postion!! she stands right beside mia. grr well coach usually puts them in together because they play better that way (i dont think so) and since there are 2 of them and 3 forwards on the field, she puts those 2 in and the captain. so that leaves me on the bench. well lately shes been putting me in before them and the 2 captains. yay. i was all happy, but last nite she competely forgot about me, i didnt play any in the damn game. grrrr and its because pang and mia were in and then jenna. GRRRRR pang passed the ball to the other team 4 times, stood across the field from where she was supposed to be (beside mia, pang plays left, mia plays right) and totally missed a shot on goal. dammit. oh well, i didnt say anything but ive started to hate hmongs more and more. lmao not really...but i hate them.
