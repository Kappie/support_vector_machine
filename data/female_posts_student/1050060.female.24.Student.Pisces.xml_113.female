It's going to be interesting. One of my cousins works with me. We had a great time working the other night. I didn't get home until 12am but that's ok. Tomorrow i start at 10 in the morning so i will be home earlier. My brother is still looking for a job. He was suppose to go out and look for one this week but he didn't. Right now his friends seem to be more important then anything else. Oh well it his problem.   My mom's birthday was last week and tomorrow its Mother's day. I wasn't able to get her anything but a card. Once i get my first pay check i am going out and getting her something really nice. Well i have to get going. Have a good day!  Note to Katie! I am happy your have a new blog and writing again. Miss you!
