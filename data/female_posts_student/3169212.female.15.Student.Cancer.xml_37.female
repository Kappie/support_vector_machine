Like I said, I'm from Kurama's past.  In fact, I was his partner before I met a terrible fate while fleeing from the Castle of the Demon World.  My hobbies are stealing and fighting.  I use scythe and a pendant that I never cast away to manipulate my opponent's mind and make them believe whatever I wish them to believe.  Of course, I also just use the scythe.  And just to diminish any worries, I don't attack enemies from the rear.  It's very dishonorable.
