Anyways, I  am happy to report that liturgical dance practice went fine and the air has been cleared with Katie and Becky.  No worries.  My only complaint is that JW's sisters,  Helena  Elisabeth, are obnoxious little girls.  Or maybe it is fairer to say this:  they are completely odious at rehersals.  Sure they may appear sweet--I was once deceived too--but they have a problem acquiescing to an authority/leader figure.  Towards the end of the rehersal, I was so tired of their complaining and rude comments about not being able to dance with the older girls for By Cross  Water Signed, I found myself being extremely blunt with them.  *sigh*  Whatever, it's all over now.  Anyways, yesterday I had a doctor's appointment.  I had to get a Hepititus A shot by this butch nurse.  When she came in with the needle prepared and everything, I said, "Um, I don't really like shots"--you know, just to let her know that it is not a walk in the park for me.   She replies with, "Nobody does," and out of no where, just stabs this needle into my arm.  Gadzooks!  THEN, my doctor says I have to go downstairs and get some bloodwork done, which I've never had done before.  Okay...so my mom and I go downstairs, and they are closed for the next 45 minutes for lunch.  Fine.  We go to that KFC/Taco Bell on the corner of Naglee and Bascom because it is close by to grab a bite to eat.  That butch nurse who gave me my shot came in with this other nurse to grab lunch.  She gave me the most spooky, sly smile.  It was freaky.  And since my mom thought it was hilarious--the dialouge that happened surrounding the impromtu stabbing--she went over and started talking to her.  That's one  of those "Maaaaaaahm"  moments.  So we go back to get my bloodwork done.  Oh, by the way, it's that big yellow building on O'Connor Drive across from the elementary school entrance of St. Martin's.  Anyways, we walked right in and I go in the back room with this perky Asian nurse.  I told her I had never done this before and she was sweet, just because of the fact that she didn't stab me right then and there.  I began sitting up in a chair and I couldn't handle it.  Part of it was the nurse saying to the other nurse, "Where's the vein again?"  So they had me lay down.  Left arm: prick.no vein. prick. no vein. tears welling up in my eyes.  Right arm: prick. aha!  What a wild experience.  The only good thing is that I came home with about four different Looney Tunes character band aids on both arms.
