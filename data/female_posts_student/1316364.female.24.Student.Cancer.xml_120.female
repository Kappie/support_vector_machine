We are going to have a barbeque in a local park and I can't wait because it sounds so fun. So right now I am just waiting for my Brother to show up here so I can see him and Candace and possibly make our way over to Melissa's Apartment.   I spent the morning with my two nephews and my niece, it was great fun. I love seeing them. My Niece Elizabeth helped me make the potato salad for the Barbeque. It was so cute too see a little 3 year-old standing on the kitchen chair stirring the Mayonnaise into the salad. Every so often she would say “opps sorry auntie” when she stirred a little too hard and a little bit of the potato salad would go flying out of the huge bowl and land somewhere on the kitchen table. I wish someone would have been there to take a picture of her helping me. After I was done my oldest nephew wanted to sample the salad. He said it was very tasty, and smiled a wide little smile and nodded his head in approval of what he had just tasted.   It’s a little after 1:00 pm and I have just logged onto the internet not more than 5 minutes ago to see if Jesse was online and sure enough he is, he has about 30 minutes left until he is off shift though. He told me that they didn’t give them the day off for the 4th but then again that is understandable and most likely they were on high security due to it being an American Holiday. So now that I have given it some thought I understand completely.  Other than that, nothing else is new. Tensions have been high at home, but mainly due to the fact that I am hardly ever home. I think my mom is upset about the fact that I have been spending a lot of time with Melissa but for some reason I feel so comfortable there and I just seem to forget about the things that are bothering me. I guess it’s a place for me to hide out from the world.   Everyone needs to find that place every so often.
