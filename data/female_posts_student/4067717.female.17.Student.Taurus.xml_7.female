But that's OK. You probably won't notice the additional guilt, since I'll already be rubbing in about how I SAVED YOUR ASS by loaning you money so you can talk to your boyfriend (Is he really younger than me? Eww.).  Note to self: Visit Sarah's blog more often. Discover all her other dirty little secrets. (As if I had to ask ;)  Last night I dreamed that someone tried to strangle me while I was in the ALCO stockroom. Phillip and Jason ended up chasing the attacker all around the upstairs, and I stood with Alice, LaDonna, Tess, and Michelle and listened to them knock stuff over. Quite interesting.
