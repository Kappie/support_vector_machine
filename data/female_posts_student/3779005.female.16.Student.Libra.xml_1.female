We got off on the wrong tramstop, tresspassed main and the most dangerous street in Katowice, meet my Mom to take money for tickets :> went to "The Helios Cinema" were there were no tickets left on the 8pm. and 9pm. show, so decided to go to "The Cinema City". When we got there, it was 5 to 8pm. so we thought if there were no tickets left on "Shrek2", we would go on "Harry Potter and the Prioner of Azkaban" (although my sister and I have already seen it :P). To our surprise there were tickets on "Shrek2"! Show started on 8.30pm (although it was supposed to begin at 8pm :P) and finished about 9.45pm. We had a tram to Bytom at 10.12pm. and came back home at 11.15pm. My Mom was angry, because I have time to 10pm always becuase this is very dangerous region and this was a "little bit late".  But I saw Shrek2 on it's premiere-day and I'm happy :) Earlier that day I went shopping with Evil_girl to Tarnowskie GÃ³ry (I didn't mean that in Bytom we have no shops, but we have been to all and seen nothing that we liked). I bought black sport-shoes and a bikini :>
