For all of you who don’t know, TriCare is the medical coverage offered to the dependants of Military Personnel, it’s more of a bonus if the policy holder is active Duty… this means FREE coverage for the duration of their leave or Active Duty assignment. I guess you can call this a perk to having my loved one taken away from me. Any way, my new Doctor is very thorough, which I like. He has been testing me on anything he can to make sure that I am ok. He found from my first test, that my liver enzymes are high. He said that even though it isn’t a big deal now, this could lead to problems when I get older. He told me that “you are too young to be having these problems, and I want to find out why so we can correct it.” This made me feel good because my previous Doctor didn’t really seem to care when she found out my liver count was high. I do think that part of my problem is that I don’t drink enough water, YES Jesse I am finally admitting that I don’t drink enough water (he has been getting on my case about this little fact since, I don’t know, as long as wee have been together). So in the mean time, the Doctor is running more tests to see if he can pinpoint what is causing this. He told me to stay away from the alcohol and to see him when I get back from seeing Jesse in TX. So we’ll see what is to become of this.  In other news, there is only 5 days until my trip. I can’t wait to see Jesse. I miss him so much and as each day passes I begin to understand that in a few short weeks he will be making his long journey to another country. It is scary to think that he will be on the other side of the world, hundreds of thousand of millions of miles away, with a large body of ocean separating us. That when I look at the stars at night all he will see is a sunny sky. I feel like I wish I could go with him, I mean I am being left behind, but I am not the one who is going to a country he has never been to, with people he only really knew on a last name basis. I hope that his relationships with his peers are strong; I would hate to know that he is all alone over there.  I am glad that he decided to have me fly to see him. I think it would be easier for him if I went to him versus him coming home, that way its just me and him and no Mother-in-laws calling every 10 minutes wanting to see her son, or anything else like that. I feel that it is very important that we get some time alone to talk and just be together. (In actual reality, I want him all to myself… **Insert sinister laugh here**)
