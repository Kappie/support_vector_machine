In the mornings he's playing Aetolia in the library. And yes, I could envision that to be a bit more than frustrating. I was, again, moreso unimpressed today than ever. I swear, he didn't even look in your direction, as if to see if you were looking in  his  direction, know what I mean?   I think the problem is that guys finding dating a girl to be really...I dunno, voliatile? I guess that's the best, albeit slightly offensive, word. We envision that if we do one thing wrong, it's all over. And we're very afraid to be pushy, too. At least some of us are. *shrug*  This is all from my perspective. You know what I think you should do, per your BLog; but that's never going to happen. I hesitate to say that it won't grow if he doesn't do anything soon, but I only hesitate. And remember, it takes TWO to have a relationship.  With extra emphasis on that last line, eh.
