(points at Jill)  Cindy: Your head is really... hard. Seifert: Really? (touches shaved head) I didn't think I had a skull.  Something else that happened at youth group tonight: We did this service project related to Celebration Sunday (which is the big finale of 40 Days of Purpose) in which we put these fortune cookies in these little chinese food boxes. (The fortunes are like "Your purpose is discipleship!" or "Your purpose is worship!" and so on with all of the 5 purposes that are in that book.) (Which I haven't been reading.) We had a bunch of cookies leftover so we all got one if we wanted one (my purpose is evangelism!) and I was talking to Cindy and Chris Klein after, and I gave the wrapper to Cindy, since I didn't want it, and then she gave it to Chris, who stared at it for a second and then put it in his mouth.
