We talked long and hard about memories from our lame school CCDS about State History Day, Graduation, and other times where a certain someone (I will not mention the name for the person's sake...) was nitpicking at picking imaginary little fuzzies off all of the guys (and some teachers). Now, what is it with these magical little fuzzies just appearing all over people? And why do they only show up on men? I'm not sure, but I have never seen any of these mystery fuzzies on any of them...Maybe this person is just using some sort of hallucinogen and weirding out and seeing these little dancing fuzzies on all the men and having to touch them all over their bodies to get them off instead of just telling the guys and letting them take them off themselves. Interesting I know, and I will have more for you next time...
