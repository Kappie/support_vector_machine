We were waiting for the bus, and Jake and everyone kept making me laugh and Corrin was doing this wierd bum dance thing, so I laughed, alot. When I laugh it sounds like I can't breathe, so they were all deserting me! They kept telling me to shut up! How rude??? Jake said a very stupid comment to Corrin:  You have to roll your rollies! No shit sherlock... When the bus came we were all shocked, it was a double decker!!! We all rushed on and sat at the front at the top, it was sooooooo funny!
