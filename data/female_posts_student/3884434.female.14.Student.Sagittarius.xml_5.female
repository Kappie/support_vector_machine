What we do is we eat TONS AND TONS of chocolate. I'm at Chocolate Camp right now, and we just made a triple chocolate cake. It's in the oven and it smells soooooooooooooooo good! Anyways, we'll also do stuff like go to the lake, get manicures, go shopping, work at my aunt's mother-in-law's jewelry store: Katie's for merchandise, and we'll bake, and bunches more! It's so much fun! My grandmother, Nana, and my grandfather, Granddaddy, are so cool! It's fun to talk to them about stuff, and they tell me the funniest stories about my mother that I can taunt her with! ;)  I haven't written any other poems yet, but I'm planning to soon. Just, nothing has come to me yet. Sounds cheesy, but that's how it works for me. Maybe I'll write a poem about Chocolate Camp! lol! I'll be here until Friday, so I have plenty of time for inspiration! I bet Nana and Granddaddy would enjoy it too!  I feel so sick... I just licked the bowl of melted chocolate for the cake. Good. But sickening. My Aunt Julie and baby cousin Cate will be here soon! I'll talk more later!  Hugs and kisses!
