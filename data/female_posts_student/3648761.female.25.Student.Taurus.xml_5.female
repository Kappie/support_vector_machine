He was great, we went on a car ride, I had to run some errands. Every time I would stop the car, that kid went crazy. (What a set of lungs) As soon as I started driving again he'd take a nap. Very smart for 3 months.  Cleaned my balcony today and laid outside in my big floppy hat that I love. I hate tanning my face, but love getting my legs nice and tan. Not a bad set up on my porch, My lay out chair, and a little 19inch TV (with cable that I rigged).  Today was perfect for it. Tomorrow I am going to get my $20 season pass for Ottawa Lake, so that I can do my swim across the lake.
