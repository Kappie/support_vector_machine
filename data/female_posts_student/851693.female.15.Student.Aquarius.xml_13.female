I remember how we rushed for bridging worlds last year, and was thinking that this time round we'll be even busier, but i'm sure it'll be worth it in the end. I apologise for not having contributed too much so far, but I'll put in as much effort as possible from now on try to work on the exhibition and marketing stuff. We're cutting up the tickets and putting up posters for marketing right? I think we need to meet about western exhibition sometime soon as well. Anyway, special thanks to shao, nicole, carol and charmaine for doing a large part of the marketing stuff, and of course to veron michy and CS for basically making all the rehearsals work!
