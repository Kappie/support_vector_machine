I have to feed and walk the dogs, and I  have  to have my morning coffee or else the rest of the day is going to be a bad day. So when I got to work this morning I find out that there's only an outing for the day and it doesn't start until 1pm. This means that I didn't have to be there until 12 which also means that  I didn't need to get up at 7 am!  Ya think someone could have  called  me and let me know!....  Stupid people.
