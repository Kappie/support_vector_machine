Kuronue:  I'm going to regret this, but how the hell did you see Lord of the Rings?  Buddha:  I can take many forms.  Kuronue:  What did you turn into a cat and go to the theater?  Buddha:  How dare you!  Baka:  Kuronue, do have any idea what the cat symbolizes in Buddhism?  Kuronue:  Yes.  Baka:  The cat represents evil.  Sidhartha Guitamo was one of the most pure gods.

Kuronue:  How did Buddha get into this anyway?  Buddha:  I'm just a part of Buddha, but I'm not sure how I got into this.
