It's really well located near all the terrorist targets in the nation's capital.  To prepare I've been listening to the soundtrack to the musical Chess, listening to ineffective "learn russian in your car" CDs, and gaping at my Russian quick guide to customs and etiquette. I can't believe there are A LOT of students going on this trip who are making no attempt to learn the language. The Cyrillic alphabet is  KILLING  me, but at least I'm trying!  In the meantime, I'm finishing up my Hogwarts' student robes and preparing for the big premiere next weekend!
