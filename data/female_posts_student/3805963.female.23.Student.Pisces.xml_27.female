One of those stupid little things that seem to be so important at the time yet when you look back at it you realize that you just need to grow up. Who cares who has the keys when your both going to the same place and why in the hell do when you put on your shoes really matter in the long run? Not a clue but this morning those things seemed to be at the top of my list of priorities. If I ever get a divorce or break up with Pheonix I want it to be about more than just shoes and keys on the table.   Besides the chatastophes of this morning I am working 17 hours straight today and into tommorrow. Today at Crieghton University's DOIT (Division of Information and Technology) we are holding GameFest, a bigger and better LAN party for all incoming sniveling whining bratty freshman that I hate more and more each day. I want to make a t-shirt that says, 'Please dont bring your 80's computer to Crieghton. It sucks and so do you.' My job today is to haul 5 plasma tv's and 40 Gateway computers three blocks across campus. My shoulders hurt, my arms have fallen off, I'm tired and I'm on break. I'm sitting here bitching in my blog about this and that and the other thing while random people are coming up to me. 'Can you fix my computer?' 'I cant get connected.' 'Where is the nearest wireless connection?' Dude I'm on break. Just because I work for DOIT does not meen that I like people. I tried to ignore them but then it seemed that they multiplied like mold on cheese. I want to charge money, $5.00 to see the on break DOIT person. I bet your asking 'how do they know you work for DOIT? Do you have a sign above your head?' Almost but not quite entirely unlike tea there. I have a big sign on my shirt. In large bold letters across my back and chest my shirt yells DOIT to the masses. I'm going to apply ducttape to it today. It's not even a nice colored shirt. It reminds me of a janitor or an industrial worker. I feel like I should be scrubbing toilets and not crawling around on the floor hooking cables into walls and explaning what a Desktop and a window is to estranged students. (Yes, that really happened I just got through talking to them. He wasnt even 50, he was a sniveling freshman.)  However I too have a tendency to digress as well and my break is over. More on the fantasies of DOIT later.  Ackron --- shoot the stupid people.
