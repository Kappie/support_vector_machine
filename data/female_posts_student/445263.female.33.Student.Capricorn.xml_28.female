The Hutton Inquiry is limited to just a small area of the conflict. It is absolutely scandalous that an illegal war, which has caused loss of life and immense misery along with making Britain one of the most hated nations on Earth, has been justified on the basis of half-truths and deception.  On September 24, 2002 Tony Blair stated: 'His (Saddam's) WMD programme is active, detailed and growing. The policy of containment is not working. The WMD programme is not shut down. It is up and running'.  Tony Blair described the intelligence upon which his assertion was based as: 'extensive, detailed and authoritative'.   The dossier which he was quoting from went on to say: 'Some of these weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use them'.  The whole war was fought on the basis that Iraq posed an immediate threat. We were told when war started that Iraq had deployed chemical and biological weapons to use against British and US forces. No such deployment took place. A whole series of allegations were made in the build up to war and throughout the war that have been shown to be at best inaccurate and at worst blatant lies. To date, no weapons of mass destruction have been found.  Sign the petition to Tony Blair now at  urlLink Our World, Our Say  and get all your friends and colleagues to do the same.                           This is part of a major new Our World Our Say campaign to ensure that politicians are made accountable to us for their actions.
