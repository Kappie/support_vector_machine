A definite prospect who was extremely gentlemanly, mannerly, and more than willing to pick up the check!  What more to ask for in a fella!  In a nutshell, here's what we did:  Whistler exhibit at the DIA 1:00 pm, coffee, chatting, strolling around the Medical Center, beers, bowling, Royal Oak, more strolling, " urlLink Super Size Me " at the Main, more strolling, resist the temptation of the hookah, tea (in liquid form) then farewell at 1:00 am.   Quite a lovely time!!  I really hope to see him again, yet I AM NOT getting my hopes up, only to be dashed soon afterwards.  With the past few guys, after the first date, I've thought giddily "I'm going to marry him" but not this time, well yes this time but not exactly.  Instead I can honestly see something real developing; a real friendship leading to something else.  We have so much in common and that's a rarity for me.  Plus the fact that he has an evil streak is a bonus. ;)
