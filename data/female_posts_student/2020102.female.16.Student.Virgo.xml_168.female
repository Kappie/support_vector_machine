But then I realize that I hate salads, and the list of veggies I like is actually pretty short. And then the fact that cheeseburgers are the best thing in the world and sinking your teeth into one of those bad boys is like going to heaven... and that just reinforces the fact that I really don't care about being healthy. I just want to like what I eat.   Hey, wouldn't it be funny if the same people who preach about saving the rainforests were vegetarians?
