In fact, it may even be advisable for those of our peers and fellow citizens who have not stretched their minds to the full extent of their gray matter since attempting to comprehend those dastardly, evasive times tables, except those people's minds have probably atrophied hopelessly by now. I, on the other hand, think so much about nothing at all, or about one thing constantly, until i whip myself up into a state that is both a tizzy and a stupor at the same time. This leads to a blatant manifestation of my normally subordinate fantasy life, and a contemplation of a variety of sensible and useless things.  Sigh...what's the matter with me?
