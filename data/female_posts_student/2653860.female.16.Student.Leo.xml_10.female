I was kind of glad we had a snow day. Even though we have to make it up over the summer, but still.   Cassie, what do you mean it is a NOTSNOW Day? Look at all this snow. I measured the depth of the snow on our picnic table and we had about 1/2 foot, that was during the second big blast of snow. Would you want to get stranded at school because the snow was too bad for the buses to come get us? Not me.  Matthew, You would look better without the beard. I also liked the way you bashed your own section. It was great. Are you back at school already? I couldn't remember.  Oh well. How your having a blast where ever you are.  B4N
