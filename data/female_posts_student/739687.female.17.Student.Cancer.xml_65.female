So there! Everyone with their doubts...hah! But seriously, it was so much easier than I thought. I mean, really, everyone acts like it's sooo incredibly hard, and there's not much to it. I guess that's because I can't really do much, but hey, for a first timer, I'd say I was pretty good.  But on another note, why can't people just grow up? I'm sick of everyone judging everyone else by how they dress. It's not about outer appearance! People shouldn't make all those crappy judgements like...it seriously makes me want to kick them in the face. Let's grow up a bit people, I swear, not much makes me as mad as this crap. "Preps" judging "punks", "punks" judging "preps". Let's drop the labels. I'm sorry, but I have a name. And so does everyone else.  Well, that is all!
