And every so often, when the water becomes too heavy and strenuous, the bucket tips over and it all pours out.  I fell over today.  I collapsed from the strain of containment. I curled up on the ground and I cried with every bit of energy I had.  Everything just feels so hopeless. I knew it was coming. I just felt locked up in this miserable place. I am always locked up in that miserable place.  Sometimes I wish it was easier to make people understand what I feel. I have trouble conveying my emotions sometimes.  I just felt dead. As dead as one can feel and still be able to breathe and hold a pulse. There have been two times in my life that I have ever felt so dead.  The first was the other week. The second was today.  And while I was crying I just kept repeating "Please give me strength so that I can get out of here."  There were no outbursts or confrontations with anyone that fueled my breakdown this time though.  My heart just felt too weak to support everything.  It's different than people think.  People don't see how dark of a world this life can be.  ONWARD.  I really like this song:  "Your eyes tell the stories of a day you wish you could Recall the moments that once have Retract the footsteps that brought us to this favor I wouldn't ask this of you  Good eye sniper I'll shoot you run  The words you scribbled on the walls The loss of friends, you didn't have I'll call you when the time is right Are you in or are you out From them all to know the end of us all  Run quick they're behind us Didn't think we'd ever make it This close to safety in one piece Now you want to kill me In the act of what could maybe Save us from sleep and what we are  Bye, bye beautiful Don't bother to write Disturbed by your words and they're calling all cars Face step let down, face step...step down"  -"A Favor House Atlantic"  Coheed and Cambria  Well, all for now crazies.
