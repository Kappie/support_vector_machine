Probably the gross cakes (not to self - never trust Laura's cooking again). You poor fruitcake (my fave new expression) having to walk to Grove to get a key, how smelly. Hehehe, guess it could have been kinda fun at the time.  Well woo-diddlie-hoo, 'fraid I might not be able to come out tomorrow Kes, I'll leave you to have fun juggling standing on your head, or whatever extreme measures you'll end up going to when trying to entertain the "scary shy people" coming round! have fun, and don't tell them about Zigganought, Vera the stuffed cabbage or Mr.Fopple unless they seem like that kind of person, ok? Just show them Virtual Fighter 4 or something and watch them run.   So are we doing something on sunday? I've decided to ask my short-longie guy-friend person why he's not talking to me because you'd be pissed off if I decided that I was only going to know you on certain days of the week, wouldn't you?!
