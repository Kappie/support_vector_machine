The reason this was decided is because I'm tired of being lectured by people... or having little comments made here and there regarding the friendship I have made with him.  It wouldn't normally bother me, except it seems a little hypocritical of some people to make jokes about someone I made friends with off the internet... especially considering his past... and future with this.  There's a comment on the last post to explain that comment.  Anyhow... on to brighter subjects...    Patty's Birthday!    Happy Birthday, Patty!  Saturday I went over to Ricky's to celebrate Patty's birthday.  We had a good time... It was good to see Trinity again, and good to spend time with Marta, Jeff, and Zoey.  :-)  We had barbecue, watched Trinity dance to Lilo  Stitch music, and then watched Spy Kids 2.  I don't remember why exactly we watched Spy Kids 2, because it wasn't any good.  But, yeah... we watched it.  I took a Marie Callendar's pie over for Patty... it's probably gone by now... and she made some bread pudding.  It was my first time to have it, and it was good...!  This is surprising to me, because I usually don't like rasins, but I liked this.  Even though Ricky and I found STICKERS in ours... apparently Mr. Ansley didn't take the stickers off the apples.  :-\  It was still good, though.  Sunday-Did a whole lot of nothing.  I slept in, I watched tv, I read a little bit... that's about it.    This Week    This week should be fairly easy.  I don't have any tests, or any projects or anything.  Which is nice, because from the looks of my syllabi, I won't have much to do before Spring Break.  :-)  I must say, I'm still quite upset that UT and UTSA don't have the same break...!!!  Oh, well... at least I'll have the weekend before or after to spend with Austin friends.  :-)  I was thinking of talking to Jamey and seeing what her spring break plans were.  I sorta wanna do some partying this break, but I don't know anyone of age, other than Jamey.  So I was thinking she and I could party.  I wonder if she's going to the coast.  If she is she's probably going with Adrian... and I'm NOT staying in the same hotel room as them...!  I don't want to hear the sex going on right next to me.  :-(  BLECH!  We'll see... I'll have to talk to her about it... Okay... not much else to say right now... but I'll post again later... probably on the comments, because I have a feeling there will be some lashing out by a certain someone who won't be too pleased with the anger I have for them due to their comment.  I know what's going to happen... I'm going to get a "Can't you take a joke?!?  GOD!!!"  but the thing is, it's just not funny... and this person has NO ROOM to joke about this topic... especially knowing how much flack I've gotten about this from 2-3 others.  Oh well...
