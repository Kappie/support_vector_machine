Not just last night, but the entire prom in general, everything like planning it to making arrangements and everything else... I read Brian's Journal and I guess in a way I can totally relate to him, except, I don't have friends.  I have Matt.  And I have athletic training.  I only seem to be happy, temporarily, when Im either with matt or training.  It's really sad.  I dunno. I dunno what I did that made me loose the people I cared about so much.  I guess I just wasn't good enough.  That wouldn't suprise me because it always seems to be the case.  I try, I really do.  But I get nothing in return. Ever.  Maybe that's why all I have is Matt and training.  I'm good enough there.  Matt loves me, I know he does.  I get frustrated sometimes cause it's not always as clear as I need it to be but that's just because Im so damn insecure.  We've been dating for over a year and a half- I should be secure enough, but I'm not.  I just don't want to loose him.  Im afraid one day Im not going to be good enough for him either.  It just seems like its going to be a matter of time because that's how it has been with everyone else.  I can't loose him.  He means too much.  I love that guy with all my heart.  He's my best friend (more like my only friend but thats ok because he's more than I could ask for)  Im good in the athletic training room too.  People depend on me.  I like that.  I have fun.  But it's strange- people depend on me so much in there, but in the hallways I don't even exist to them.  I guess Im just not good enough to get a "hi" in the hallway.  Im never good enough at home.  I always do something wrong.  From the minute I walk in- which is usually late because the later I come home and the less time I spend there, the less time I can get yelled at, be littled, ignored, and in trouble.  I try to fill my time with the 2 things that make me happy, but there's always this gap.  This never ending ache.  There's always a peice of me missing.  Friends.  Like girlfriends.  I don't have any.  I don't get it.  I used to, but again, Im not good enough.  I don't understand really.  I walk down the hallways alone.  Stand at my locker alone.  Go to class, surrounded by people I may  once have concidered friends, but feel completely alone.  Nothing would matter if I wasn't there to them.  It may matter to teachers, they're the only ones that seem to notice I exist anymore.  Unless someone needs something from me.  I hate this feeling, when I get this way.  Usually I can hide it.  Im a good actress.  I've done it a lot...   Prom last night was ok.  I wouldn't have gone if it weren't for Matt.  It was on a boat which was really pretty and it was a gorgeous night so we were outside the whole time which was great.  If he weren't there I probably would have thrown myself overboard though.  The whole thing about lack of friends and all really hit me last night with prom and all.  Between planning the dance and me not having anyfriends to plan anything with, to during the dance.... to after when I had to friends to do anything afterwards with... I just felt like an ass.  Even though it wasn't Matt's prom I feel like a made him have a bad time.  I loved being outside and him holding me.  It was the best feeling in the world.  but, like I said, there was something missing.  There wasn't that group.  I liked it just the two of us sometimes but I dunno.  It was different too because there were 2 dance floors.  That was good and bad.  I didn't have to see half the people, mostly those I didnt want to see.  I was able to say hello and never see them again for the rest of the night. I also feel like I missed half of what was going on.  It was just different.  If someone were to ask me if I would do it again, I probably would as long as Matt came.  This is better than senior trip which I said I would never do over again.    I think there's something wrong with me.  I can't be happy for an extended period of time.  Im happy in the training room and with Matt. Thats it.  The best night (senior prom) and best 4 days (senior trip) of my highschool career didn't even bring that much happyness.  It's like I don't know how to have fun anymore, or what fun is.  The senior prom pretty much means your senior year and highschool career is over.  My senior year has pretty much sucked. As much as I gained, there's still a void.  I feel like a peice of me is missing.  I found one peice but lost an even bigger one.  Im about to graduate highschool and have never been to a party, never drank, like never go out... I feel like I missed so much in highschool.  I tryed to be a good kid and get the most out of it. I got involved, got good grades, played sports then athletic training, developed some great relationships with teachers but Im still not happy.  Why? why can't I just be happy for what I do have.  I dunno.... I can't... Im empty.  I want to go out and have a good time, laugh till my sides hurt with people who love me, be myself and have them love me for it, to have girlfriends to have sleepovers with, freinds that call to see how your day was just because they care, that call you to see what your doing and want to know if you want to hang out, friends that smile when they see you because they're genuenly happy to see you-not becuase it's polite, friends that call at midnight because they need someone to talk to and that 10 minute venting session that we needed turns into a 2 hour long conversation that ends with both of us laughing and smiling forgetting what our problems were, friends that let me know, no matter what happens in the future we'll make it because we'll always have eachother.  more so, I want to be happy- more than temporarily.  Matt- if you read this, don't take it personally. you're more than I could ask for.  you make me happy and I hope you know that, there's just a place for you in my heart and another place that's empty, a place you cant fill.  I love you. I always will.  Thank  you for all you've done because its more than you realize and more than I could ask for.    I just realized I don't know why I write in here because Im sure no one really even reads it.  Oh well, it helps me get it off my chest at least......... later to anyone who cares
