It was soooooo annoying today as Verity,Antz and Jamie mainly Antz and Verity have been bugging me about Ed and me and Jamie were talking about Ed and Mark. That girl is definitly in love with Mark. It was quite funny/awkward today because I saw the teacher that is the grandad of Ed and we spoke it was quite strange but it is sweet he is a wierd but cool teacher. I also had english today and our speech draft was due so that sucked but oh well she says she will call home tomorrow if it isnt finished but none of the class care. Well I dunno wat else to say. Oh yea I have training tonight am unsure i think it may be the last one so that means I will be going to the gym more often because it takes away my main training source. I am listening to Usher's song Burn and writing this hope it gives ya sumthin to read. I also have a referee meeting tonight, so shal be a lil boring.     Im out.     Peace
