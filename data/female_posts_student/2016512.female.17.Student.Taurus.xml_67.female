I think Maury is taking the costumes the wrong way. it should be reggae. not king arthur goes to the circus, but there isn't much i can do.  today was alright. i woke up as usual and went to church. the priest was a visitor and i think he should go back to where ever he came from. he definately wasn't the greatest. i also had dance and got an overview of next year i.e. - Hitler returns to the Midwest! Marium and Joby have decided that next year will be hell -All soloist must be able to do fortes -we will start numbers this summer -Giselle will be the second act of our "Christmas Show" -We will be manipulated into performing at the Chapman Fritz -You will be put on "probation" if you miss practices. -We will have to be better than DL (no one cares except Marium). -We will put up with all of Joby's temper tantrums -And don't forget we're supposed to have fun! (not since 6th grade)  yeah right! the only way i'll get through this is if Al and i stick together. we'll be teaching a stretch class (which is good) but we will probably also be pushed into everything else. this sucks! i like dance but not the politics. maybe i can learn how to get rid of communism at girls state. that would be rather handy at dance.  This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting. -Betso
