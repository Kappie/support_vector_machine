The Reasons are below:  * Releasing of exams results - - - -  - English 27/50 (^_^) (HEY! Not many pupils can pass, YA KNOW!) - Chinese B3 (-_-) (MUST STUDY HARDER!) - E- Maths B4 (-_-) (THE LOWEST GRADE IN THE CLASS, MY TEACHER SAID THAT) - A- Maths F9 (-___-) (BUT I AM NOT THE LAST ONE !)  - Sub- Science (chem/phy) B4 (^_^) (I HATE BOTH OF THEM) - Biology C5 (HEY! 1 MORE MARK AND I CAN GET A B4!) (-_-) - Humanities (geo/S.S) B4 (-_-) (GEO PULL ME DOWN...)  * ALSO...I did all the sit- ups, pull- ups and etc, except 2.4 km in ONE hour. I skipped PE a few weeks ago for my dental appointment -_- So that's why my body is aching like HELL ! ! !   So, you can see my stupid exams results never fare very well, but, in all, at least I pass all my subjects EXCEPT A- Maths which I KNEW I can never pass and I have given up hope. My dearest A- Maths teacher -_- can dream on to have 100% all passes for O Levels....  Alright, alright, enough of me fussing and grumbling around. I think everybody is sick of clicking all the Singapore's teens' Blogs and see everybody grumbling about their exams or getting their results in a few days time.... I foresee a disaster in my home during the evening. My brother AGAIN skipped school and played traunt. And his stupid teacher called my mother and boy, was she sad and desparated at the same time, or WHAT! She called my father and when my father is brought to the 'STAGE', my brother can dream on to try again the next time.... My father is that POWERFUL !
