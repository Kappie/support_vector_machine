You are the Sonnet. Get it? Composed?       Sonnets want Love and have high ideals about it. They're conscientious people, caring  careful. You yourself have deep convictions, and you devote a lot of thought to romance and what it should be. This will frighten away most potential mates, but that's okay, because you're very choosy with your affections anyway. You'd absolutely refuse to date someone dumber than you, for instance.   Lovers who share your idealized perspective, or who are at least willing to totally throw themselves into a relationship, will be very, very happy with you. And you with them. You're already selfless and compassionate, and with the right partner, there's no doubt you can be sensual, even adventurously so.       You probably have lots of female friends, and they have a special soft spot for you. Babies do, too, at the tippy-top of their baby skulls.     ALWAYS AVOID: The 5-Night Stand, The False Messiah, The Hornivore, The Last Man on Earth   CONSIDER: The Loverboy
