Like..when we got to the tiger area, there was this glass, and this large male tiger was pacing back and forth, his muscles rippling with grace and strength. I saw his eyes, and in them I saw what I see in mine every day. Emptyness, anger, hurt. He was so beautiful...such a lovely creature should not be imprisioned. But, it keeps him safe from scumbag hunters and pochers and the like. I will almost definently get pictures up tommorrow..hehe...I hope to Bastet your eyes do not bleed. Im not that pretty, sorry. Or skinny...Im a freaking fat ass. I hate my father...harsh as it seems, I do. Okay...Steph was with right?? Well, she was wearing shorts and a tanktop, and steph is like...really pretty. I mean, skinny and stuff. well..my sick ass father kept looking at her like he does me sometimes.....my hair's been falling out all day. Stress...:( And i have another one of my lovely stress headaches. Anywhoo...Im gonna go...my head is pounding....toodles.
