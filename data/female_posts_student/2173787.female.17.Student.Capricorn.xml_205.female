It feels good to get it on paper, to get it all down.  I feel clean and honest.  Emotion did seep through and I think it made it stronger, made it more real.  It has been a long long time since I've allowed myself to just write.  Everything seems to have become false.  Papers and journal entries at school have dulled my writing, have cornered it in a box and taken away the freedom and power I feel when I am writing something I care about, something I am proud of.  I can never become a writer, it would kill me to have to write to a specific thing, to have commitments to others twist my words.  I worked through this essay, worked through some of my baggage, and worked through the chaos that this essay made me feel and because of all that working I can lie back in exhausted bliss.
