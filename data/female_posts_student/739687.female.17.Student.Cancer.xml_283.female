We caught the train at Richland Hills and headed out there, etc etc. Got drinks, chips and queso at the Cocktail Lounge in Reunion Tower. Then we rode over to the West End, and ate at Spaghetti Wharehouse. Oh, then Becky got hit on my some 14 year old boy. He was like "You remind me of a famous person, with your boobies and all." Hahahaha it was FREAKING HILARIOUS. Oh, then some crazy hobo man offered to get us fake ID's and jobs at a strip club. Wow. That was interesting to say the least.  Well, I'm shortening the whole of the venture, because I don't feel much like typing.  To sum it up, I had a great day today.  C-ya round, crazies.
