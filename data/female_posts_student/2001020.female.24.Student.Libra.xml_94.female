There's  urlLink a reproduction of her blog online , and it's absolutely fascinating.  I mean, if this is legit, it's amazing.  I am amazed by this chick's lifestyle...but I totally don't put it past a Syracuse girl to do that.  Amazing what some people will do for money.  She says some funny things in her blog, like, "Who can live on $25,000?" and then says something about how everyone must be doing some freaky shit.  Yeah, sweetie, but probably not like that!  Ha!  I'll update my own life's blog in a bit, but for now, I'm gonna read about this hookerneck's exploits.
