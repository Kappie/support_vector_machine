I know once you set your mind and heart on something there's nothing that would change it. I respect that. I'm sure most guys do too. That's a really good thing, it means you're a strong person (Guys like that).  I'm really lucky to have you love for this long. I know I haven't been a very good or perfect boyfriend through out and all along. I fucked up in many different ways. It's too late for me to make that up. I can't just win your feeling and heart back. I'm probably consider as a pass to you huh? You do deserve so much more then me.   I know what you mean when you say that "you wanted more in life". This is what I was thinking about this morning. I figured it'll be easier for me to express myself to you in writing than talking to you face to face. I know you'll get very annoyed by me. So I don't wanna see you all sad and stuff. I'm gonna end it here. Love you and miss you.   There are so much things I have planned out to do with you. Getting married, having kids, little Sakdary and Little Harvey running around. Starting our family with, travel, enjoy the rest of my life with you, etc. There's nothing more I would rather do than that with YOU. I just wanna spend the rest of my life being with the one who I really love and care for. You know that I am afraid that I wouldnt have the chance and time to do that with you.   I'm sure that's what everyone wants in life. Wanting and having are two totally different things. Its nice to want things but it's not so nice not having it. Just like how I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Things tends to happen for a reason and there's nothing I can do to change it. I think I'm just being really selfish.  I'm willing to do whatever to keep you by my side. At the same time I feel you want to be doing other things. I'm keeping you from doing what you wanted to do in life. Keeping you from making friends. Its like I'm trying to lock you down with me, even tho you're not happy. Making you do things you don't wanna do. I'm keeping you away from all your dreams and goals in life.  This pass week has been the most wonderful week. It meant alot to me more than anything. Just seeing you happy. Seeing you smile!!! My heart lights up from that. It means so much to me just to see you happy on the outside. Inside I wouldnt know unless you open your heart and tell me.   I my self Sakdary, never thought that there would be another who would love me as much as Harvey does. It really means alot but what is love? Nothing last forever rite. I do believed that things happen for a reason. We've just got to find ourselves and ask our heart what is it that we want most in life. This is a total concept experience that every human being goes through.   I finally figured an answer to this situation and I tend to keep it that way. Feelings are only good when it's there. Cherish every moment when being together. have a great time and smile more often. Enjoy life as it comes because nothing last forever. I take anything that life has to offer and go with the flow. Life is too short to compormised anything if you would make plans for.   I do believe in having a future but like I said "I'll take it as it comes. Nothing last forever". My greatest fear of all is falling in LOVE. I am so afraid to get hurt by anyone. Life doesnt have too much great expectations. I live day by day for happiness and glad that i am still alive. I've got two favorite quote that I live up to.   "Don't cry because it's over! Smile because it happened".  "If life gives you a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it."
