We have to EXTREAMLY tiny apples and they're kinda mushy…yuck…and there is an orange…but u see when I eat any thing juicy it gets all over me…(lets all refer back to the strawberry) so I looked in the fridge and I found sum jello, that is fruity isn't it? but then came my dilemma what do u eat jello with so I stood there with the utensil drawer open staring blankly, shifting my eyes back and forth from the forks to the spoons. Now maybe it has been the lack of sleep or sumthing, but, I was stumped…and I couldn't decide, so I grabbed the spoon. Seeing as it would be the most helpful when trying to get eh jello out of the container. That was pretty much my exciting morning, and now im listening to cold hard bitch by jet…woo hoo..ok, I gotta get back to my game of solitaire alright, later losers
