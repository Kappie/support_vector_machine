I was also viewing the quizzes I took last week and both answers had common grounds... so I'll just post the answers see if u see it. You are Haruko! You love to hit people (mostly with a guitar) and are somewhat insane. You get those mood swings, one minute you'll be angry and the next you're bouncing off the walls. You ran over Naota with a vespa and now you're curious as to the things comming out of his head. You are GIR. You are... completely insane... and, quite possibly, the most lovable creature in the universe. Whether you're screaming and running into things, making soap with bacon, watching mindless television programs, or devouring everything in sight, there's no question about it--you are filthy with cuteness... like a baby... except... metal. (METAL) i miss wsou glory days.... any way, in answer both characters are from cartoons I watch, one on adult swim sat. and the other was on nick but now on dvd.  So watch them they are addictive and it takes time to see what the real meanings are... loves much and be kind...
