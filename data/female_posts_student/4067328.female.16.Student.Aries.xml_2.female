"daddy would you like some sausage?  sausages sausages sausages.." woo funny stuff right there.  anyways that was over around 10:30 and it was time to drive jennina home.  well knowing us we can never go straight to where we have to go.  of course not.  we have to go on a wild goose chase to find this kid thats at this girls house.  all we know is the girl lives in the seasons and her friend has a jeep.  so we enter the seasons and start searching every driveway for a jeep.  after about 10 min i see a jeep!  heres how the convo went from there      "hey theres a jeep!"   "his is dark green"   "it was dark... and it had a hard top"   "HIS HAS A HARD TOP!"   "and it was next to another car"   "she drives a cavalier"   "IT IS A CAVALIER IT IS IT IS!!!!!  ITS A CAVALIERRRRRRRRR"      omgg i was peeing myself.. although you prob had to be there.  anyways we make a sharp turn and start heading back and there's this kid we're looking for.. standing right in the driveway.  jess feels the need to start drag racing down the streets of the seasons.. jesus.. with no "oh shit" bar in the back i was flipping.  although when it was all over it was a good laugh.  we continued on to jenninas from there.. cracking up the entire way.  then we got back to jess's and i chilled there for awhile.. looking at old address books... "with pat..? lol" and "with katie the bitch" ... omg tooooo many laughs.      anyways i'm home now and yet another adventurous, however not out of the ordinary, summer night is over... *sigh* the wonderfulness of summer vacation.. which is slowly coming to an end *tear*      til next time,        jaimie      p.s. inspirational quote for ur eve..."life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that take our breath away"         soooo true...
