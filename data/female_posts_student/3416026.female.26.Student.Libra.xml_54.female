For instance, I am sure you all heard that the senate voted "thanks, but no thanks" on Bush's constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage.  Accompanying the NY Times print version of  urlLink the article  was a box with quotes from Republicans supporting or opposing the amendment.  Take, for instance, idiotic Sen. Wayne Allard (Colorado): "Marriage does matter.  It matters to our children; it matters to America.  Marriage is the foundation of a free society, and courts are redefining marriage."  To make statements like these bearable, I propose: Republican Mad Libs.  Erase "marriage" and insert the word of your choice:  _________________________ is/are the foundation of a free society, and courts are redefining _____________________.  Here are some words to get you started.  Then think up your own! 1. my nuts 2. ham and cheese 3. yo momma 4. Uranus 5. Timbuktu
