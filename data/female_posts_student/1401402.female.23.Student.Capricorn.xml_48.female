This is the time to dig through all those good and bad things that your loved one had been hiding from you.  This is the time to share your personal histories.  This is the time to uncover your personal histories.  This is the time to share your deepest and darkest history to your loved one.  This is the time to settle your differences.   I found this on the internet. I couldn't have said it better. So, read on!  When you think of your past love, you may view it as a failure. But when you find a new love, you view the past as a teacher. In the game of love, it doesn`t really matter who won or who lost. What's important is that you know when to hold on and when to let go! You know you really love someone when you want him or her 2be happy, even if his or her happiness means that you`re not part of it. Everything happens for the best.   If the person you love doesn`t love you back, don`t be afraid to love someone else again, for you`ll never know unless you give it a try. You`ll never love a person you love unless you risk for love. LOVE STRIVES IN HURTING. IF YOU DON`T GET HURT ,YOU DON`T LEARN HOW TO LOVE. Love doesn`t hurt all the time. Though the hurting is still there to test you, to help you grow.DON'T FIND LOVE, LET LOVE FIND YOU!. That`s why it`s called falling in love because you don`t force yourself to fall. You just fall. You cannot finish a book without closing its chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to leave the past as you turn the pages.Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in which we are always learning, discovering and growing.  The greatest irony of love is letting go when you need to hold on and holding on when you need to let go. We lose someone we love only when we are destined to find someone else who can love us even more than we can love ourselves. On falling out of love, take some time to heal and then get back on the horse. But don`t ever make the same mistake of riding the same one that threw you the first time.To love is to risk rejection; to live is to risk dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must be taken because the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk involvement; to expose your feelings is to expose true self;to love is to risk not to be loved in return. How to define love: fall but do not stumble, be constant but not too persistent.
