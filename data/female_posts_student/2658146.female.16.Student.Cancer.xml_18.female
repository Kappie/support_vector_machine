Btw, for those of you who can't read the note for whatever reason, it reads as follows: "Dedicated to all my friends: Thanks for making everything worthwhile"  And the chibi says "Nyao!"  Yes, I actually have a shirt like that (see link at end of post). The grayish ring is my hematite one, and I usually have it on a chain, but it didn't work in the picture like that. The other one is my graduation ring, which I'll eventually get pictures of. Maybe. And don't ask about the black X on my hand. Only the members of the Cult of the X would know what that's for.  YAY FOR STUFF!  You can get a shirt like the one in the picture  urlLink here .   Current Mood:  Artistic
