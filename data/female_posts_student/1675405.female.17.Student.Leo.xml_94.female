Got my AP scores, a measly 3. Dissapointed, but not to the point I am not going to carry on with my life. I know I worked my ass of in Dr. P's class, and a score is not going to make me believe that more. So what's done is done, I'm moving on.     I talked to Heather yesterday for the first time in about a month or so. I don't quite know how I feel about that yet, but hey, a single conversation is not something for me to build any assumptions on. She' s a friend, that's all I know. Not my best friend anymore.    ***Note to self: Ask about NHS meeting if I haven't already missed it.**
