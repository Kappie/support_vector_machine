I love getting outside on beautiful days like today. It's so wonderful. My mood got 100% better by just spending about an hour or so outside. Actually, it was about 2 hours. I really feel great right now. I'm starting my diet and workout stuff as of today. I think tomorrow I'm gonna focus on doing a kickboxing workout...I still remember all my workouts n stuff. Way cool. I really don't feel like being much of a people person tonight...I just need tonight to be sorta calming and nice. And I don't want to hafta change out of my running clothes.  Mmm...I'm gonna go find something to do. Good day, crazies.
