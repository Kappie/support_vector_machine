What it was like - to live with heartache and pain.  Many times the tears... would come to my eyes And many times - i just cant cry out.  Throughout it all... You were there - while I worked it through.   To this day... If You would had asked me... Would you like to meet someone - that would... : speak heart to heart with you. : love and cherish you forever. : be willing to work at becoming your best friend. : be there for you through the bad times as well   as the good times.  And I had replied... I would...I WIL!!!
