I'm always busy because I have work and I have tutor, and with everything else I have going on with my life.   My grandma has problems with her brain. One part of her brain isn't functioning. She forgets things a lot really fast. And everytime I see her in the nursing home, I just want to cry. I wish that God will bless her and make her feel better. She's fine and healthy, but she can't walk and can't remember me or my family. Only my grandpa. My mom and my family consistly remind her who we are, then she remembers, but the next day, it seems like we didn't even visit her..   Theres a lot of things going on in my life. I just realized that Safee has a girlfriend, and I wish the best of luck to him and..um his girlfriend..don't know her name so I can't really say haha. A couple people told me, and one person *not named hehe* told me he asked her around the end of june..or before he went on his trip to the States. I'm glad he was able to get over things fast. Well he was the person to break up with me right? haha. I'm so weird at times. Actually correctiong, I'm weird all the time.   I watched "Win a date with Tad Hamilton" with Candace after our usual tutor with Mr. Leung, which I must say that it's getting tougher each time *test on monday ahhhhh*..and there was this one part where the main character said, "You don't love me, you love the image of me, but you have to love someone for their details..." And I guess that's what happened, really. I loved him, I admit. Not just love him, I was in love with him. I guess he just said it, maybe got caught in the moment. Someone told me why he broke up with me, and I trust her, and it was way different from what he told me haha. She told me that I hid my feelings, and I admit that's true. The funny thing is, when I was about to tell him everything, he broke up with me, but I guess it was meant to be right? And another reason was because I knew how to make him go over the top, like his pissing off status. I guess we lied a lot to each other. All those times when he was angry, he told me it wasn't my fault, but it was. And my fault for saying it wasn't him that made me upset, I lied, a lot.   Tomorrow, I'm going to give the things he gave me back to him. Not tomorrow, but maybeanother time..
