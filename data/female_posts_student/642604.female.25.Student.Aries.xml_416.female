"You'll find better love, strong as it ever was, deep as the river runs, warm as the morning sun...."  "Four o'clock get up and go and Five o'clock that rooster's crowin...."  "Guess you got what you wanted, what about me?...."  "I still want you by my side just to help me dry the tears that I've cried..."  "Time's been good to you, you know what I mean...."
