For scientific purposes I decided to try potty-ing feet flat on the floor, it's terribly uncomfortable. However my legs didn't go to sleep, when I tip-toe they usually do and getting up turns into a real bitch. I also tried potty-ing sitting straight up, boy was that a bastard! Take my word for it, it was.
