On its good side, of course.  I am probably the only transferee who loves UE more than I love the school that kicked me out.  I mean, it’s expected from transferees to feel a bit of resentment against San Beda or UP or Ateneo or UST but somehow, they still feel they belong there.  No school spirit.  A lot of it, I think, stems from the fact that UE is so org-based that they think the only reason they can assure themselves support, moral, financial, or otherwise, is if they work together, as a basic unit and not as a whole UE community.  Like I always say, when people from UE pass the bar, or God help us, even top the bar, the newspapers will not indicate John Doe, member of this or that fraternity or Jane Dela Cruz, transferee from this or that school.  Rather, it will say, paquita motivo, UE Law.  Come on, the school administration may not love and support the UE Barristers, but we should shove it in their face that we love the school.   “The next time you feel like CHATTING OR MAKING UNNECESSARY NOIISE IN THE LIBRARY, take a good look at the results of the recent bar examinations, IT WILL SHUT YOU UP.   The LIBRARY IS A PLACE FOR STUDYING. Let us all keep it that way”  I plan to have this announcement posted on the bulletin board next to the article posted “Why UE Failed the Bar”.  I hate the way the UE people don’t take their studies seriously, the way they don’t take their classmates seriously enough to respect them.  No wonder other schools don’t take UE, with emphasis on DON’T.  They, I repeat, do not take US, UE Law students seriously, because we don’t take US seriously.   N.B.  i'm gonna take the bar this September and i still feel this way
