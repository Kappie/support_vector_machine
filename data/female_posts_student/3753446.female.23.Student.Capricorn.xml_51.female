I woke up this morning, and first thing I did was pop in that CD. And then it has to travel with my to my car and to my lab and back again. This is truly insane. I gotta get it out of my system. I hear people are going out to the clubs next week, and I am going to try to hold out. After all I have a test around then to take care of. But until then, I'll be the one dancing in my apartment with my cat, dancing in my lab when everyone leaves, and dancing in my car as I drive down 315. have YOU seen Columbus's very own psycho dancy lady? Ok I'm out.
