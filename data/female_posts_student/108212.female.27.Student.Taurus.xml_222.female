After trying on 12 gowns and 2 1/2 hours at the store, I ended up choosing the very first one that I tried on.  We took pictures of all the dresses that I tried on.  I forgot my camera, so it's in Brian's dad's digital camera.  He's supposed to give me a disk with the pictures.  I will show them to you.  We have to be really discreet because it's bad luck for Brian to my dress.  It'll be a surprise!  I still have to wait four months for my dress to arrive (it's one that has to be ordered), but I am so excited already!
