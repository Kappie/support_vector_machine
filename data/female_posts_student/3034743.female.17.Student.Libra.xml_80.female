He said that generally on "fun" days, I blog before 10 and on "boring" days, I blog after 10. That boy has too much time on his hands....well better time on his hands than something else. I dunno. I'm in a weird mood kinda. I talked to Alex today for a bit, and that was nice. She should be back tomorrow, and that is even more nice. I dunno. Haha. Today me and Amanda went to Hi-School Pharmacy for a bit, and to Subway. That was really the only thing that I did. The rest of the day was boring. Oh well. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
