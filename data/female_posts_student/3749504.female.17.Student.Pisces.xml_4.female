The first coat was white primer and the second coat was semi-gloss black (I shall have to do a second coat of the black :X). They are pretty, pretty pretty.  I haven't written anything in Bullfrog for a long time (well, a few weeks, possibly), which is a bad thing. A very  bad  thing. To keep up with my schedule, I must write approximately three pages a day. Not gonna happen, sadly.  I really should get together with Chelsea this weekend. I mean, my family will be going away soon. Possibly Ashland this Tuesday, and Seattle (with my friends, not family) in the middle of August, and Berkeley (with possibly mom and Mary) the first week of August. Lots of traveling...and that doesn't even allude to the possibility of our annual coast vacation, which we may yet go on. Who knows what the future holds?  I don't, Mr. Spock.
