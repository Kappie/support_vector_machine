Expessally certain people that make you feel so happy that you can't help but smile... although there are some where you just want to stand there and yell WHAT DO YOU WANT... WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS??? Boys expessally, they make me wonder, and make me really just want to be able to know what they are thinking, that's alright. Now we can talk about PLACES, places I love are Maine, and Arizona. I love them both so much that you don't know. Now I have to talk about THINGS, things are so awesome! They make up my life, the computer, the phone, my cell phone... I love them to death... love them, love them, love them! Yes... well that's basically all of it. But I could go on about people for a lot longer, although most of my blogs talk about people
