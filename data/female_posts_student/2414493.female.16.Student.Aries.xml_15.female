Four and a half hours of piano today, plus a lesson, topping five. I would probably tell R if I was talking to him at this point in time, but I won't.  It's another day in the life of Lydia. I'm sitting here listening to Goo Goo Dolls and trying to do my Bailey except conversation is much, much more interesting. I'm kind of pissed off that the housekeeper pleated my pants. AGAIN. Well, thank god it's only the gray khakis (v. the khaki khakis or the gree ones or the light ones, etc.). No pleated running shorts for tomorrow.  I must be doing something wrong with the shaving cream. lol, I don't know why it bothers me so much but the rim of the can is accumulating rust and old pieces of old shaving cream. What am I supposed to do? It's kind of gross, and I just hope I finish this one soon.  I just can't shake off this overwhelming feeling of being an idiot. E, supposedly, has broken off her antisocial streak, so that leaves just me. With tomorrow comes a new semester, a new beginning, perhaps? I know there'll be people around that I can at least carry on a civilized conversation with, but not much more, and that's kind of depressing. What the heck is wrong with me? Sure, I'll act like nothing is going on, but something is, and I just wish I had a more tangible support base.  Argh, I can't work with the music on anymore.  Somewhere between flushing the toilet and washing my hands I remembered how in the first grade I thought "hate" was a bad word. Happily, I've now progressed past that horrible H word to the more pleasant sounds of crap, shit, hell, etc. To be used sparingly, of course. It's funny how we perceive words. I always thought "segway" was just that new mode of transportation but now I hear "segway into" as if it existed in the pre-Segway (with a capital S) days. And how we stick to our own pronunciation of words. Remember idio-sin-CRAZY?  I'm tired of just sitting here, and now that S has retreated to the safety of his shower, it's probably best that I focus on getting Bailey done, eh?
