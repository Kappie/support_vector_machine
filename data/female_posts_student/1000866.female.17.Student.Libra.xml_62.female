Haha, ok, I'll keep the title. Anyway, hm...I'm just thinking while cleaning my room. Why am I cleaning at this hour you ask? Well...honestly, I don't know. Probably because I'm going to lunch with Joanne and Diane tomorrow and I can't go unless my room is clean. Yeah...that's why. So, anyway...I was thinking...I feel really bad for not telling people much. I want to tell them, but is there anything to tell? What can I tell when there is nothing? Or is there? Is there stuff that I'm just avoiding calling stuff because I can't handle telling other people? I think the latter of the two is probably correct. I don't know...People keep telling me, "Yeah, you're always there for me, but what can I do for you??" I mean...that's so cool that people think I'm really there for them, and that I'm trustworthy, but, they begin to wonder after a while when they're doing all the talkng, and I'm doing all the listening. I wonder what is acceptable for me to tell people? I mean, is there a trusting people 12 step program? Wow, that'd be so cool. I really need that. I don't know. I try and try. I can almost bring myself to, but I just can't quite. I trusted Bryan with one of the most significant secrets ever a few weeks ago, but it was an, "after the fact" kind of secret. I told him who I liked before, but that was only after I liked the person, and that was reallllly really hard to tell. I can't even tell people who I USED to like, heaven forbid who I like now. Man, I don't know. Haha. That's the title of the little newsletter that a bunch of guys made up at school. It's actually pretty funny. I really honestly wonder what I can do to trust people more. I mean...I really do want to, but I fear so much that they will tell that I can't. I think I'll probably explode one day into a million trillion pieces. Haha. Alexander, Michelle, Brandon, and I have been doing this little chat room things lately. It's really quite funny. It's like one of the only things that made me happy today. I don't know why I just typed that. I didn't have an unhappy day, but, I obviously typed it for a reason, so...I'm leaving it. Teehee. I should really go back to cleanng. I don't want to be up until 3:00...again. Haha. I have to wake up at a reasonable hour too. Eeks. I'm listening to Sing Sang Sung right now. Wow, such a great song seriously. It makes me happy. Fer serious. Teehee. That's really fun to say/type. Oh well, I'm gonna go back to cleaning/listening to some sweet jazz. I still gotta hear the Love in the Tub or something like that song. Brandon and Alexander get a real kick out of it. Alexander found this sweet jazz music the other day. It's German. Ah, Germans. Tim...haha, he be cool. Anyway, I'm in a much better mood after writing! :)  Over and out!  If ya don't know who it is then you shouldn't be reading this anyway :)  XOXO
