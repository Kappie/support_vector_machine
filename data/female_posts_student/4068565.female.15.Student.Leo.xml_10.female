It was...bad. I was getting angry and emotional so I called Arik and everything was better...Can always count on him to make me smile. Hes so wonderful. So yeah that was a big interesting mess that I got myself out of. Anyways then today I got up around 8 and went out to the school for cheerleading. Ugh. I was soo extreamly tired...since I was up late talking to Arik and my mom. So we warmed up and I didn't have any breathing problems so I knew already that this year was better. We worked on some new cheers and did some stunts. We went over positions and jumps and then went to lunch. I walked over to Godfathers...yeah. Then walked back and sat around for awhile cuz no one else was back yet. Then we had cheer talk and then learned a dance. Im really bad at it now..its way to fast. Its to the song Yeah. Wow its fast. ugh. I will hopefully have it almost all down by tomorrow. Then we did more stunts and then got evaluated on a cheer and prep. It was a somewhat fun day I guess...Im just sooo sore. But that just means Im working...getting tight positions and all that. Plus I found out that someone droped Varsity so I might get to cheer some games. I don't know the exsact details to anything yet we'll figure it all out on the first day of school. So yeah...thats about all that went on today...tomorrow I'll be doing the same....just extra sore....my neck is the worst. I was counting on seeing Arik this Friday...but its not gonna work out. The 20th may tho....so then I can see him...and he can stay 3 whole days here...yay!  Anyways...Im gonna head off now....later all...  -Tara
