If you have a german flag in your house or something like this people will think you're a Nazi. Is this reaction to patriotism to extreme. In America after 9/11 the american flag became ubiquitous.  What does a flag represent. Does the american flag represent as the song says: Compromise, Conformity, Assimilation, Submission, Ignorance, Hypocrisy, Brutality, the Elite. Or is it something else that was yearning to be expressed here. A feeling of collective sorrow, a will to overcome grief, a recognition of the freedom that was taken for granted? In Australia John Howard has tied school funding to the compulsory flying of the australian flag. I find this completely inappropiate, it is enforcing a patriotic position onthe australian student who has never been patriotic and never should be. Where is a healthy point between national pride and irrational jingoism, surely its not up  a flagpole.
