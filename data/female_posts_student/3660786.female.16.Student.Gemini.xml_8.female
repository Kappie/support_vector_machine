One : Play your Aerosmith CD 400 times.  My result : Actually getting into the song too much and dancing around the room, then tripping, and not being able to fall asleep because of the pain jutting through my arm.  Two : Take a Hot Bath.  My result : Ended up playing with my little brothers' rubber duckies and splashing water every where, then having to clean it up. Which made me hungry so I went and ate some raspberry sorbet. Upon which made me hyper because of the large quantity of sugar it contained.  Three : Read a Steven King Novel.  My result : The book scared the shit out of me, and I was too scared to get into bed without leaving the lights on, and I cannot sleep with the lights on no matter how hard I try.   Four : Work On your screenplay.  My result : I ended up yelling at the computer and slaming my fists on the keyboard becuase it froze up, which made the computer restart, and that angere4d me, so I went downstairs and put a FRIENDS DVD in.  Five : Drink a glass of warm milk.  My result : Did that, but realized I was lactose intolerant and the milk I drank wasn't soy. I threw up in the toilet and had a sore throat for an hour.  Six : clean your room.  My result : Cleaned it very well. Didn't make me tired enough to sleep.  So there you have it. I've really tried to go to sleep, but nothing works. My brothers and sisters are all asleep, all 13 of them! I cant sleep though.... Too bad.
