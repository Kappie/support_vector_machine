Some nerve he has.    Thus another friendship is down the drain.    People are difficult. I hate them all. Sometimes I wish I didn't have friends. Of course, since I'm in a semi-sane state of mind right now, I know that's a very BAD thing. That reminds me, I need to make Ryan some cookies...    Curse long distances! Justin would totally be another best buddy if he didn't live in RHODE ISLAND. Goddamn. I'd have so many more friends if all the cool people didn't live in Michigan and RI and Norway... Fucking hell.    I've  become such a pottymouth. It doesn't really bother me, there's no meaning in the words to me. After all, they're just words. But when I'm in public, I tend to come across people who don't think they're "just words." Stupid pricks. Them and their pop culture... eww... *shudders*    And since you people never seem to be satisfied with what I say, I'll put it here for future reference: I'm attracted to Ryan. He's cute, innocent, charming, and incredibly cool. He's got a job and he can drive. He's responsible, and his parents are practically non-existant so he gets to do a lot of things he wants. But, I don't want to date him. That's right. You heard me you bastards. I don't think he has the aspirations I'm looking for in a future partner. I need someone with a plan. And flunking out of half of your classes in high school is not what I'd call a plan. On top of that, he's kinda like Genell. Heck, he even compares himself to her. That means I can't swear and pull as many perverted sex jokes around him. I don't think I'm sensitive enough for him anyway. I'm a very conceited person.    If you don't mind, I have to go take my amoxicillin and then curse myself for my pitiful existance.   Current Mood:  ...
