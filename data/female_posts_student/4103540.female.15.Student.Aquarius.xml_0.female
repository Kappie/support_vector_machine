From now on each of my posts is going to be about at least one song...So to start with we have...  Green Day: Good Riddance (Time of your life)  I've always been quite fond of this even though it's possibly the most over-used and mis-used song ever. All over the place people go on about how it was their graduation song and it reminds them of all the great times they had etc etc etc. Does nobody except me see that the song is called Good Riddance (Time of your life)? Obviously... Won't stop me liking it, it just annoys me...Having songs constantly played is the no.1 way to ruin them for me. I'm willing to bet at my prom in March this will get played. And I won't be dancing. And I'm greatful for this song in a way, something modern to play on violin that isn't The Corrs, oh how I'm sick of The Corrs. And it's acoustic guitar, also perfect for me.   Good Riddance (Time of your life) - Lyrics   Another turning point,a fork stuck in the road. Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test, and don't ask why. It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  So take the photographs, and still frames in your mind. Hang it on a shelf in good health and good time. Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial. For what it's worth, it was worth all the while.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.  It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life.
