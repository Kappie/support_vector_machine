The distinct air of desperation wafting from my every pore?        I don't think I'm going to bone The Phoenix. We had another writing session tonight, him, James, and me. We finished by 2:30. Awesome for the feat of playwrighting, sucks for the "Spend as much time as humanly possible with The Phoenix" plan. I smoothly ask if one of the guys will walk me home. Yes, it's just down the street, but who knows what kind of Welsh crazies lurk in the shadows in the middle of the night? He offers to do it. Good sign, right? Here's why I think we are not destined to cleave (as the fabulous   urlLink Nick Twisp  would say): yes, I think we have delightful chemistry together. At least, for our first few encounters, when we hadn't really talked and didn't really know each other. But now we've spent a decent amount of time together (any time you're with someone for over 24 hours straight shoots you up to a whole new level of bonding) and we're still at that same point. The natural chemistry can only take you so far, you see. We're still at that point where we don't really talk about anything, except for, "So, that play we just wrote," or "Wow, only three weeks til Edinburgh."     So perhaps not. But let's keep a positive outlook. Only time will tell.    Anyway, the play we wrote is really awesome, and we came up with the idea in less than an hour and all together it probably only took four, maybe four and a half hours to write. Which is a really good sign for  urlLink Hardcore .             Just so I can be cool like everybody else...(that sounds mocking but actually I really like when people do this)       Watching:     Seinfeld.  Just finished "The Secret Code," now onto "The Pothole."       Reading:     Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.  Have had it for about five years, just started it.       Listening:    The last song to come through on the iTunes was "All 4 Love" by Color Me Badd. Then I caught Felice cheating and the band serenaded me at the Peach Pit.
