Read his blog: www.jakeloveskari.blogspot.com  It'll knock your socks off to see what an  ASSHOLE  he really is. And to think, I liked him. Well, I think he just used me for someone to make-out with while Kari was gone. And to  Kari ...I apologize several times over for going out with Jake and causing you pain. Honestly I do. I'm glad that we could make up and be friends again. It's a great feeling to know now that you do not hate me. *Happy Face* But your boyfriend is another story. I honestly used to like him, and thought I still did after what he had done, but now I am not so sure. Talk to you all later.
