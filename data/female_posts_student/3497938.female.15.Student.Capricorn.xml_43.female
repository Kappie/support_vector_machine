Then me and Jessie were sitting outisde near his car and we were talking. It was about 2:30am. I told him that a man was walking down the street saying he needed help. Come to find out, he had been jumped and pistol whipped. He had 2 big gashes on his head and a big bump where they kepts hitting him with the pistol. His hand was broke and had cuts all over them. He was only 16; he was walking home and people puled up in a car and jumped out and started beating him. He looked soo pathetic and helpless. i was talking to him and telling him it would be ok. You cant even walk home these days without getting almost killed. I hate the human race...
