UM lately life has been throwing lots of punches, and somehow I've managed to be quite peachy about it. (God is amazing!) and PRAYER ROCKS! ok here's an amazing lil mmiracle of the day. Yesterday was full of insecurity, just a lot of questions, ie God should I really go on the retreat....and so forth.  After getting all my stuff from my old home, I was given my mail... in it was a SUPER old check (from january) for 15. well...thats just about how much i needed to go on the RETREAT! Prayer, and faith. but last night i just felt drained. what an exhausting day, the refreshing part was being with my friends. you guys are the people i depend on, you are just like sisters and brothers to me.  i'm not going to say we're going to keep in touch, but i will try to give you a call every long once in awhile. :) thats about the best i can do :)  last night was me and er's last night of official bible study...*sigh* well i gotta go get my compy outta my car so that it doesn't get jostled and broken.  peace out! love to ya neighbor, and whatever you do ' KEEP UP THE ROCK' ...LOL
