I never thought a mac could break, until you drop a rock on it...The "j" key flew off and there is a dent by the track pad, the screen went black and I can't tell if its on or off.  Thats gonna have to get fixed.  Hopefully the lil elves at  urlLink Apple  can do that for me.    Long weekend coming, yay!  Plan on BBQs, time with my girls, movies, hockey and cooking.  Anyone have any simple, but to-die-for cookout recipes?  Lay 'em on me.    Added many peeps to the linkage:   urlLink tif (finally, sorry!) ,  urlLink madchatthew ,  urlLink the sicilian ,  urlLink moe ,  urlLink hipster faggot  and  urlLink happy hooking .  Um, I think that does it for now.
