Then we didn't leave until after 10:30, which was simply  fabulous  b/c I was tired, bored, irritable, and in pain (sore throat/earache, both on left side).  OF COURSE it was at her friend's house, and she had to just chatter endlessly...  Then I got home and took meds and sat in my bed in a fairly pissed off mood.  Ken had called me at 7 to see if I was back from my 'kidnapping', but dur, I hadn't even left yet.  So he was going to go to Orfordville after he got off work and then when he got back he was going to call me and make me watch him light off fireworks or whatever.  I wasn't listening all that intently to the conversation...  Anyway, 11 rolls around and he  STILL  hasn't called me, so that didn't help my mood much, b/c there was no way in hell I was still going to go out anywhere that late feeling like I did.  Plus I was pissed off b/c after reading Lainie's comment on one of my posts, plus random other little things, I felt like I had my thoughts collected enough to tell Ken   EVERYTHING  .  And now, of course, I wasn't going to get to see him.  So I just texted him 'Im going 2 bed.  we need 2 talk 2m' and hoped I'd be in the mood for it tomorrow.  Then I got ready for bed, and about 20 mins later, right before I turned off my light at whatnot, I texted him again 'I meant what I wrote in the letter', I don't really know why I texted him  that , I was just in a sharing mood and figured I'd take advantage of it...    Oh yeah -- my mom talked to Fran and everything is good w/ the house sitting thing. :)  They talked for like, 20 mins, and my mom won't tell me what they talked about b/c she said she told Fran she wouldn't.  They doesn't really sound good, does it?  And then there were my mom's replies... "Don't worry about that, she likes vodka" and "I'll check her luggage before she leaves"   Hmmm.. comforting, isn't it?  Anyway, she told me that Fran's going to talk to me after the 4N6 meeting on Tues. and give me all the details and whatnot.  So yeah, sometime next week I'll talk to everyone about spending the night and whatnot.  Today's probably going to suck for most of the day...  I have an eye appt. at 1, but it's supposed to be really short.  Ashley's grad party starts at 12, so I'm just going to go after my eye appt... I didn't RSVP, but I don't think it'll matter, b/c I'm just going to stop by and say hi anyway...  I have to go shopping w/ my mother at some point today, so she can buy me a new outfit for my senior pics...  And today's my grandma's b-day, so we'll probably all go out for dinner...  And  then  I'll get to talk to Ken tonight, which will be one big fucking party...  If he doesn't come over tonight I think I'm going to just snap.  Rattle everything I want to say off in one big long sentence over the phone.  I can't deal with this anymore, honestly...  notfairnotfairnotfair...  *runs headfirst into a cement wall*
