We went to get coffee and then headed to Pinball Pete's for some pool and CRACK. Hahaha. Went to Outback Steakhouse for dinner with Mom, Brother, Brother's girlfriend, Brother's girlfriend's sister, Nick (yeeeeaah.... we won't go there, will we Mike?), and Mike. Came home and got so drunk I couldn't see straight. YAY! And now I'm ready to throw up whatever bile has accumulated in my stomach, maybe last night's JACKAROO AND CHEEEEEEESE. BOO! Nick takes public humiliation very well.   Today...  I think I'll be spending 11am-2pm with B in downtown A2 at Hash Bash, hopefully won't see my parent's there. My mom invited me. I really think she desperately wants me to smoke pot. If anything, just so we have something in common. I really wonder sometimes, how mother and daughter can be so completely different, don't even get my started on my dad. Then I pick up Mike from Jake's house and take him to Kettering with me where I get wasted out of my gourd and hang out with a bunch of engineering students / fraternity guys. Tonight will be spent being the easy whore I am... because I'm easy, and a whore. Oh, tonight will be great. One problem, I need to make it back before midnight. Drinking and driving will not occur, but it's Hash Bash so you just know I'm going to be stoned all fucking day. Today will be good. Today will be great. Today will be stoner-riffic.  I sometimes wish I could do this stuff with you... *sigh* But I'll forget and everything will be okay, at least for that short period of time. I just have to keep repeating that in my mind. Everything will be okay. Everything will be okay. Everything will be okay. I don't believe myself sometimes. Bet you won't read this... but that's okay. Everything will be okay.  Mornings.
