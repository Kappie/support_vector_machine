Now I have to convert all my tapes into cds.  I've got some really great mix tapes too.  Just recently I figured out how to burn cds on my pc and have burned all of... one.  The problem is that I want to recreate those mix tapes but since I borrowed some of the songs from a friend's cds, it's going to be a little difficult; especially since she lives in L.A.  Michelle says she may come up north this month but that could be anytime between next week and the end of the month and I don't want to wait that long.  My other alternative is buying the cds but then that would be kind of expensive if I was just going to record a few songs.   However, there is Streetlight Records, which isn't too far and they'd probably have what I'm looking for, but their quality is questionable.  I bought a movie there once... Bull Durham... on VHS and it was totally warped so I brought it back and they were happy to give me a refund or exchange it.  Well, I went back a few months later and you know they were still trying to sell that exact movie.  I recognized it from the tear in the box.  So if you ever go to Streetlight Records, be wary and make sure you have time to take back any purchases -- you have 7 days.  I like Blockbuster's policy of 30 days.  I've heard of people who hate, absolutely loath, Blockbuster, but I've never had a problem with them.  I rarely rent movies nowadays anyway.  I just keep a list of all the movies I want to see and eventually buy them.  That's a crap shoot.  I once made the mistake of buying some movies I'd never seen before and actually never remembered seeing advertised; boy, was that a mistake.  Don't ever see "Nurse Betty" or "Dr. T and the Women".  Both suck big time!  We were having a garage sale a few years back but unfortunately I didn't remember about those 2 movies or they'd be gone by now.  Now they sit on my shelf mocking my taste in movies.  UGH!   Actually, I have a few more movies I wouldn't mind getting rid of:  The Royal Tenenbaums (twisted family movie that's not all that twisted but just very boring, predictable, and depressing), All the Pretty Horses (I guess the draw for this movie was Matt Damon.  I don't see it.  He's right up there with Brad Pitt who I just can't see what the big fuss is about), Blast From the Past (total waste of 2 hours.  I like Brendan Fraser but he's totally insufferable in this movie), Captain Corelli's Mandolin (I finally watched it last year.  Now I know why I didn't take the plastic wrapper off for so long.)  I don't have much in the way of cds and I've recorded the same songs, albeit in different orders, so many times, I'm bored with them.  The only reason I've burned one cd so far is it's a copy of my latest and favorite music mix.  I call it Relaxation.  It has all of Josh Groban's English songs, a little bit of Norah Jones mixed with Sophie B. Hawkins, Jason Sellers, Mark Wills, and a couple of songs from movie soundtracks.  I like to take it with me when I'm pet sitting; it helps me to sleep.  I have the songs in the perfect order.  And let me tell you, that's not easy.  There's a whole process that goes into making a mix.  It usually takes me a couple of weeks from start to finish.  Getting the perfect mix of rhythms from soft and relaxing to rocky and uplifting... well, you don't want to bore the listener with too many soft songs in a row or with too many songs by the same artist in a row.  It's a delicate balance as anyone who's ever made a mix tape will attest to.
