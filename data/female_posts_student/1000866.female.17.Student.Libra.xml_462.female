AND, marching band has to go to the game Friday even though we can't play our halftime show. I don't think I'm going since I have to leave for MI early the next morning.   Anyway, I guess I'm going out with my family for a bit then to the marching band awards thing. I am SUCH a loser. I make myself sick.
