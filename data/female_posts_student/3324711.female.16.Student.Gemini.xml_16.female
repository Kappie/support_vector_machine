The greatest thing EVER happened yesterday, and that is that me and Behn [sorry Kara, Behn and I] found out that the old record player in my shed works, and Behn just so happened to get 20ish records for his birthday.. so we had a record party. And Im sure that this whole summer will be filled with them :) Amazing. It all put me in a mood to listen to Kiss, so Ive been listening to Love Gun and Strutter, the only songs that actually work on Kazaa. I wish I could find my Detroit Rock City ST..  I feel so disco in my new shirt, but not at the same time. I love the collar though. The collar MAKES the shirt.  Lauren, it really sounds like youre really having a bad day. Im serious when I say that you can always come crash here for a few nights or whatever.  But I am seriously really excited about this whole records thing!! This summer is definetly looking up. May just be the best summer yet.. :O  Things to Do during the summer:  - get off this gd computer. - parties [toga party/jam party/birthday party/etc] - beach - listen to records - frisbee - camping and kayaking!  What a great, great time of year. 13 days!
