I'm just not in the mood to delve into the..."ocean of emotions where no definitions exist and things lurk under the surface to appear out of nowhere."   Basically, rather than talk about some of the deep things that have been on my mind, I'll just talk about stuff that's been happening in general.  Let's see. I took my History, Math, and French finals already. Just English and Biology to go. I'm so not studying for English because it's just two essays and there's really no preparation you can do for that, so whatever. I'll probably get the same grade I always get. And anyways, the fact that*(kiss my butt, E. B. Strunk and White)I'm studying for finals in the first place is a joke. No matter what I get, my final grades for the year are going to be the same. The only class it would affect would be Math anyways. I studied for that one. We'll see how I did on Monday when that grade is posted.   Besides finals, yearbook signing has been an issue this year. I haven't had enough time to sign even like a quarter of the yearbooks I wanted to. I really wish we had one day before finals where teachers did nothing and just let us sign yearbooks and finish the year. Wishful thinking I know.   Considering that idea of yearbooks...I really don't know how one message can be enough for some people. For example, if someone is your best friend, a message in their yearbook is nice of course, but how can it say enough? And for another example, if someone is leaving for college, same question. A little message in a big book isn't going to say too much. And on that note, what's up with people writing what they couldn't say all year in yearbooks?   They write it at the last minute as if things can all of a sudden change or evolve. Like in the old show Felicity, he wrote about how much he'd been admiring her from afar as they were leaving for college. Now that's messed up. They could have had an entire four years or more together and the stupid boy waits until the absolute last minute to tell her. But then, the stupid girl forgoes her dreams of attending Stanford (well it wasn't certain if that was totally her dream and not just her parents', but she wanted to go there for her entire life) and she follows him to NYU.  That's too funny. Now that I think about it, that show has a lot of parallels with my life. But that's too much for this entry. But yeah, my point in drawing the example from Felicity was that if you have regrets, I don't know if a yearbook is the best place to express an unrequited love or something like that. Maybe you should have done that when you had time together. Maybe if you want to do it at the last minute, you should be a little more romantic than that. I don't know. That's just my take.  Yeah, it sucks to have regrets, but at a certain point, you missed the opportunity and you can't go back in time to change what you didn't do by leaving a message in a yearbook. If you love someone, then tell him or her. I agree with that, but I don't think it should be revealed for the first time in a parting message. That leaves way too much to be desired. You'll never know what would have happened had you taken the opportunity, but now it's too late, so stop being selfish.  Now, I see one exception to this rule--one very important one. If you and this person met late in life, and you and this person have been friends throwing hints at one another for the longest time, and you and this person cannot just tell one another because you've had premature such revelations in the past or you've had issues in the past, and if one of or both of these people is leaving soon and you want to take advantage of the time you have left, and if you want to be tied to one another by a stronger, more dear bond than that of friendship--then go ahead and write a sappy yearbook message explaining how you've loved him or her for the longest time, but couldn't say it and wish you had.   In that case, and that case only, it's sweet. It's cute, it's amazingly romantic and fairy tale-esque. In other situations, it's a selfish and pathetic attempt that can be summed up in the common expression of being too little and too late, or as my grandmother would say you're "trying to pick up the barrel after the fish have been let out." I love my grandmother's quirky quotes. Haha.   Anyways, I didn't want to get into a belief or anything, but I digressed or I guess you could say I developed. Whatever.   So Tuesday is the "Picnic of Splendor." I don't know if I'm going to go to that. I'll figure it out later. Then you have a couple of cool parties thrown by a couple of cool people later in the week, and then you also have the graduation performance on Wednesday.   It's going to be so hot and sticky and disgusting out there I cannot even believe it. Some people think they'll be useless because they'll be so upset that their seniors are leaving. Some people think it's going to rain, but Egan says if it rains, it'll be a good thing. He says we'll just take our instruments inside, then have a band v. orchestra football game in the mud. I just find that idea all too amusing. I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams anyone in orchestra daring to do that. I could see practically the entire band up for it, but not the orchestra. You have to admit though, that'd be funny.  So anyways, I guess I'm sort of sad the seniors are leaving, but we all knew it was coming. Some of them are awesome people I'll sincerely miss and wish I could have had more time with, but oh well. That's life. We have the summer and then we can keep in touch and have visits. Time flies; people change; they grow; they evolve; they change; they move away; they die. That's how life goes on. "It's the circle of life" on a smaller scale when talking about graduation. So yes, my point is that I'll be quite useful during the performance. I don't think I'll cry. If I do, I'll be so surprised. I'll be sad or whatever, but I accept it. Of course I'll miss them, but that's how it goes.   So, as for an update...finals are almost over. School is almost over. Graduation is near, at which, I'll be fine. Yearbooks can cause drama and revelations. You often don't miss someone until he or she is gone. You often don't realize how much you love someone until he or she has disappeared, but yearbooks are just not the place unless of course it's an exceptional situation.   I've been thinking a lot lately, but this was supposed to be an update. I think I ended up going a little deeper than that. Oh well.
