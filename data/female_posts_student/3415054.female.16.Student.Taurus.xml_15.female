Im not one to cry durin sex so he knew somethin was up.. n then I was like I wanta change. n hes like are we breakin up.. n basically I hada tell him that I loved him w/ all my heart n junk like that. God I love taht kid more than life itself. I swear him and Megan are like the most important people n my life. They are like my bestest friends EVER! but about her.. she cheated on Matt.. how sads that? I kinda feel bad for that kid but at the same time if he was bein a decent bf she wouldnt have to go out w/ other guys.. so idk. Im just glad she didnt go farther than makin out w/ Josh cuz shes slept w/ that kid PLENTY of times.. so yeah. guess shes lucky nothin more happened. Well I gotz to clean up my room so I can go w/ my baby tonite! mwahz!
