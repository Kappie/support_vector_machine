Uncle Jorge, as i fondly called him, was the person who introduced me to my currrent Boss and adviser. He wanted me to follow his footsteps and wanted to mold me into becoming a politician someday. He made me run for President of Kinabjangan Women's League so that I could lead the women of our Barangay at a young age. I won as President even if I was the youngest among them, maybe because of my own skills but, always with the support of my Uncle.  I have told him once that I won't get into politics since the most unscrupulous of men belonged in politics...but, he also made me see that there are still some politicians who are honest and service-oriented.   He lead our barangay for as long as I can remember...when i was still in highshool, he was already the Barangay Captain and until his death, he's still the Father of our small barrio...  He may have had his shortcomings, but he was only human. He also commit mistakes...still those mistakes were compensated with the goodness of his heart and the sincerity in his job.  His death brought tears in our eyes...and the feeling of emptiness always comes through, yet, i'm sure he's glad he finally found his peace since he was already suffering greatly from diabetes...and getting tired of all the hassles of being the Barangay Captain after the amputation of his right leg.  Those were trying times for him, yet he remained a stalwart figure of leadership in Kinabjangan, and even though he already stood up on his prosthetic leg, albeit unsteadily...his calming presence makes everything run smoothly.  Uncle, you've left us with your legacy...may you find peace at last in the arms of our Creator...you will always  be in our hearts...remembered...missed...and loved...till time and times are gone.
