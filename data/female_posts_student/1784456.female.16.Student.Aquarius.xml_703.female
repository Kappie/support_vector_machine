We don't know when you're coming back (if you're even going) so we don't know when to give you your pressie! Would you like it on your birthday (if you're going to be here) without Katie, or another day with both of us? Arghh! Well I'm off on the 3rd of Augie and coming back the day before your birthday, and I think Katies going on the 5th (???) and coming back god knows when... How stupid - why don't I just text you!? You're probably not going to read this until you get back! *smacks forehead* Arghhhh...  I am almost totally booked up for this week - Sunday:Bowling, Monday:Does anyone wanna come ice-skating? Tuesday:Emma Bisacre's, Wednesday:Animation course, Thursday:Cinema?, Friday:??? (packing?) Saturday: Eastboure! (woo-diddlie-hoo)
