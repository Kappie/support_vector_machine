((very, very late)) they ripped him in half ((on"accident")) and taped him back together. He was SO cool looking they couldn't help but scan him in! ((the faint of heart/stomachshould look away now))  disclaimer: yeah, this really happened, and yeah, this is why idon't talk about my friends much on here.
