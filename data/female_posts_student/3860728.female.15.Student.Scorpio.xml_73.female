I suppose talking about Ash will at least make me feel better about ash now on account of i have nobody to talk to at the moment. Hmmm i remember when we first met in November of 2000. It was like 2 or 3 weeks after my birthday and we had just moved back to Columbus from Meridian, MS. Anywho i was in the 6th grade and Lavender and Sunny were gone somewhere when his dad and him came over. It was like a little while before mom met jiro so, they came in and talked for like 2hours straight. While that was happening we sat in the den playing video games and didn't say anything for like 30 minutes lol.. i guess we're both really shy. I don't really remember what we talked about and i don't even think i told him my name, but i do remember seeing him in most of my classes when i started school. Hmmm i actually remember hanging out with him and people saying stuff about him being gay... anywho, we're still friends now. God i miss him even more now. I must seem spaztic going on and on about him, but i don't care.. hmmm more stuff about Ash  Full name: Ashley  Simon Swartout (his initials are A.S.S.)
