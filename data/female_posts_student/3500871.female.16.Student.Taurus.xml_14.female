Ok, I really really can't wait until I have that picture adder thing on here so I can add a picture of my Power Ranger, Billy. One time my sister and I were overly tired.... (It was 2 in the morning) and we made a video on webcam with my Power Ranger and Cat in the Hat doll. And we had the Power Rangers Theme song playing in the background. It was so lame. And then next day I had friends over and I showed them and I honestly had no idea how BAD that movie was, so needless to say I spent the whole time watching the video falling off the chair and crying from laughter. They laughed. And gave me funny looks. Whatever.  BYE!
