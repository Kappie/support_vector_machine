I have enough to do without doing other just completely random stuff.  anyways, ning and I always have very interesting conversations.  she told me that when she first saw jack, she thought he was cute.  now, isn't that something???  that's a sign man, a sure sign.  (they're meant to be...)  see... ning at least is a blip on jack's radar.  so... the blip just has to become stronger... then all will be well.  oh, yesterday I had a dream about jack.  it was really really freaky.  I dreamt that his plane crashed.  -__-;;  isn't that just real nice of me?  okay, I want to finish my english homework before tomorrow morning.  can I do it?  (probly not... only 20 minutes of today left)  oh, but joy!  I am back down to soup faerie level.  =D  so many tests next week.... sooo many......  ++sunny
