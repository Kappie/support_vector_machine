I mean.. these commercials are horrific and shud not be exposed to children with such sexual content: "Plug it in plug it in", "Slip and Slide" "Wet and Wild" "u know u waaant it" "quick and easy" "no leak is a good leak" "Just do it" ....ya i think i just think WAY too dirtily....not my fault. blame my fellow friends.. not me.. no way..
