I want him sooooo bad it hurts to see his picture hearing his voice shakes me to the ground I want him I need him but he dont want me back and it hurts me more i cant stand to be apart form him he barely knows me and doesnt know the extent of how i feel for him, if he only knew if only i could talk to him....my heart is empty...  I cant stand it anymore, i have to go, and not think..if he knows who he is, he'll come to me...and hopefully he'll do it soon...
