I did get a chance to chat with Jesse a little bit this morning, which was very odd beings that they moved him to day shift therefore he shouldn’t have been up. Our chat was very brief but from what I had gathered from what he had posted, he was not having a good day either. I guess they had a big power outage at his camp and that was the reason he was working a double, they needed him to help get all of the equipment back online (Jesse if you read this please correct me if I am wrong on any of this information please).   Tonight is the must attend FRG meeting. I am looking forward to it and also very happy that I will be able to see people I haven’t seen in a while. I have noticed that as time slowly creeps on, the phone calls seem to get sparser and sparser. I am sure this is due to the fact that people have found things to keep them and their time filled, like I was with school. There is nothing wrong with that but I am often curious about how everyone is doing, but I also hate being the one who has to make/initiate the phone call.   Last week I was going through a few things I happen to have at my mom’s house that were overflow messes from the apartment that now lives in a stuffy old storage unit. I came across all of my piano/music books and a fresh, empty, sketch book with brand new color pencils. So I have decided to take up a few of my old favorite passions to help pass the time while I am out of school. Jesse was very happy to know that I was sketching again. I haven’t drawn anything in such a long time and I know that in not doing so I have let down Jesse and my mom, because I have stopped doing something that I have been told I am good at and although I am upset at myself for letting my mom down, I am even more so upset that I am letting Jesse down too. So knowing full well that he would be proud of me for starting up my art again, I have accomplished two things: 1)	I gave Jesse something to smile about 2)	I am building up a skill I have left dormant way too long The cool thing about this is that my sketchbook is small enough for it to fit on my scanner and I can scan all of my completed work for him to see.   Once again I applaud modern technology.  Other than that I have only fifteen more minutes until I get to leave work and go home to get something to eat, for some reason I am really hungry right now… I am also closer to going to the meeting that I really am looking forward too. Not because the major topic of discussion is going to be filling the positions, but also because it gives me a chance to interact with people who aren’t my family for even just a few short hours. No offense to my family but you all probably know exactly what I mean.  Well I guess I have detained your time long enough. Thank you again for reading this little extension to a military wife’s mind, and please make sure to come back and continue to show support.
