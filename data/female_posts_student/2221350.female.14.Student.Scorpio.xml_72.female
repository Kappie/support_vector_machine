I find that regardless of whether I am in a good or bad mood, I can always come to the same conclusion: that happiness is ignorance, and that if you're not ignorant, then you're in denial.   think about it, when people are happy, it's only because they don't know about their other problems yet, either that or they just ignore the problems they already have until they blow up in your face.  blogging is kind of like solving problems but not really, it's just my special way of feeling better. I come here and throw-up and the internet feels sorry for me and then the next thing you know I have more stuff to throw up.   it's an endless, ravenous, horrible cycle, and I like it.   does EVERYTHING have to become a problem? Can't I take a fucking piss without upsetting someone? No, because if I piss too long they'll think I'm mad at them so they blame someone else so those two start fighting so the other one tries to mediate but after several hours of careful dissection of my long-winded piss, they come to the conclusion that the third person is at fault but the third person, being selfish and stupid, blames it on me, who already knew the long piss was my fault in the first place, as I was the only one who drank all iced tea, which is also bound to piss someone off.  And THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is the story of my life...  And from the womb of hell springs the brightest angel, who being ignored, finds solace in wrong-doing.  ((I made that up))
