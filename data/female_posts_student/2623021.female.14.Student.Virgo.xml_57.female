But that was long ago  Girls didn't care about boys, and boys didn't care about girls,  but that was long ago,  Parents were easier on us, Punishments weren't as severe,  but that was long ago,  We didn't have to worry about scholorships or colleges,  but that was long ago,  Sports weren't as competetive, Coaches weren't as serious,  but that was long ago  As we get older things get harder, we can always look back on the times when things were easy,  but that was long ago.
