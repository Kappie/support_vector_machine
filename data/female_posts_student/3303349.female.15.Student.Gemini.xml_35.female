Just saying those words, "I love you" makes you light. It dulls the pain of life and we are surrounded with the comfort of pure, intence happyness. It is an intense emotion unlike any other. But the intenseness of it is dulled by the sheer amount of good emotion it brings. Who knew that one person saying three little words to another could set a wave of this extrme emotion on the other, and themselves. It's all consuming. But it brings on the haze of happyness. reality ceses to exist for a moment and we are at peace. To be in love is perfect and it is the only thing that is needed in life, before it's abrupt end.
