I should be in bed like everyone else, and I'm tired, but I have to dry my hair. *sneezes*  *sings* That was a very loud beep... *stops self*  Rent is all I can think about. Um... I'll think about ponies and how they should die. Grr.  Nah. I like thinking about things I enjoy. Dammit, what do I write? I write about... how my dad is here and giving me a look. That is not something I enjoy. I do not enjoy this at all. This is scary. Not enjoyable.  I think I'll go now.
