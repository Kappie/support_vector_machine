And then, as if reading my mind, he came over and started talking to me and it turns out he just got back from France, where I'm headed to really soon. I thought it'd be interesting had we seen one another there instead. Anyways, the whole situation was weird since Brittany had never seen him before and I had to talk to him--something inside me was urging me to. So, I talked to him. The funny thing is that he doesn't seem to have changed verymuch--still the dorky, little kid who followed us around all summer, but of course older.        That wasn't the importance of seeing him, though. The important thing worth talking about now was that in seeing him, a flood of memories came into my mind from years ago and my summers with Camp Journey--the people I met, the things I did, the trips we took, the stupid, but funny sayings--just everything came back to me. And in reviewing all this, I realized I have grown and developped in life--not because of JSA or because of any single experience--but because that's the natural progression of things.        The importance in seeing him stemmed also from the fact that it made me wonder. What if I had seen him in France instead of here? What if, instead of ignoring him those years ago, I had taken an interest in him and taken him up on his offer? What if I hadn't gone to Camp Journey? What if I hadn't met some of the people I did? How would I be different?        The answers weren't important. The answers still aren't important. The importance was that I asked the questions in the first place. It's really amazing when you think how seemingly insiginificant things can shape your life in small, but fundamental ways.        Something as trivial as meeting one kid who isn't like your best friend or even that great of a friend can matter. I wonder how many people I've met who have mattered in this way. Of course there are the ones who definitely matter--the ones whose importance manifests itself each day--your best friends, boyfriends or girlfriends, family members, teachers--but I wonder if even the smallest people whose paths you cross each day have a purpose.        Like if I didn't pass that one guy, say hello, and casually smile, would the course of my day, and consequently of my life be different? I know that sounds crazy, but yes, that's what one encounter with one minor character from my past prompted me to ponder. Think about that one.        It's a tough one. Because if you believe that even the passer-by can have an impact on your life, where do you draw the line? Is everything and everyone planned or does everything and everyone you come into contact with have a significant effect in shaping the course of your life from the random pedestrian to the driver at your right to the stranger at the store? Wow, I don't know.        Coming face to face with your past, in my case at least, always brings up these deep questions. Tell me what you think.
