Well, it ends up that caroling has been cancelled this year, or was never officially planned by anyone, so we're not going. Poop, I always looked forward to that, too. Instead, I stayed home and made banana squares, except with little ingredient twists by me. Before that, though, I went out to see The Return of the King. I found that kind of sad. Christmas Eve, and I go out and watch a movie in Century 25, and come out with a ridiculously stinky popcorn smell clinging to every inch of my body. What holiday cheer. The movie was very good, though. I must say, Sam had me teary eyed for parts, no, segments, of the film. However, yesterday, my sister informed me that Elijah Wood was gay, and was going out with Dominic Monaghan, no less. That definitely threw me off guard, and I couldn't stop thinking about it as they embraced when the fellowship met up again. I tried to take my mind off of it and savor the happiness of the scene, but it just wouldn't leave my mind. It's definitely a disturbance. And I'm sure, if this is new to you, you'd know exactly what I'm talking about. We're having people over at our house tomorrow, and I guess that's where my banana squares are going to, as a "Welcome, let's begin to stuff ourselves" dish, of which we have many more. From those, we're led to the appetizers, then the main dishes, filling drinks, and then belt-busting dessert. And I really mean belt-busting. There's going to be so much food, we could probably take out an eighth and feed a small family with it. It's a good thing a lot of people are coming... Yesterday, I went to Kumon for the first time in three months with street clothes on. I had always walked there after cross country, or "pre-track", now, and in my sweats or shorts. It's pretty gross, actually. Last time I came in soaking and shivering, and my head was dripping. I just tried my banana squares, and they taste good. On Monday, I went over to Christina's house for our little Christmas party thing, and we watched Pirates of the Carribean, which was pretty good. Then we did the gift exchange, and I watched everyone else play DDR. The end. There are pictures.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.1nnemo1zUy=-hlo7qs=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3DtrueUx=1  Here are pictures from Winterball, if you missed them.  urlLink http://www.ofoto.com/ShareLandingSignin.jsp?Uc=cegxtsb.cawd1v3bUy=-jb0rr2=BrowsePhotos.jsp%3FshowSlide%3DtrueUx=1  Okay, so Winterball. It was definitely fun, even if we did get all split up. The girls, that is. I guess we just gave up on trying to stick together, since our dates were all pulling us in every direction and every restaurant. I ended up going to Macaroni Grill, with Lester, of course, as he was my date, Amanda, Josh, Liz, Eric, Grant, Mariko, and Logan. Okay, the night before Winterball, I decide nto to go to Shipbuilders because I know I have to wake up at 6:00 the next morning to get my hair done at Quanina's house. I read a little, set my alarm clock to 5:45, and go to sleep at 10:00. Alls well, until the phone rings and it's Quanina, asking where I am. I look at the clock, and lo and behold! It's 6:30. I must have turned the alarm off in my sleep. I run around, trying to pull on a bra and a shirt, when I realize that I have to wear a button up shirt so I don't muss my hair. I button myself up, then I realize that I have to wear the strapless bra I planned to wear to the dance so I don't muss my hair. I pull it on, button myself up, and off we go. I arrive at Quanina's house at 6:45, and her mom immediately combs out my hair, and begins twisting it up. It's done by 7:15. and my goodness, did I have a head full of bobby pins and saturated with hair finisher. I liked it, though. Not the hair finisher, the feeling of having nice looking hair. I call my dad to come pick me up, and glance at Quanina's CCS yearbooks for about 7 minutes until my dad shows up. I go home, and resist the urge to sleep so I don't muss my hair. Still wearing pajamas and a button up shirt, I toddle around the house with what seems like a giant cinnamon bun on top of my head, and finally my dad gets tired of me and tells me to go do chores. Feeling utterly silly, I clean out Milo's litter pan and throw out the trash with my head looking really nice and the rest of me looking, well, not so nice. I decide to start on my homework, and soon it's 1:00. I grab my dress, throw some make-up into a bag, and go to Jane's house. I'm the first to arrive, and I just sort of lounge around and eat a really big apple. Jodi and Ashley come in about an hour, Jane turns up the music, and the action begins. Jane and Jodi do a simultaneous hair-curling act, while Ashley and I get their back hairs for them (Ashley was a bit more successful with that), and then the make-up breaks out. It's done in no time, and we all glide down the stairs feeling quite a lot more beautiful than how we had come. Jane's mom takes a group picture, and we're officially done. There was actually more to it than that, but it would take to long to write about. Greg comes first, to pick Jodi up, and Jane, Ashley and I are left feeling a little lost. We talk about dinner and dates and limos (Ashley went in a stretch Hummer! I was so jealous.), and before I know it, Lester arrives. Jane's mom opens the door, and Mrs. Mopas pops out with a camera. I feel a little awkward, because it's not even my house in which Lester and I were taking the first of many, many pictures, but I smile anyway, maybe a bit in bewilderment. Then off we go. I really don't know what I would have done if I had gone with who I had wanted to go with, because I would have been so utterly nervous, I probably would have peed my pants. Err, dress. So anyway, I'm pretty at ease with Lester, and we pick up Amanda, then we arrive at school, meeting up with everyone else in our little limo group. More pictures, and a ton more pictures in the cafeteria, half of which I feel extremely silly during, and then we leave in the limo. The whole limo thing was pretty bleh, and not at all as glamorous as I had imagined, as it smelled like smoker's breath and there were two feet marks on the window (major turnoff). Then, the TV popped out right into the back of Eric's neck, and when we stop at the restaurant, the chauffeur immediately goes into repairman-mode and tries to fix it. There was a whole hullabaloo with the reservation thingies, but eventually we make it in, after about five of the following conversations: Hello, dear, may I ask what you're all dressed up for?(Like I could say no)
