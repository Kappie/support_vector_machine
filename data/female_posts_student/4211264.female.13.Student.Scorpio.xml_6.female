We went to Hollywood and got the movie "The Perfect Score", which ended up being comptely stupid with a horrible ending. When we finished watching that, we watched "Free Willy 2", which was incredibly good. I love that movie, I don't know why. While watching the movies we ate popcorn and Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Olivia ate  New York Chocolate Chunk  while I ate  Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough.  It was goot. I think tomorrow we are going swimmin' at SWCC again so we can get tans. How do they do that, you ask? We swim for a bit, then we go outside and lie in the bendy chairs they have there, and well.... tan. Incredibly, eh? HEY! I sound like a canadian. Now for other words, I've been watching the Olympics lately, and the one I really like to watch are the gymnastics, like the one with the two seperate bars, and they do twisty-flippy-double-backhand-springy-maddings. It's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Yada yada yada, I keep goin' on! I gotsta go...  -Sierra
