SPANISH ROCKS! i decided i was gonna help jonny study spanish. i know my verbs and phrases, i got those down! I havnt had spanish for over a year and I still remember them. Mostly because the beautiful and talented Jamie Beaver helped me in my days of learning them. We studied, maybe he remember the hints i gave, i dont know!  Reality tv, i love it. I do, im not going to lie! But i hate Big Brother. I dont know why, it just seems....nasty!  I dont know what to write. Im just rambling. I cant wait till Mudd Bowl, Adam you're going down!! Im going to just go all out and tackle everyone who comes within 5 feet of me! make that 3 feet!! YAY for dirt!  God made dirt, dirt wont hurt!!  Peace out yall!!!
