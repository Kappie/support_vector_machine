But, unfortunatly, I feel that too many people are reading this, and it's starting to get really weird when random people talk to me about my blog, people I had no idea exist. Or my worst enimies. Or people I rant about on here. Or my current boyfriend or crush, because that's awkward when they read bad stuff. Or awesome when they read good stuff. So I'm blogging elsewhere. Want the link? It's easy to find. Remember, clicking on that link requires you to keep your mouth zippo'ed shut.   Love you. I'll see you in 46 days, San and Erin....*screams*
