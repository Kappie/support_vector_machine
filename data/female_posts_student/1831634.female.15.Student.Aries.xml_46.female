I really really really wanna go over now.  =)  but the thing is... just randomly going over to jack's house is not the same thing as just randomly going over to kailing's house.  -__-;;  (maybe because jack's not kailing!  lol yeah anyways...)  but I dunno how they're gonna fit people into his house.... it's freaky small.  maybe he's gonna move to frisco or something.  =)  then he wouldn't be around to depress me.  oh, while I was talking to my mom, she was like, "there's nothing between you and jack, right?"  and I went "umm.... noooo way..." and she went "just making sure.  I mean, you're a girl and he's a guy, and I always leave you two alone in the house together..."  and I went "gee you make it sound so bad."  and then she like gave a lecture about sex without ever using that word... haha.  and how not to "try it out" with jack or whatever.  and I was sweatdropping like crazy.  it was v. v. v. strange conversation.  -______-;;  and then I was thankful she's never heard one of ning's conversations with me.  lol.  that would not have gone over too well...  and then we talked more about jack... and more about jack... and it was strange.  and she told me again that jack dragged his parents to willow bend mall to "look at sunshine's drawing".  and according to her, he told his parents that he was glad they never wasted their money on teaching him how to draw b/c he could never had turned out anything like whatever crap I had exhibited there.  (dun remember what it was, just remember I hated the stupid picture)  hahahahahha.  -__-  he's not normal.  I swear.  not like, gay, or anything, but not normal.  and he was born with perfect pitch, man, BORN WITH IT.  I am so mad at him.  go move to frisco, little boy!  aaaand I was looking through this backpack one day and I saw this note from this tracey girl in canada... and he said for me to not open it (cuz I was opening everything else of his.  I looked at all his progress reports.  lol.).  and then he said it was because he didn't even read it yet.  and he got it before he moved to plano in august.  and I was like "o0;;;;"  and then I made a mental note to never write jack anything because it will just be a waste of time, energy, and paper on my part.  =)  and now I'm gonna go eat then tackle my homework then GET MORE THAN 5 HOURS OF SLEEP TONIGHT.  =D  ++sunny
