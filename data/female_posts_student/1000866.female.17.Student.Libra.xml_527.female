I love high school and my friends and my life, but sometimes people really get to me. I wish people could at least act their pants size. Ugh.  I'm talking to Pat right now though. :) He's such a fun kid to talk to. Too bad I almost never go to MI.   Anyway, I think I'm going to stop writing in here before I end up writing something I regret about my friends who I'm not too happy with right now.
