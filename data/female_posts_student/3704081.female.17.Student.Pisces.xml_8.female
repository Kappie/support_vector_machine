You can't say that it wasn't entirely educational either. But what I did learn from that trip of mine is this: people suck. People like the ones I went with primarily. They all were nice for about the first, oh, five minutes. But now I'm home, with the majority of my friends that I actually want to be around are gone. So I fill up my time talking to a bunch of boring people who don't ever do anything. here's how a conversation goes: "Hi." "hi." "what's up?" "nothing much, how about you?" "Nothing." and it just stops. Doesn't that sound exciting?  NO.
