As it turns out…. my days off keep turning into days working I have another 6:30-2:30 day tomorrow… those are killer. Oh well, it beats me sitting here with my mind wandering like it does. I am so ready to just give up on everything…. I cannot have anything or anyone I really need. It is depressing… well since I didn’t do much there isn’t much to say…wish the phone would ring and it would be someone other than work though
