A creepy man came out from under the earth and ate out the kid's insides. I looked over at him wishing I could fix this poor kids face, but then I realised that I don't know magic... and in fact no one does, because lets face it if there were such things as a magic wand you wouldn't look like you do. Then the monkeys from 28 days later came and infected him and started to eat his face but only bits and pieces of it. After that delightful turn of events I thought of you and wondered. Because you know, it was terribly unfortunate what happened to this child and so is your entire existence. Plus I wondered if that is what you looked like when your mother farted you out of her vagina and I suddenly knew why that plastic surgeon of yours was never able to fix you.  Talia P.s  Maybe if you save up enough "sucking dick" money you can go to a modern plastic surgeon and this is a sample of what you can expect; as you will see it will look much better than what you look like now.  This is the best we can do.   http://www.horrordvdtalk.com/reviews/28DaysUS/28Days-42.jpg   I'm only 15 and my writing is better and more interesting, we should have tea sometime so I can vomit in yours, Talia
