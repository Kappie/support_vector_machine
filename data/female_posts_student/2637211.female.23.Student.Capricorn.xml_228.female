They barely seem to notice that I'm graduating, while everyone else's parents are all excited and doing cool things for them since they've finally finished college. And my friends Holly and Roz are showing up, but I have no idea when or even exactly where, and one is out of touch for the week, the other said she would call me back in an hour last Thursday but never did, so somehow I feel like it's her obligation to call me. Maybe I'm just a flake, but I think she should call me. I've decided that if people want to see me and do things with me, maybe they should call me, and include me in their plans. Seems simple, but it rarely happens in my life. I'm worried about this whole thing being a clusterf*ck mess with crazy people and no where to sleep. If this is any kind of repeat of picnic day, I will honestly pitch a fit. If I have to step over people to have breakfast with my mom, I will start yelling. I'm not sure where the rage and panic is coming from, but it's rising quickly, and I need to start organizing this boloney before anything crazy happens. Maybe it's just that I'd prefer something smaller and lower key on Friday night, and the insanity to happen on Saturday night. I don't mind small get together, I do mind drunken sleeping all day. I don't know, I feeling crazy and out of control lately, and my head and balance have been off. I feel like something's wrong with me. Oh, I know, I'm graduating.
