We entertained ourselves for a good ten minutes just watching him and also the guy next to us that was totally picking his nose. It was so gross I didn't know a finger could go that far up a nose. But the highlight of the day was Bo and seeing him driving around in his awesome new pickup that I am proud to say that I probably helped pay for! Too bad its not me driving it. Any way Happy Vday to everyone!
