My dad and brother and I went out to Circuit City earlier tonight and I picked up a few new albums for our trip to Canada next week. Woot. Anyways. We got a new digital camera, too, so I'll take some pictures in Canada for all of you guys to see; I'll probably post them on my blog and make some photo albums to put on my home page.     Last song I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster .    Last meal I ate:  Macaroni, fruit salad.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Band camp is in... what... like a week and a half or something :P?   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I found a periodic table placemat from when I was about 5 years old today, and David instantly started drilling me on the elements... I haven't lost my touch :P. I think I'm going to hang onto that placemat for a while :P.   Last person I talked to:  Steph.    Favorite song today:   Motorbreath  by Metallica.    Favorite food today:  Macaroni.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Bought three new albums, and my family got a new digital camera.   Funniest thing that happened today:  "'Ac' is not actinium... it's air conditioning! And 'Ca' is not calcium; it's California!" Good times.
