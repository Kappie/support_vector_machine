Friday night I officially washed my hands of David when he bailed on a damn good Chicken Piccata dinner I spent a decent amount of time preparing.  He didn't even have the decency to call.  Schmuck.  Shawn almost got himself on the Shitlist by pouring ranch dressing all over the chicken and telling me half way through the meal that he didn't like garlic...good timing there, Shawn.  As usual, Katie remained my favorite Gainesville person...or at least one of them, but I'll get there in a minute...  Saturday Ryan came up and we did attorney training for 4 hours.  Lots of new attorneys, I'm excited, and Ryan did a great job covering Argumentation and Ethics with me.  We wandered unsuccessfully around the mall and then went to Tequillas for dinner.  Then it was off to Do Art to paint pottery for a few hours.  I'm going to become addicted to this place before I leave Gainesville, I can just see it.  We rented Dog Show, funny and very similar to Drop Dead Gorgeous.  I give it ****  Sunday Bruce and I went to Leonardo's 706 for lunch and then to see Insomnia.  After that we came back here and Frank and Zoe worked their magic on him.  The date gets *****   ()=)
