Michael, not Micheal, welcome to the Blog, I'm Will, I play Soccer, correct teachers for fun, and spend the rest of my time sleeping.  I have a knoledge of medieval torture devices as well but I don't think Z needs my help and Lindsey is pretty good at taking care of herself.    ps I am not by any means strict on grammar unless it's Rosie who messes up.
