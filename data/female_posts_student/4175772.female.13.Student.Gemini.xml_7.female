But Radar tells off a General.  He's so cute when he's mad :) Also watched the first Flagg episode.  *tries to cuddle her horde of Flagglets*  Henry also gets pretty beat up in that episode.  Why do they like being mean to him?  *tries to cuddle Henry, Flagglets and Radar at the same time but doesn't succeed* I love my M*A*S*H people.  Hi Colonel Koetzle!  I locked Frank in the bathroom today :) *is extremely proud of herself* *Grabs Henry and hugs him as he tries to prevent Hawkeye from breaking my moms vase* Thats all for now, roger will go over and out.  Oh by the way BUSH CHENEY 04 and GO ILLINOIS
