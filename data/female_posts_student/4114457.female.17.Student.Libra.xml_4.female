I just have to say how much I love the voicemails I get where I am yelled at or where I get all sorts of attitude when all I wanted to do was help in the first place. I feel like everything between me and everyone else is a lie, they lie, I lie, we all do it, and we all do it for different reasons. I try to avoid it but sometimes you have no choice, you have to protect yourself or someone else. Of course, ya know, I worked 8 hours on next to no sleep so maybe I am blowing everything slightly out of proportion but what can I say… here I am, dead tired at work and the corporate office shows up… ha, during lunch rush none the less. So everyone is scrambling, I am already worn out and about to fall over and I find out I can’t even get some water!?!?!? Uh, sorry LOL I chugged half a bottle while corporate was still there. I didn’t get caught (thank goodness--- I say this now but I didn’t mean it earlier) and I just keep on trying to work. I would rather be working then most anyplace else in the world though. And that one other place I would rather be…. It will never happen anyway, so I guess I gotta settle. But if you think about it, when I work my mind typically stays on the job, especially when we are busy, of course, as soon as it slows down and I get a chance to catch my breath… all my glorious thoughts about everyone start up again. ey yi yi!!!! I really outta be medicated. LOL ummmm don't get me started on that conversation. As soon as I got home today though I checked my phone, which is when I got the beautiful voicemail and so I called Courtney… I just kinda sat there on the phone once I said what had happened and of course, everyone got worried that I was up to something… maybe I was, maybe I wasn’t but either way, it isn’t really their problem anymore. If I don't care anymore, why should they??? Sometime after 4 I zonked out from everything, being tired and "stressed" (as everyone puts it) and didn’t wake up till dinner at almost 7. It is actually 8 o’clock now but I figure too much more exciting stuff can’t really happen between now and when I set this up online so hopefully tomorrow will be better….. HA!!! Yeah right, but it was an attempt and an honest one at that… more tomorrow…. Please stay tuned for the continuing saga.
