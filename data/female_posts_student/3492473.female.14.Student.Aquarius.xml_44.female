But that saying does come true.  The unexpected always seems to happen.  And I've learned that those  unexpected things are one of the best things out there.  I've also learned that pain eventually fades and happiness and love will find you  again.  And maybe second chances really are the greatest kind of chance.It gives you a chance to relive what you once had. And it's at the times when you're ready to let go of all this shit that something happens and *they* pull you up and made you hold on even tighter...
