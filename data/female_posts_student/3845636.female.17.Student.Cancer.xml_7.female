So I'm trying to balance things up a little and to try and keep up or to even increase the momentum. Did some serious self reflection too... to see how I can improve myself.  However, that's besides the point. Recently I made some new friends. That's interesting~ hee... these ppl didn't look friendly in the first place, but surprisingly they made the first move in approaching me. So, as usual... I'm definitely ready to reciprocate to this friendship! haha... =P This shows us that we should never judge the book by it's cover yah?  hmn... feeling slightly better too... guess I've learned that we should try to let things go at times. By accumulating them bit by bit... I'll never be able to handle them. It's just too much to worry about. Sometimes, by worrying too much about every little single thing... we tend to forget the most important stuff that we have yet to handle. So... we should try not to allow our overwhelming emotions affect us too much. All these should be set aside for the time being. I believe there will be plenty of time to solve all these problems later.  Feeling more lerthagic than usual lately... I'm not sure why either. Maybe I should try to synchronise my body clock again...  I've lots of questions in my head too... but I guess the answers will come by as time passes...
