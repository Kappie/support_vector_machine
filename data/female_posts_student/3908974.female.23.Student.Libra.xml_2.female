Had a nightmare featuring Mexican food, my boss, and a missile silo with a high powered elevator.  I couldn't shake the feeling of careening down an industrial elevator shaft miles below the surface of the earth until I'd cleared off a cup of tar black coffee.  My boss is whistling and I think I am going to squash his stupid fat head.  Why is it that people whistle?  They do it when they're in a fancy free mood, but everyone who has to hear it goes dark and stormy and homicidal after a few minutes.  Now he's immitating Elvis.   I guess I should consider myself lucky because I am "working" right now, and most people would get canned for sitting around filling in their blurties on the clock.    Finally opened my credit card bill today.  I'd been scared to confront the magnitude of my debt and admit to myself that my net worth is many thousands of dollars in the negative.  I'd left the envelope on my desk, in my backpack, on the kitchen counter.  When I finally decided that I had to at least know, I looked inside.  It's not as bad as I thought, but I won't be going out to eat or drink or do ANYTHING except sit at home in the dark and eat ramen noodles.  So, boys and girls, if anyone ever reads this but me, be warned:   DO NOT  get a credit card while you are in college.  It will be the death of you, unless you're ultra responsible and don't like to go out to the bar with your friends.  I'm going to see Lucinda Williams in Kansas City this weekend with my friend Craig.  He's 45, one of my dad's first students.  Now he's sort of a friend of the family.  He's the consummate bachelor.  Wears nothing but blazing red (Cheifs) and royal purple (K-State Wildcats) sweatshirts with food stains on them.  Drinks Budweiser in the morning, always has a five o clock shadow.  I cleaned house for him a couple of times to pick up some money and to help him lure prospective mates into his apartment.  Tell me this:  How does a man shit on the BOTTOM of his toilet?  And what kind of substance could be on a kitchen floor that would require removal with an ice scraper?  But Craig, in spite of his flaws, is a great guy with a kind heart, and his disgusting qualities are very endearing to me.
