'Cause every time they tell me that I'm not going to grow anymore, which is true, but they don't need to keep pointing it out. Like "You're in the 28th percentile for your height. That means almost 80% of the girls your age are taller than you. YOU'RE SHORT!!!" Ok well that last part was an exageration, almost. But then they're like "and you're in the 70% percentile for your weight." great, that's only what? 40% difference. yeah. And the doctor goes "since you're not going to get any taller you need to focus on your diet because the only way you're going to grow now is around." And she like looked at my stomach. Which I thought was a little hypocritical coming from her, who let's just say was... No. I'm bad at analogies. She was just fat.
