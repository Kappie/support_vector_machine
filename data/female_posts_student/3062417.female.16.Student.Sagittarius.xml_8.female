I hope so because we are basically wasting an hour and a half and I don't wanna do that. Would you rather have 3 hours for the limo after prom or 1 hour and 15 mins? I think 3 hours is more of what I'm thinking. It just doesn't seem right. Well, now I'm bored and I'm talking to Gavin and listening to The Reason by Hoobastank still...its a really good song. Well if anyone knows what we should do about the limo situation thing talk to me about it cause I dont know what to do.  Why do I constantly cry lately? What the hell is wrong with me? One thing I do know is that once all this shit clears up I will be such a better person. I know I've changed so much and I liked the old me but I think I will like the new me better. I hope other people will too. I can't help that I changed. It was against my will but if that means you can't like me anymore than ok. But I hope it means you will like me more.    I'm not a perfect person  There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you   I'm sorry that I hurt you  It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears -"The Reason"-Hoobastank  awesome song
