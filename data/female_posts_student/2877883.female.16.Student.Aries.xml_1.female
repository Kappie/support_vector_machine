On Friday, after I was told about 12,000 times that I am obsessed with matching, I came home and then hung around a bit, read a magazine I think.  Hmm, yeah that was fairly boring.  Then I went with my madre to Worcester Common Fashion Outlets, which is just about dead considering like every single store was closed and there were barely any people here.  But we went because she needed some new suits, so of course that meant I just walked around/sat in the suit store for at least an hour.  Then we went to The Sports Authority and I got a tennis racket, even though I haven't played tennis in about 5 years or more, but hey I like my racket.  Then we went out to eat at Racha Thai and we got some fabulous fish/shrimp food, so that was lovely.  Then we went to the store in Millbury  oops "The Shop pe s at Black Stone Valley"  and we went to Kohl's, which normally I really like, but I didn't really find anything and we went to to Target, which was fairly uneventful, and then we went to Circuit City to look for the ipod minis that they were supposed to have, but they didn't which was kind of dumb.  But I saw in an ad this morning that CompUSA has them so that is quite good.  Hmm then we came home I think and watched Gillies aka Gilmore Girls and I fell asleep with all my clothes on, which was fairly uncomfortable.    So then on Saturday morning, my mom woke me up a little after 8 and I felt so gross from sleeping without brushing my teeth and washing my face etc.  So I showered to make me perkier then Sar called and we decided that we really didn't want to be tortured by boring yoga with a sketchy teacher and that we just wanted to work out instead. So we did, then we went over to my brothers soccer game, but went in the car and listened to John Mayer instead of watching.  And we found about 1,000 different maps and travel guides and I learned that Tiger Woods' real first name is Eldrick so that was exciting (except not). And so then we got some Wendy's for lunch and rotted our insides with a lot of French Fries (haha remember when we were supposed to call them Freedom Fries).  Anyways, so then we went to the softball clinic at Chocksett and we were sooooooo confused about what we were supposed to do, since we are going to be  helping  with the little girls in the instructional league.  And then they made us sit through his boring boring boring coaches clinic in which a guy named Ralph talked extremely boringly about softball.  And I realized that Sar definitely had ADD 1,000 times worse than me, and everybody enjoys telling me how short my attention span is.  So then, this was tres exciting, we found our purple dots on the wall underneath the booth that we always sat in  8th grade!  Hmm then we hit with pitching machine and looked at the trophies form the 70's that Chocksett has (except in the opposite order).  Then we left finally and dropped Miss Sar off, even though I was going to see her again in like 3 hours.   So then I went home and realized I officially needed to retire from my basketball playing-ness because I was sooo sooo bad.  Then I did my French homework and finished my book for English, which I still need to discuss with Miss Carolina.  Hmmm then I changed and put on some mascara (random) and ate some spinach pizza which is always soo good, but I got a humongous chunk of spinach stuck in my teeth and I looked so incredibly like a hillbilly.  So then I went back to Sar's house before the Sutton vs. Parker girls varsity basketball game and we listened to John Mayer (obviously) and I saw her pretty new room which was fabulous.  Then Kelsey came and we sat around until we were ready to go.  So then we went.  Obviously. Then haha this is funny.  When we got there we had to park in the Parker parking lot (try saying that 5 times fast) and we decided to follow some guy with those shiny things on his shoes across a field as a short cut.  We didn't bother to realize that with the extremely mucky ground came an enormous puddle and our feet got so wet.  And Sar was so brilliant and wore flipflops.  So that was joyous, except not,  but at least memorable.  So then we went to the game and Parker lost by quite a bit, which was sad and all the girls were crying, and I felt really bad.  But before that Sarah definitely got very aggressive (like the whole be aggressive cheer) and plotted to take out about half the people in the gym.  Especially one girl on the Sutton team who was way to good for her own good.  Hmm then we came home and that was normalness and we were all really tired.  Hmm then I came home and watched UCONN lose to Villanova for the 2nd time in 2 years, which was really frustrating.  Hmm then I went to bed and slept until 10 this morning.  I was waken up by my mother who called to say that she would be home soon after my brothers baseball practice, which was at 7 this morning.  Lovely for him.  Then I had some pancakes and tacon and watched Best Week ever and now I am here, and not much more eventful has happened.  Today I might go to a movie, or work on my homework like I probably should.
