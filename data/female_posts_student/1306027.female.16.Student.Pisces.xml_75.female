You see- Im not a dress person. I will do whatever is possible to never be seen in a dress. But it was different with this dress. I felt like a princess, and trust me, I AM NOT A PRINCESS. I'm actually, quite far from. I'm a tom-boy. Lol. And no, that is not code for I am lesbian- so just shove it.    I'm so excited!!  I really can't wait. I just wish someone was here in hickville with me that day ;-D. You know who you are :-P. Btw- Everyone expect pictures in may. I will be sending them!   Now for some lyrics  I love this song!! So I had to post it!   I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   You know that you love me... so- just tell me!
