Considering I'm missing spanish, la, gs, gym, and half of math, I think it'll be great, EXCEPT pat said he is turning in his permission slip tomorrow so he can go. please let him forget, please let him forget, please let him forget. If I have to spend an entire day with that fucker, well one of us may not come back alive, while allie laughs.
