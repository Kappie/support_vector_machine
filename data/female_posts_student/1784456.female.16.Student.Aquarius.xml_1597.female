So basically, we're doing tests one every day with breaks. No time to relax kiddo, this is study hell. Ahh, so I might come on later in the week, and if I'm acting drunk, I won't be *i hope* I'll just be stressed. Actually, I might be drugged up on herbal medicene. No really, this is herbalist stuff. (or mate de coca... hmm, tough choice)
