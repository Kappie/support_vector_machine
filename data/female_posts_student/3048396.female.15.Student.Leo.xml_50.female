All over the place its saying something like do it now or you wont have the chance later...A TV show said that...a book im reading...the movie tonight. Its kinda getting to me...trying to tell me something I think. Like...do it now or you'll never get to. Makes me think bout how...you never know if you'll live tomorrow. What if I died in my sleep tonight. Would I ever get to say what I feel. Don't know why but tears just filled my eyes. What is wrong with me? Im like shaking...*sigh* My Grandpa almost lost his life last night. I guess it just hit me that he could not be with us know. I thank God he is. *sigh* Everything is getting to me. What if I don't get to do what I want...What if I don't ever see Ross again. What if I could never tell him that I loved him as much as I do. What if...*Sigh* Im almost scared that God is trying to tell me that I don't have much time left. All these signs in one day....its scaring me. *sigh* I dunno. My heart is beating so fast right now. *sigh* Well I want you all to know...how much I care...even if I supposedly "hate" you...its not like I don't care. I do. I really do. *Sigh* I want you all to know I love you. Just in case something ever happens to me. Even if it doesn't seem like it...I do. I just want you all to know this..just incase something bad would happen. You never know how much time you have left. I just hope I have alot left. I have so much to look forward to. *sigh* I really am going crazy...I should just shut up....Im gonna go now....leave you with this...Even if I dont seem like I care...I do...I love you all...and I love you Ross.
