I finished a layout for  urlLink Em 's blog, if I don't decide I hate it. But I'm not ganna put it up until she gets back or I speak to her over the phone about it.   urlLink Emilie  is gone to gulf port.  Yay!  *sarcasm* I know she may be upset by this later;  I don't miss her (that much .) I mean, I do wish she was here, but I'm not totally, dreadfully alone like I could be (or like I was on my trip south.) Which reminds me, I opened a  urlLink Xanga . It's for my poetry and "eloquent" prose. (My short shorts that sound like poetry in paragraphs.) Em opened her one, too, but I think she really just wanted to comment on  urlLink Micah 's blog.  Even though I am mildly upset by  urlLink SP Quill 's revision of my  x . shh...a heartbeat.x  I think I will submit to them again. Really, why shouldn't I? Just be sure to note that I request something stay Italic or Bold and I should be fine. Now that I have finally memorized the proper use of a semicolon I am using it where ever possible. Oh, and I'm listed on  urlLink this page  for my submission  (under Quill Poetry).  w00tness. I can't believe they published it for some reason. But they did and I think they will publish more of my stuff if I go for it.  Did I mention I was sick? I'm had something that started to get bad Thursday but it's better today. Mom has it too but here is has been worse and she went to the doctor for it. He last few days she's been as sick as I was yesterday but I didn't feel I had to go to the doctor. I have a good (young) immune system.  Little Women is on TV. The old version. Well I don't know if there is a "new" version but this is the black and white one with Katherine Hepburn in it. I think this is AMC...they've been showing her movies all day; I don't believe it's her birthday, they mentioned something about an anniversary this morning. (No, we have not been watching this ALL day. A few hours, on and off, we watched other things.)  Well, that's all I can think of...Ok, that's all I feel like typing right now. This is long enough. I think I'm going to go spell check  urlLink Emilie 's blog or something. She said she couldn't get it to work.  [addition @ 11:40 PM: My blog does this funny thing where it only shows my comments after a week and I republish something that has to change all my pages like my layout. o.0 So i just got Emilie's comment that called Metallica "posers". Yes. There is arkie butt to kick when she get's back from Mississippi. But I'll be gentle because she said I rocked... WOOHOOO!]  [addition @ 12:05 AM Aug 06: Micah's blog is called  Weave of Madness . I thought I would share this. I was just like focusing on the slight irony/humor/wtfness I see in that.]
