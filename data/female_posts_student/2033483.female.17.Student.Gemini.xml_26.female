I woke up feeling better but there was no real point in going to school for 3 periods.  Renae and Jess both called after school which was nice.  Renae to make sure I was okay and Jess the same but she called bearing bad news.  I will be doing homework until I die apparently.  I'll recap my weekend for ya'll because it was much more fascinating than my day.   On Friday: The fam and I went to the mall for supper where I saw Jason.  I think he must have been training for a job or something.  After the mall we came home and my Cousin Jeff, his kids, Emily and Justin and his girlfriend Christie came here from Spearfish to watch Christie's son play in the football tourny.  They came around 11:30 and they were so loud talking to my parents until around 2 in the morning I didn't fall asleep until they all went to bed.    Saturday: I had to babysit at 7 and was not happy with my 6:30 wake up call.  When I got home at 12:30 I ate a bit, then showered.  Next, I took a nap until my dad called at 6 to tell me to start getting ready cuz Renae would be on her way soon.  Renae got lost coming over to my house, which is okay because everyone seems to the first time.  She found it tho and we were off to Black Sheep, 45 minutes early.  We thought we were smart and would get a place to sit down.  We couldn't have been more wrong!  By the time we got there it was already standing room only.  GRRR!  If Kurt wouldn't have moved their is no way we would have got to see the band.  They were awesome by the way! The bass player was so HOTT!  After Rookie of the Year was done, Renae and I decided to leave and go to Hy-Vee cuz I wanted to find out if Sean had our tickets yet. Plus, we were hot and sick of standing by that time anyway.  Do you think Sean would have our tickets. no! Sean didn't have the tickets!  Whatever!  So we thought we'd catch the last few songs of Spill Canvas and went back.  We got there just in time to see everyone walking out, yea we know we're cool.  But it was fun we stayed and talked to Kurt, Ross,surprisingly, Joe and some other kids that were in that huddle but I don't recall whom.  On the car ride home Eaner and I agreed we had loads of fun.  But our Guests didn't get back from the game until 1 in the morning so it was another late night!  GRRR  Sunday: Woke up around 10 against my will.  If I would of had my way I would have stayed in bed all day.  But NOOOO...We all went out for lunch at Ruby Tuesday and Renae was there with her dad so that was a bit funny.  After lunch we went out to my big bro's house for Andy's b-day party.  My baby is now 6.  Sentimental tear!  Then we came home I wrote my lit and comp paper and did my history notes until it was time to go to church.    Fun weekend all in all but it defiantly wore me out.
