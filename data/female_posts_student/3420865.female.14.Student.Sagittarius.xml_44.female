(aha i'm kidding. it was wierd. it was cute.) then we went into the basement and watched pearl harbour. and since tim's a guy, he had to comment on the fact that it was a love story...and when i say comment, i don't mean in a good way.      so since we didn't have enough time to watch the movie, i just told them the ending...and ruined it for them. then we went outside, erblina's dad picked her up, and me, tim, erin and vanessa just waited outside for the rest of the parents to come. ahaha then the best part of the evening came...k, it was like 10:45, and you know how you're not supposed to be loud after 11:00? yeah. well there was this woman on vanessa's street, like 2 houses down from her, and she came out at 10:45, and told us to be quiet or she'd call the police. when really, we weren't being that loud. (minus tim throwing rocks and this big metal thing on vanessa's lawn. and it made a loud noise...but whatever.) and if we were being loud, then vanessa's mom would have told us. so this woman needs to relax. but it was funny...then she went inside, and we made fun of her. (kindof mean, yes. but again...whatever.) then we talked and stuff, and then my brother came to pick me up. and drove me home, obviously.      then i went to bed...cuz i had to wake up early today. because i have an orthodontist appointment at 9:50. and i have to take the bus...but i could have woken up later then 6:30, but i thought it was at 9 and my dad was driving me. but no. i have to take the bus...erin wants me to visit her at bunsmaster (where she works) after my appointment...i would...but i don't know where it is. fruk.      "were janet and david home when you went out?"-me   "no. but we had dinner."-my brother...so random. and so pointless.      "go to sleep."-woman telling us to be quiet...yes. i'm going to go to sleep at 11. or you know,not.      "is that nice 'n' easy?"-vanessa's mom, talking about the dye erblina got vanessa.   "no. it's hard 'n' fast."-erin.      frik. i suck.      so i shall be leaving to catch the bus soon...it should be fun. (only not.)      aaah so excited for tomorrow. cuz sofija's coming over! wow. i'm seriously so psyched...minus the fact that she wants me to meet her downtown at 8:15. then we're catching the bus back to my house, and probably going on adventures. so yes. should be so sweet.      the brightness left your eyes,    as i held your face.      kayte.
