Anyway, yes, i went to the beach yesterday, came home and watched TV. Watched some degrassi, old episodes of course. The U.S. version of the show, edited out. Nice.  Stayed up till 12 to watch Higher Ground-good show, i especially like the reformed gothic. (enough about that tho) ya so, nothing atall is going on in my life and i kinda like it for a change. But i constantly have to move around and since i've been in my new place i have done nothing but watch tv. My house is getting scarier by the min. due to all the writing on the wall. With a big cursive 'S'. in the middle of it all. Ya thats a lil scary.Also i keep seeing little lights..u might call them orbs but now that i just got back from Tracy's i see them all the time, i hear noises, things fall off my desk and bed without explanation. And, I've been watching my cat. Cats can pick up things just as well, or better than dogs and she looks off into no where land. she's lucky tho. Not a care in the world, she just sits, watches, loves. Thats It. Thats all she does. She'll meow when she see's me as always. She'll come to me when i call, but she acts really strange. hmmm..oh well. I have nothing on my wall except for the weird writing that's next to my bed. There she goes again staring at something(the cat)My room is still a mess, haven't touched anything since i moved here,,,things on my desk. I have my candels set out nicely. But i have yet to speek to my cards or, my cards speek to me, which ever one. So, ya sorry you had to read this, its very boring but, i just want to keep up with me blog so i dont lose touch. *Tornwings*
