The incident occurred on Tuesday in a terse discussion between the two that touched on politics, religion and money, with Cheney finally telling Leahy to "f--- off" or "go f--- yourself," the aides said.  During their exchange, Leahy noted that Republicans had accused Democrats of being anti-Catholic because they are opposed to some of President Bush's anti-abortion judges, the aides said.   That's when Cheney unloaded with the "F-bomb," aides said.   Well, he certainly showed those "anti-Catholics," now didn't he. I bet they'll never think to oppose him again. After all, the next thing to come after a good telling off, is an ass kicking.   Now, THAT, I would like to see.
