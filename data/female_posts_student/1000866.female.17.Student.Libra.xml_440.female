Seriously...on how good my day was on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best...I'm at like a 9.3 and really, the only reason it's .7 off is because of PSAT's. Well, those and the fact that I finally took my hair out and not only does my room reek of hairspray, but my hair is all hard...  It's creepy...  Anywho, (I don't think that would have been considered correct on the PSAT's) I am DEFINITELY going to sleep now. :)   Phrase of the day...    *Practice makes perfect.* ;)
