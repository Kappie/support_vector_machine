Why can they not leave me the fuck alone and trust me to take care of myself. I fucking hate it. I also hate how I'm aloud to do shit fuck all here at Aunt Liesas. I mean sure I love watching the girls, but I almost don't want to do anything at night because I don't get spend the amout of time I want to with my friends. I have to be in at this time and that time. Hello! I am more than fucking capable of taking the TTC. Oh worried I'm gonna get raped and stuffed in a trash can? FUCK YOU! Chances of that happening are slim to none. I know I have to respect that my Aunt has to get up for work...well then don't pick me up or wait for me to get home. GOD! HOw can it be I'm 16 years old and I have to abide by laws a 13 year old should.   I'm sick and tired of having to phone my parents everywhere I go. Oh it's to make sure I'm safe? Fuck that. I WILL BE OKAY! Michelle never calls her parents and she's still kicking.    FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK!   I'm so angry right now.   Jenks.
