We ran 200 meter or something like that and I beat my group twice but died after thought...i get the worst side aches ever...BUT luckily i have a vocal contest tomorrow from 11 to 5:15 so I wont have to go! YES!!!! Im watching my big fat greek wedding right now, well i was but i left it and my sister is watching it instead heheh!   We took CRTS, and i dont feel like explaining what they are but technically its tests over each subject and i need to pass them or something so i wont have to be in special classes and this also affects my drivers liscense....oh goody! Well im tired.....im gonna goooo!! TOODLEZ Oh and PS: People at our school *6th graders espicially* are assholes! I thought i would share that cuz i know you wanted to know, dont lie. :D
