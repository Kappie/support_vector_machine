Fianlly though, we found a place in the 6th row from the stage.  We could actually see the features on their faces!  It was truly great.  Almost everyone there was really preppy, the sort who obviously has a lot of money.  Hell, with a lot of those people, their parents probably paid for it.  I'm completely in debt to my parents.  I'll be doing a lot of babysitting and ironing for this concert.  But man, ws it worth it.  Adam Levine is sooooooooo hot, and Maroon 5 KICKED ASS.  Of course, I knew all the words to all the songs.  My god, I listen to that cd enough.  at least once a day... since june 1st... 2003.  I'm obsessed... so?  john mayer was really sexy too, but he tried eating the microphone.  I love the man to death, but he's so weird when he sings, and has no rhythm.  People seemed to like our saying.  while everyone else shouted "you're hot" or "marry me" or "john mayer rules", we were yelling "john mayer, be my squeegee bitch!".  We saw this article where he was talking about his first job, and he talked about how he was the best squeegee in the land, and how he could make the gas pump stop at exactly $15.  So, we made a poster that said "John mayer- the best squeegee in the land".  They wouldn't let us take it in, but they let someone else take their poster.  =(.  But everyone loved us for having an original saying.  It was a great concert, overall.
