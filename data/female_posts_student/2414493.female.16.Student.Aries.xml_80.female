It's funny, it seems like I've lost all my momentum. There's nothing to make me really care right now--not dinner, not homework, not piano, not friends.  In short, I am down. And I just need to fish myself out of this rut. Alone, please.  Dreams are potent things, but they can also be pernicious. I might have just dreamed all of the possibilities away and now I'm just left here, a human vessel sitting at the computer (think: maquina). I have a habit of doing that too much. So I've really trampled one situation, and I'm beginning to eat into another. Another one that exists only because I think it does. How incredibly stupid of me.  Maybe I am just too ambitious. I see the big picture, whatever's at the end of the tunnel, but along the way I run so fast I trip. And fall.  Naturally, I'm already quiet. Too quiet. Factor this in, and I'm practically mute.   Remember that old song by Lifehouse? Spin? I need that now.
