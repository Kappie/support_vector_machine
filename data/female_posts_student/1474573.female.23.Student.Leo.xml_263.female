Stevie poo, Steveums, Honeybunny, Sweetie, Cutie-Patootie, etc... Its very difficult to calculate the exact day because I was dating others at the time (ooh, scandal!), we werent serious, he broke up with me twice,  and  now we have the wedding anniversary that everyone remembers...  So anyway, a toast to us, [clink, clink of the plastic tumblers] the happy couple!  I love you babydoll! (OH! That's another nickname!)  :-)
