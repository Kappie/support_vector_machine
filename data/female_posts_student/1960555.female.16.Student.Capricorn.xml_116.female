(i  fell in love  with a grocer boy at safeway by the by.  i'm not even kidding.  he's my  cheese and ketchup hero .)    then i made some rather ass kicking cannaloni.  my own recipe too.  yummy.  then i decided to use the little package of face mask that i had bought while out with  Lou  (aka my mum).  so i'm using my mask (which coincidentally was actually a  mud mask for men  because i don't know how to read packages...) and i realized that i had over half of it left.  so i slap some on my mum (who complained that it was stinging her face!!) and i still had some left.  so... my  poor innocent daddy .... got a facial.  ha ha ha!   family facials .  it was hilarous.  oddly enough tho, he actually let me put it on him.  i think he really felt left out. ha ha ha.  "but it's actually for men daddy!  see! (holds up package) it's a guy!"  [saturday.  i volunteered for a forester safety fair that was in cahoots with the boys and girls club and coast capital savings.  it was pretty fun.  i met a lot of really nice people, ate some mighty fine  hot dogs  and  snow cones  and had  a good 6 or 7  suckers.  amy volunteered for the morning with me and we got to  man the mini golf  station (that was conviniently located next to the sucker pull) and then she went home and i became a  plinko god.   i also ran into  leslee  who was working there with her two sisters.  she was doing the mcdonalds gig.   good times.  they gave me  coupons and bandaids.   it was really fun.  i got a little burnt but by the next day it was gone, so woot.  that night i was suposed to go to the  fire works  with my parents, but instead i babysat for their friends and made  a pretty penny .   [sunday.  me and leslee decided to go downtown and hit up the douglas street  farmers/hippi market .  we got dropped off at the  noodle box , grabbed some chow and ate it at the bubble tea bar where tour bus people " observed us in our natural habitat " (leslee's words, not mine)  then we went to the market.  i bought a  restored 70s leather  wrist strap for 10$ and leslee got a pair of super pimped out  pink 70s shades  for 10$ aussi.  oh and did i meantion, we got them from the  cutest gay couple to ever exist .  they were freaking adorable.  after that we just kinda roamed around holding our  leftovers  from the noodle box and our  bubble teas  (which leslee kept forgetting to drink).  at about 3 leslee went home ( a la autobus ) and i met up with my parents and we went to  eternal egypt .  definatly in love with egypt (not that i wasn't already...)  but none the less, it's so different to see these artifacts  up close  than it is to see them in books.  i just couldn't get over how these works of stone and wood were  over 3000 years old .  it was just so hard to comprehend.  and to look at the mummies was just amazing.  there was a mummified  10 year old boy  (approx) and you could see that he had wavy dark brown hair.  you could see his eye lashes.  you could see his  teeth and lips  and i just couldn't get over the fact that this kid is really over 2500 years old.  so i was  blown away  by all of that.  and thats really where the day ended... well actually after the exihbit we went to the imax to see  mysteries of egypt .  it was an alright movie, not really what i had expected, but it wasn't bad.  funny thing tho, when we were waiting for the movie to start the  fire alarm went off .  but it was acutally the warning alarm.  it's not the solid ringing but it rings for a second then stops, the rings again and stops.  it was  bloody annoying , but it stopped right as the movie started.  good timing.   [so, it was a rather eventul weekend.  good times were had by all.  now i'm off to go clean the hell out of my house because  robyn  is coming over in a couple of hours to regale me with stories of her  trip to cali  to embrace her  love affair with ian .
