We have third lunch at 11:40 and I normally have 4a lunch which starts at 10:15 so yeah... it's not a good combination. Today has been exceptionally long. It felt like 7th period last block and I wanted to go home soo bad! I really can't stay on task, like I have ADD or something. I would say ADHD, but I'm not the least bit hyper today.   Current Mood:  Hungry
