And if I can, wake up for the match between Germany and Netherlands at 2:35am, though I don't see much of a fight. I need to conserve my energy for the quater-finals coming up.  Which reminds me, two full pages have been dedicated in today's paper to report the match between England and France. Boy, does Beckham look vengeful on the front page. But no one can deny the power of Zidane and Barthez!  The posts are getting longer and longer. So much for the short and sweet.
