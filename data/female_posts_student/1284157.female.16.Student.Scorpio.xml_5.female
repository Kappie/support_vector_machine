And then when you go buy the remover for eye make-up so you don't have to worry about stinging your eyes with the normal cleanser stuff, it ends up burning your eyes just as much AND it doesn't get the eyeliner off.  Damn you Theatre rules...damn you.  So, this month's warning is about the dangers of make-up.    In order to keep a lawsuit from knocking on her door, Amanda suggests that one never uses eyeliner unless he/she is well experienced peoples who can handle poking their eyes with semi-sharp, wooden objects that write on your skin. Also, if one were to be crazy enough to do this, experienced or not, do not use any kind of remover to get the black crap out of your eyes. Simple warm water and a soft washcloth works better, and hurts less. Please refer to the monkeys if you have any problems. Thank you.
