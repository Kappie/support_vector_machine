Yesterday I decided that I have a real problem..and to a stop it must come. WELL not really a stop bc there is no fun in that...but maybe we can just cut it down a little? Yes that will work Well heres the problem..I bought 5 pairs of shoes yesterday..taking my grand shoe total for the past 5 weeks up to ..hmmmm...10 pairs of shoes.. You know what..I think that evens out nicely..that is only 2 pairs a week..but still with the whole object of car insurance and drivers ed coming up I really must start saving my dough..and I think I have enough shoes to last me a nice while.  So sad as I am to say, but no more shoes for Jacque, for this holiday anyways.
