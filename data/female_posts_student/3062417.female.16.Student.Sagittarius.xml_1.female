Mine was cookie and creame and it was yummy. hehehe) Then I hung out w/ Molly, Justin, and Dave like the whole night. That was fun. I didn't get home until 11 though so that kinda sucked.  Today was good too. I had swimming for gym and water polo is funness. I had double lunch today too! And I hung out with Molly, Justin, and Dave, yet again. They are some cool kids. lol Then I had my fun study hall which I always love w/ Danielle, Carol, Kimmy, Ned, Kevin, and Beaner. They always make me laugh. My English project is finally moving along so I'm happy about that too. And as always Kim and Josh always make my bus ride home interesting. So overall my day was the best I've had in a long time.   Now I'm talking to Gavin, listening to AFI, and downloading Rooney. Later I have the first night of Cabaret. Everyone should come and watch us! I have to be there at 6:45 and it doesn't start until 7:30 so I'll get to hang out w/ all my friends again like last night. It should be a ton of fun. I can't wait. Then tomorrow I'm going to Kayla's house to film my AP project so that should be interesting. Then the last night of Cabaret! I'm gonna be so bored when this week is over. I'm not gonna have anything to do.  Song:  I can remember a place I used to go Chrysanthemums of white, they seemed so beautiful I can remember, I searched for the amaranth I'd shut my eyes... to see  Oh, how I smiled then, so near the cherished ones I knew they would appear... saw not a single one Oh, how I smiled then, waiting so patiently I'd make a wish... and bleed  While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away  I can remember... dreamt them so vividly Soft creatures draped in white, light kisses gracing me I can remember when I first realized Dreams were the only place to see them  While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away Hope was wasting away Faith was wasting away I was wasting away  I never, never wanted this I always wanted to believe I never, never wanted this How could I have become? I never, never wanted this But from the start I'd been deceived I never, never wanted this How could I have become?  I never, never wanted this I always wanted to believe I never, never wanted this I never, never wanted this But from the start I'd been deceived I never, never wanted this  Inside a crumbling effigy But you promised So dies all innocence But you promised me  While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away While I waited I was wasting away Hope was wasting away Faith was wasting away I was wasting away  "The Great Disappointment"-AFI
