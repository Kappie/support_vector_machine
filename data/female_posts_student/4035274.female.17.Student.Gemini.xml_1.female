Is itjust me,or didkicking someone while they're down become cool lately? I've been getting a lot of it. I feel like nice guys do finish last, like I'm being kicked in the head by someone I trust. The worst part is, it makes you wonder, am I really an egotistical jerk? Am I like that, do people hate me? Bloody hell, the paranoia it takes control. And I answer myself, "no no Alex, you're not like that." Really?   Meanwhile I just got an email from AJ begging me to talk to him again, in contrast to the previous dilemma it makes me think "Am I a pushover and let people walk on me b/c I'm trying to be nice to them?" Really? Bullshit, I'm not going to forgive him for him, I'm forgiving him for me. I'm using him and I'm disgusted with myself for it. Sometimes I worry he loves me as much as Simon does, but at the same time its so good (in an evil way) to know someone out there who loves me that I don't love back. Knowing that there's someone out there who will literally beg me just to talk to him as if I'm someone worth begging for. Yeah bloody right. Nobody's stuck by him, its my own damn fault for being that somebody who did, now I have this power and I'm a slave to it. Maybe I'm the succubus in my story.   Speaking of Simon, he's finally coming back in five days! I'm so happy, yes at least somethingstill makes me happy. Plenty of things do...Mandeep, Chris, music...my camera...Right. Hopefully he'll call tonight soI can tell him about this whole bloody mess (I really like that word "bloody"), I could use his support. I need someone to ease my fears and forgive me for being the awful whore I am.
