Missy I think, got a little upset about Janet and I becoming so close, but she's been with Damien the whole time anyway. John and I have been doing good, we've had some bumps and disagreements but its all good.I'm trying as hard as I can to keep him out of trouble. Well August 1st, the night of, Missy's dad (my dad pretty much) had a heart attack on his way to the store. He had open heart surgery yesterday, and as far as I know he's doing good. It was way scary yesterday. I thought it was really messed up because Missy and Dusty had their boyfriend (damien) and girlfriend (chrissy) over and a whole bunch of other people while there dad and family were at the hospital. And Dusty's selfish ass didnt care at all and all he wanted was pot. How dumb!!!!!!!!!! He's pisses me off. He has no feelings or concern about anyone else except himself. But I gotta go, put my clothes in the dryer. Laters!!!!!!!   ~*CaSeY*~
