When I lay down to sleep at night, it fizzes and bubbles like soda. Sometimes, I can feel it running out of my ears, and my eyes, and my nose, and my mouth onto the pillow but when I look down, there's nothing there. Only the vague memory of a liquid touch on my skin. A burning sensation that travels through the layers into my veins. Through my veins, it washes down the rivers of blood into my heart and then I can feel the fire smoking inside the chambers. At this time my eyes hurt and water with sleep and all I want to do is lie down and forget the world for once. Lonliness is a flame that can never be smote. It sits there and waits in the dark black coals and ashes until even the tiniest breeze whisks over the surface and kindles the beast below the shadows. Something in my heart always hurts, something is always burning, always hurting until I can't ignore it. There's always this feeling that my puzzle is missing a piece, a critical piece. I'm like a young child solving a riddle, given a puzzle by his parents. They tell them that his present is revealed to them through the puzzle and the one block that will show it all has not turned up in the box, or on the floor, or in the couch cushion. The missing link is indeed missing and I can't help but feel it through every fiber of my being. I keep telling myself that. It's missing, I tell myself. Better look for it. Better find it before you drive yourself insane from late nights and early morning, bitter sodas and apple sauce. The kind with the chunks so when I go to chew on the pulp, I remember that there's icebergs floating in the water. I just painted my nails black, the color of the sky, and already its chipping away. I pick at it as I write this nonsensical fairy poem, occasionally chewing on a nail or two and spitting the flakes of polish away, in the air, onto the carpet, onto the desk, onto my shirt. I don't care. Because in the end, no one ever notices their polish peeling and rushes to the garbage can. Shreds of nail polish are forever lost in the microscopic world we tread upon, like a lost soul trapped beneath a tombstone or locked inside a void so deep and so endless they are left with nothing and everything. I'm not well. I think I'm actually quite sick. But this sickness I will hide. This illness isn't right, it's the embodiment of insanity with phlegm and congestion. What's there to say? I'm missing so much of me, so much of you, it's hard to tell time now. The pendulum of the old roman numeral clock in the living room only swings when it wants to, only works when the air sounds right, when nothing is looking. It will rock back and forth in the dense smoke snakes that float upwards to meet the ceiling. And it will go about its business when no one but I can bear witness. That old clock is solemnly waiting something, waiting to begin its duty 24/7 only when something happens, only when its ready. Flowers leave in the winter but they return in the spring, they are born of the rain and of the clouds but also of the sun. They wait to begin life until they know they can. I'm waiting..for so many things..but mostly for you. Because that's all I can do is wait. I'm not a patient person but..love makes you do..some awfully crazy things. The next couple of days I'm going to try and smile and sing with the clouds and the birds for awhile. I'm going to run around in the meadows of the world with the ones who make me smile and laugh and forget about things and I'm going to hunt for butterflies with honey and those beautiful orchids lazily swaying at the end of the yard near the barns. But at night, when the sun is gone and the stars and moon roam the endless fields of life and death, I will think of you and your face will be what puts my tired eyes to sleep. Your words will make me dream and your touch will keep me awake until I can be in the company of my friends once more. And even then, the memory remains. There's a lot of happiness in a pocket. But finding the urge to reach deep enough down to scrape it up is hard. And the energy doesn't come in cans anymore.
