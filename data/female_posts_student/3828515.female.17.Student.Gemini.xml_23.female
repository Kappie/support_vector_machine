Humans often do not have the power to revolt productively and maintain that forward progress peacefully. The saddest part is that no one will ever have the power to stop these kinds of things from happening. Remember entropy? Entropy is the idea that the world has a strong tendency toward chaos. What can we do? Mankind in general is not intelligent enough to figure it out. If only everyone would take the time and thought to seek the guidance of God through His Word. I'm sorry for rambling on. I'm exhausted.
