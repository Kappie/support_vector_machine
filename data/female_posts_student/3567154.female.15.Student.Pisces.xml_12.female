I have been gone most of the day and then when i do come home they both are working. O well i guess. I hopefuly will talk to Jake later tonight when he gets home from work but that depends on when he gets off. But if i do not and he reads this i just wish of him to know that I miss him and I love him.   On another note. I started accutly driving today in drivers training. I found out i have one very lead foot. LOL. Yea that would be me the lil speed demond that I am. LOL. O yea and I drove out by Bryon skools and i found out there skool is TINY. I never thought my skool would be bigger then anyone elses. This is short I know but o well.  peace out,
