That movie made no sense at all. ha ha. freakin ridiculous. but i had a good time in general. i just needed some calm, laid back people to hang out with, and now i feel sooo much better. however, i am traumatized because tyler took of his pants for most of the movie and just sat there in his boxers. i've seen his ass so many times in my life, that freaks me out. ha ha. arggg. the auction is tonight and my mom had an emotional break down before she left and just started crying and talking about how she cried there and had so much left to do and no one was helping her. i felt really bad but she really got over it. i hope things stay like this. i'm gonna go get some sleep for chilling with linz tomorrow. adios.
