After nearly 5 weeks of preparation, and a morbid fascination with the word "poop" during the last week, I took the damn thing and PASSED with flying colors!!!! Altogether now, who's the shit? ME, ME and ME! I think I had nearly forgotten that great feeling of being transiently free of school, at least during this past month or so. There are times it feels I'll be studying the same thing for-freakin-ever. Its a great feeling to reach a milestone. The MD PhD program is plenty short of them.    With the test over and done, of course I took the rest of the weekend to celebrate! Friday night was pretty funny. First I cancelled on some friends who were going out for french food, with the promise that I could go see Jewel with other friends. Then, Basheer and Saqib and I spent an hour and a half cruising around PromoWest Pavilion trying to scalp tickets to the Jewel concert. After two tries with every scalper in sight, we gave up and headed to Zen Cha, my favorite little tea cafe. Basheer bought me a bubble tea to make up for the mess and knowing me and bubble tea, you can bet that made my day. We decided to head to Easton from there and saw Spiderman 2. Excellent movie, especially if you've seen the first one. I give it a B+. I know, I'm a little harsh. Movie critics have to be.  Day 2 of post-test partying involved a road trip to Sandusky and Cleveland. Aaron and Scott came with. We left at 7:30 in the morning to get to Cedar Point, taking every back road in the state of Ohio (or maybe just OH 250). The two and a half hour drive was a little much, but the guys made it bearable. It started to go a little downhill when they started dealing out IQ points to me for proper driving etiquette, and taking them away for the slightest mistake. I think by the end of the night I was somewhere between a dumb blonde and Forrest Gump. Yeah, apparently not a perfect driver. But dammit we made it there and back in one piece.   So with all this intraCamry drama, we eventually arrived at Cedar point and met up with my dear friend Soumya (Soums). The first ride we rode--Soums and I kicking, screaming, and praying the whole way--was Top Thrill Dragster. Shot out of an electromagnetic starter at 120 mph and going straight up and down 400 ft, with nothing but a lap bar to hold you back (Aaron says I'm obsessed with restraints, but I did used to work with them back at WPAFB) it was by far the most amazing thrill I have ever EVER experienced. If I remember correctly we were all in some hysterics as we got off that ride. Watching the ride is astounding enough, and lots of people did, but actually being in those seats is incomparable.    After that, we went on Millenium Force, which went 93 mph and was about 300-350 ft tall. Aaron bet me a corn dog that I wouldn't be able to put my arms up going down the hill. But the corn dog was too tempting. I went down that hill with my arms over my head thinking "I WANT MY COOOOOOORN DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG!!!!" Truly amazing what motivates me. The ride was really smooth, it felt like flying! Definitely my favorite ride in the park. And although I was too obsessed with the first hill to enjoy the view of Lake Erie very much, it was a great view as well.   Well, after those two amazing rides, it was back to the less intense, but fun ones. We rode the Iron Dragon (although I'm not sure why, it was STUPID) and then met up with Hadele, Mourad, Sogol, Shaker, Shabnam, Amir, and Daniel to ride the Gemini and the Magnum. Hadele and I are still twins. She has the same majors as me, is a CWRU hijabi on exec board of MSA, works with all the cultural dinners, and turns out, screams EXACTLY like me on rollercoasters. Same pitch, same duration, it was really freaky when we were riding Magnum together and it was like "AAAAAAAHH!   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!  " at the exact same time! After that we split off from the CWRU group and Soums, Aaron, Scott and I rode the Raptor, which was a fun ride too. And then it was off to Cleveland.   We made it to Cleveland with plenty of time and even took a little road tour of downtown. Public Square, Gund Arena, Tower City Center, Jacobs field, and the BP building. I never did find out what the name of the tallest building in Cleveland, the one immediately North of the BP building, was. Hmm, gotta find out. Anyway, Fat Fish Blue was just how I remember it. Fun, relaxing, and tasty. I got a souvenir glass with my root beer float, just for good time's sake. And of course I ordered my usual fried green tomatoes and watermelon-cucumber pan seared salmon. It was DELISH. And we finished off with a Carpetbagger. This dessert that looks like a chocolate paper bag, and is filled with fruit and mousse and cake. MMMM MMMMMM. Its definitely still my favorite restaurant in the city of Cleveland. In addition to the great food and fun silverware toys (we named all the toys: Janet, Red, Spike, Charlie, Tiny, Slim, and Ugly), the thing that made this particular night memorable was seeing all my friends at once. Soums, Sahar, Aaron T, Aaron T's girlfriend Zaynab, and his brother Dan, were all there. And in addition of course, my newer friends Aaron K and Scott.    Having Soums, Sahar, and Aaron T in the same place again was wonderful. It was back to talking about Pakistan and China and world religions and all the dreams we have, or had, our families, our other friends... It was just nice to be back home again. The only thing missing was a certain Tamina we all once knew. I missed her a lot more than usual that night. I can't believe it's been almost three years since she died. It makes me really reevaluate what I've done with those three years. Did I spend them right, did I do enough? I guess I'll see as I go.  On a more positive note, I really liked Zaynab. I think she's really good for my Aaron T. I can't wait to see where things go with them. Hopefully all good things. So, after Fat Fish Blue, we went to Pick Wick's Martini Bar, where I had my very first virgin martini. I asked for a diet coke too, and the lady said "Doublefisting tonight?" That was probably the funniest thing I heard all night, next to Soumya's "I was praying to all the Indian gods before that ride, and there's a lot of them!" After our drinks, the night was over and it was time to go home. It was so hard to tear myself away from everyone, especially Aaron T, because I know he's moving back to China again soon, so I probably won't see him for a long time. Somehow we all said our goodbyes, probably til next year, and Scott, Aaron K, and I hit the road.   I drove from 12:30 to 3:00 in the morning. I never believed that you could actually fall asleep at the wheel until I felt it last night. The blankness of the road, the way you focus on the painted lines, the way the view never changes from "just dark"... its overwhelmingly soporific. Aaron was a doll about it though. He stayed up and talked with me the whole time, about some really mundane stuff too, I think, and kept the radio going strong. THANKS AARON! :)     And to seal off the evening, let's just say Vanessa Carlton's song "A Thousand Miles" came on the radio, and Aaron and I sang it all the way home ala White Chicks. (And from the backseat, a rudely awakened Scott goes..."OH GOD NO!")   The perfect end to a perfect weekend.
