I want certain things to happen, and they don't, or there's a slim chance that they will. I can't live like that. Its just so redundant and boring. I feel like most of the world is against me no matter what I do. I just don't understand that in the least bit. I wish I could figure out what force of Nature does this to me. If anyone has any ideas, comment on this post, and let me know!
