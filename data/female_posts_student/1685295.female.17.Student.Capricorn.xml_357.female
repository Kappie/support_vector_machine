It feels weird typing...haven't done it in a while, and my fingers are not sure where the keys are suppose to go.  So what have I been doing with my time as of the late?  Absolutely nothing, and enjoying it.  Feeling copasetic.  51 days until graduation, not counting weekends and days off, but AM counting regents.
