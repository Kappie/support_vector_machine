       
      I lead a charmed life, folks.  I've just been introduced to my new best friend:  the six-day weekend.  That's right, starting tomorrow night at 10:35, I will be freed from the obligation of attending class until 9:00 the next Wednesday morning.  Let's just hope I can make all the extra time worthwhile, and get caught up on things, and perhaps even a little ahead.
