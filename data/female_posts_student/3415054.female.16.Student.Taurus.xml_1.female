Then I got on here n Jess Imed me and was like Can I tell you somethin without you getting mad. I was like wat. and she told me that basically Justin was cheating on me and that there was a girl who he had on the sidelines to replace me when we broke up. I started crying. GoD! I never wanna lose this kid I love him so incredibly much. I was really upset so I talked to Blake a lil bit and helped a bit..I love that kid so much. Its like me n him have such a past that hes soo easy to talk to. I couldnt see myself w/o him as a friend. Then Meg called me and shes havin probs w/ Matt.. so we talked bout how much harder love is than we thought it would ever be.. so yeah.. I love her so much. Shes like my best friend ever and helped me a bunch.. and then I got online and Marie was on and she made me realize I shouldnt do anything too dumm. I love her.. she makes me realize a buncha junk.. Gosh. Im just soo scared to lose him. I mean its like this is the second time this has happened n the past month.. I Love him sooo incredibly much and Im sooo scared to lose him. I think Im gonna go clean n then at 3 Ima get off here n see if Justin calls me. I think later me n Justin are sposed to go chill.. who knos.. Ima go now and get cleaned up. bye fools.
