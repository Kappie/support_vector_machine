The  urlLink article   states  that a student was caught photographing an exam with his camera phone and sending it to a friend.  Unfortunately, the consequences to a situation like this effects not only the student who cheated, but all the students in the school.  Hopefully they have a few pay phones on campus so students can make calls if needed.  And I'm sure that the cell phone ban won't stop students from bringing their phones to school, now they will just have to be much more discreet when using them.   urlLink   urlLink
