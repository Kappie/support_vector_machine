(family discretion is strongly advised: as in don't read u really don't want to)  I think people should get over the fact that I broke up with them, especially the people who physically hurt me on numerous ocassions "right now he's saying she deserved it" well you and wife beaters around the world are nodding their heads. And by numerous I mean both hands, and by physical we are talking blood and bruises with scars attached.. just to clarify. I assure you no one in their right mind do what this person did, only psychos, and certainly not the person he pretended to be.. but.. well, he's psycho and no one likes the bastard child.  He really should work on his landscaping advertisment so he can go make enough money to leave me the fuck alone.  so i write yesterday:  wow, people really are bitter when you break up wtih them, even though they beat the crap out of you... boggles my mind why ur still alive. why is it so hard for people who supposivley hate you to stay out of ur life and stop checking up on you? sorry you lose, and really i wish you would actually for once do the things you said you would, like take a "gun to ur head" (said in the message he's not supposed to send me), cuz it would stop your FAT MOUTH FROM TALKING TO ME, ur so full of shit please god please if he hates me so much make him avoid me as much as i avoid him   It was great, for a week not a single message or glance of the piece of shit.  It must have been an off week where he felt that pissing me off would take to much effort.  Needless to say I am happy now and with someone without major mental or erectile dysfunctions.  And on a side note it isn't the size so much as how to use it but when u do not have the size or the know how.. well then... ur my psycho stalker ex who after a year really has to let go.  Lets face it only six months were good and that's because you were faking u werent psycho, the three months after where you werent around were even better!  Hey what he doesn't know, and what I don't know is really what made it so great.  It's nice when people fake that they are nice sincere and care, but you know it fades. So end result I dated a person that never existed, lost a friend i didnt care about and gained ANOTHER psycho ex who wont leave me alone for whatever reason it really is cuz the reason they give is shit.... if you hated me you would avoid me! PLEASE.... ur dumb i trashed you like the garbage you are...   so it's a nice day i'm going out.. and really ur building urself up for a big fall, a much deserved one and one you brought upon ur self....
