Insomnia, anxiety, and the constant heavy load of work I need to take care of. It's just absolutely lovely. Model UN paperwork for the school board, applications for various programs, my senior resume -- all waiting to be taken care of and completed tomorrow. I really ought to study for my final now.  And it's not a good sign that I want to give up... grrr. I have way too many voices in my head. It's no hard to make a decision with so many voices giving me suggestions.
