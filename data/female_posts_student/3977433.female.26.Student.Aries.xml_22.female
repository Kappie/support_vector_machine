At the moment he's starting to show signs of yet another seizure. It's taking everything in me not to cry or think about what is behind them .    If   I lost him I would be empty  .  Trust me, you have no idea what empty is until you lose someone so close to you that you'd truely give    anything    for them. Some think they find it through life, but it was just false hopes that you could care for someone that greatly for   real  . I think after Onion died, I purposely   forgot how to open   myself to anything. And now, even if I try very hard,  I just can't seem to remember .             It's gloomy and very cold out today. Which is not so nice, it's my day off. This trail mix stuff is yummy though.         -  I have so much to lose, and nothing to give .
