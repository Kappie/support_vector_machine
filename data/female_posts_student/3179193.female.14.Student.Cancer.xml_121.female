Hilarious people. Makes me laugh so hard. Them and their eraser throwing down people's shirts. Haha... idiocy.   Read Wilfred's blog and Erica's blog at school during Computers. Tomorrow after school... band practise session for the contest. Gotta do this! ^^ So excited.  Oh my gosh! So hot! Argh! Can't... think! LOL!  Re-read the emails that Nima sent to me (almost all of them were forwards) and re-read his blog entries... I read them while listening to "Arms Of An Angel" by Sarah McLachlan. Makes me think... Same with "I Don't Wanna Know" by Mario Winans... *sighzZ*  Nima said he was a little upset today... I wonder about what. He wouldn't tell me though... *sighzZ* Blah... I'm too hot to type right now... blog later... maybe.
