Anyway, I've pretty much had nothing to do since I got off the boat, but yesterday I made a big coffee mug (that's grey, but shh, I'm sure it'll come out fine.) and ate ice cream at the new ice cream place at Stuvesant Plaza...umm they have cake batter ice cream! Anyway...I don't really have much else to update on...I'm not very interesting...so maybe I'll post more later.
