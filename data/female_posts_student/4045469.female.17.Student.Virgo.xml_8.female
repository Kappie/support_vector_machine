So I'm unsure of what to let go of, and what to keep a firm grip of, in preparing myself for the worst.  I know it seems I just sit here alday, doing nothing, but it's this nothing that seems to be everything to me. It's this nothing that allows me to be me. When I attempt to do anything else, I end up getting seriously overwhelmed and I completely lose myself, and although I hate myself beyond belief, I really don't like that.  Confusing, huh? Times that by 100,000,000,... and you get how confusing things are for the whore, shoveling the shit in my head.  This isn't right. I mean, are things really supposed to be this confusing? Am I supposed to be feeling this tired and warped? Does everybody else feel the same way? If so, how the hell do you all cope with it? Sometimes I find myself so confused I can't even do the simpliest of tasks, tasks that don't actually require much thought, if any at all, like dishes, or even just watching a simple soap on TV.  Sometimes I feel I'm on top of the world, and could take on anything, others I forget where I am, who I am and what the hell I'm supposed to be doing. I've found myself, on many occasionas, seemingly waking up from some sort of dream, almost doing something dangerous. Yesturday I found myself just about to stick my hand in the chip fryer. I really can't go on like this.  But hey, maybe it's completely "normal" and I'm just a weak piece of shit.  It really gets to me sometimes, because I find myself coming across to people, that I really want to give a good impression of myself to, as a retard. I'm deffinetly not a retard. Well... I never used to be, not so sure about now...  As a child I was freakishly smart. I really was, and I loved it. I was a strange child. I spent many days indoors just pondering endlessly over anything and everything. I was quite the little philosopher, my mother was forever losing her temper with me because I questioned and complicated EVERYTHING. But it never struck me as odd until just recently, when it came up in a discussion, and no one could honestly say they experienced similar thoughts to mine when younger, though they all seemed to find similarities amongst themselves. Every teacher I had (and believe me that's a lot of teachers, considering I've been to over 28 different schools), never failed to comment on how clever I seemed (ok ok, I know it's their job to say that, to encourage learning, but the majority of them genuinely seemed rather taken by me), and the only national test I ever sat, I came out tops. T'is just a shame I never really put any of it to use. =( Seems like myself, and many others, let my so called "potential" just slip away.  Actually, no, the more I think about it, the more I realise my mother's constant lack of interest/concern probably played a huge role in such. Because since she was never around, and never posessed the desire to educate her children when she was, I had to learn to seek out answers and conclusions on my own, and thus I picked up a "skill" I found to be of much use throughout my young life. But now it just seems to have completely vanished. I can't think on my own, and when I try my brain just seems to short circuit.  I was your regular smartass, bever missing an oportunity to flaunt it either, but now that it's all gone, I'm nothing.
