     
       so ive just finished my first full week at the language school an things are going great. today we are going to leave for zacopani and not be back till sunday night. it should be awesome to have a break from the routine of the school week and there will be plenty to do since we are very close to the square. on the bus ride there we will try to watch harry potter and the prizoner of azkaban... the third one (the one in theaters now) bootleging doesnt seemto be a problem here as several people have offered to lend us shrek 2... fun... i will try to find a cafe in zacopani but it might be until monday thta i write again, but there will be plenty to tell.. miss ya all!!           ******mary*******
