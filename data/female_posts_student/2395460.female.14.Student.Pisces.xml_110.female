Get ready for the next step in evolution and what promises to be the next v60...  Introducing the  urlLink Motorola v710 .  Still sleek, still tiny, still workable, but now with an explosive list of features:  • Hi-res 1.2-megapixel camera with auto timer and flash • Bluetooth® connectivity • 128MB Trans-Flash memory • Video clip capture and playback • "Office-quality" speakerphone • Integrated MP3 player, MP3/MIDI ringers • 2.2” active color display • Voice-activated dialing • External color display and picture caller ID • WAP 2.0 • PC sync with Mobile PhoneTools version 2.0 • Expandable memory with SD-compatible removable memory slot  Motorola seems to have done it again!
