I just got out of school maybe two or three weeks ago, and it feels like heaven (well actually heaven couldn't compare to this).  But from reading some of the blogs I've come to find that a lot of people  really  will miss being out of school for the summer. Now i personally find that insane (and trust me, i know insane)! I mean high school isn't all that bad (who the hell am I kidding it is), it's just I don't understand what's so  good  about it. It seems like the worst time of our lives instead of the best.  My mom says I should cherish my time in high school. Simply because I don't have to worry about responsiblity or a job, instead, i can just "find" myself! Well no offense to my mom, BUT WHAT THE FUCK! I'm so friggin' tried of trying to "find" myself, i never really  lost  myself, i think the problem is I don't  know  myself. If that makes any sense. On the other hand, I don't want to be 95 years old looking for my teeth on the porch and wondering why my high school years were so misreable (okay that's a little graphic). I guess high school is what you make of it. And right now I'm not exactly making the best of it.  Maybe it's not high school that sucks, but the people at high school that suck or the one's at mine anyway. My high school is full of little cliques such as the following: Preps Jocks Punks Freaks Druggies Nerds And everyone in between I'm bascially an outkast. Which is quite alright with me. All my friends are outkast too, so maybe that's my clique. The Misfits, The Unwanted, The Undesirable, The Losers, (i could go on all day). But when I think about it, all of those clique are so cliche. then again, this is high school I'm talking about.  Here are some of the main people who make other people's lives like mine a living hell.  Species: Snotnoseus Bitchus Common Features: Blonde hair  Characteristics: Never found to far away from a mirror, the species know as snotnoseus bitchus (more commonly know as cheerleaders) truly run the school. They like to give other people shit (because they can) and when bored they gossip about who is screwing who. With their Iqs lower than the temperature in Alaska, the snotnoseus bitchus are only good for one thing, sex (mostly with “jockus dickus”). They adore themselves, and despise people who aren’t like them. Natural Habitat: The Mall  Species: Jockus Dickus Common Features: Letterman Jackets Characteristics: While not all the of the jocks are complete dicks, their still is huge amount. The jockus dickus (mostly football players) are know to be complete and total jerks. They constantly bully kids who are smaller and weaker for no good reason, and they give no mercy. Not all of them are stupid, but they have exceptions. Most of their conversations include content about sex, and the only math they know are the size of their dicks. Natural Habitat: In the “Snotnoseus Bitchus" Pants  Species: Teacherus Devilus Common Features: there is vary of features, but they are mostly found with Detention Slips in hand Characteristics: Since the teacherus devilus control the school they are the main hell raisers. Some of them are cool but most of them want to fuck you up. They all work together to make students life a living hell and they won’t rest until the job is done. The ring leader is the Principal (or Head Bastard). Natural Habitat: THEY ARE EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  well there are plenty of others that i could go on and on about, but I'm pretty much bitched out for now. Maybe if I was a little more optimistic about this whole high school thing, i wouldn't be writing this. It's sorta like this quote I read from a book somewhere "The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem." Well Chow For Now
