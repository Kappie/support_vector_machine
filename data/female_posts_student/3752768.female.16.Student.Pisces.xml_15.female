I start Saturday I am so exited!!!    Me and Ryan got into a fight at his house. I was goofing off and I messed up his room and he got REAL mad. So I left his house and I actually made it all the way to mine.     But anyways Ryan came to my house and we made up. Then we had to go get Eka from work. As we were driving we saw a hitch hiker. It was so funny...When we got to Calzones I found out that the "Hitch hiker" was EKA! lol. It was so funny. So we got Eka and then we went home.    Me and Ryan went up to Lizards and Ryan was telling me that one of his Ex girlfriends had asked  him if he was still with me. He said yes of course and that little skank bitch said OH DAMN! I was so mad! But when I got to Lizards she wasnt there.     Me and Ryan got bored at Lizards so we came to my house and watched t.v and then he went home!
