Anyways, my weekend was really crappy. My mom and I got into a fight on Sunday, got shorted on my check Monday, work sucked as always, and- it was just a bad weekend. I ended it out by crying myself to sleep Sunday night. I know everyone thinks that is so pathetic and whatever, well, I don't care! See, if I cared any at all, I wouldn't have posted that information. **Too Late**  Yesterday I was still feeling slightly off my hinge, so I talked to some of my awesome friends and I felt a little better. Talking to Tim was awesome though- I must add, cause we had so much fun talking on mic and cw at the same time. We could speak our minds about certain people without actually typing it. Lol- plus, Tim played an awesome weird al song for me. Twas hilarious! I was cracking up so hard that Tim was cracking up. Lol. It was crazy. O.o I must say-  MARY NGUYEN REPRESENT!   I also talked to Tabitha and Arturo. Tabitha called and asked me if I would go out with Mike.. and I'm just like "What?!" and.. the conversation pretty much went on like that until I said "Maybe if I knew him better and lived over there". She got all quiet and was like.. "DUDE YOU WOULD GO OUT WITH MIKE?!" And I'm just like... omigosh.  Mine and Arturo's conversation was, to say the least, very strange. Lol. But then again, all of our convo's are strange. I was telling him how I had a blacklight, and he says "You should pee on the wall, than it would glow!" I told him- "Dude, I'm not gonna drop mah draws and take a gigantic swoosh at the wall. Besides, I don't even have the equipment to aim for the wall.." He laughed for at least 5 minutes after that one.. and we spent the rest of the conversation trying to get each other to smile and giggle. Don't ask, lol. It's one of those, you'd have to know us personally things.  GASP! And I got to go shopping today! WOOTANNY! I got a wireless keyboard and mouse, new shoes, cds, and a new mouse pad. Twas awesome shopping therapy. Just what I needed.  So- What would I write now Arturo?? I would write that I am happy.. and that, I like being happy.   I leave you with this- Seven Places ROCKS!
