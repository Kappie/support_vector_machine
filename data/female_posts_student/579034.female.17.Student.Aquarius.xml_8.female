Well the first day there was really boring. Just me and my mom shopping. I got a really nice bathing suit there though. Then the second day Derrick and his family came. I met him there last year so at least knew each other. We hung out that day making more friends. Me, him, his brother and sister all hung out with the other people there. By the like thrid day of vactaion we had a huge posse of people. It was so great! They were all so... just... awesome. I mean  I knew these people for one week and it felt like I knew them my whole life! I would take a bullet for any of these people. James and Shawn were from Canada. James does the BEST immitation of Dr. Evil I have EVER heard in my whole life. He could take over for Mike Myers. Elliot is from England. He was really cute, he had the cutest accent (Fuckkin wanka!). I met him at casino night at the hotel. Then there was the Matt from Conetticut. He was really cool. He's like 7 feet tall and he was just hysterical. Then Jose who is just like the best (you wuddnt have had to drug me man). Then Sara (shes also British)who is my girl. You guys I picked out the BEST outfit for her when we went out. She looked sooooooooo nice all the boys were like shhaawwinnngggg!!! (lol) Then there was Matt and Patrick. They are aslo from England and they knew each other. Matt is a sick soccer (oops, I mean FOOTBALL) player and he yelled at me for sayin Nokia wrong and for saying "cell" instead of "mobile"... cheers big ears. And just because you beat me at air hockey like everyone esle dont make you better then me! Patrick was sooooo funny. He's 11 and knows WAYYYY too much for his age. Nuff said. And then there was John. My track and kemp buddy! And how could I forget Anthony!?!?!?! us New Yorkers gotta stick together!! Your ass just got New Yorked biotch!!!! And Tisha, the crazy Texan!! Girl if you EVER need me just gimmie a call alright???  I will NEVER forget these people. When I was leaving everyone was so sad!! I have never had people do that for me before. I don't think anyone I met over vacation has ever cried over me leaving before. I love you guys!!!!!!! I think the best night we all had, well there were 2. The night was almost all fought those kids for bein dicks wasnt excactly FUN but thank God for swings (lol Matt). Then the night we went to Pleasure Island! Oh man Freddie vs. Jason was a sick movie. And Matt I don't care what you say, you still owe me dinner. James you were mad funny that night ("Yea no doubt!" as the whole theater cracks up). Like I said, I don't think I have ever felt so close to people I met on vacation as I have this trip. James and Shawn I'm deff comming up to Canadia to see yous. Sara, Elliot, and Matt I'll be comming to England soon you can count on it. Jose, Ant, Matt, D, Tay, and Cory yous are so close I can deff go and see you and visa versa. Tish, you always have a room in my house if you need it girl and give me a call if you need to alright??? OMG but you's have NO idea how sad me leaving was. Like, my mom called to see if the plane was delayed or anything and the lady said that it was delayed till 11 0r 12. So I'm extatic cause it means we get to stay a litte longer but then the lady tells my mom it would be best to be there anyways just in case so things sucked again. So, my mom told me to say goodbye just in case we cant come back. It was TERIBLE. I was crying like you would not believe and so were some of the others. I felt like I was on my death bed and they were all mourning me or something. Then we got to the airport and they said the flight wasnt unitll 11:30 so my mom told me we could go back. I was SOOOO happy. I called Jose and told him but he was at dinner so he couldn't spread the word yet. We got back to the hotel and I ran around everywhere looking for people and then I ran into the pool room and saw Shawn I ran to him and then Elliot and James saw what was going on and there were hugs all around. I told them what was up and then I got a call from Matt (the british one, the other Matt left that morning) I told him where I was and him and Patrick came and we all hung out. We got in touch with Sara and then Jose came and it was like all of us together again! It was great!!! I had only left for 30 minutes but it felt like years ya know? Our second goodbye was bad, but not as bad ya know? I mean, I was sad deff but it felt as though we were leaving on much better terms then how we had before. Like, the one before was rushed and just like bad. But this one was a little easier.  Well, thats enough for today, it's long enough. Talk to you all later!!! xoxoxoxox
