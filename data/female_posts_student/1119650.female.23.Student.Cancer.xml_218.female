I have been driving for about 5.5 years and in all those years I've struck cars and people, but never cute, fluffy animals (at least ones that were still alive) today on my way back to work I hit a squirrel.  I heard this quiet "thump" against my tire, I had seen him in the road, but I had no time to avoid him.  I would have maybe felt better if I flattened the poor lil fella, but I just knocked him out and when I looked in my rearview I saw his tail flaililng around wildly...I pulled over like the pussy I am and cried for like 5 minutes.  Poor lil guy was just living his squirrelly lil life and I ended it.  I bet his momma is wondering where he is right now.  How do I tell her?  Should I send them a nice arrangement of Acorns and Peanuts to "big old oak tree....3rd nest on the right"?  Oh well, I guess I should feel better that it wasn't a black squirrell, then I prolly would have killed myself.   urlLink LFJ  made a good point...he's in squirrel heaven getting his supply of eternal nuts.  Godspeed, little fella.
