That means another day without you my friend. And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself. And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else." -Ben Harper, "Walk Away"  "oh very young what will leave us is time. you're only dancing on this earth for a short while. and though your dreams may toss and turn you now. they will vanish away like your dad's best jeans, denim blue, fading up to the sky. and though you want to last forever you know we never will, you know we never will. and that just makes the good bye harder still." -cat stevens   I've been the burnout kid I've been the idiot I'll turn the other cheek to be hit You can take what you want from me Empty me till I'm depleted I'll be around if I'm ever needed -Switchfoot
