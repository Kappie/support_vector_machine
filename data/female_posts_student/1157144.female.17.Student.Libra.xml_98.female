Causes, incidence, and risk factors      Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by the inability to metabolize the so-called 'branched-chain' amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The disease is called MSUD because urine from affected people smells like maple syrup.  In the most severe form, MSUD causes severe acidosis during the first week of life. This is characterized by progressively poorer feeding, vomiting, seizures, lethargy, and finally coma.   Untreated infants may die in the first few weeks of life in severe forms of the disease. MSUD also occurs in an intermittent form and a mild form. Even in the mildest form, MSUD results in mental retardation and bouts of acidosis precipitated by stresses such as ordinary infections. * * *  happy little booger, isn't it?? apparently it's even fatal to adults, so yeah, wow, i learned something today. i thought i'd share it with y'all and maybe you'd be enlightened...somewhat....i don't know what point i'm trying to make, so never mind.
