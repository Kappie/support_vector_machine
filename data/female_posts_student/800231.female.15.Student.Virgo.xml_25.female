I finished but Steph can't figure it out and Mr. F has been yelling at me for helping her. Poo.  Obviously the Mexico cruise people are back. Alice can barely walk and keeps falling down the stairs. She hasn't slept for a week because of the cruise and she leaves for New York in two days so it looks like she won't be sleeping for another week. I laugh at her misery...  I AM SO BORED
