This comes relatively soon after Dean has dropped out of the race, and one has to wonder if the two situations are related.  I'm not sure how significant this is, really.  Nader could be a factor in a close election, as he was in 2000, but I'd say most people who are on the fence about Nader really don't like Bush and would do almost anything to see him not get re-elected, and this would include settling for the Democratic candidate, whoever that might turn out to be.  But there are still going to be the crazy die hards who will vote for him, and if that is the case, he could have an impact.  It's something to watch anyway.
