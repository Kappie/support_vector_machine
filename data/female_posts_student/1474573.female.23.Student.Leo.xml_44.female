It's an excuse for everyone around me to party like it's THEIR own birthday. But seriously folks, I've never felt soooo loved before. Fish and Lenny (Fenny) thanks for the roses, they were gorgeous, shout outs to Jillian and Jay (Jayllian) Tatiana, Angie and Judie (aka Ta-Anjudie) for throwing me the ill surprise thingy.I really believed that there was a "strange smell coming from my room that i HAD to come home and check out". My peeps from Ryan J.H.S. Beavis's (Tamz, Bridgette,lissette), My brother and my mom and my dad.....and and and  and...   "This moment is bigger than me"  "This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside me - Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett and it's for every nameless, faceless woman of colour that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.    that's the speech i DIDNT get to give after winning the Survivor Slam.... ahem ahem
