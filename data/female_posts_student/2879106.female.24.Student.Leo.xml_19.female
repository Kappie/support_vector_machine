(Alisha don't worry a couple more times out with me and Amber and you will play pool like a pro) So then I left there to go see Spiderman 2 for the midnight showing. I had a really good time and the movie was great BUT I have never been so glad that a movie was over in my life. The fricken A/C never came on and I felt like I had a fever. It was miserable. Anyway, other than that it was great. So I think that is enough talk about what I did last night.  Now onto the important stuff. I miss Alek a whole lot. I am not sure why exactly. I just want to see his hot sexy face and look into those gorgeous eyes. I want to see him looking back at me in appreciation while at the same time I am looking at him the same way. I want him to take me into his arms and kiss me like he has never kissed me before. Then I want to touch each other all over in order to explore each other's bodies, just to see if there is any secret places to be discovered. Then I want to make love as if it were the first time. HEHEHE I sound like a porn author. ughhh. Anyway, this is just a dream that will never come true. Even if it did real life never lives up to your expectations. Also if things went this far it would just be a cover up for the true problems we are having. BUT hell it would be a fun cover up while it lasted. WINK WINK!!!
