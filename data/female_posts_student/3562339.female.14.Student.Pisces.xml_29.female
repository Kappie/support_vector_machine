This is what happens when there's nothing to do, and this is why I choose camp over staying home all summer being bored.      Yesterday, I watched  I love the 90's  and other Vh1 shows, which are all hilariouso. And then when I got bored, I called Dot, and ended up walking over to her house. We watched  High Fidelity , a movie about John Cusack and his relationshiop problems. I *heart* John Cusack. We also attempted to make pizza, but the top got burned, and the bottom didnt' cook at all, so it didn't work out very well. Wipe the vomit off my tongue. Heh. Then I got a ride home, and watched more Vh1. Yay! I attempted to call Dylan at like 11:30, but apparently he was asleep. Whoops. I think I woke up his father too. *blushes*. Heh heh.      Then today, I watched Vh1, ate, took a 4 hour nap in the afternoon, read, watched Vh1, and wrote this. Now that's excitement. I think I have developed an unhealthy obsession with Vh1, but the shows are just so good! At least I'll get away on Friday when I'm going to Souf Street with Alicia, Dot, and S'rah. I'm planning to meet up with Jimmi there too, but they don't know that yet. Shhhhh...!      ...la Gu
