Yupperz.. happy about that... But I'm kinda like tired today man.. Dun talk about monday. It was like WHAM! Double shifts.... but there was 2 houra break in between of course. Moreover my shift was from opening - closing shift! But they need more people. When they have more people, I won't hafta work so much already. Woo.. today I had turkey melt sandwich for lunch. Nice manz! Monday was the best.. Baked Macaroni..TASTES DAMN GOOD. I also LOVE the Shiitake Risotto. I tried it on Sunday which was kinda like the orientation day. They let us tried almost ALL THE FOOD. So nice..  I remember Saturday I was so terrified when Jane told me I had to take my typhiod jab. COZ SOMEBODY TOLD ME SOMEONE CRIED COZ OF THE JAB. Damn! It wasn't THAT PAIN?! In fact it was quite alright? Hmm.. Ok... I think I'll end here for now..
