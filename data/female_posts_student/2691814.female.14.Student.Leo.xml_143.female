They were really good so anyway, i was just u know thinking about that band so i found their website and it had they're e-mails so i just u know...emailed Ryan O'neil-guitar/vocals/keys. So after watching all the hot guys at the beach..hehe..came home and checked my email..well he e-mailed me back. I thought that was really cool cuz i didn't expect it. I'll  post the e-mail later. So ya, that was pretty nice. My face is pink lol..well just parts of it... we watched the Blue Collar Tour on tv..its 4 comedians that call themselves 'rednecks' lol...and the lovely Jeff Foxworthy was on there and did the famous'you might be a redneck if..' thing. Ya it was really funny.
