Loose yourself  Alone in this world Try to reach the ground in this endless fall Feel free to feel Loose control  Get anger Hate everything you know Especially yourself Question your existence Why? Why? Why? Then get lost in your emptiness And fall asleep.  I’ll be near to comfort you To cherish you To hold you To clean your blood and tears To rise you from the fall Till the next false step Till the next mistake Till the very end…
