I've learned massively today at the lectures, a good lecturer makes ALL the difference. I would have stayed longer.... hey, I even got a silly and random idea of "hey, I want to study medicine!!" I'm back to my senses tho, my head isn't made for physics, chemistry, maths.... especially not for anatomy and physiology! This is just enough for me now.  Well, got annoyed about some people asking "can we quit earlier today" and "how long do we have to have tomorrow". I guess they don't appreciate... stupid them. Well, almost all day went at the lectures... but after them, I bought 500 mL soda and went to sit outside with Anne, to drink, enjoy then sun and chat =) It was soooo nice. I'm going to ask her join me again later =) I might take my drawing pad with me, hey now that's a great idea! =) Ummm, even better idea would be taking a studybook with me =)  Oh, I feel like I'm living the best time of my life right now.... almost. I just want my 'clinical physics and hospital machinery' and 'surgical nursing' exams returned!!! I want to know how well I did... I think I did well, I hope I did.  I'm writing this at Anne's.... from her comp. She's watching 'The Bold an the Beautiful', the dumbest soap opera I've ever seen. They're all dumb though. I don't know why Anne, normally a great and sensible person can watch such poo =P  I think I'll go now... and try to get her off the TV now, lol. I can't stand even listening to this crap. Ah, it ended, thank you universe! Anyway, bye for now.
