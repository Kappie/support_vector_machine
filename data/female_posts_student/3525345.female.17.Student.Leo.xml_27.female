Yeah I'll eventually get to that but this time I want to apologize again for..yeah you guessed it. I didn't show up when I was supposed to again. Plus I had a bad day at work and knowing that Jimmy may be mad at me has put me into a bad mood. Oh yeah I thought I should at least put one runescape related thing in here so I'll let the others know how much coal I have.  Coal ore count for Aeri : 179 coal  Yeah yeah I know it's not much..but I'm working on it, and I'll be sure to get on runescape tomorow. Adios people...  P.S.  Best of luck to Jimmy tomorow on his driving test!
