I had had both tea and coffee on an empty stomach and therefore spent the remaining 12 hours in a numb shaky state.  and i got in a fight with my mom, broke the banister AGAIN... and got hurt in the process, smashing my thumb. I wanted to see alanah so bad- so i'm glad i went.     and i am kinda seeing what the hell is wrong with me. this is turning out to be such a good thing with gordon.  and yet, i have this trepadation going into it. and i'm trying to see that its all in my head. and now, in reality, i see no problem, its great, i'm happy. but then i'm alone thinking to myself again, and it all whels up in me and i dont know how to think anymore.  I always think the best of ppl. but they always ruin it and make me feel like the biggest idoit for ever giving them that chance to fuck with my mind. and i dont really ever have a problem with letting certain people it, and sometimes i want it so badly. but after each mess up, i fall into a comfortable state of simplicity, and just not wanting to go through with something and find its all me, and they go do something and i'm left there. and i need to get over myself. Because i know its all in my head, and that i create something wrong in my mind that isn't actually there, just because thats the way i'm use to it being. how do you define a broken person?  and alyssa- i have seen girl with a pearl earring, and i didn't do that thing.  anyway- i really liked going to starbucks. i'm glad we at least did something! but it really sucks that he's going to new york tomorrow. seems that everything is always horrible timing with me. oh well, he's back the 23rd and so am I. And there really isn't  anything  to do in katy, just to let everyone know.
