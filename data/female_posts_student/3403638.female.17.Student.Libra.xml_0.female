My life just burst like a balloon There is blood all around me, Mom And most of it is mine I hear the medic say Mom, I’ll die in a short time   I just wanted to tell you , Mom I swear I didn’t drink It was the others, Mom The others didn’t think He was probably at the same party as I The only deference is, he drank And I will die  Why do people drink, Mom? It  can ruin your whole life I’m feeling sharp pain now Pains just like a knife The guy who hit me is walking, Mom And I don’t think it’s fair I’m lying here dying And all he can do is stare  Tell my brother not to cry, Mom Tell daddy to be brave And when I go to heaven, Mom Put ‘Daddy’s Girl’ on my grave Someone should have told him, Mom Not to drink and drive If only they had told him, Mom I would still be alive  My breath is getting shorter, Mom I’m becoming very scared Please don’t cry for me, Mom When I needed you, You were always there I have one last  question, Mom Before I say good bye I didn’t drink and drive So why am I the one to die?  Someone took the effort to write this poem, So please, forward this to as many people as you can, and see if we can get a  chain going around the world that will make  people  undertand that drinking and driving not mix  ikhgoen@hotmail.com
