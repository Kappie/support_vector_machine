The story follows Zeke, a gangly, unpopular, 19-year-old college student - a townie who also happens to attend the elite college in his community - who has discovered a terrific new club where he is accepted and popular. There's only one catch: everyone at the club is dreaming. It only exists in the shared dream consciousness of its participants. If at all .   Doug's a genius. And a great guy who talks faster than maybe anyone I've ever met. He was one of my favorite teachers at  urlLink ITP . I highly recommend watching his Frontline documentary on marketing pop culture to kids,  urlLink The Merchants of Cool .
