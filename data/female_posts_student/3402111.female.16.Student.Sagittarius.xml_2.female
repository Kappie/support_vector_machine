But today was quite the opposite.  It was a great day.  A normal one.  But a great one.  I went to marching band and for some strange reason it doesn't bother me that I spent my Saturday morning standing in a parking lot.  And I went to a bunch of various places with my closest friends: the Library, the Mole Hole, Sonic, Dragon Stadium, Seven  Eleven, and my trampoline.  It was just one of those relaxing days that I love and wish I will always have.    Laughter has got to be one of the greatest things on earth, too.  I mean not only do you burn cals, but it makes you happy.  However, the key is being able to stop.  It is horrible when you have one of those silent laughing fits and you can't stop.... or breathe.  And sadly I am one of those who will keep on going.... and going.... and going.... just like the energizer bunny.  That, or I will stop laughing and a few minutes later I will burst out laughing out of no where just at the memory of whatever was so funny before.  And of course it isn't quiet.... it is one of those PPPPPPPPPFFFFFFFFUUUU!!! (with spit flying all over the place) and everyone in the room turns their heads in bewildered amazement.  But hey, what have I got to be ashamed of?  It's good, funny times....  hehe.... it's great.
