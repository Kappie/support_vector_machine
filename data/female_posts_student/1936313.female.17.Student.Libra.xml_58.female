(-patiently awaits all the loud cheering to end-) I decided I needed a new change, away from the summer of Coca-Cola and into an Autumn of studious uh.. browns... Yes I was lazy this round and did not make the design myself but instead used a Blogger template. Yah me!!           It's a super fantastic chicken surprise (hush I didn't say that!! And damn I need a new strange line instead of stealing others.. I'm taking suggestions!! lol)          The new features of Blogger of Mine V3.0 (or is it 4?) includes the Make a Comment choice, which means all my adoring readers may make a comment on my posts, cool, no? (-awaits the harrassment to begin-)           No no, don't stop now!! Blogger of Mine V3.0 (or is it 4?) also includes the new -Link of the Day- function!! This will include a link, chosen by me as the "LINK OF THE DAY", something of great interest which I think all my friends and readers should check out.           Today's link of the day is.. dun dun dun.. Alter Bridge!!! New band with their cd just newly released (on the 10th i believe) I swear, check it out, these guys rock! (Mark Tremonti and Scott Phillips from CREED as well as former member Brian Marshall from like, way back and new lead singer Myles Kennedy) CHECK IT OUT! Yes, its an order!          Enjoy!! (btw, the picture is of Dad and I on our little day trip out to the mountains when Aaron came to visit. Columbia Ice Fields, Jasper National Park, Alberta.)           ....and unfortunately I just realized that the 'LINK OF THE DAY' is hidden in the Title. Click the title to check out Alter Bridge!!!
