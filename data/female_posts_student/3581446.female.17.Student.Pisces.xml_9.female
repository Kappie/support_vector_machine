Why the choice was made to make one of his catchphrases in Spanish is quite beyond me, but it actually reveals a lot about the psychology of language.   'Hasta la vista' is Spanish for 'goodbye', and it literally means something like 'Until I see you again'. The French equivilent would be 'Au revoir'. Now what would've been the reaction if Arnold had said 'Au revoir' before he extinguished the eternal flame of his enemy?  It just wouldn't work.   French is just not a toughguy catchphrase language. Why Spanish works better is beyond me; but whatever it is, French don't have it. French is, at best, an intellectual catchphrase language ('Au revoir, les pensées traditionnelles de la philosophie', Sartre might say, if he were prone to saying such things - 'Au revoir, Dieu' might've been the motto of the French revolution, if it were made into an action movie), and perhaps a romantic catchphrase language, but it is definitely not a toughguy catchphrase language.   The French themselves know this, of course. Thus their tremendous jealousy towards us, when they have to watch American action movies and witness the substandand effort to make the transition between American toughguy phrases and the French tongue. American action movies aren't that popular in France, you say? Of course. Now you know why.   Anyway, this was why Arnold's line was Spanish in the first place- to reach out to the French, of course. The hope was that Spanish could become the Esperanto of toughguy movie quotes- a neutral, auxilliary language that everyone could enjoy without giving up their native tongue. Much like Esperanto, though, it never caught on, at least not to the degree the creator would've liked.   Oh well. Unity on toughguy action movie quotes eludes us, and it's just as pernicious a problem as any other world unity problem, lemme tell ya.  -Ian
