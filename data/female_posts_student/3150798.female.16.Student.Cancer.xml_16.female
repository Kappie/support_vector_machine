I'm not really sure how many times I've listened to it throughout the day, but I think I may have all the songs memorized already.  Anyways, right now I'm listening to Subseven's "Emotion" right now. That has to be the best headbanging song ever. It's been a pretty long day, just sitting around the house. I got my order in from C28, and the One Truth shirt is gorgeous. I can't wait to wear it. My 6 year-old sister was running around the house all day wearing my stretch terry wristband, my trucker cap, and her nail cross necklace and saying she looked like a Christian rock star. She's so cute.  I'm really kind of nervous about closing at work tomorrow. I have absolutely no idea what to do, so I hope they are patient with me. Anyways, can't think of much to write. But if you are reading this, go buy an FM Static cd.
