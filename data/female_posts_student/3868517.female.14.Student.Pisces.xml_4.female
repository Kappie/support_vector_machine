For me, it wasn't all bad, because my mom put me into a christian school called Gainesville Christian Acadamy or GCA, which had probably about 8 to 9 6th graders!  It was a hard school to get into...Heck, before they let me in, I had to take practically an over 100 question test on your basic schooling skills and pass a certain grade.  I aced it, which I got a higher score than any other person......or so I think.  What sucked was the uniforms we had to wear...I mean Im not for it at all, but the only reason if I had to chose them would be that everyone looked the same and people wouldnt judge you on what you wear.  I always thought our skirts would be like those in the movies on the cute private school girls but no, they were long......longer than any skirt Ive seen.  Besides the wardrob, our homework and school work in general was piling up and it was just the first week!  I decided that it was too much for me, so my mom switched schools from GCA to Forte Clarke.  I had met my friends Courtney Jones and Francelis Miniya in 5th grade at Hidden Oak and I knew that they were going to Ft. Clarke so I didn't think it would be that bad.  Also, Courtney lived in the same neighborhood, so Id be riding her bus.  When I entered that bus the first day, let me tell you I thought I was sooooooo cool with my new clothes and going to a new school, but once I entered that bus, people looked at me like who are you?  It was horrible!  Then the bus driver assigned us to seats, so I ended up sitting next to this black kid who was really mean and his friend, who was okay.  After about half the year was over, I switched seats and sat next to Alexandra Albert and this other girl.  But anyway...  When I got there, me and Courtney finally met up again and she showed me where the 6th grade bunker was.  Im like "bunker?  whats that?"  I found Francelis again and she was so surprised because she knew that I was going to GCA, but didn't know I switched.  I also got to see Evan Berban who had scrapes on his face and I thought he got beat up.  I said to them, "it's only been a week, and already people don't like him?"  It was almost 9:03 which meant that the bell would be ringing shortly and everyone would practically break down the doors trying to get in.  Courtney said that it was best to stand by the doors so you don't get trampled by the other 6th graders.  After being shoved through the doors we made it into that long hallway with green stripes painted on the sides.  -Green meant that only the 6th graders could walk in the halls because they were known as the frogs mascot; 7th graders had orange stripes since they were the tigers; and pigs had pink since they were pigs.  But then again, the whole school's mascot is the falcon so they confused us all.-  Courtney showed me all my classes and where they were.  My homeroom class was Ms. Hathaway (now known as Mrs. Jackson)  then for 1st, I'd go to Math with Mrs. Baurice, then on "A days" I'd go to Ms. Hathaway's class again for social studies and on "B days" I'd go to science with Mr. Young.  Then for 3rd block on "A days" I'd go to P.E.  (I just want to thank god for coach Stafford, because without her, you know we'd be no where!  Im just wondering though, how can a person with that old of a body keep it in shape?  we might never know!)   and on "B days" I'd go to band.  I then ended the day in my 4th period class with Dr. Carroll.  After about the 3rd week of school I got to know where and when my classes were and I was on a roll.  See, I didn't care much about what I looked like, and I didn't care for going out with my friends, or calling them on the phone, no!  I was too interested in my grades and worried about my scores and report cards.  I was mainly a stright A student back then.  PASSION!....just look at my yearbook picture...yikes!  But then again, I was only 11.  I had a lot of fun surprisingly in 6th grade because I met a lot of new people and actually survived middle school.  It wasn't as bad as I thought, because I had nice teachers and good friends.
