Why am I not allowed to be happy?   - - They've clipped my wings again, tore them apart then left me. No use to fly away, to my yesterday of freedom. My eyes died back that day seeing the hurt I may have done... Beat me instead of them pain is my only zen of fun. - -    Furthermore yet.... why do I let it happen? Why do I continually allow myself to suffer like this.... Its certainly not fair to me.. my family.. or my friends (though I'm certain half of them wouldn't give a damn)........   - - I'll go where secrets are sold, where roses unfold.. I'll sleep as time goes by.... So hurting here is where I belong, dreaming a song, blood on my hands to stay strong. The flowers in the graveyard are all gone, I don't belong, there is no right to heal the wrong. Soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die, I can't throw up don't think i even want to try. - -   I'm honestly to a point I'd volunteer myself to that damnable psychiatrist Dad always wants me to see.... even if she's stupid and doesn't care about my personal beliefs... yet.... maybe thats again where the answer lies... my beliefs have dragged me out of the gutter before......  Its spring.. I should be happy...   - - You still can't make me cry, you've pinned this butterfly down. My fires burning out, kill my flame without a frown... and starving hurts the soul when your hungry for some love... So if I close my eyes I can really fly above... and I'll go where secrets are sold.. where roses unfold.. I'll sleep as time goes by...- -   This godamned life I live is wasting me away.... My priorities are skewed... I need it back.. what it used to be... I -was- happy before I came home... I'll not lose that again... Prepare for change......   So hurting here is where I belong dreaming a song blood on my hands to stay strong the flowers in the graveyard are all gone I don't belong there is no right to heal the wrong soup's on hot feelin' like a do or die I can't throw up don't think I even want to tryyy- tryyyy- tryyyyyy
