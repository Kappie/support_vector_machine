The night before I recalled my mother and I arguing about the dirty little habbit I try to keep from her: smoking cigarettes. I hate lying to her but I don't know how she'd take it if she knew. It was even stranger when I got a phonecall at 7am from my aunt who had knews of my grandmother who suffers from emphysema. She had gone to the hospital with internal bleeding and was scheduled for a blood transfusion. I ignored the little coincidence and carried on. I prepaired myself for the day and headed out. By the time I had reached the bus stop I had about 20 minutes to spare. I strolled over to the nearest gas station and wandered inside. The clerk wasnt at the counter but I didn't think about it. I pulled the change from my pocket and went to the cooler at the back. I slid a Root Beer Jones Soda from the rack and went to the counter. I leaned over and looked at the door to my left behind the counter and a man appeared. He smiled and rang up my purchase, I paid him and left.I walked to my bus stop which was only on the other side of the road and sat myself down against the pole. I pulled out my last cigarette and eyed it before taking one more drink of my soda. I set it down and popped the cigarette between my lips. I looked down at the soda cap in my hand and on the inside of it were the printed words "Stop Smoking."      Of course, I smoked the cigarette as I wondered what had taken god so long to get the message to me.
