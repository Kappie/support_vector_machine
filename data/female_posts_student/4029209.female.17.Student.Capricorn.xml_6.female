Works ok at the moment actually. My manager left, and i thought i'd have to be split up into a different team, but they've brought some else in to sit in while they look for a replacement. Not sure how long i'll be there for, but i know i'll be sad to leave.  Hmm chicken noodle soup...forced myself to have some, cos apparently 'it cures everything', tho i need convincing :/ it just tastes yucky and i'm not a huge fan of noodles anyway, they remind me of thin long worms :P.  1 week till results day :/ seems to be getting closer so fast. Good luck to everyone :) no matter what happens, we'll have a good time anyway :P.  Think i'm gonna be boring and lie down for a bit, but that'll last 5 minutes and i'll prolly end up going out and making myself feel worse lol.  Happy Thursday :P. Yes, i am crazy...
