The mantra "Om Mani Padme Hum" is inscribed in the wheel (or in the gif, in this case) and when you spin it (always counter clockwise) it's supposed have the same effect of inviting blessings as when you chant the words. Dharma Haven says that your hard disk is working as a prayer wheel right now because the mantra (as text on this page), and the gif are spinning around your drive. As I'm going through a period of feeling unsettled and confused (just the last 10-12 years or so, nothing to be too concerned about), I've been seeking serenity or some guidance and decided to download a dozen of the images and let them spin on and on. I'm a skeptic, but since then I've been having the craziest dreams. Maybe they're leading me somewhere, I don't know.   I'm going to buy a copper wheel at  urlLink Tibetan Spirit . I hope Richard Gere will approve.
