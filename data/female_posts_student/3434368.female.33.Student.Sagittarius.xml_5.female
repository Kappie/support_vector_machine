I like to play the harp. I like stuffed animals (esp. a particular Rabbit) I like to read books. I am planning to become a librarian. I am a graduate student.  Ideas for Blog: I will post poems perhaps some stories too. I want this to be a "family" blog. So, please NO bad jokes, NO bad language, etc. Thank you!    Now, Please when you post--introduce yourself--say a bit about yourself. It could just be one sentence like: "Hi, Rose, I am a student like you or whatever you do--work, etc."  Thanks! Yours truly, Rose Hill 32
