I had to change my spectacular answer to fit this specification. Grrr! Well i thought it was a good answer so read on if ya like (it's a bit weird to be honest) but heres the randomn question and my answer:  Your pajamas have duckies on them. Why did you switch from choo-choos?     Well i changed my pajamas for many reasons really.  1, duckies are soo much cuter than choo-choos.  2, duckies are stereotypically pastel colours (usually yellow) and choo-choos are horrible greyish and black maybe with a bit of sky blue.  3, this sky blue mixes with the sky only to confuse the birdies (tree-perching duckies) making them think the sky and the choo-choo are one. This ends up in a 'splat' sound and a horrible redish mess on the side (or front) of the choo-choo. I therefore conclude that the choo-choos will be the death of the tree-perching duckies, and so i switched from the evil choo-choos on my pajamas to cute duckies.  They shall live on!  Yeh! luv it xx
