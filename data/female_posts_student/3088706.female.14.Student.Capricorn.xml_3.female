Anyways on a more positive note.  Art of the Con kicks butt and I cannot wait till the sequel.  I want to film something so bad.  I guess it is time to call up kathleen, amy, and elizabeth.  In addition why don't i call sheri and katie too.  Whatever happened to my graduation party? I think it flew out the window with the rest of my life.  Shu boppity bop cant do that squat.  Hip Hop to the hippiest hoppster in the world.  Okay so I went shopping over the weekend. I got the following shirts: orange, brown and inbetween stripes, this little golden book belongs to, *ANOTHER BUNNY SHIRT* Crazy doesn't even begin to cover it, a blue one, and a white one. For skirts: a black one *I am wearing it right now* and an orange one to match the first shirt mentioned. For accessories: I got a necklace *hahahahaha For shoes: Nada.  It was all pretty cheap too.  Now I just gotta find that khaki skirt............hmm. I also need shorts but I didn't really feel like looking.  I don't think anyone has ever posted on this blogger.  I might as well check :/  So long...
