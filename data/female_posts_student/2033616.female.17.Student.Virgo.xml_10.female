I got there at exactly 3 o'clock... and Aliesha and Bret and I couldn't find Jack anywhere.  So after Aliesha left for swim warm ups... Bret and I wandered around the school looking for Jack.  Well we finally just called "his wife" to find that he was on his way home.  He had waited at the wrong door... what a kid that Jack Farley.  So Bret and I hoped in the car and drove to Jack's where i got a warm welcoming from Jack and Amanda (aka, the wife).  Well okay, it was Jack that welcomed me... I don't know if Amanda thinks too much of me.  We sat around for a while, then headed off to the school to the swim meet.  We got to hang out with Anne (Anne's thinking about going to the Y2J2 camp session this summer which means I am THERE).  Amanda left for volleyball eventually... (it's not like i don't like her but i feel wierd hanging out with Jack when she's there... I don't want her to feel like i'm crossing on her turf or anything... but I don't get to see Jack but every other month).  So then it was just me Bret and Jack as Aliesha and Anne came back and fourth between swimming and hanging with us.     So after the swim meet we hugged the very wet Anne goodbye and went across the hall to watch Amanda's v-ball game.  Well until Aliesha was ready, then we peeled Jack away and headed to the mall for some much needed Chick-fil-a.  No matter what Jack says I'm not using them for their Chick-fil-a :-P... but it is a plus :-).  We brought the food back to Jack's house and ate... Jack said he'd take me to my winter formal... you know... the usual...   After one last bear hug from Jack, I was off.  I took Bret home... and then Aliesha and I sat in his driveway for the next 5 min saying... "THIS HAS BEEN SOO FUN OH MY GOSH!!!" we finally said goodbye for the last time (isn't it sad).  And I was off.  I got back home, talked to Jamie on the phone.. things are settled... out in the open and things will get better i think.  Today was awesome b/c i was still on cloud nine after yesterday.  And I just beat Chad for the first time ever in internet checkers.. haha!!!  Time for a rematch and then i'm off to bed.  Sweet dreams everyone... may the horse be with you ( I know it didn't make sense but that's a good song :-D)
