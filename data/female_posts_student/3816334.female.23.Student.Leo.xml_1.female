Per usual i had to drag everything he was feeling out of him, because god forbid he actually trust me enough to tell how he really feels about something. He claims its the way he grew up which frankly just sucks because how the hell am i supposed to undo 19 years of an inablity to communicate effectively with another person. sometime i don't think he realizes that he never tells me what he wants. like for example the topic of last night was what happens when i leave in may after graduating. He never comes right out and says that he doesnt want me to leave him, its always that when i say i am leaving he feels sick to his stomache or whatever. Which is fine because i suppose that is some sorta reaction but once and a while it would be nice to know exactly what he is thinking. See he is lucky, if i am feeling anything he gets a detailed account of whatever it is i  am feeling. If he makes me happy i tell him, if he pisses me off you better believe he knows he did. I am a yeller i will admit, which when dealing with someone who has a hard time expressing emotions is never really constructive. He feels like i am yelling at him (which vocally i am) but really its a way to get a reaction, something, anything ,that shows me he does care about it.  he told me last night that he loved the year we spent together last year and that that is what he wants ... i was so relieved to hear him say that , most of the time i feel like am pushing too hard on him but i also know that if i don't fight for us most of the time he won't, or can't. We fell in love to young. But there is nothing that can be done about that now. I have lived with him and love him enough now to know that i will be with him forever and always. he told me last night that dating experts have said that if a couple can stay together for 30 months and not get sick of one another then they can make it work for the long haul. Rick and I just passed the 15 month mark bring us half way. And i NEVER get sick  of him, but i get frustrated because i feel like he is waiting for some mircle to happen when he finally gets out of school. I want to walk through life with him, not sit on the sideline waiting for everything to fall perfectly in place. Nothing is ever perfect and sometimes, all though perfection is a prefectly good dream, the reality of the situation is that perfection is not for this world. So whether it is the money we dont have or the obsticles we have to face i want to work through it all together not wait while he figured it all out. Waiting in this situation is wasting precious time, why if we are great together should we not be willing to make the sarcrafices to make everything we want happen. The thing about dreams are everyone can have them, its what you do to attain them that makes the difference.  I don't understand a person who would stand in the way of rick and i being together. people who claim to love him should be so happy he found someone to live his life out with. I love him i like no oneelse does that much i know. I want the best for him, I want to give him everything i have and to have him let me into his world knowing that i will love him till my dying day without hesitation or reservation. I want his love and his trust and to be the one he comes home to at night. I want to come home to him at night and when i lay down to go to sleep i want him to be the last person i see and i want to have my prayer thanking god for him to be the last thing i do each night. I don't want to live my life alone and only be half of a pair. I need him as much as i hope and know he needs me. We are so different in our approach to everything but if we each conceed a little bit there is no reason that we can't get exactly what we want in life. but i want to do it all together as a team not wait around for everything we have no control over to fall into place.  the moral of today rant : time is precious so instead of the fighting and the animosity why not try to make moves towards the life you want.
