This rabbit ate his name card. So I made him a new one. I'm halfway through cleaning the double-cage of particularly heavy and grouchy Siamese cats, when I hear this chomping noise. I turn and the little pest is eating his nametag again! So I move the clothes pin up to the highest hole in his cage, where he can't reach it. Now there are so many bite marks, that it reads  "peye it food ice day" Which is saying something, because it once said: "Popeye Chay, Greens, Rabbit food twice a day." So Popeye the sailor bunny doesn't seem to like his spinage much...he much prefers the delicacy of yellow-dyed index cards. With love, April
