But guess what they said? Uh huh, "without one year of driving experience" (which I don't have since you only have to have your permit for 6 months in IA) "you cannot get a North Carolina driver's lisence" OUCH. That means nada, goose eggs, no lisence for Karen until some random day in Febuary when I decided to finally get off my lazy butt and get my permit. That means, go Frances and Cam! Because you're not the last ones to get your lisence, oh no, it's Karen, whose parents dragged her to NC without her permission. So instead of getting my lisence on my birthday (what every good 15 year old hopes for) I'm getting it in some random day next Febuary. Pretty crappy. I'll probably look back on this and laugh, but for now, it's just sucky. Other than that, everything's pretty boring here (what else is new) and I'm starting to miss being bored in my Iowa summer. Strangely I can't wait for school to start so I can actually meet some people my age and have a social life out of this pit. Some people are making offers on our old house, (that better be you Nette  Emo!) so my parents are always talking to our relator and bugging us to do more chores intheir spare time (not like we have a whole bunch of spare time ourselves). Somebody please send me a plane ticket or something cause I'm ready to come home. Love you guys and obviously miss you a lot. OH by the way... if anyone has any suggestions on how to paint my room, feel free to comment, because I'm trying to figure out what to do with it once I get the ugly wallpaper off. Leave a comment at the beep.... BEEP!*
