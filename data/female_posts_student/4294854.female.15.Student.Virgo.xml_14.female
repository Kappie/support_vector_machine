Maybe ill let her post somthing on here im not sure. WEll i got 3 pairs of pants today at the mall. 3 pairs of undies (thanks to Victoria's Secrets 3 for $20 sale) i wont go into detail of what they look like but anyways. I also got 2 cute little summer purses that were like really really cheap at old navy. Thats about all i got. Oh yes i got Chick-fil-A for lunch ...havent had that in a while. So later tonight after dinner Courtney and I are going to the Marble Slab for dessert ( i hope thats the right spelling). We are just gonna chill and have fun. I also talked to my best friend today. Shes in TX ...she moved there about 2 weeks ago i miss her sooo incrediably much. I love her to death id do anything for her. Big shout out to ya Clara Jean i miss ya!!!!
