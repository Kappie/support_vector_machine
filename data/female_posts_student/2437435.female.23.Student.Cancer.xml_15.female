My mind and soul cannot set easy on anything.  This meloncholiness is taking form into madness. I d not know which way is up and I cannot see clearly.  Things I had counted on before have vanished leaving me to take solace in isolation and grieving.  How did things get so bad? The sun is shining but in the ever midnightness of my charred heart I see no beauty. Before the Full Moon's rays gave everything such a beautiful glow, but now it makes things too foggy too see. All I can think about is leaving it all for dead and going away. Sure I may miss some people, but I can look back fondly.  This world has yet to offer anything substantial enough to create stakes high enough to gamble myself, sanity and love.  Perhaps in another time things wouldn't have to be like this, but as of right now... If there is a God he better have a hell of a plan. All there is is misery, despair and anguish and for what? What is the incentive? You work all your life at a job you hate for retirement? By then you are too old to do anything you had to give up for work. "It's better to have loved and lost, then to have never loved at all.." But if it caused you so much pain, how could you be sure it was indeed love?  And if love is so beautiful and pure, why is hatred right across the line?
