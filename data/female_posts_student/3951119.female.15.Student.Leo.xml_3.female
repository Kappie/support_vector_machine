Some rose-shaped ones. Two red, four white, two blue. Blue Rose Society. *grins* aa...and a candle-holder that looks like a lamp. hmm...I'd say this day was rather boring. Rare steak for dinner, I discovered I love it yesterday. aa, yes. I nearly forgot. I was out walking earlier, as I always do, and I fear I frightened this man I walked past. I merely said 'Good evening' to him, but he seemed in such a hurry to do laundry that he couldn't reutrn the polite greeting. Perhaps my 'fangs' frighten people off in the dark? *giggles mischeiviously*
