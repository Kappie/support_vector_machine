OMFG today we had "Rent-A-Senior" day it was awesome. A bunch of guys dressd up like girls with leopard skirts and crowns, make-up ect. It was soooo funny. This guy in my Vis Comm class wore a towel as a cape and everytime some one said his name he had to say this "Duh-duh-da! Super Tyler!" he was getting so pissed we all kept saying his name. Well that's all I guess.... bye
