That's so early for me nowadays. I actually got some time to myself! I've had a chance to think a lot about stuff that I just honestly haven't had time for.  I've been having a lot of weird dreams lately and about stuff that I used to wish I could make myself dream about but now...I just wish  it'd go away. I'm sick of it. It's my own fault but I'm still sick of it. Wy am I such a chicken? Like...seriously...I need to just be honest. I don't understand why I can't just tell people stuff. I really don't. Like, everything makes  completely logical sense in my head and then...I can't do what I tell myself to do. Grrrr! Og well, I'm done for tonight. I'm sorry I haven't been writing. You probably don't want to see my writing anyway. Something good did happen today though. I got a good grade on the French test that I thought I bombed that everyone else did actually bomb.  Ah, good times. Oh well....I'll leave you with this.It's definitely been running through my head lately.  Sometimes I walk alone at night When everybody else is sleeping I think of him and I'm happy With the company I'm keeping The city goes to bed And I can live inside my head  On my own Pretending he's beside me All alone I walk with him till morning Without him I feel his arms around me And when I lose my way I close my eyes And he has found me  In the rain the pavement shines like silver All the lights are misty in the river In the darkness, The trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me Forever and forever...
