"It's, like, really cold and last night we were shooting at this sugar mill and it really smelled bad. And I didn't wear shoes, like, I don't know."  Continues the beleaguered Paris, "We're in the middle of nowhere and there's bugs everywhere. Everything's real. I'm actually running through a forest with bare feet -- it hurts. I've done my own stunts, like falling. I hurt my knee -- it was bleeding. But it looks good, so it's worth it."   Hilton, who returns to the small screen on June 16 for the second season of "The Simple Life," co-stars in the horror flick with hotter-than-hot up-and-comers Elisha Cuthbert ("24") and Chad Michael Murray ("One Tree Hill"), but she knows all eyes will be on her.   "I definitely think people are going to be, like, looking at me more than they would if I wasn't, like, so . . . ," she tells the Sydney Morning Herald before losing her train of thought. "I can't explain it. But I do a good job and I'm really looking forward to people seeing I'm good. It's not fair but life's not fair, so . . ." So ... what?
