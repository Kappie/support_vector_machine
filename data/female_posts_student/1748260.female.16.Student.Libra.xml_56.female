Dealing with friends Who betrayed your trust. Standing alone in the rain From dawn to dusk. Losing the man With whom you wished to share your dreams, Leaves you with eyes like clouds And tears like streams. With family members Arguing from day to night, Makes you want to run away From that unpleasant sight. School is hard, Doing work you don’t understand. Walking down a road Holding no future in your hand. Your world is dark, Empty and confused. You feel angry, frustrated, And completely used. Everything is unclear, You only see death on the way. This life isn’t worth living, It should be taken away. But then there’s a small voice That suddenly appears. Looking all around... you Can’t seem to find it anywhere. This little voice said, “There’s a whole lot more to life. Everyone goes through joy, Happiness, pain and strife. There are people who love you, And you will meet new friends. Everyday is a new experience, It’s just a matter of where and when.” That is when you calm down And begin to think. After all, life can be good And have its positive things. You can have an education If you’re willing to learn. You’re future is the road ahead, Considering which way you turn. You have been hurt, Betrayed, denied and used. But people will know your importance Depending on the kind of friends you choose. Not having a boyfriend Isn’t the end of the world. He’s not worth loving If he leaves you for another girl. It’s normal for a family to argue, ‘Cause that’s how they compromise. If you think problems can’t be solved Then you’re not very wise. This little voice saved your life- Didn’t keep you and the world apart. That’s when you realize this voice... Is the “voice of your heart”.
