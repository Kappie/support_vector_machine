Mind you, i had nothing to say, i just wanted to end the death threats.    anywho, i check my journal, and what, of all things, should happen? my computer freezes up!  I reboot, check all the whosiwhatsits and get back on.  I innocently try to read my journal, and it loads a blue screen (not the normal red) and then freezes.  Thoroughly confused, i decide to get on Bravejournals ass about it... still waiting for a reply  Aren't you glad to see that i've ended my time of 'hiatus' or 'sebbatical' or 'lazing my ass off"?  I sure have missed our time together, and as the end of the year approacheth, i figured you needed an upped dosage of MEEEE!!  In my time of 'not giving a damn' i have learned a few things about blogging.  One of them  is to personalize the mood music etc. columns.  I think that Movie o' the week (or day, or whatever) is better than music.  I just listen to too much music to put it all down, and frankly, i love movies.    So the movie of the week (really, the movie of every week when you think about it) is the Godfather, part 1, which i recently shared with some friends (and some idiots who showed up to TALK DURING THE BEST PICTURE EVER)   Another thing i learned is, keep it short and sweet.  Since i no think so grood,  You should probably enjoy this sweetness of the short post while its here.  To be seeing you soon, jess
