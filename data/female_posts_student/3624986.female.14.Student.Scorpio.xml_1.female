My snacks sucked, we were watching  Shrek , which I'd seen a billion times, I was sitting with a guy I'd never met even slightly, and my gameboy game gave me a headache.  A while into it I got sour powder caught in my throat and coughed up a storm.  A three-hour bus ride under such conditions is like some form of American Chinese water torture.  When we got off the bus, Anderson (my homeroom/science teacher) gave my class our tickets and our group met up together.  It was me, Danielle, Ben, Candace, Greg, Casey, Leann, Eva, Travis, and John Sharetts (who I'll just call Sharetts from here on out).  Ben's dad, who was chaperone, gave us a time to meet at, even though for a while we walked with him.  Until we got through the gates into Hershey Park, because everyone dispersed into the park.  When we got into the gates, I saw a stuffed animal shop.  I told Ben, "After we go on a few rides, you haveta take me back here so I can go in there!"  He didn't say anything.  Danielle wasn't feeling well (she'd just broken up with her boyfriend that morning and her stomach was ill), so she sat down on a bench as soon as we got in.  Leann and Eva and Travis disappeared, because Leann's family was going to be at the park.  Sharetts went with Kristin and Sarah, other people in my clique-thing at school.  Greg and Casey disappeared, and Ben's dad eventually wandered off.  Me, Candace, and Ben want together.  First thing we did was go on this rollercoaster called  Trailblazer .  Getting off it, I felt  extremely  stupid, because I had been nervous about it and it ended up being a kiddie rollercoaster.  After that, the juvenile I am, I talked Candace and Ben into going on the Tilt-A-Whirl with me.  Ben was subtly laughing, presumably at himself, I was giggling like a toddler, and Candace was laughing at  me .  After the Tilt-A-Whirl, we were walking, and I stopped to look at the ducks and the huge fish in the water.  Ben threatened to throw me over after about a minute or two, so I started walking again.  We met up with Ben's dad a little while later.  Ben got iced tea and put lots of syrup in it (pure sugar, you know).  After Ben bummed a few potato things off his dad, we left to find the zoo.  Ben promptly got us lost, walked us all the way to the wrong side of the park, and then proceeded to lead us in the correct direction the long way.  While we were lost, I stated the obvious.  And Ben said: "I'll use my psychic navigating skills to get us there!"  I asked, "What psychic navigating skills?"  Ben replied, grinning, "I know, that's why I always get lost."  At the zoo, they gave us blacklight stamps to show that we'd been admitted (although it was invisible without the blacklight), and we went in.  The first place we went was a reptile house.  There were all sorts of snakes and lizards and turtles in there, and at the end was a lonely-looking gator.  I sat down next to the glass close to his head and said hullo and asked him how he was doing.  I got no reply, of course, other than Candace telling me I was an idiot and Ben telling me I should hurry up.  After the reptile house, we went into yet another house.  This one was the Desert House or somesuch, where they two desert birds living together.  Then, attached, was the Nocturnal Mammal room, which was pitch black.  We went in, and looked at an opossum.  It was sleeping in a hole, all balled up comfy-like.  I went to the next window, one housing a skunk, and there was nothing there.  "It died." I said, jokingly.  Candace replied, "Yeah.  Every animal that isn't here  died ."  Then I turned to the other wall, and it was a vampire bat.  The three of us looked for the bat, instinctively on the ceiling, but he wasn't there.  I looked down at the water bowl, and there he was, licking away at the dark liquid.  But I could tell it wasn't water.. It was too dark and it looked  red .  "Oh my God, it's got cow's blood!" I whisper-yelled.  "No it doesn't," Ben tried to tell me.  But I know he was wrong.  Because vampire bats drink animal blood, and they definitely  do not  drink water.  There were lots of other cute nocturnal aminals (yes,  aminals ) there, but, again, I was hurried along by my dear too-grown-up friends.  After we left the House of Nox (dubbed so by  moi ), there were no more houses.  We saw bison in the distance, and a turkey, and lots of things we didn't actually see but looked like they were there anyhow.  Ben, being, well,  Ben , followed the signs (although when he'd done that to  get  to the zoo, he'd become hopelessly lost for the fact that the two signs pointed back at each other), and led us toward the wolf exhibit (because he knows my obsession with wolves, strange as that is).  We passed a fenced-in place with deer, a buck and a doe (wow, I'm using my vocabulary here),  as well as the turkey, who stared evilly at me and gobbled threateningly.  We saw many other animals as well, only that my memory sucks like a vacuum and I can't remember what they were.  We had to go over a bridge-like thing (it went over the water, therefor was a bridge), and since I had a quarter from buying a lemonade earlier, I got some feed and fed the duckies and a rabbit that happened to have made friends with the duckies.  Then we moved on 'cause Candace and Ben were becoming exasperated again with my jovial duck-feeding.  Once we reached the wolf, it was a big disappointment that he--a magnificently black wolf--wasn't in the mood for a chat, because he was lying down behind a rock, presumably sleeping, and all I could see was a bit of his back.  After we visited him, we found ourselves a niche where we watched the ducks again.  Candace looked at a swan and called it a goose, and Ben scolded (ok,  yelled at ) her for not knowing the difference.  My comment was, "It's a bird that swims."  After that, we walked again.  We walked over toward the bison.  There were two at what I can only assume were watering/feeding troughs, and one that was laying down.  I wanted to talk to the bison, but I didn't know how the hell a bison would speak.  So I  moo ed at it.  Yes, I  moo ed at the damn bison, OK?  After being called a moron, an idiot, and a dumbass several times, we moved on to the mountain lion.  There were stairs leading up to a fence that with the  MOUNTAIN LION  sign, and I was walking up it, and then I thought aloud: "You know, this doesn't seem like a bright idea."  My friends (those chickens!) didn't follow me up, so it was much easier to get down.  Ben notified me that there was another place where you could see them from (without getting you eyes clawed out), and I followed him and Candace there.  The mountain lions, there were two of them, were both sleeping.  So we went over to visit the prairie dogs.  The prairie dogs both had different reactions to us: one of them (probably the female) froze up and stopped moving, while the other one  started  moving and worked on building (kinda ironic, isn't it?) his hole.  I walked over to where the frozen one would have probably been staring, and I said hullo to it.  I sat down with my eyes level with the prairie dog's and just stared for a while.  The prairie dog didn't move.  Then I clucked at it.  "I wish I had a rock."  Ben said, watching the prairie dog working on his hole.  "Don't throw a rock at it!! That's mean!" I scolded him.  "I was just gonna help it.." Ben defended.  "By knocking it in the head with a rock?!"  Yeah, I won that argument.  After that, we walked on to the porcupines.  Me and Ben had a "can not"-"can too" argument over whether porcupines really shoot out their quills (which they don't).  Neither of us won, because I knew we were both hardheaded enough to argue for the rest of the trip and I called it off before that could happen.  Next, we saw the bear exhibit.  'Cept no bears.  There was a building labeled SOMETHING  BEAR EXPERIENCE .  We all went in, and there was a stupidly-placed wall near the back wall.  Ben went around the wall and found a platform, which was in front of a large mirror.  Candace and I followed, and what do we see but  bears  (that's a real kicker, huh?) sleeping right next to the window.  The one closest the window is chewing on and playing with a little rock; the one lying next to him is lying on his back, sprawled out, with his mouth hung  wide  open; the third one, who was lying farther away from the others, was just peacefully snoozing away.  Then we left the bears to their slumber (after, that is, gawking at them for a while) and headed toward the exit.  We passed by the deerfolk again and said hullo, then passed by the evil turkey.  I  bagawk ed at the turkey as we left the zoo.  After the zoo, we walked around again.  (Jee, recurring theme, that walking around stuff.)  I believe that was when we found the video game arcade.  We went in, looking for Ben's dad (at least, I think we did).  I played 3 quarters worth of pinball, boring Ben and Candace to death.  We went outside afterward so Ben could call his dad on his cell.  Ben's dad eventually came, and we went back into the arcade.  Ben played against me in Hydro Thunder twice, brutalized me, played once by himself.  Then I took him over to play a motorcycle racing game.  Ben and I were almost neck-and-neck near the beginning of the race, and I found the use for that handy  ATTACK  button on the left handle.  Then our game timed out and I got first place.  After that, Ben played this kid at Tekken 4.  Then he played me.  Whooped me big-big.  Then he played Tekken 4 against his dad repeatedly (I stopped counting after one or two matches).  Candace went over to talk to Travis, Vicki, and the other people they were with.  I played Skeeball.  Then sometime after that, we were aimlessly walking, and I stopped again to observe the ducks, this time from a really high-up bridge.  Once again, Ben threatened to throw me over, with a "Why don't you jump in!".  So I started yet walking again.  I believe around then was when we found Natty, Kaylor, Viral, and Tyler Brown.  Ben halloo'd Natty, but they all walked right through him.  Once we were positive we'd found the pit of all that was Nobody-Is-Here, we sat down and just kinda people-watched.  We pointed out the groups of people wearing the same shirts (the purple, the blue, the orange, the red-like..) and watched for people we knew.  Needless to say, we didn't find anyone.  When we walked again, and Ben was walking extremely fast because "his aspirin was wearing off". (He'd hurt his leg playing football the other day, and he took aspirin to relieve the pain.)  I told him to slow down, and when he didn't I started basically whining. (I had told him earlier that week that it was guaranteed that he would be  extremely  sick of me by the end of the week.)  He said, "I thought you said  I  would get sick of  you , not the other way around!"  After a while of me yelling at him to slow down, I guess Ben let his selective hearing kick in, and he stopped listening to me altogether.  He told me and Candace that he can hear perfectly well when he's selectively hearing when someone is talking  about  him, so I turned to Candace and said, "You know, I'm gonna jump on him if he doesn't   slow down !"  Ben turned around and gave me a funny look.  But he waited.  Ben took me back to the stuffed animal store, but he wouldn't go in with me.  Neither would Candace.  Then I realized they were all Beanie Babies, which I'm not particularly fond of, and I decided to save my money.  After a while, Candace spotted Chelsea and Samantha.  She left with them, because my chickenshitness was boring her, I guess, and she wanted to actually  do  something.  How odd is that?  After she left, we made our way to  Wildcat , the country's fastest wooden rollercoaster.  Oh, joy.  Before this day, I'd never been on a roller coaster, and now I was going on a recordholder.  That's a step up, ain't it, folks?  Well, my stomach was squirming like it was full of spiders the whole way up, and I thought I'd die of a heart attack when we were getting on.  After it started, though, I had no time to freak out.  I was too busy chanting "Oh shit!".  Ben laughed at me the entire time.  After  Wildcat , Ben and I were going down toward the next roller coaster he wanted to torment me with, called  Lightning Racer .  He called his dad, who was mysteriously in the plaza-like place that we had to get through to get to the coaster.  We stopped to talk to him about his icky funnel cake (he said it, not me), and I got Ben to go on a Music-Go-Round kind of ride.  He had to sit on the left because he was the heaviest, and I sat on the right, but as soon as the ride picked up speed, we were both on the left side, crammed together by gravity.  Damned gravity.  After the Music-Go-Round, Ben, his dad, and I went to  Lightning Racer .  The line wasn't too bad, and we got to the top fairly quick.  Ben and I went on Lightning, and Ben's dad went on Thunder.  Once the "race" had begun (even though it was technically set for Thunder to lose), I began chanting again, except this time it was "I hate you, I hate you, God I hate you so much right now!".  After the ride ended, Ben and I couldn't figure out how to unlatch the bar so we could get out.  It's a "push-down-pull-up" thing, and we didn't know until someone told us.  When we got off and were walking down, he said, "Yeah, and we're supposed to be the  smart  ones."  When we got off  Lightning Racer , Ben's dad realized he'd lost his cell phone.  While he searched for it, me and Ben went wandering off again.  We met up with Kristin and Sharetts and John Donahoe near the water rides, and we chatted for a while.  (Well,  they  chatted, I just stood there.  I was hungry.)  Then we left them so that I could get the Chinese noodles that I realized when we got to the Wok  Roll that I wasn't hungry for.  The roller coasters had made me lose my appetite.  So we walked around.  We found Natty by himself, so we sat down and talked to him for a minute or so.  He offered me a French fry.  (Yes, I ate  one  French fry.  Those Boardwalk Fries aren't that good anyway.)  Then he left to catch up to his group.  After that, we walked again.  At some point between that and the final meeting to leave, Ben's dad bought me French fries and a Coke, and we sat on a bench for a while.  Candace and Chelsea found us then.  I remember that Ben's dad gave me a stuffed shark with a surfboard and a bulging stomach (I tell everyone that it's the hand of the surfer he ate), whom I lovingly have named "Jawge the Frog".  After waiting for Travis and Leann to come so we could leave, our group was the last to get to the bus (other than the teachers that had stayed behind to wait for Travis and Leann).  We didn't know which bus was ours.  We knew they were Shrock buses, and Ben and I knew that one was the same bus from Pittsburgh, but we couldn't find them.  Eventually, we  did , obviously, locate our bus and get on, after Ben and I fussed a little over who went into the bus first.  I convinced Michael (the guy I was sitting next to) to trade seats with Ben, who got stuck sitting with Jeff (a dumbass I know).  I asked Jeff to trade me seats first, but he didn't want to sit next to Michael, so I figured I'd just bring Michael to him.  On the bus, Ben shared his Swedish fish with me (he knows I love them), and I eventually finished the entire bag.  My appetite had come back, I guess.  Jawge and I took a little nap on the way home, and when we got home Mom and Dad got to meet Ben's dad a little.  I talked all the way home about my misadventures at Hershey Park.
