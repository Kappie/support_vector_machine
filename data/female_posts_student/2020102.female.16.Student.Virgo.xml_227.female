She makes me want to push the pretty girl we walk past against a wall and…prove a point.   Jack has drawn a lightening bolt down the forehead of Buffy on my Buffy mouse mat to "make her look more like Harry Potter". I do not have the words.  Darling, with beautiful shoulders, talks about love and people with lips that I can’t stop watching. ...the nights where I walk back to the cab station crying because it’s not me kissing him, those aren’t the good nights.  I guess it’s pretty late but I'm not really sure. I have this vague idea that I should be asleep not doing whatever it is I'm doing. That annoys me, I think. I seem perfectly capable of doing nothing of importance for hours on end and then I'm still surprised to find that I’ve lost whole sections of day to lazy things and daydreams.  I'm trying really hard to see the funny side of being an idiot. LET THERE BE A FUNNY SIDE, please.  I'm going to think of happy things and then everything is going to be ok again. -short musical interlude-  A lot of people are annoying me. I'm becoming quite obsessive about it. I can’t even look at them without all my muscles tightening in frustration. I should stop telling other people how annoying they are too. Although really, this is quite a hard thing to do. MY ANNOYANCE IS ALL CONSUMING. Once I was Liv. Now I'm Annoyed. It makes me more annoying than the people annoying me. And that’s just wrong and is completely unjustifiable in the grand scheme of things. Why, I'm surprised that the balance of the universe hasn’t been severely disrupted.  I want to go back to where I was in September. I think my day would be nicer if it were September again. I liked September. I liked it more than I liked November. If I were back in September I’d be having a really nice day, I'm sure.  I went to church for the third week running. Soon I will become a nun and I will sing in the hills and maybe I’ll find some nice children and I’ll make them wear curtains.   Liv: Hey C: Lo Liv: How are you? C: good Liv: cool Liv: have you had a good day? C: blah blah blah blah Liv: aww poor you/oh/cool/oh cool/right .... Liv: well I’ll be going then C: Laters Liv: xx  Today we interacted! Gee wiz! It was like October again.   I fully intend on marrying three times before I'm 30. Gemma says this is morally objectionable. I say her face is morally objectionable. We agree to disagree.  Note: the only reason I like that one is because it reminds me eerily of the strange conversations I routinely have with Miss Erin.   I'm not in love and/or sleeping. This is not an example of denial.
