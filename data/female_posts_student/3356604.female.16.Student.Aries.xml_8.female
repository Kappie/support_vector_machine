I even tried to get some stupid f***ing Chemistry study, but I think all that did was make me more sick, lol. Anyway, I dragged myself out of bed today, and after popping a panadol I let myself be driven to school. Ugh, a whole day of doing nothing remotely interesting (except possibly Geo, 'cause we're doing mapping) and me feeling crap all because of moronic, pointless, messed up CHEMISTRY. -breaks something- I had a test today, and the stupid teacher won't let you take the test if you're away, and gives you zero. I'm so annoyed, I like haven't eaten anything today excepting 3/4 a piece of toast and 1/4 mueslie bar. I don't even feel like eating, which means that I MUST be sick. Tonight I have more BATS (Broadford Ametuer Theatrical Society) rehearsal, and I'm gonna be so wreaked...price you pay for CAS though I guess. For all those non-IB people, CAS is a whole bunch of hours of either sport, service or something creative...big timewaster, and it, like the IB, is taking over my life. I found out I've got exams starting next Thursday. Can we say, OH SHIT!!!!! I'm going to have to study this year. No more stuffing round like previous years. Just goes to show how arrogant I am. Fifth year at TKIS and I still think I'm above study. Hehehe, I guess these exams are gonna teach me a thing or two. Anywho, must get going...only cause I don't have anything else to write really.
