[Ahem, those of you who grew up in the "everyone's-not-special" generation, ANNOTATION means writing in the book. You write what you think and underline stuff. This is not "Oh no, I hope they don't go under the bridge!" This is "Foreshadowing?" or "Periodic sentence" or "irony." I sometimes write "Ouch!" or "Haha!" but I odn't show my teachers.....]  I underlined stuff to avoid being pointed at and laughed by this woman, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the book!  However, it was weird, because on our plane ride home(yes, I was gone, losers who didn't notice or miss me) I'm reading the last part - for those who've read it, it was about the time Wilson and Nick left their respective residences - and my dad suddenly leans over and asks, "What are you writing?"  He leaned over to try and read it like I was a little girl writing in a diary and snickering at him. it was kind of weird, considering he's mass-educated, but then I think this whole annotation thing must relatively new, considering the amount of used books you can find that aren't all pencil-y.  I'm sure I sounded like quite the disgruntled teen, but I whined, "Dad, I'm  annotating!"    And because I thought my annotation here was stupid - it was like, "is it dead?" and generally my hope on that subject is rejected by superior Southern-Baptist lit experts - I  actually covered it up with my hand.   Like a little girl writing in a diary, guilty and embarrassed!  I don't think this says that annotation is part of that whole reader-response theory, that the reader puts a huge personal thingy in their reading, and maybe doesn't want to share, or anything profound like that.   What it says is that I'm a nerd.
