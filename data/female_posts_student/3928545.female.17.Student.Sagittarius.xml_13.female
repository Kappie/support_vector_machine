Let me see, Steve told me he used to have a crush on me, which is just perfect, just perfect,except for the fact that he USED to have one. He said that he liked me before we really started to talk. I guess that is how it is though, I open my mouth then it all goes to shit. I told him I used to have one on him aswell, it's true, if used to can equal 15 minutes before that conversation happened, then it's true. Honestly, why the hell did he feel the need to tell me that? Yeah, he's an honestguy and what not; butdid it make me feel better?? NO. Was I already on the verge of tears?? YES. That was the straw. I can't take it. I don't know why I let things bother me.That shouldn't have made me upset at all. It just made me feelreally uninteresting, I have nothing intelligent to say.I just...I need to go to bed. In the morning, it will be a new day, a fresh start. It will be wonderful.
