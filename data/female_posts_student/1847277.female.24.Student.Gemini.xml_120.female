It seems that I've lost a lot of brain cells over the course of my trip.  I wonder how many more I can lose over the next two months or so.    So I went to the museum today, where I chatted up Karen, Hemanth, and Donna.  Everyone seemed to be doing alright, and it doesn't seem that I missed much while I was gone.  There are 4 new students starting in the fall, which was just enough to result in me being booted over to the Treehouse.  That's really kind of sad.  I wish I was staying in the museum.  Maybe I can find a way to get an RA position for my 4th year so that I can move back.  I was going to move all my stuff this week while I had some free time, but I guess the people who are currently in my office haven't moved out yet, and don't have to until August 1, so my desk can remain a mess until I get back.    Matt and I are working on wedding plans.  Ooh, fun.  Actually, it's both fun and intensely stressful all at the same time.  We've decided to go for something kind of informal.  This is not suprising given that it's me and Matt.  And because we don't have much money.  Speaking of money, I got all the funding that I requested for the summer, which means I'm set for all my trips and for South Africa in the winter.  Yay!  That's very happy.  Now, if only I can find a dissertation project...  Yumm... Matt is making pizza and it smells good.  He claims that it's going to be bad cause the crust didn't rise, but it does smell tasty.  Anyhoo, I am pissed off at travelocity.com, as I ordered tickets from them on Friday with Priority Overnight delivery by Fed Ex, but they didn't come today.  They screwed up and sent my order to travelocity.co.uk, who it seems mailed them via regular post, which means I won't get the tickets before I leave the country.  This is a big problem.  I'm going to call them again tomorrow and bitch a lot.  We'll see how that goes.
