My summer, thus far, has gone nowhere. I have sat by my computer, staring mindlessly at an assortment of internet websites, for the entire week or so that I have been out of school. Gosh, I am so lazy and fat... I can't drag myself away from the computer (what else is there to do anyways?), so I might as well make the most of it... I'll just type about my pathetic thoughts and a good story or two (if I can find any to tell) on my blogs... Yup, aren't I making the most of my summer vacation?    Today, I shall talk about my social skills. I don't know why, but I just will. All though I am generally "okay" (at least I hope I am) in writing my thoughts, opinions, and other junk on my blogs, I have no social skills in my real life... And I am being totally serious about this. You see, I have a little thing called 'A Bad Past' that further complicates every friendship and other relationship I have. 'A Bad Past' isn't great to have because it doesn't let you trust people. Nope, it makes you avoid nearly social situation that you are thrown into... It sucks an awful lot to have...    Anyways, I am not very sociable... Every time someone talks to me I am extremely quiet, my face turns beet red, and I can't do anything but give facial expressions and body movements to indicate that I'm still alive and listening. It's rather sad. I used to be a bright, bouncy, and lovable girl, though that may be very hard to believe... I've never really had lots of friends but I was pretty well liked. At least, I believe I was. People used to come to me when they had a problem with a friend, a parent, a boyfriend, a sibling... I gave advice, talked to people about my likes and dislikes among other many other things, never picked on anyone, and even gave people parts of my lunch when they didn't have anything to eat. I was well liked, and I liked being who I was. It used to be fun, just being me... Then everything turned upside down. People used me to get what they wanted, whether it was popularity or something else. This turned me off... I became cold, distant, and impossible to talk to. I cried myself to sleep every night. I hated the world, because the world hated me. The world hated me for being me. It sucked. All of my friends started being mean and rude. They said terrible things... Eventually I left it all, made new friends, and became slightly more opener... Well, unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever grow back to trusting the world as much as I used to. Some cuts are just too deep to heal.    Every now and then, a wound that was almost completely healed, opens up again... Sometimes it is my fault and guilty conscience, but other times it is the cruel people in my life who always bring up painful memories whenever they can. It hurts a lot when they do this to me... I mean, I was never really rude to them... Yes, I hid the truth under a blanket of lies once but should that send me off to hell? Is not telling your best guy friend of nine years, that you had a boyfriend, such a big crime? Other, deeper wounds, like Camp and such, I know aren't my fault 'cause I never did anything wrong with them. Yet, part of me still believes that I am responsible for them.    Not being able to trust anyone, sucks. It hurts you a lot. You go through this really long process. Beforehand, you trust everyone but then everything, all the good in your world, just collapses...    Firstly, you believe that you're just imagining things, or that things aren't as bad as they may seem. You say in your head things like, 'Everyone has problems', and 'It's not as bad as it seems.' You're optimistic about things in the first stage, usually. Then as things worsen for you, you slowly turn into a more pessimistic person.    Secondly, you are in shock and can not defend yourself. This stage may only happen to a person that has never needed to defend themselves or just someone who is really nice. During this stage, you are amazed that all of this crap could be happening to you...    Thirdly, you get angry or confused. It seriously doesn't matter which 'cause sooner or later you'll feel through them both. For me, I was a little bit of both at this point. I was angry at the world for sending me into a downwarding spiral and confused at why the world would do anything as mean to me, who had never done anything cruel on purpose.    Fourthly, you'll try to severe ties. You'll go around apologizing over and over again to people for ridiculous things such as keeping the eraser that they let you borrow, for a few days more then you intended. You may flatter them with compliments, gifts, etc... Basically, you'll try to patch everything up even though it may not be your fault.    Fifthly, your plan will not work. You'll end up either angry or confused at everything and nothing at all.    Sixthly, you will let the world hurt you, feeling that maybe you deserve it or that they'll leave you alone after a while. This stage can last for quite a bit, and for me, it was the most painful stage of them all. The words they say will cut into your skin like knives, in the future.    Seventhly, you will become extremely depressed, angry at the world, antisocial, and/or not trust anybody. I became all four of these. You'll be quite miserable... At least I was...    Eighthly, you finally give up... There still may be flickers of moments in the previous stages but basically you're done. You'll let the bullies or whatever was cutting you up before, destroy you... You'll become either determined to not let the pain show, or let them get to you. I practiced a little bit of both. This one isn't much better than the seventh stage but usually people will discover your misery.    Ninthly, you will get away. This stage in one of the few that you have to wait for. For me, I had to wait a little while to get even part of my pain away. This one is one of most scariest stages to go through... You're dragged into situations where you're not sure how to act anymore... Eventually, things will start looking up.    Tenthly, you'll join the 'Healing Process'. How long this process takes depends on how scarred you are. I have only one painful experience in this part right now and though it has been here for five years, it is not fully healed yet.    I have faith that one day my cuts and scars created from Camp being taken away from me and other painful memories (like when my mom tried to kill my dad) will make it through this process. I know that I am strong enough to make it through, 'cause parts of me are healing and feeling great! I know that I can make it through. I've survived hell, even though some people may say what I've gone through isn't hell. But to me, it was hell... And if you can survive hell, then you can survive anything...
