I think it hit me today that I'm going to Boston for a purpose other than to hang out with B. I was like, "Oh yeah...I'm doing an externship, huh?" I think I need to start taking this thing a little more seriously or else the people at MIT are going to think I'm a slacker. I need to at least  pretend  that I'm there to work, not just to see my b/f.   Today I hung out a little bit with Jon and Ruth. They had lunch at Dos Coyotes, but I just had a drink since I already ate. It was a little awkward hang out with them, I don't know why. They seemed to be having more of a conversation amongst themselves and I felt a tiny bit left out but not enough to hold it against them. Afterwards I went to Bereans with Ruth because she needed to pick up a book. We talked a little in the car. Ruth and I actually have really good converations about meaningful topics, but it just take a little while to get it going. We talked about "emotional boundaries"--something that I've never heard of. She said that just as a dating couple should have physical boundaries, a married couple should have emotional boundaries. This means that one partner should notbecome too emotionally attached to someone of an opposite gender except for their spouse.To do otherwise would be "emotional adultery". This makes sense. For instance, if I were married, it would be wierd and wrong for me to have a guy best friend that I confided in more than my husband. Emotional boundaries.
