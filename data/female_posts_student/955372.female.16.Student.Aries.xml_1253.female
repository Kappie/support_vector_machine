Here's the summary:  Low Points: - was with family - had to wait AN HOUR AND A HALF for a table - during hour and a half waiting got to walk around mall looking at stuff I couldn't buy because didn't bring money because didn't expect to be waiting for, say it with me, an hour and a half - walked around mall with family - when finally got table waited an hour for food - waiter was crossbreed Jamie Oliver and Freddie Prinz Jr. and perky to boot - had about three options on menu to choose from that didn't have meat in some form (as predicted) - Dad complained about cold fish or something but then refused to take free meal or get it warmed up. Point? none. - had to make run for the car since was 18 degrees outside and units decided would be smart to park in bumblefuck  Highlights: - saw really REALLY great shoes ON SALE, is likely will go back asap - when dad complained about cold fish, seemed to break perky waiter's spirit. Très amusant. - one waiter looked exactly like Jeff from Coupling and seemed to have personality to match. - Manicotti was really good. - dad's food was cold. bahaha. - after we ordered our food our waiter said, AND I QUOTE, "ah, great. I love you guys.", downside: had to refrain from responding "we're not into that"
