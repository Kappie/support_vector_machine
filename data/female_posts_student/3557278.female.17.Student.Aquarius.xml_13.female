I had a free first and then this src presentation thing where we got a badge, they did give us free food though :) Yeah... hmmm what else happened? Well my extension assessment went fine! I'm happy to say. My speech was 4:22, meaning i was the only one in the alotted time, and my improvised speech was 1:28. i think i went pretty decent and i addressed all the issues i needed to. yay ;)  I have bad hair today :( i loved it when i first got it done, all silky, blonde and straight! I wish my hair would blow dry straight easily. aaanyway. not being shallow or anything, lol.  Tonight i'm going to do my society and culture assessment task - inequality in gender. I get to use stingers :) but I have to write my dukes log book too...booo! I'm not looking forward to it. i better go hunt down my notes. wah  see yas
