They always make me smile and make my day better.....I love em to death.... Gah lately God has spoken to me so much and I'm acctually being able to figure out the things I need to do with life I mean ok I've been single now for like 7months! Wow that's basically a record for me I mean I've always had some odd guy there that I was dating and now I look back on some of them and regret them but hey that was the past......I figured out that God is showing me that I don't HAVE to have a guy I mean yeah they are great and all but I don't have to have one there for me all the time I can just be best friends with them without having to be there girlfriend I mean Colby is my BEST guy friend!! and so is Adam and Matthew I mean I love them all to death and they all have always been there for me adn I mean just to put the spotlight on Colby for a little while I mean he adn I dated like 3 times and it was truly special and I loved him and all and thoguht it would never end but then it did all 3 times and he's ALWAYS been there for me to just go and talk to about ANYTHING! I mean I've told him things that I would tell just anybody and I don't know he's just so awesome and I've mis-treated him so many times ans now I realize that but he's ALWAYS forgiven me!! I mean honestly if I were him I would just hate my guts but he's always forgiven me and tried to helo me move forward in life and just being able to open up to him makes things so awesome! And to be totally honest I'm really starting to like him ALOT again but I don't wanna just jump into it I wanna take things a little slow if we do start dating b/c if you go too fast in a relationship that just ruins the whole thing and then eventually you get sick of each other  where-as if you take it slow then there's more to look forward to in hte future plus it brings you closer and easier to talk to each other...but yeah that's a little more then a tad but about him but I mean thats just how awesome of a guy he is he makes me smile when i'm having a horrible day and i can tell him anything and he is just great. He makes me laugh alot except when he makes fun of me then I just feel stupid but hey thats ok everybody just needs to learn to laugh at themselves every once and a while. Over-all he's just made me a happier person and I love him to death. I love you Colby! anyways this is pretty long and so I'll write later on I love you alll soooooooooo much!!!!!!! byebye
