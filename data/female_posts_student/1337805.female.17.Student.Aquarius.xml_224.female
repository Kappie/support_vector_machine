The only thing is, the one person in the enitre world who might care is in Argentina and pretty much unreachable  So I'm pretty down right now, cause there is no one else to scream and jump up and down with me, no one who truelly understands.  I tried telling Tom tonight, and he was just like.. "I don't see the big deal...?" It just made me wanna cry. Hugely. Big wet tears.  Where are you Fiona?! I miss you so much now, you really are and will always be the glue holding me to youth group...I don't wanna go if you aren't there to help defend the CUC to our very American group..:(     --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Thursday, March 04, 2004   Is it wrong to like someone you consider to be your best friend?  Is it wrong to have those urges, and those feelings?  We've been getting pretty close lately, and it's been awesome. We're both completey dependant on each other when it comes to the opposite sex, always talking about who we like, and how to rope them into our reaches.   And now I think he's accidentally roped in myself.  Oh heart, why do you play with me so?      Wednesday, March 03, 2004   I miss him.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Tuesday, March 02, 2004   I feel so obselete sometimes.. That my creativity is sometimes wasted.  I pride my beauty. I work hard to look the way I am, and to act the way I do. I strive to be unique, and to differ from others as much as I can - to stand out, and attract people and attention. If I can stay in their mind for five minutes, or even more, that's all I need.  Today we filmed part of our movie, where I am the hooker...When it was time for me to be filmed, Nick was laughing, as was everyone else...jokes were cracked, but there was lizards in the ditch below to enteratin and distract me. Afterwards, while capturing the movie, Nick shuddered and wished aloud to be able to just turn off the monitor and not watch that part. Ouch.  First, it was HIS idea for me to be the hooker. We could have gotten someone else, but it had to be me. Fuck.   Abstract thoughts. Love and Lust.  Nick, regardless of his faults, is beginning to look rather tempting to me....I want to be able to feel the texture of his mouth, his tender lips...I mean. He's extremely intriguing, with his groping, feeling hands, and looks..The way he acts is entertaining, but yet very observable. You could watch him all day and be plagued with wonderings of why he does what he does, and what he is thinking. He is inpenitraitable. I can't conjure up a way to figure out more about him, his thoughts, and moods. Likes and dislikes. But I am resourceful. I can find a way to hear his thoughts, and one day, I shall.  More lust. Is it wrong to lust or long after a person who is pratically my best friend? I tell him everything, he is what Liam was to me all those precious years ago. (That statement makes me feel so old!) I laugh with him, cry with him, comfort him, and be comforted by him. We're always talking to each, laughing. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to lean over and just..kiss him...be caught with his surprise, and be pleased as the moment intensifys...pardon me, I believe I'm thinking of Tom when I say that...  I'm just a messed up puddle of emotions.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  New blog. I'm not used to change like this. I'm not even sure I'll use it that much. But no one knows about this, my secret fortress of solitude. I can truelly hide my thoughts and feelings in here, without worrying what people are reading...
