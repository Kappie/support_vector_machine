I don't know if my story is all that amazing because I don't know the answer to the question I just posed. If every girl has a story, well maybe I'm not alone in feeling as if sixteen years of an amazing story have taken place for me and me alone, leaving me with the responsibility to those girls who come next to write a book like "Chicken Soup"--to write a type of Chicken Soup for the Soul. Yes, I say Chicken Soup for the Soul without an adjective in front because I feel as if maybe this book would be totally different. Maybe this book would be truly a Chicken Soup for the soul, only I generally don't like soup at all, so I'd say it's something everyone loves that comforts them...or at least something I love that comforts me...like macaroni and cheese but not just any macaroni--my mother's homemade macaroni. I don't know. By the way, I've stopped using proper grammar and punctuation in this entry because well the thoughts are flowing so fast I can't bother with such conventions. So, it's around 2 am and I'm up because I for some reason can't sleep and the only remedy I can conceive is writing. It's as if I have a story to share, which brings me back to where I started--does everyone have a story?       Well, I have no clue, but I do know that I have a story I want to share, and I can't possibly do it here--there's absolutley no one crazy enough to write a life story when one's life isn't nearly half over yet--when there's so much left for this author to experience--so much yet to see and do and feel and touch and know--I mean truly know, not just know like  anyone knows from a book of accounts, but to know from firsthand experience.       Here I simply want to purge some of the thoughts keeping me from sleep. I want to go to sleep, and all I can do is roll around in bed thinking--unhealthy, I say, unhealthy. I have a story to tell of broken hearts, what ifs, missed chances, stolen moments, countless opportunities, deeply captivating friendships. I have a story to tell and I'm just crazy enough to share some of it here. I'm sure everyone, if she looks deep enough inside, has a story, but I guess I'm one of the few crazy enough to share it.       I'll look first to my later years because they're what I can actually remember. And I warn the reader because the story changes as time moves on--because we're so quick to romanticize the past and remember only the good, pretending as if the bad does not exist and never did-- maybe to make ourselves feel better about it and feel as if our time has not been wasted. I'll warn the reader because with each narrator, the story alters. I warn the reader because with time, the story alters. With time, the perception alters--bitterness or romanticism influence the story greatly, despite the narrator's attempts to simply recount the past. The truth, however, is that no one can objectively tell the past to someone who wasn't there, so no matter what I do, this story is not exactly what happened.      I guess an interesting place to dive in would by when I was twelve--in the seventh grade. I could start earlier because I remember further than that, but I'd rather start there. Those of you who knew me then know that was definitely a time of anxiety and just insanity for me and everyone around us in our little Team A--Team A was the Orchestra team, B for Band, and C for Chorus. Orchestra doesn't start with A, but I guess it's just that band and chorus work so perfectly and alphabetical is best, starting with B would be dumb. Then, of course, they mixed the General Music kids in each of the teams evenly. Team A was dramatic, to say the least, well to say the very very least. It was crazy. We managed to turn everything into an epic drama concerning the fate of the world, and in some ways, things have changed very little, but in others, they are worlds apart.      So Team A--the "crew" I hung out with, well let's see you had me, Danielle, and Jimmy as the best of friends, then our lunch table of Zoie, Brittany, Tahoorah, Rebecca, and our constant visitors of Ryan and Kim. Our lunch table was drama central and I can barely remember one week when we were all talking. Things have definitely changed. Danielle, Jimmy, and I used to be so close--it'd probably have made most of you vomit had you known us. There wasn't a day when we didn't all talk on the oh-s0-popular three-way calling system, which we had just discovered on our phones. I would get home from school around three and the first thing I'd hear the moment I walked in off the bus would be the ringing of the phone and I'd know it was Danielle. That's how it always worked. Danielle'd call me, and then, later, we'd call Jimmy. It would be the strangest day ever if I didn't get the phone call. So, even when we fought, we'd call one another--I think because we neeeded the voices for comfort, and even when we'd fight, we'd try to make up because we'd have to sit near one another in orchestra--that all-important class--that foundation for everything that we were when you really look into it...without orchestra, we wouldn't be Team A and without Team A, I'd be a profoundly different person with fundamentally different friends.  Gosh...picking up the violin wasn't a huge deal until Middle School--Linwood's system made your music choice a part of you through separation, then isolation of schedules. It was taboo to talk to kids in Band and Chorus--and hell, that stayed with us to high school.       Orchestra--wow--that class was haha crazy. That's the only word I can come up with to describe it. It was me, Danielle, Jimmy, Zoie, Merin, Brittany, Taylor--remember Taylor guys??, Pratik, Rebecca, AB later on, Salma, Kevin who was very haha different to say the least then, Devjoy, and just everyone. Mr. Schiavone was at the helm, driving us to play these songs with "impossible" rhythms and notes that we now laugh at in remembering. "Don't Cry for Me Argentina"--I hated that song, that and "Air on the G String"--oh my God...horrible. We couldn't play them, no matter what we did or how much practicing, well maybe if we had actually practiced back then...haha we used to just BS those Practice Sheets--those mandatory two hours per week sheets we'd lie on and have our parents sign, knowing we hadn't taken the instruments home all week--all month for that matter. So yes, these terrible songs mixed with the constant drama and the diva impressions people had about the First versus Second Violins and the constant screaming of Mr. Schiavone--they made up our days. Everything would essentially start and end in that class--fights, issues, conversations, friendships.       So with orchestra being such a formative class, and then our plunge into high school--people dropped the instruments. We lost Pratik and Zoie and Jimmy and Merin and Taylor for another reason, and more--and if you think about it, in losing them in Orchestra, we lost them in our conversations, outings, friendships, and lives. We just lost them. Of course, some of these friendships survived--it wasn't the be all and end all, but it was strong enough to severely weaken them.       Gosh...the things we did in seventh grade--there is no way I could actually end this blog with just seventh grade if I went into it all. We were just insane. Let me just say that we hurt and loved and felt more deeply than I think ever I have and ever I will. Constant puppy love and furious attacks on one another, along with the entertainment provided by my utter lack of poise and balance. I fell down, I rolled down, I tumbled, I slid--I just embarassed myself day after day and I guess that's why those times are "akward youth." But, the importance is that I survived it all--not without a couple of scratches of course, but alive and better for it.       Peer mediation--haha Jimmy, Rebecca, and I helped so many other people figure out their problems and solve them, but we couldn't make heads or tails of our own--well not so much Rebecca for she always was the logical, calm one. When we ended up there as a huge group--think about it, guys--it was sad. We cried over "she told everyone that I tripped out the doorway and the teachers were playing soccer with me," and just stupid things like that.       That was truly "the best of times, the worst of times." Guys, I'm going to end this with just a light touch upon the past at age twelve. I'm not going to even attempt to explain it all, because I could write a novel of War and Peace length with just seventh grade antics. I hope you remember always because Orchestra--it truly is our root. Whether you play in the future or not, stop and think. Without that class, chances are that we wouldn't have each other. Without being yelled at all the time by "Tomato" as we used to refer to him, we would have sucked even more. Without one another to get through those insane times, we'd all be in clinics or undergoing some intense therapy.       Whether you remember the things we said to one another, the good times, the bad times, the fights, the kisses, the love, the hugs, the dances, the making up, the breaking up, the classes, the letters--remember us. Remember that we had one another then, and that in the future, we have the memory of one another and that is the strongest thing you can have of someone--and that like it or not, you're in each other's hearts--you're in my heart, and perhaps, that's why I can't forget that phone number even though we've had a horrible falling out--perhaps that's why I'll never forget "The Queen Bee"--maybe that's why I'll always play the violin no matter how much I complain about it--maybe that's why we have one another--perhaps that's the reason I'll never be able to ride a feras wheel wihout smelling something or hear KC and JoJo without laughing--maybe that's why everything.       You can trace most of it back to Orchestra. So, maybe as much as we feel we've been tortured by our conductors since third grade and the age of eight--we loved every moment of orchestra. We needed every moment. We were meant the be the "fiddlers or the stringers" as they said. We were meant to be Team A and help to form one another.       And perhaps this is why I couldn't sleep before--because I know that in sixteen years, I made some friendships that I have tried to let go of--with people I've tried to ignore and forget--but in the back of my mind--in the back of my heart, they remain.  And just maybe this act of clarity comes with old age--17 years, and still going strong, so I say if my first 16 have been this crazy, and this long entry barely touched on just one of them--I have a story that just might be a tad bit unique.
