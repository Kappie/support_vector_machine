Where is that safe place where I can be content, relaxed, at peace? Are not all places what we make them? Then, that place is in my mind. But now, I cannot find it. Now is not the time for me to feel gleeful or amused. Now I am at war, fighting the forces of melancholy emptiness vying for my emotions. At times they besiege me, and it is then that I come here. To a place that cannot judge, cannot offer unwanted taunting or charity. It is emotionless, so it absorbs. And after a while, the mist disperses. As do I, knowing that the twilight is inevitable, knowing that I am bouncing my soul off of something soulless. An echo. A wall I can't climb, but can touch and feel its hard, cool stones. And suddenly a section of the wall unhinges, and I am allowed through, journeying from one damp heath to the next. But I am home now. This is my plain, these are my rodents scurrying through the grasses. I feel a peace. Not the peace of contentment, but the peace of familiarity. I know all will be well soon. The sun is setting, and windows twinkle in the waste around them. It is warm in the cabin, and she will have something hot ready for me. Soon, surrounded by humanity, I will come back to myself and forget my dispair at coming home empty-handed, forget even walking through the grasses beset by winged parasites. I will be warm. I will feel the warmth of their smiles. I will be happy.
