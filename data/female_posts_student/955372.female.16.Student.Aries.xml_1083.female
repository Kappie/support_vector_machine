Song for the Dumped- Ben Folds Five   So you wanted  to take a break  Slow it down some and  have some space   Well fuck you too  Give me my money back  Give me my money back  you bitch  I want my money back  (And don't forget to give  me back my black T-Shirt)   Wish I hadn't bought you dinner  Right before you dumped me  on your front porch  Give me my money back  Give me my money back  You bitch  I want my money back  and don't forget   And don't forget.
