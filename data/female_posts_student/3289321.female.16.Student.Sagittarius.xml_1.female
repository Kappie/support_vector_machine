Youth was really cool tonight..we talked about our upcoming mission trip to KY.  I'm so excited!!  It'll be my first mission trip ever, and it sounds like so much fun...we're gonna be working with little kids the entire time..we're doing a vacation Bible school, and the theme is sports!  WOOHOO!!  I can't wait!  Going to the beach this weekend, and megan's coming too!  It's gonna be great.  SUMMERTIME!!  Good song that I just heard...   Oh cuz I don't know I don't know what he's after But he's so beautiful Such a beautiful disaster And if I could hold on Through the tears and the laughter Would it be beautiful?  Or just a beautiful disaster ^"Beautiful Disaster" - Kelly Clarkson -------- And because this song is also cool, it has to be put in here:   There's a place off Ocean Avenue Where I used to sit and talk with you We were both 16 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street  We would walk on the beach in our bare feet We were both 18 and it felt so right Sleeping all day, staying up all night Staying up all night  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  There's a piece of you that's here with me It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see When I sleep, I dream and it gets me by I can make believe that you're here tonight That you're here tonight  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away  I remember the look in your eyes When I told you that this was goodbye You were begging me not tonight Not here, not now We're looking up at the same night sky And keep pretending the sun will not rise  Be together for one more night Somewhere, somehow  If I could find you now things would get better We could leave this town and run forever I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together Let your waves crash down on me and take me away ^"Ocean Avenue" - Yellowcard    Later  >
