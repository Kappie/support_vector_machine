A happy thing happened there today coz I moved into a space with a Spawn and only got hit for 5 points! Whee! I was taking a chance there, I know. But 2 ghouls in that same box is too tempting...  What exactly did you  do  that makes you feel you've wasted your time? Lounging around in front of the television???  I have to say, even though a lot of people hate the US... Perhaps its future would be brighter than that of Hong Kong. =.= If Hong Kong is spiralling down the way A Lee always feared it is... Then the US is definitely a better choice.  Hm. And Step. We don't try to correct you coz you're beyond the help of corrections. Hahahhahhaha. Alright. Just joking. ^^"  You know what, I went to bed last night at 10... But couldn't sleep until 3. Pah. My mom said it's the coffee I had yesterday. I don't know. =.= I was tired, my head was heavy, but I couldn't sleep. Laid around until 1 sth and turned on my bedlamp and read... Finished that love story. Thought I would be able to sleep after that... but no. The story is just so nice and romantic that I couldn't sleep right away. =.= So I got online and wrote a bit... Some sort of late night confessions. =P My entries are always so blatantly honest at that hour of the day.  Oh alright. Getting to the title of this entry. I was thinking of some new names for this blog just now... Came up with a couple of words... Shared Attic? Loft? Well, I was thinking about the attic coz well... I don't know. It's just sort of the part of the house that isn't usually visited by people. Some people use it as a bedroom... some use it to store things... the point is. It's a private place.  I also looked up what an attic means in dreams and came up with this:  "To see an attic in your dream, represents hidden memories or repressed thoughts that is being revealed. It also symbolize your mind, spirituality, and your connection to the higher Self. Alternatively, it signifies difficulties in your life that will hinder you from attaining your goals and aspirations. However, in the end, after a long period of struggle, you will overcome them."  I don't know. What do you say?
