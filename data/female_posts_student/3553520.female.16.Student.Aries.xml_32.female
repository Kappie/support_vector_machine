     
      I miss being beautiful.   I miss fooling everyone around me.  I miss being sober.  I miss having fun.  I miss being thin.  I miss having friends.  I miss knowing what I wanted to do.  I miss feeling everything.  I miss the past.  I miss what I was. Who I was.     I miss ... Who I used to be.
