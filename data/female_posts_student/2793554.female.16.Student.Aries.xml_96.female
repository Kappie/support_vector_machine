DEATH! ::stabstab::  On the bright side, i got to hang out with Shauna today. Shes so cool, i was in such a good mood hanging out with her. We went out to dinner and just.. talked about stuff. And then ignorant masses came and swamped us and BLAARRRRGHHHH!!!! ...just like that.  And i got to hang out with liz and melissa. Theyre SO awesome and i love them to pieces. Except melissa was sick, which was sad. But i brought her tea this morning, i hope she gets less sick cause shes all pathetic when shes sick (but in the cutest way, of course.) and  i shaved lizs head and we just sat around doing nothing.  I MISS DYLAN! ::WHIIIIIINE::  gah. im going to go sulk off and pout about how i hate people in high school.    abby
