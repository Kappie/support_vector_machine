The name of it is  urlLink Hot Abercrombie Chick  which is funny because stereotypically it would be thought of as a dumb liberal blonde's blog, but it is a conservative college girl who is very articulate.  I love reading what she has to say.  I need to get more involved politically.  I can't vote but I can speak.  People need to here the issues.  Correctly. The media is leftist.  The public schools are biased toward liberalism.  The government is socialist.  Kids are being raised to not read.  Just watch TV and listen to what they have to say.  I mean if they made it to TV, they must be right.  Right???   If anyone else wants to get involved email me.  I am going to think of ways to get out there.  Make the issue known.  Intelligently.  Too often, conservatives just go out and get made to look like idiots by people who confuse themselves.  *Speaks out*
