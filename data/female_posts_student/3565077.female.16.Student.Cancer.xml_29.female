"david was afraid of the lord that day and said, "how can the ark of the lord ever come to me?" he was not willing to take the ark of the lord to be with him in the city of david." god can't fight our will. the choice, ultimately, is ours. if we want our town to be blessed, we can't afford to get disillusioned and give up. if we aren't willing to put our own way aside for god, nothing will ever happen.  also i got psalm 2 verse twelve "kiss the son, lest he be angry" we have got to throw aside all our religious jargon and be open before god, even if it's scary and out of our comfort zone. we have to draw near enough to jesus to feel his kiss, near to the almighty one even though we're trembling and our heads are bowed. he promises later in the verse that "blessed are all who take refuge in him"  thanks god!!!!
