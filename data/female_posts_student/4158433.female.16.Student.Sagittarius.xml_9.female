That i can make it through this   and ill end up goin' far.   And then I start to fall   As I look up to death's glance   And then you come down   And save me from it all   My angel of reassurance   my light inside the dark   You help me find my way again   And rekindle my sparks.   You take my hand and lead me through   help me start to stride   And you show me that im beautiful   and heal all my pride   and when night fades to day   you look at me and say   Even when it gets dark again   Ill help along the way   Ill always be there to guide you   when things seem a little too hard   and I will always love you   when you feel alone.   So remember my fallen angel   It's because of you      That I kept on goin' and didn't become so blue.
