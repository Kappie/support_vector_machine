That was funny. It's funny how you can turn something like that into something that makes you laugh by just doing a simple action. They cheated in the french test!!! That reeaaallly pisses me off grr..... they judge people by things like what they wear and what their preferences are, whereas I judge people after knowing them long enough to know that they're self-obsessed, shallow, uncultured, closed-minded, COWS  No offence to cows or anything.
