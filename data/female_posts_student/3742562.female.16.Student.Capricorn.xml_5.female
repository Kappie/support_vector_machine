We made plans for her to come here, and that didn't go through...sooo we made plans for me to go there...hopefully that goes through and her mom doesn't throw another hissy fit... I was gonna go to Brandon's since it's my first day I can go somwheres after getting unpunished...but being his *UnDeRsTaNdiNg* self, he's not mad...gotta love that guy... s0o0 I guess I'll go to his house tomorrow or he'll come here after he gets off of work... I been cleaning all day...cleaned the bathroom floor with Clorox...them fumes are definitely getting to me...PHEW!...Well...I better go finish cleaning up and all...hopefully, one of my plans will go through and I'll get to get out of this house!  OH!...and mom bought me SpiDeRmaN boxer pants!...cause someone stole my favorite camouflage ones! GRR!!!!
