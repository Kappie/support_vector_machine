Well life offically sucks, i hate most ppl and things and everything..i'd say more but i really don't want randoms to know all about my life..but i guess i reallly have nothing to hide, rite? not that it matters because i'm too selfcontious, so u can all wonder about how truly depressed i am. or am i just full of shit?..u'll never know. No one will ever know, because like i said b4, i'm just too self contious. if your confused..u shold be. i told u not to read this, u just can handel temptation can u? is ur life that boring that u have to read about mine on a on-line journal?..it seems as thought the latter of the two is more correct..am i not rite? so are u comparing ur self to me? have u decided that you are better yet?..or am i the better one, or have i confused u so much that u won't continue reading this. nope, u've decided to keeping reading my bull shit. or am i just speaking the truth?...of course i'm not, because ur rite and if u are always right then i must be wrong..am i correct?..well saying yes would be a contridiction to urself rite, so to make urself fee; better you will say no..but wait if i could predict that. then that can't be true either..because that would make me rite, rite?..wrong. ur worst nightmare, or ur ecstasy? ur annoyance or entertainment?..what am i to u?.. i'm nothing. what do u see when u stare into my eyes? can u see the sadness, can u feel the coldness coming from my heart?..am i dead inside?.. would u ever be able to feel my pain? am i saying this for kicks?...do i think that i'm trying to be "deep"?..do i give a fuck what u think? I told u not to read this
