Lool, why the hell did Luke (that is his name, right?) go to uni in Wales, anyway?  I mean, WALES?! Jesus Christ! Of all the places ...  Pooj, lurve the pink, but the rest of it is not loading!  Oh yeah, I can just say that to you on MSN.  Hold on a minute.  Okay. Back.  But I have to go now.  Chuh.  See you later :D  Jools
