I haven't really given her a name. I call her kitty out of habit but her vet records say her name is Z. I call her that sometimes but not as much as Kitty. Recently she has become more of an outside cat so I don't see her that often especially because I've been at my dads a lot lately. Today when Sarah was still over I saw her for the first time in a week or so. I picked her up but she didn't really seem like she wanted to be held, so I held her front legs together and petted her stomache like I do a lot of the times, she usually stays in my lap or arms, but this time she really wanted to get away and I didn't know why until Sarah pointed out that she was bleeding. I didn't think it was a big deal at first but of course I wanted to look at it. There was a nickel sized hole in her back left leg where there was absolutely no skin at all. I could see her muscle and a vein just sitting there exposed. She wanted to go outside so badly but I was so freaked out of course she was not going outside. Mom said that she probably got attacked by a racoon or something. It scared me so bad. I called the Pet Doctor right away but apparently they are closed on Sundays, mom said we could call the emergency pet place but they are way more expensive. She is calling right now to see if she will be okay until tomarrow or if we should take her in. I think we should take her in but we'll see.
