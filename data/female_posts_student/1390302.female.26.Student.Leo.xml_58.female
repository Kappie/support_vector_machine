I think I have recently found out.  It’s the single saddest thing I have ever seen, it’s the single saddest thing anyone has ever seen (speaking relatively, of course).    One party wants a divorce, the other says no, they try to patch things up, have what is probably a pretty ordinary, boring, make-up fuck, and they think that life is all good!  How can anyone be so damned naïve?  So what happens next week when party #1 wants a divorce again?  Or the week after that when boring make-up sex has reached its height and just turns into normal relationship sex again?  Then what?  All I have to say is if my marriage turns that cliché and utterly sad, I hope someone will put me out of my misery!   I mean come on, I am not trying to be mean, really, one party to the couple is a really good friend of mine, I just think she’s being especially meek about this whole situation.  I just want to kick her and say, “Dump the ass-hole, you can do better!” but when I open my mouth to speak, all that comes out is, “I hope y’all can work this out, I know you love one another…” blah, blah, blah!  It’s gotten to the point that I am nearly completely personally insulted by her naiveté.  She and I are pretty close friends, I feel for her in this situation, yet the realization that there is not one damned thing I can do for her is killing me!  I want to kick her husband in the nuts and tell him to grow up and be a man, he’s too old to be acting like this!    Yet when the day is done, I don’t, they don’t, life is still as sorry and angry as it was when the day began…Truly its not that I don’t understand their situation.  I was a party to an especially bad relationship once, it lasted 5 long and miserable years and when it was done I cried more for becoming a statistic than for the ending of misery.  When I got divorced from my first hubby, I was happier than I was when I married him.  I never shed one tear for him or his feelings; I shed hundreds because I had just made myself into a societal statistic, “65% of marriages end in divorce!”  AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!  Don’t get me wrong, I am a Christian and I know that being a good wife is important, I consider myself a very good wife right now.  I know that to divorce is going against religion in many ways, yet it couldn’t be helped…I guess that I shouldn’t have made the stupid mistake of marrying the jerk to begin with.  I did, but I fixed that mistake and now he’s some other poor sap's…that is, some other poor woman’s problem.  Poor girl, if I hadn’t hear that she was such a bitch and that they make a perfect pair, I might have even felt sorry for her.  So, all in all I think that the quote at the beginning is right!  You have to experience BAD love to know GOOD love when you see it.  I know good love now, I just wished with all my heart that my friend could.  Perhaps some day she will come to her senses, I pray for that day!  ~Kristyn
