I'm probably tired because I just got back from working out. I went to the JCC earlier today to work out and I was the youngest one there. In fact, my dad would've been the youngest one there. I think I'll avoid going during the high elder traffic time. Plus one of them pissed me off! I was going to the elipitical machine and this guy on the other one says I need to go sign up for it. I was like okay, whatever and I did it. I come back and he's like it just really makes it easier on everyone. Like someone can't see I'm on it and decide to go to another machine? Okay I'm over that.  So I'm on the eliptical machine and this girl, Erica, who works there comes up and talks to me.I would've been just fine listening to my tunes and working out. Actually she's a nice girl, but rather annoying at times. Anyway she proceeds to tell me about her boobs and her bathing suit drama. How her boobs got bigger, well not bigger she says, wider and so they hang out of her suit. I personallycouldn't see a difference in her boobs, but Ididn't wantto stare. And honestly I don't care about her boobs. I'm thinking, however, maybe I need to do the stuff she's doing. I want bigger boobs! So she keeps talking, I give her my best blank stare, throw in a few head nods, uh-huhs, I understands, and keep working out. She even invites me to help her with her bathing suit hunt. How I would've loved to go! So over the course of the next 10 minutes, she's still talking, and I'm not listening. After talking she feels better. I'll make a good psychologist, huh?  Anyway on my way out I run into this girl that works at the front desk that I talk to every now and again. I don't know her name. I walk up to her and notice she's staring at my legs. Odd. I ask her if she's coming up here to work out and she says yes. She said she needs to get in shape and I said I understand. Not really, I said me too. Anyway she's still staring, not blatantly, and says at least you have cute legs. I'm like okay thanks. Was I supposed to say you have cute legs too? Anyway I feel odd since she's still staring at my legs so I say well I've got to go. As I was walking off I saw her turn around and look at my legs. Now I have a complex about my legs. Thanks.  Okay I think I will go take a nap now.
