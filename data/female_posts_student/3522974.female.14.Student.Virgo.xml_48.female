Unfortunately, 9/10 ths of my group is invole in MSPA, so unfortunately won't get any! Muahahahaha! It'll just be my stomach and I dining...And Sarah! Ooooh! Yummmmm... While i am thinking bout food poor beth is worrying bout her dance. Dw beth, it'll all turn out well, on the night u can just make up ur own moves and Hannah can do hers seperate or something...Your a great dancer!   When the going starts to get rough, and u feel like you had enough of the music....Take a chance and do what you feel........      Don't get lost in the crowd, be the one to stand strong and turn heads around......Be a believer, don't get lost in the crowd.     Random, i know. Just two songs i like, that seemed to relate.  Now, excuse me while i go buy an apple with a coupon, and then come bak to the shop where i bought it from and complain so everyone else in line has to wait for me! Muahahahaaa... Tata every1. (*Ding*)! Dim sims r ready!
