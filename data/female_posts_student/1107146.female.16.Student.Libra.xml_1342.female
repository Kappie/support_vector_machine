I don't think I will ever be able to get enough of that stuff.  Hummmm.... I bet I could figure out how to make it at home.... It's nice that you are back, Will.  I don't think I will be able to catch up that quickly when I get back, but you never know.  Can't wait until tomorrow.  Wahoo!  Boy howdy!  Whoopie-ding!  Neato mosquito man!  Whoop-di-doo!  Ok, I can't think of any more really cheesy phrases that express sarcasm, so I'll stop now.  Anyway..find some more random quotes, Linds.  I'm ordering you to.
