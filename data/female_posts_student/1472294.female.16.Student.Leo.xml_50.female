Hmmm... and today was actually a very fine and HUMID *sweats profusely* day and what am I doing? Sitting on the orthodontics' "chair", I can tell u that it is hard and not comfortable and right above u is the damn light. *eyes close, small pupil, circular muscles contract, blah...* And beside u is the dentist all covered in green (GREEN robes, if u noe wat i mean) holding all these wierd tools that look EXACTLY like scissors and other scary- looking stuff. Ok, now u ask mi why in e hell am I doing? Of course, I hav braces and u noe the rest of the story... Jaw IS very sore right now. *eyes blinking*
