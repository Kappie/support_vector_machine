Well, my name isn't technically Kitty. Its Yekaterina. Since no one could say that, we shortened it to Katya. People still have trouble pronouncing it and I got tired of telling them that its pronounced 'ka-dee-ah' not 'cat-sha.' So then that is shortened to Kat, and my friends call me Kitty because I'm lazy, have claws, hiss when annoyed and/or angry, sleep and eat a lot, and scratch people like a cat. (The creature.) So...yeah.   The Outback Kitty  I am...me. I have BROWN hair(ha to all you people that say its dark blonde!) and blue-grey eyes that randomly change colour slightly(not because of the light.) I am a 13-year-old wierdo. TWO whole people have told me I'm cool though. and to MY FACE!!! As in, in real life not on the computer. :) One was some wierdo guy who had a crush on me years ago. (He's a year younger than me and a midget. why do I get stuck with the wierd guys?) The second was my friend, Sam. As in [Sam]antha, if you were wondering. -_- But that was probably because I read her future once. But now my Tarot cards are gone. :(   Origins of my Name[2]  Did you know that there are three possible places my name could have come from: (a) Yekaterina, the person, a really really famous Tsarina once in Russia(yeah I'm Russian. Get over it.) (b) St. Yekaterina, some saint in Russia. (c) (Yeah, you can laugh here. Just finish the whole sentence first.) Yekaterinburg, the city, in Russia once again, which is highly doubtful but then my friend said that me getting into a private school was highly doubtful and here I am at Loreto Mandeville Hall, private school.  Actaully my dad told me that I was named after choice (a) there. So...yeah. I don't know much about her other than she was really really famous and she was a ruler of a really really huge country. (Have you seen the size of Russia? Whoa)   Friends are a Girl's Best Friend......sometimes, anyway   Um...so that you know what I talk about later, here are a few of my friends and the ex-friend that all-to-often rings me up. If I mention anyone who is not here in later posts I will explain about them there.  Tracey: A Vietnamese midget. She has black hair and...um...dark eyes? (I've never bothered to look, I've been too busy reading) She loves the Tamora Pierce books almsot as much as I do and we drive Freya crazy talking about them on the way home on the train. Its so funny when I stand next to her because I'm this huge skinny giant and she's...a midget.  Freya: I am SO lucky to have a friend named after a goddess! They even look alike only Freya(the one that I know) doesn't have red hair like Freya(the goddess). She had brownish hair. She walks really really fast. She takes the train home with Tracey. And me of course.  Tash(Natasha): Another midget. Really really small. Even for a midget she's small. I love standing next to her. Its so funny to look down at people.  GG(Actually Georgie but her nickname is Gigi so I shorten it to GG): Not really a midget but still small. She comes up to my nose. I know because we were doing this thing for health and GG was the only one who remembered the exact height she was so we were all measuring against her to roughly figure out our height. (Don't ask)  Chelsea: The ex Friend. I've known her since my fourth day of prep(unfortunately) She used to be my friend, or at least I THOUGHT she was my friend. she is just a bitch. She is a tryhard. And I swear, she calls me up just to brag or tease or annoy me. Here is an example of the last conversation we had, on my birthday(7th May):  Kitty(answers the phone while pigging out on chips): Hello? Chelsea: Happy birthday! (in singsong voice that immediately tells K that she will be complaining annoyingly) K: Oh...um...thanks...(frantically tries to think of a way out of this conversation) C: (in an annoyingly accusing voice) You didn't call me earlier this week, when it was MY birthday. (by unlucky chance, b an unlucky alignment of the planets, her birthday is four days before mine. If you're realy stupud and can't figure it out, that's the third of May.) K: Oh...uh...sorry. I...got my second holes done on Sunday so I was kinda excited on Monday(her birthday this year was on monday. she called me on thursday after school) So I was kinda, you know...(whew. I did actually get my second holes :) and before she, the copybitch, did.) C: Oh. whatever. anyway, I was talking to James, and he said that he doesn't hate you. But I think I should have introduced Nicole to him instead. She's more normal. (The person that made up soemthing called the 'hairy chicken dance' is supposedly normal?)  I think you can imagine the rest of the conversation. James is some guy from her new school, I met him. He's a midget, even smaller than chelsea, who is like half my height (this is the part where i LIKE being so damn tall) Nicole is a girl from my, chelsea,s and Dana's primary school. we used to be really good friends until chelsea intervened.  Dana(the maths freak): Okay. Dana was and is my best friend. I've known her since like year 2 or something. She's chinese. And really skinny. Liek a stick. Even skinnier than me. We are best friends because I am a spelling freak and she's a maths freak. We're both above average students, we both got academic scholarships to private schools this year. We both got the hgihest scholarship our schools give. (I got a 50% she got a full because my schools really snobby with scholarships and they dont have full ones. sucky huh.) We both go to(or used to go to) saturday schools: her chinese school, me russian school. We both quit now. We're both wierd. Her nicknames are Dan(that's pronounced dahn by the way) and DNA. I call her DNA because I was playing around with name anagrams once(forgot what they're called, you know, where you mess up their names to make a new name?) And I accidently forgot the first A and so I call her DNA now, partly bcoz of that artly because she's aa maths freak. She calls me Kat. I am so happy she's stopped calling me KTY. Don't ask.
