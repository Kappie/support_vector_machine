So, it was about time! This afternoon Nick  I went up to G'ma Lu's to do laundry and eat dinner. Billy  Austin made Nick laugh like crazy! It was so cute. Then we went home for bath, bottle and bed. He's sleeping right now!!! The best part of my day today was taking a nap with Nick. We fell asleep around 9:40ish until 11:25! I love snuggling with Nick and falling asleep. Tomorrow Shawn comes home for 5 nights and 5 days. I get used to having him home on the weekends so during this 5 day stint, I know I am going to get really used to having him home and it's going to be hard when he leaves on Sunday. Kind of like starting all over with him being gone. I've finally got used to it being just Nick  I during the week.
