I got done with the exam in about a half an hour, so that made it 6:30pm.  Headed out to the Big Mall to get a birthday gift for tonight's gathering at the lake.  Then I went to the bar to meet up with Superfly.  Cam and Chica showed up.  Chica is a spitting image of  urlLink Halle Berry,  so every guy in the bar stares, and one or two will approach her.  It's funny to watch them.  They look our way, keep looking back about twenty more times, then finally get up enough nerve to come talk to her.  Some have sent their friends over to talk to her.  This is NOT what a girl wants.  At least not any of us around here.  If you cant talk to the girl, dont even bother sending your friend.  So last night, this guy, I'll call him 'Hilton Head', because thats what his shirt had on it, kept staring and playing the game of 'I'm looking at you, are you looking at me?' No, she wasnt.  Cam and I watched as he put the cue stick above him as if to stretch and tried to be cool while he walked over. Before we could warn Chica, he was there.   Asking her if she wanted to shoot pool. He walked away with nothing.  Cam and I like to people watch, him and I were in NYC people watching while Superfly and Nikki were bickering back and forth.   'We gotta get on the blue line train to get on the red line train to get to the xy path'  and so on.  Yeah, if you're from NYC and I messed up the colors of the train, Fuck Me.  It's been a few months and I have real shit going on.  I really need to take my tape recorder with me and get this all on tape sometime.  But then I think, would it even be funny in writing?  Because you sitting there reading this with nothing to alter your mind, might be like, this girl is freaking insane!  INSANE- At one point Superfly made this god awful noise, we think it was a burp, but coming from Superfly, it sounded horrible, and she gets up to go somewhere, and says 'brb' (we have this inside joke about 'lol' and 'brb' and all that other online crap) and Cam goes, "Beer Right Back Up' you mean.  Heh. yeah, not that funny right now.   Sports Report  No wins or losses from last night.  Tonight we play the cards.    Aww, no set lists either.  Sorry Av.    peace.love.dmb.   Happy Birthday to Sokie and Mo.    I survived 4 years!  Time for lunch.
