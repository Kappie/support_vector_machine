Highschool friends working in grocery stores, photographic negatives of swamps with footprints drowned in blood.  Faces of wolves with cataract eyes, a red so deep it was almost black.    I was tired, so tired that I could hardly make sense anymore.  I tried to take a nap after work.  My man and I went back to the air conditioned cavern of his apartment and tried to sleep.  My eyes wouldn't keep shut, and though I needed it badly, sleep wouldn't come.  I get turrets when I'm tired.  All the weird maggots squirming in my brain come out onto the surface.  I thought I was going to cry over nothing.  I felt like a child.  My weaknesses came into the light, too.  Insecurities and old hurts and jokes that aren't funny anymore.  I had to leave just to hide.  Today is the last day before he leaves.  He's going to Florida for two weeks, some military thing.  I hear from my roommate that he's cheated on girlfriends on these expeditions.  Men take off their wedding rings and go to strip clubs, have one-night stands and strange encounters:  Anything goes.  But I trust he won't do me like that.  Mostly I will just be missing him, hoping he is okay down there.  In the jungle.  He is so good to me.  He brought me peas yesterday, surely the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.  Better than roses, those peas.     I will have several days alone, which I think will be good.  I think part of the weirdness yesterday was that I have not been writing regularly except on this thing.
