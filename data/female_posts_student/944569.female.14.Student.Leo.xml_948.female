A person that will like me even if I can't make his (her) dreams come true.  -Chobits-  Omg, Chobits is the cutest anime in the world...I've only seen a few episodes but it's so adorable...*sniffle* I'm starting to get emotional now....*sniff*  Chobits is the romantic type of anime that's slow-paced and cute.  it mostly talks about romance, acceptance, love and relationships.  I really love it.  The story is about a guy named Motosuwa Hideki who is poor and wishes to earn a persocon (personal computer that looks like a human).  Obivously, he's too poor to buy one so one day while he's walking past a dumpster, he spots something that looks like a human.  He panics but finds out it's actually a persocon.  When he brings her back to his apartment, he pushes the on button and the persocon comes to life.  She keeps on saying the word Chii at first so it becomes her name.  Hideki tries to hook Chii up on his television so he can surf the internet but it says no data so he calls up his friends who try and fix Chii with their own persocons but all the other persocons crash after trying to fix her.  Then, his friend Minoru tells him about a legendary persocon that's called a Chobits and does not need an operator and has feelings.  he then shows Hideki a picture of a persocon excatly like Chii all covered in wires and enscribed in its leg is the word CHOBITS...dunh dunh dunh....  This is Chii.  Ain't she cute? She's my fav. character...
