Am I suppose to give up all my beliefs just because you think your in love?  Have my thoughts and emotions meant nothing to you?  You call and I become upset, why would you want me to feel like a bitch!  Why do you wish for me to feel like I've done something wrong!   I don't think I led you on I don't think I lied or said I wanted more I told you it could not  be  Why do you keep pushing for something that doesn't exist!  I told you we were friends that's all we can be,  I gave you warnings, if you kept pushing, id give you up! I'm not afraid of letting you go! But I'm afraid that I've done something wrong to make you feel for me so I keep dangling you there  You keep climbing the rope,  I'm sorry but its time for me to let the rope fall and For you to jump to another rope another person that will pull you up,  We are done you can delete my number I want you no more,  Don't call me while your drunk don't call me after you've done some drugs!  There's nothing left for me to fight for with you,  Your to stubborn to except the fact that I just don't have the same feelings for you,  I'm deleting everything so I can only hope you'll do the same Your name will not exist just leave me to my self,  As I have told you before that's only way I know!!                                                              -just another memory-                                   ~crystal~
