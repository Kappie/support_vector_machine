But I just like the way it sounds, and it just about perfectly describes the way I feel.  I had a very good night's sleep (although I was up a bit too late), but I awoke this morning from a rather strange dream to find myself nearly choking with coughs.  This was quite an inauspicous start to the day.  But hopefully it will get better from here.  I feel okay, and I haven't even had my medicine yet.  Plus, the planned trip to Wendy's for lunch is upcoming - it will be my first time out of doors in over 24 hours.  Hopefully, I won't be attacked by another sneezing fit, or I'm liable to be arrested for something - it seems just about everything is illegal in New York City nowadays.  They've already gotten rid of smoking in bars (which is really quite lovely because now, living on a street with many such establishments, I get to walk down a gauntlet of smoke every evening), so I'm sure sneezing cannot be far behind.
