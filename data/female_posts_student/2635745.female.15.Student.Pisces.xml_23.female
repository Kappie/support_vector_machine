He was being a little perverted, but then he got serious when I asked him how he was.  He looked miserable.  He had a long face and looked really tired.  He smiled when I asked him and I really sent a rush of glee through me.  He made some funny jokes, but I don't feel like telling them.  Jake was acting weird.  He thanked me for inviting him to the party and then asked me if we missed him after he left.  It is so weird, he is such a ladies man and no one knows why.  Then I spoke to Hamburger.  He still tried to mess with me and I told him how I enjoyed the conversation we had when he thought I was Chelsea and how he asked me if Liz, Morgan, and I fell for their joke, thinking that I was Chelsea.  Chelsea confessed when I told her what happened.  Ha it was funny.  She's great.  It was cool today.  Walking down the halls today I found that there was always someone at my side from class to class.  On my way to 4th I was in between both Hamburger and Ferrell.  That felt satisfying because I've always been the weirdo and to have two sophomore guys on my arms felt nice.  And I was scary, Ferrell actually did that clingy thing where you hook your arms.  He grabbed my arm.  It was a really different side of him.  Huh.  I'll leave on this note.  Until Later.
