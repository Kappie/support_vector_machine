I got enchiladas at Baja Fresh and practiced my sapnish "skils" The cutest guy ever was ther. He was like 6 feet tall. he  had gorgeous eyes.  He had curly hair!  Yay.  I kept starring at him so he looked at me funny. Then, i went to go get salsa and I spilled it all over the floor right by him. Hahha Then I spilled my silverware!  Hahhaha  It was kinda not funny in a funny way.  Then we went to prarie and I served for and hour and a half straight.  I'm getting a blister on my fingers because of the over serving.   What school should I do to next year? I totally can't decide. I'm kinda freaked out.  Cam is nice..but i don't seem to be getting much out of it.  Hockinson is beautiful and wodnerful but I would be leaving alot of people behind at cam. I can't deccide!  And I only have till may 1 to decide! YIKES!
