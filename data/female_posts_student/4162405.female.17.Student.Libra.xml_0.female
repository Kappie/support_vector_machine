Today i had a Physics SAC *groans*.....Newton doesnt just have 3 laws of motion anymore...i invented another one for him today..as per usual i forgot wat the Third law was so i couldnt answer one of the questions...so instead of leaving the space blank, i created a new one that mite try to help wit some sort of explanation....unfortunately i dont think that this "new Law" is going to get me many marks....oh well this SAC is only worth 20 out of 100 for this semesters marks so its not extremely important.      A couple of days ago we started doing this MIPs thingy at school where we looked at all the different Uni courses and stuff for next year.....they recommend that u put down like 8 preferences but at the moment im going to only put 4.....Melbourne Uni- Bachelor of Veterinary Science (ENTER=99.65), Melbourne Uni - Bachelor of Science (ENTER 81)...Monash Uni Clayton - Bachelor of Science (ENTER= 74), Monash Uni Gippsland- Bachelor of Science (ENTER= 72)...and if i dont get into any of them...that basket weaving course could be looking pretty good....i mean- it could open up a whole new world of opportunity (ummm lol i dont think so) The probability of me getting straight into the Vet course is almot like me wining the $10 million lottery-it aint gunna happen lol...neway, ill try to get ito one of the science courses and transfer over later       In other news...I played my usual Wednesday netball last nite- Yet another WIN to Primary....we r kicking ass....equal top on the ladder, down only by a few %....theres another 2-3 games left, so that means that we should be looking pretty good in the finals.    Untill next time.....mwah
