I'm very pleased to share that I will be enjoying the sunny LA weather with the pleasant company of such characters as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and if I'm lucky, none other than the adorable Piglet. If you have any messages for my kind friends let me know and I will pass them on during my visit... and note to Jody- i am so with you on the spider solitaire... definitely the way to go
