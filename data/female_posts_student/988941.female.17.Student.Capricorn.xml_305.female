It holds 18,000 and looks small but you don't realise at first that there is a second tier up above you! It was a good laugh. The stewards were trying to get a Mexican wave going, eventually they did and it was so fun. The concert itself was better than at Wembley. Maybe it was because he had some more dates under his belt I'm not sure. Maybe it was because there were more people? And that the audience was younger? But it was good. Veyr good atmosphere, everyone was up for it and jumping about. When he came on at the back of teh arena for the encore 'Pump It Up' and the whole audeinece was clapping and stuff I could just picture this track being shown somewhere like the Hard Rock Cafe. What is your job Jo? Max please blog. That is a request. A couple more and sposh, you'll be gone.
