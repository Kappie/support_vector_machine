I have my science lab today, and then I'll be in the music lab finishing up my midi project, because it's due on Monday... I just want to get it done and out of the way... and I want to get it done today, because I don't want to be in the music lab tomorrow... cause that'd suck.  Anyway, so... Steve may be coming over to our site permanently.  Yesterday was Mary's last day, and we're getting someone else on Monday to replace Greg W. (the one who left the begining of last month because of a school conflict)... anyhow... Steve may end up at our site permanently... and he's been rather giddy at the concept of that.  He was at our site on Wednesday... and he said to me, "It'd just be so cool if I came here permanently... then I could hang out with you ALL the time...!"  Hmmmm... don't know what to think of that... but if he'll be doing my closing duties (like he did on Wednesday) for me ALL the time if he comes to our site... then BRING HIM ON THE TEAM AT STEUBING!  :-)  Okay... nothing else now... but maybe later after I return from the evil UTSA 1604 campus.... ;-)
