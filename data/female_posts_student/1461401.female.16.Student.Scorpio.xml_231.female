Make it better for the both of us. But I didn't. But then, at the same time, I've had even more chances to just go and make it stop. Make it worse for both of us. Bring it all crashing down. But I didn't do that either. I just   I  Just Don't Know What To Do Right Now  so I'm just not going to do anything.
