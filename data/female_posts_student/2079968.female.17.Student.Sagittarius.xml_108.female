A very paraphrased version of yesterday: Church was awesome yesterday morning b/c it was Pentecost Sunday...good stuff :-) Very uplifting! Obviously it touched on the book of Acts, which keeps coming up daily for some reason now that I'm studying it...it's awesome!   urlLink RON  was awesome...they rocked. I bought 2 copies of their CD...good stuff. Anyone want a free one?  If you let me know how to get it to ya you're welcome to it.  Gonna rest up a little...maybe I'll put up some photos or something interesting later.  Do I say awesome too much?
