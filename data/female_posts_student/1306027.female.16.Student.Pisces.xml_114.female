Just last night I got to listen to Arturo crack up over the phone while listening to my latest voice post. I never knew I could inspire so much laughter in such a short period of time. It's really, kinda, freaking me out. Granted, I know I can make people laugh. But rarely do they ever actually get my jokes. It's like, I say something off-handly colorful and the person is usually just standing there like "What the flip?". Haha. Yea, I love my super powers of confusion. They keep me out of some really freaking weird situations.  Anyways, I was saying one thing, and then got off topic...  Back to me.  Right, well, I was thinking yesterday, while on the phone with my great friend Arturo (Ladies- he's single and almost god-like! Hahahaha...) and well, I was thinking: What would I do without some of my friends? Granted, most have them have kicked me in the head, but, what about the other ones? I never thought of myself as being reliant on other people before. I am not a conformist or anything as drastic as that. I just... hmm.. never realized how much I loved my friends before. So, this post is to basically thank my friends for being the awesome people that they are. Tabitha: I love you mannnnnnnnnn! Your like my best friend in the whole world. I hope we stay friends for a long time, and I can't wait to visit egypt with you!  Arturo: You are absolutely the greatest guy friend I have ever had. Your just so awesomely funny, smart, and drop dead sexy! (hehehehehe) O.. and how could I forget.. **almost god-like** I love you to pieces and I hope we stay friends.. for.. well.. for a very very  very  long time.  Tim: Ahaaaaaaaaa! Mr. Gusty! They call him Flipper Flipper Faster than Nothing.... lol lol.. I love making fun of John Kerry with you! Also, tim, talking on the mic is fun so long as you stay talking. Indeed-dly-doo. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! Lol.. and I mean that in the friendly terms... GASP! Stacy's Mom has got it going on!! **smilez** Mojo (heart) SJ. Lol.. gosh- we have so many inside things now it's hard to keep up.  Ritu: Dude.. dude..DUDE! Lol. We had some awesomely great times at camp last summer. And yes, we should live closer. I think almost 75% of my friends live very far away from me. It's hard.. *tear* I wish ya'll lived closer everyday. It's ok though! Cause there's always IM, Email, and yes- CELL PHONES! Lol Lol. Happy Birthday Chica! I hoped you enjoyed your prezzies.  Ricky: I promise I will come to wyandot as soon as I get the chance! O.o someone is turning 16 soon! I hope it's an awesome bday for you. Lol- did you guys like my house?? I personally think it's awesome but ya know..  Becca: My long losted sister! Thanks for finding my chinchilla, *tear* your such an awesome friend. Becca- dude, our road-trip is gonna be so awesome! We can do it on spring break.. and I can drive up there, pick you up, than we can drive all through IL, and pick up my friends, than drive through NC, and SC, pick up carmen and tim, and then we could all head to miami to party with Josh! Ahahaha- That... would be so awesome. Rebel Sheep Fo'ever. For Serious.  Carmen: I have never met anyone who could keep up with my overly-active imagination like you can. Your so awesome and then some. I love ya's like a sister and I hope I get to meet you one day. We can go skating.. or something.. lol.. NO! We can go toliet papering! hahahaha! Yes! It's a plan! I can see it now.. ski masks and citronella candles, and ketchup, and tissues. MUAHA! Yes!  Ellen: Intrinsic ability to detect mobile sugar! Lol Lol. Ellen, you are the most awesome chick I have ever met. We had some awesome times at camp and I hope I see you next summer! I will be the cool and awesome equinox student, and you will be the older and expierenced spectrum student.. Dude- we will so rule CTD. I look forward to it. Lol.  Now, if your name is not in that list above, it does not mean that I completely hate your guts, it's just that maybe we haven't talked in awhile or done anything together. If that's the case you should call me or im me asap and we shall talk and hang out. Then I will add you name to my "awesomest peoples" list.  *Sigh* Time for me to go to work... I shall post- later.
