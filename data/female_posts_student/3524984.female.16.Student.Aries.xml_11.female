The fact that I am wearing jeans, tee shirt and a sweat shirt is getting to me now. o.O  Grad is soon. :( I dont want to leave at the end of this year! No! I can't. Billy is moving this year too! :( Aww well, I'm moving he's moving. We have e-mail, and then the phone. I'll be missing him SO much. Hopefully he will get things straightened out with Joey. Nah, I they will. For sure. *whispers* They're perfect for each other!  *dies* The Heeeeeat! Ack. Ooh, I'm multi-tasking! I'm talking to Billy on the phone, writing this, chatting with various people, sending out invites to the grad party...  I have so many projects for tomorrow..*dies* Someone help me finish all this BULLSHIT! >Religions of the World> 5 to 6 pages >Jeu Questionnaire > 50 Questions  >CrossWord...dont ask. Just dont.  I'm just sitting here, waiting for something to happen...actually, I'm busy, projects and stuff...:S  I hate Alex. I hate him! I hate him! I hate him! *goes crazy* I cant believe I actually talked to him at one point. He sickens me. He got into a fight with Big Brun, and Alex *this other guy, hes a good friend...Ack! Howard!* And I ask him whats going on with that...he goes off at me, as if I had like slapped him. Gawd. Some people at school need Anger Management! He like, its none of your fucking business! get the fuck away from me...BLAH BLAH BLAH!! :( JENN! WE MISS YA! BIG TIME!! :'(  I hava no idea at all of how I am living right now. I havent eaten a "meal" for about a week. I could count on one hand all the things I've eaten from last monday...yuck. Like chocolate milk, 2 pop cicles, some cotton candy, and like half a bad of pop corn. Which I threw up on sunday - I went and drank on saturday...*read previous posts*   I ran track again today...yucky, now I know why I am NOT on the track team...HA! LOL. Gym is hell this year. Hopefully, I can get away with just NOT getting it next year. Hoo Hoo Waa! No track, no running, no PaIn!   Julie hasn't been at school for awhile...because of Jenn...*cries* THIS IS SERIOUSLY FUCKED UP! I can't live like I used to...Bah, fuck it...meh...  Problem...my social worker thinks I'm totally suicidal..or fucked up, or whateverâ„¢...He's fucked...totally! I hate him...FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU!  Mookie wants the phone bad...just so Van can call him...then after April..Those girls are SO annoying...Well, I dont mind April. Shes alright...But I hate that Van girl...*yuck*  Right now, I'm talking to Nat's boyfriend, and his friend "pat" Ugh...they're idiots. I hate them. Yet, I talk to them *it kinda makes me wonder* I mean, if you hate someone...why bother wasting your time talking to them...it's pointless...right? I dont know. I guess its just to pass time off...  RIP Jenn* :'( ~Sem
