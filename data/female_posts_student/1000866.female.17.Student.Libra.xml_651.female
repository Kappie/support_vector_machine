I kind of miss being able to talk with him and stuff. Iy's just a bummer and especially before he leaves. I kind of hoped we'd stay friends at least until he went to college.   Honestly, i don't even know how to act around him anymore. I'm just...cold to him and it makes me feel terrible whihc is why I hate talking to him now. I don't feel comfortable around him anymore. i don't even know him anymore. He's changed so much. I guess, maybe he hasn't changed so much just...i don't know, it's always this way when he;s in a relationship. I hate when things are like this because, I feel so discarded.
