Last day, I'm so happy, I only have to go back to pick stuff up. It's great. I have time to read and write and have fun. I also have time to get money for that trip thingy. I really wish Laurell K Hamilton would blog. I miss her. Beth will be happy to know that I only have two and a quarter pages left of editing to do, and I'll try and get it to her asap. I have to email people about Raven's party because if I don't they'll forget to bring me stuff on june 29th. My summer looks like this: June 21-25 working at a woman's shelter, July 14th raven's B-Day party, July 18th Cultus lake with my Kung Fu people, July like 20th I leave for Calgary (I;m not sure for how long), August 9-20 Science world helping children learn. This doesn't leave me much room to make money. But I'll try dear god I'll try.
