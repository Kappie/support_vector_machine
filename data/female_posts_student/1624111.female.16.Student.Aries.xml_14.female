We're having great fun playing scrabble...the play of the day "nad" then with an 's' added and then finally "go" added so it was "gonads".  Very ingenious.  Now we're all listening to the time warp...It's just a jump to the left,  THEN A STEP TO THE RIGHT , put your hands on your hips,  AND BRING YOUR KNEES IN TIGHT, NOW THE PELVIC THRUST, IT REALLY DRIVES YOU INSANE!!!!! LETS DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!!!!! .  That's a really good song in a really creepy movie/musical.  While trying to decide whether to watch Daria or not, My Favorite Things plays in the background.  Eh, they're all wondering what I'm writing about but I'LL NEVER TE-E-ELLLLL!!!! AHAHAHAHAH, but Amanda's gunna have to proof read it anyway and check that it's not full of lewd or inappropriate things anyway but whateva, i do what i want!  (Clevland rocks, clevland rocks, clevland rocks, clevland rocks, clevland rocks...clevland rocks OHIO)   Now there's a little aerosmith playing....ahhhh YEAH. Aerosmith is a truly great band...i mean seeing as they're still going when they should be getting hip replacements has to say something for their greatness.  No one know's what to do..."Truth or dare?" was suggested by amanda and i promptly exclaimed "Oh, I WILL!" but somehow that didn't work out.  The "Lets go outside" suggestion was quickly squashed.  I wouldn't want to anyway, i mena there are loads of bugs out there.   (Did you know if you were famous and you killed your wife, there' s no such thing as 25 to life as long as you got the cash for Cochrin")    Somehow the misquitos seem to know where my main veins are...stupid bugs, i mean get a life, "blood-sucker" isn't exactly impressive on a resume (i don't know how to make accent-ma-bobs on the computer, eh, whateva, i do what i want).  Well i'm being sucked into truth or dare and amanda keeps hitting my leg with the cord. shreky
