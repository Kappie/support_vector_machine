I know if I listen to, "my neck, my back" it will, but see...the Mary Tyler Moore song is beter to mumble sing than, "My neck, my back." So, I suppose that's best.   I went out to dinner with my family for my mom's birthday. It was nice, but now I'm extremely full. Kelly was going to take me for a drive since she got her license today!! But, I had to go to dinner so hopefully she can tomorrow.   Nothing more to say really.
