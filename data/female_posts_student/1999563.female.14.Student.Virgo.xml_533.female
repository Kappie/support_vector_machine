I woke up at 7:30 and a took a shower...then I dlow dryed my hair and now I am just being bored until it is time to go.  Today my brothers are coming home from California! Woot woot! Now Jacob can give my lectures again! YES! Whenever I say something that is not scientificaly correct he gives me this big talk about how it is wrong, it's great! I love college students.   Ta ta!
