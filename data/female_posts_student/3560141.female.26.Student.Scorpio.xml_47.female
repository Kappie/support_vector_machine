Every morning he would stretch, pretend to pull his baseball cap up and down, and pick up his hands like he was practicing his swing. He would look over his shoulder after each trial swing to see if he looked just like the poster. Little did he know that his dweeby cousin was looking over her shoulder to see if she looked anything like him. I bought a Will Clark poster, I don't even know who Will Clark is....I never used gel, but I did manage to score a Polo shirt.      Onto other topics, Parker, a social worker that is on my unit at the hospital bought all the kids dunkin' donuts today...every kind, chocolate (1), chocolate frosted (5), coconut (3), crullers (2), apple cinnamon (2), boston creme (2), and good ol' jelly filled (3)...she says before the herd gathers, grab your favorite....      I began to think out loud, ..."Chocolate is my favorite, but there's only one...there's five chocolate frosted, so maybe I should take one of those, noone would notice because there's four left over...but if I take the one chocolate, noone would fight over it, because noone would know it was even there, hey parker which is your favorite.." At this point she may as well have pulled up a couch and picked up a pen and pad to analyze my overanalytical behaviors....Without a word being spoken, I realized how I treat everything in life like this, instead of grabbing my chocolate doughnut, which I know I would enjoy, I am way too worried about being caught red handed making myself happy, without concern for the herd...the funny thing is it used to be something I would force myself to do, in order to please other people...now I think it's just conditioned behavior to overanalyze till I don't even remember what my favorite doughnut is anymore...and the fact that I'm writing about it too....a day later, yes....overanalytical...
