Technically, we're in Cambridge, since she goes to Harvard :winky:.  It's so quaint!  Very Victorian, almost.  Some of these buildings have been around since the time of our founding fathers.  Two days ago, we went to New York.  It was crazy, insane, and wonderful all at the same time.  I was a very little girl the last time I saw the Big Apple, so I only remember it when it was much dirtier.  On Friday night we saw the Phantom of the Opera (I'd actually never seen it before! :shocked:); for $20 we stood up behind those sitting in the orchestra seats, although they ended up paying $100.  The show was fantastic.  I think that I started drawing too many religious parallels, but nevertheless it was a truly amazing show, with an outstanding cast.  We stayed at the YMCA ($73 per night for 2 people--woo-hoo!)  On Saturday, I think we walked the entirity of Manhattan.  There were moments when I had to lean on Mildred's arm to prevent from collapsing due to exhaustion.  It was wonderful, though; we strolled through Central Park, shopped on 5th Avenue, and then waited for an hour and a half in line to ride to the 86th floor of the Empire State Building.  Can't say that it was truly worth the wait among hundreds of people amidst opressive heat in the basement of the building, but I am glad that I experienced it.  After that crazy excursion, we went to Bloomingdales and had a much-needed glass of wine with some fine dessert in a French restaurant that strangely resembled a street car.  Our last stop in New York was Ground Zero, which was extremely humbling (particularly after walking around in the world's most excessive mall).  It was so sad, although it probably would have been even worse had I actually remembered what the Two Towers looked like.  I still can't fathom all that empty space in the middle of New York City, with blackened and charred buildings around heaps of rubble and steal.  There was a brown cross with an American flag near where the second tower fell, and around the perimeter of the fence surrounding Ground Zero a list of everyone who died on September 11th.  I didn't want to leave, really, but we had to catch the bus back to Chinatown in Boston at 8pm.  Before I said goodbye, though, I did take a picture with a couple of very cute New York fire fighters.  Their dog did this trick where he searched for a doggie treat in an orange street cone, but not before running around aimlessly with it on its head.  So now I'm back in Boston, enjoying a day of rest after the wonderful craziness of New York.  We went shopping today in Filene's Basement (the Texas equivalent of the San Marcos outlet stores), and tomorrow we're planning on getting much-needed back massages after backpacking around New York non-stop for 2 days straight.  We wanted to go salsa dancing tomorrow night as well, but it doesn't appear as if that will pan out.  Regardless, I know we'll figure out something.  Seafood along the bay is most definitely in order.  Hello to the homies back in the Lone Star State--I'll be back Wednesday night.
