I was gonna give him five dollars, but I found out he "stole" them from me as a joke, so I didn't give them to him. That's what he gets. =P  So today I went to buy some socks, a musical shirt, and some new shoes. It's about time! I really like the musical shirt. It has all these black and white squares that have an eighth note in it, and it's the same on the front and back. It's so spiffy. The shoes that I bought are DC, and they're 7 1/2. Since they don't fit me well and they didn't have size 8, this guy ordered them, so the new shoes should be arriving next week or so. Nice.  My dad says that hopefully I'll get to order the Twelve Girls Band CD. Holy crap, that's just awesome! *-* I can't wait to order it! And best of all, it comes with a DVD! Can my dad get any better?! =P
