I DON'T KNOW WHAT -2 FEELS LIKE AND I DON'T WANT TO! Luckily I don't have to go to far but I will be in the financial district and I don't know if it's colder down there because of the water, but i DO know it gets crazy windy down there. Alright, most of you have already left for work so I shouldn't be complaining but it don't make going out there any easier..... be brave be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid
