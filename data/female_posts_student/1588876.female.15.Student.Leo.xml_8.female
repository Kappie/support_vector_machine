NAKED. well, i practically was! it's not like me to wear such provocative clothing, but my mom thought it was luau appropriate so i had to wear it. and then doug had on his grass skirt and hawaiian shirt- very nice by the way. i think it takes a very secure man to wear a skirt of any kind. i guess thats why im attracted to that hot luau guy i saw in hawaii. oh my god, i think, im going to melt just thinking about him. i have a picture of him and i somewhere. i should take it to that kodak kiosk thingy and blow up the part with just him. let me just say, i didn't photograph well when i had my short hair. well, i've gotten besides the point. the next day (saturday) was the friggin' bake sale. goddammit! we have so much left over! i gained 5 lbs. ! and now im on my period, which will make me bloated. by the way, i've decided to go anorexic for about a week to quickly lose those unattractive pounds. personally, i don't see anything wrong with it as long as it doesn't become a habit and you exercise regularly. today is the first day, and i expect to report back soon about how it's going.
