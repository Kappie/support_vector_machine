Though I do think that if Shakespeare had lived today, some of his jokes would have been censored by mothers.  hehehe.   Went to pond day yesterday at Kylan's (sp?) house.  It was really fun-o!! haha.  I dripped water inside of the house and made Kylan clean it up.  Muahahaha.  And then Kylan's mom made him go and get a little dead bird from outside so she could identify it.  It looked like it flew into the ground.  Pretty funny.  Ashley said it commited suicide 'cause his wife cheated on him.  I got laughed at alot by everyone.  *sniff* poor ol' little me.  hehehehe.  Yeah............. And we went garage saling too... got a nifty saronge (sp?).  It's Hawiaan and still had the tag on it.  Was tempted to buy another fish tank, but I figured that I already had enough.  so yeah...........  Got a sand lizard to... Named it Max Nardo (or Nerdo for short.  haha)   Then we finished Hangman's Curse.  THe end's pretty good.......  Not as good as the book, but not bad.  The book ruins it all though.  Bloom does not commit suicide.... "Dude, that's not how you throw a frizbee!!" haha better to to church now, Going down with a bang.... Jack the Mighty
