Then I talked to Tregory for a while, then I took a shower, which makes every thing better. What a shower can do to yaz? Anyways later today I'm going to the lake and watch the perty fireworks go Boom! I hope it doesn't rain, but then again it might be fun for me...to run around in the rain. Teeheehee...everybody else will be runnin' for their lives and I'll just take my sweet lil time. So anyways I think I might wanna be a counselor or something when I grow up, or a psychiatrist, cause lots of people come to me with their problems or I just like to give advice...Teeheehee...But I might wanna be a neurologist and work on the brain. Wooohooo...Lol. Well I'll be bloggin' later tonight. Teeheehee..BLOG is a cool word. Blog Blog Blog. Okay yeah I'm hyper. Laters...Cherry3
