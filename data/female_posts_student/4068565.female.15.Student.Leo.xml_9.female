And I didn't feel like letting it out on anyone cuz yeah...they might get tired of it....I really wanted to talk to Arik...but he was busy...so this is all I have. The thought of dropping out of YC is starting to grow on me. I don't know how Im gonna be able to face all these people after what they are doing to me. Why do they even care about my life? Thats my question. If all they can think of to write/talk about is me...they really must not have a life. Some people -need- to grow up. God. I really mean it. Why can't they just leave me alone. Whats done is done. What I don't get...is why Im blamed for every God Damn Thing thats going on. "oh the reason we hate each other is your fault" Bullshit. Okay....you said you tried...I tried also...and I decided....You werent the person I wanted to be friends with. My mom wouldnt let me even if I wanted to. I can see right thru people. I know whos lying...whos true...and who to love. I can make my own decisions. Its just really getting to me now....life. Its really shitty. One thing is I'd never do is kill myself. Life can and will get better...but when you feel so bad you think it never will...but it will. I've learned that already. Life goes on. So why are so many people stuck in MY past? I wish people would just live their own life...and get off of my back. Cuz okay...I get hurt easily. And being trashed hurts. Im sorry Im strong...Im emotional...soft hearted. And I haven't had the best life I coulda. Back in elementary....I remember crying myself to sleep. Do you call that a life? It sucks when you are the main target of humor. Some "populars" think its real great to make fun of you and see you cry....but until the day it happens to them...they have no idea what it feels like. *sigh* Im really gonna lose it one of these days...I don't understand. Life. How would you feel if you had no real close friends...Welcome to my life. I thought I had some....But I just keep getting turned on more and more everyday. Im ready to give up. But I wont. I have Arik. All this talk about him not keeping promises....Im not listening to.  If he just wanted sex outta me theres plenty of people I know who would glady do it....but he really cares...and I love him. No one...not one person can change what I feel...no words....no actions....nothing. So those people who are trying to make my life a living hell...its kinda working. But im not gonna let it get to me as much...as long as I can write here without getting trashed....or blamed for shit I didnt do...I will let it out here only. If only some people would spend a day in my life. I have values....unlike some people. I just wish this would end. If it doesnt....I can gareentee....Lynne, Bob, and Evie are gonna want to have a big group talk....and that'll just be messed up. We're supposed to be a family at Youth Council, all get along, and I want that to happen...but aslong as some people keep acting childish I don't see it happening....I just want this to all be good before YC. If not I may not beable to go. I want to go...to have fun...and im there for a reason...not just cuz my friends and my boyfriend are in it...well supposedly my friends....some atleast I dunno if I can trust anymore. But yeah. God called me to do this. Some people are in it just because they can be with friends at this. IM there for a reason....and I don't want these people to ruin it for me. I think I need to talk to Lynne again. She really helps me....I may just e-mail her bout everything now. I may not. I just hope everything works out. I want it to. More than probably any of you think. I just wish we could all get along like we used to. Get over this mess...and go on with life. I guess Im speaking my mind here....because all my heart says is that I love Arik more than anything and it tells me to never leave him because hes wonderful and we were meant to be. I love you Arik...I really don't know where I'd be without you. Im so glad I can talk to you about all this....you make my world....even if its a little messed up....complete. I trust you...and believe your promises. I don't listen to everyone elses bullshit.  I love you Arik.  -Tara
