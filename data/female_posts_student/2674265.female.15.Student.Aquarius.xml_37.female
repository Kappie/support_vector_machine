Flying to Czech Republic and back home to Houston would cost me 1,185 dollars and once I got to Prague it would cost me 300 Euro to rent a car for the five days I would spend there.  	I choose my attractions by interest 	To travel to Prague, Czech Republic from Houston it cost me 1,183 dollars. Once I got here I spent 314 Euro to rent a compact car for five days. I spent Ten dollars and seventy-five cents on a reference dictionary for translating their language. For attractions I spent all together sixteen and five Euro (I don’t know how to read their money). My hotel with free breakfast (probably paid for in price for hotel) cost me 300 euro. The total cost for my meals was 172.5 Euro. I spent 175 dollars on souvenirs for my dad, mother, Granny Iva, Nana, Doggy Oggy, Erica, and Me! Plus an extra fifteen dollars a day turns up to be seventy-five. If you leave the Euros, Euros and turned the dollars into Euros then I would have spent 2900.68 Euros. Turn that into dollars and its 3563.49 dollars which means I have 2436.51 dollars left. I have enough money to replace my computer, or maybe ill get a digital paint set.     	4/25/04 	Today I packed my things to leave for a five day trip to Czech Republic. In my suitcase you will find. A lot of warm clothes. Jeans, long sleeve shirts, tons of socks, underclothing, tennis shoes, Tylenol, tooth paste and brush, hair brush, shampoo, deodorant, and my fuzzy blanket. I started packing early so I could make it to the airport on time. My friend, Erica, and my dad drove me to Houston. We made it there just in time for me to put on my luggage and get on the plane at 5:40 p.m. they served us supper and I slept a good was their as well as read. The flight landed at 10:25 a.m. and I got my luggage and went and picked up my car which I could have gotten at 9 a.m. if I had been there. I put my stuff into my compact car and drove to my hotel. There I checked in and went to my room. I settled in. I decided to set out for lunch and found the most pleasant restraunt. I went back to the hotel and rested for a little while and realized that out the widow there was the most magnificent view of the city. I took a shower and changed into some nicer clothes. Went to eat again and then went to a Black Light Theater.  I got back to the hotel room at about 10 or 10:30 and went to sleep. Overall today went quite well. I was amazed at the city and the beauty of the architecture but the Black Light Theater was not all that I had hoped.              Oh by the way, I traveled eleven hours and forty-five minuets in air not to mention after that. WOW! 	 	4/26/04 	Today I am to travel to Plzen. Its about a thirty minuet drive. I have already ate my breakfast and am about to get on the road. I should get there in time to do some shopping before lunch.  I figure ill get something for my dad, Doggy Oggy , Granny Iva, Erica, and Mother. That’s about one hundred dollars. After shopping ill get lunch and then go to the Monastery. I’ve heard about them and always thought it sounded neat so I am going to see one today. I amagine that I will be there a good deal of the day. Ill drive another probably thirty-five minuets(longer since its dark). I will get back to the hotel about eight thirty, took a shower and went to bed.  	Did I mention that it has been raining for the past two days. Grrrrr.... Yeah. Bummer.  	 	4/27/04 	Alright. The third day here and its still poring rain(reason for tons of socks). I skipped breakfast and left the hotel early because the weather and the drive which was an hour and thirty minuets. I am going to Brno today. Here there is some kind of cemetery that for some reason is special (Honestly, I just went for the name. Brno. Its great. That is what im going to name my next dog). Any ways, ten bucks to go see a cemetery! Can you say crazy! I can, and I have a friend who can say it in thirteen different languages. Five are computer languages. It wasn’t so bad thought. Its not like I’ve spent tons of money anywhere else. So yeah after the Cemetery my feet were soaking wet. That’s why I brought three extra pair of socks. And people call women crazy for over packing. I had an umbrella I bought after I got there so the rest of me was pretty dry. So yeah I went and ate lunch and then went shopping. I got something for my Nana. Also I remembered I had not gotten myself anything, therefor I did. I drove back to the hotel yet again, and fell to bed with no shower completely exhausted.   	4/28/04 	Today is the last day I will get to do anything. I wake up and cant remember anything past when I walked into the hotel lobby. I took a cold shower to get myself fully functional and went downstairs to have breakfast. Still not fully awake I go upstairs and back to bed. I wake up at noon and go out for lunch after fixing my hair. Then I make my way to The Museum of Decorative Arts.  I honestly cant say why I choose here except.........well it might have had something to do with that really hot guy in my English class who came here last year and suggested it. But really you never know. I spent hours here, until supper at least and went to eat yet again. Then I decided standing in one of the rooms there that I would go out and drive around the town if the weather cleared up( the hot guy said it was the best part). And ya know you wont believe it but I got to go. It was the nicest evening I had there and the building were beautiful. I don’t know if I would go back but im certainly glad I went.  	4/29/04 	So today is my last day here. I eat breakfast at the hotel, pack my bags, and go to the airport. I get on the plane and sit there for thirteen hours and twenty-five minuets, plus the three hour drive home. I dread it. I mean I love to travel but this is just to much. I figured it out on the plane and I will be coming home with 2,436.51 dollars left. I could buy a computer, except I have one already. I finished reading the book that I started at the beginning of the trip.   	4/30/04 	Alright. So I know your saying, hey that was five days but part of the journey of any trip is homecoming. And seeing that I got back yesterday at 1:40 in the evening and sleep. I met up with everyone today and told them how it went. I gave everyone their gifts I brought back ( the real adventure is seeing if I can make it thought my Nana reunion even though I don’t see her much anyways. She tells me about her traveling experiences that I have heard about a trillion times. I struggle to get away and finally do with the excuse that erica is coming over. I call her and she does. So good to be home, and to sleep on my own couch( I have no clue why I do this. I have a bed and a futon and I sleep on the couch). Well that was my trip. It was fun, but im glad its over. Ill finish unpacking in about a month and then have to go somewhere else. Oh well. Latterness.
