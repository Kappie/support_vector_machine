Paul - If you wanna argue about it, then we will arrange to meet up some time and i will quiet happily go into it further. Crispy - i put on 3 pound, and my dad put on 4! Today i went to work on some lights at AMF, i have just finished typing their invoice which (i cant say the amount online) but i have made a 3 digit figure, lump sum out of my work there, and i am very happy. After i finished there i went to waynes and spent some time with him, fixed a computer came home, typed stuff for AMF. Looking forward to school which starts in 8 hours from now!!! Brilliant stuff. Talk to you all soon. Dave
