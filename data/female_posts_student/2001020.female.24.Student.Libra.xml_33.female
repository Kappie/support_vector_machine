Nor did he return my phone calls, or my friend T's phone calls. I can't believe that I dumped him but I am the one getting dumped in the end. No rest for the weary, I suppose. I thought he didn't want to date anyone exclusively...so what is this regularity going on between them since last Friday? What is this about him liking me so much and him not wanting to be the "guy that hurts people"? He told me that he wasn't sure about dating altogether, yet he's fucking that potbellied bitch? Why is it that I always, always, ALWAYS get the fucking shaft? Okay, so maybe E's not the guy for me...what about our friendship? What about everything we had that existed a week ago? Did he forget? I feel like it's been months since we stopped talking, with the way he's acting, like nothing else matters and it's all done and forgotten. Why do I always find myself in situations with schmucky fucking assholes like this? Why did he do this to me? What about our friendship? What about everything that mattered only seven fucking days ago? What about all that?
