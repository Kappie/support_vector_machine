Sometimes I tried to be funny because my teacher has corny humor--well not corny, just her own bizarre  humor--with the intention that I'd land some extra points.  Let me know what you think.  Megan Reuter Mrs. Walker Ethics (1) 4/28/04  		Without a sense of caring, there can be no sense of community 		-Anthony J. D'Angelo    	In order to build a sense of care and compassion in my community, I volunteered at O'Connor Hospital.  Every Saturday morning--when I would usually still be snoring--I put on my Candy Striper uniform and drove down the road to the hospital.  I must admit that in those lethargic morning hours, most of the time I did not want to be going to volunteer.  I would rather be at my ballet technique class or teaching toddlers the art of dance.  Instead, I willingly made a sacrifice to give back to all my community has given to me.  My way of giving back was working in an environment with people I do not normally associate with.    	Upon arrival at the hospital, I slowly trekked my way through the sinuous hallways.  The hallways were always cold, with a slight smell of Neosporin.  Every time I hiked to my destination, thoughts inundated my mind such as, how could someone ill possibly recover in such a sullen environment or why don't they paint the walls a bright, healthy color?   These rhetorical questions were only designed to occupy my half-asleep brain until I arrived at the Mail Room.    	Only God knows why they named this room the Mail Room because there was no mail inside.  This was the lowly volunteer hub, an incommodious room, even more frigid than the hallways.  The room was dressed with cement walls and floors, a ghetto stereo that always played Hispanic music, and recycled office chairs for volunteers to sit in.  The only pleasant element of this room was that it had all the latest issues of InStyle, People, and Cosmopolitan magazines.      	So, the basic routine went like this: the phone rang, the adult employee answered it and wrote down the request, and the student volunteer carried out the assignment.  The only trouble came when there were three or more volunteers; for example, let's say their names were Megan, Hilda, and Rupert.  The adult volunteer would say he had an assignment to be carried out.  All three of the volunteers' eyes would rise from their magazines and look at one another, telepathically sending messages like, I already went, it's your turn or there's no way I'm getting up again.  One of them, let's say Megan, graciously accepts the task and performs it with compassion.    	A volunteer could be given a myriad of tasks to execute.  The most common would be to deliver supplies to different wings of the hospital.  These supplies ranged in variety from surgical gowns to urine catheters, and would travel to different sections such as the Emergency Room or Labor and Delivery.  Those kind of jobs required superior knowledge of the hospital's layout, which came each week with trial and error.   Another example of a task that would be asked of a volunteer would be to take blood and urine samples to the lab for analysis.   These samples could be the difference between life and death for many patients, especially in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  If a volunteer was called to retrieve a sample from the ICU, he or she could not spend time dawdling, looking at the old lady volunteers' pictures on the wall that have been volunteering at the hospital for half a century, rather, he or she would have to speedily give the samples to the lab.  Quickness was important with these samples because most patients in the ICU are near death, and results are needed promptly.  It was nerve racking to me that I was holding a person's fate in my own hands, so I took the job seriously, only stopping to look at the pictures after I dropped off the sample.             The last example of a task--a personal favorite of mine--would be discharging the patients downstairs and wheeling them outside to get in their cars and go home.  My favorite patients were the mothers and newborns because they looked so thrilled to be alive to celebrate their lives together; moreover, the babies were awfully cute.  They just looked so inspired by the world, full of new promises and hopes.              However, I did also enjoy discharging the elderly patients, except on one occasion.  This old Mexican lady must have weighed near 400 pounds because it was near impossible to get her into a wheelchair.  Her daughter was with her to take her home.  After a few attempts to get her comfortable in the wheelchair without further impairing her broken leg, we set off to go downstairs.  The antiquated wheelchair squealed across the linoleum of the lobby and rotated out the revolving door.  Trying to get her out of the wheelchair was the worst because the footrests did not return to their idle position.  Her daughter impatiently yelled at me, "Don't you know what the hell you're doing?"  Even in the midst of frustration with the impossible equipment and the ignorant woman, I kept my cool.  Although, needless to say, it was one of the more unpleasant experiences I went through at the hospital.           In conclusion, I think I would never work there again, but I do value the lessons I learned while I was there.  I learned to live up to my commitments, even though it would have been easier to quit; but most of all, I learned that patience really is a virtue.
