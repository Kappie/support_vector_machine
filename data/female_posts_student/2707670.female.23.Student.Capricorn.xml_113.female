I am going to tech in like three days. Can't wait for the wine and cheese party. Its gonna be a blast!!! 3. Done with finals for a couple of months. I don't know how well I did but I am done and that's all that matters. 4. Lesbians and black guys. Wow what a night. We tried out a new townie bar and had a ton of fun. Kareoke with professors and dancing the night away. I don't think we could have had a better time.
