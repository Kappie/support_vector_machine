Shyamalan Talks Buried Secret (http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2004-07/20/10.15.sfc)  Director M. Night Shyamalan told SCI FI Wire that he admires SCI FI Channel for the controversial way it promoted the original special The Buried Secret of M. Night Shyamalan. "Those guys are awesome," Shyamalan said in an interview while promoting his upcoming film The Village. "Those guys are awesome at SCI FI Channel. They're really kind of ballsy, creative people. I really dig them."  SCI FI admitted on July 16 that it created a story that was part fact and part fiction as a way to publicize the documentary, which premiered July 18, and that it did not have a falling out with the director, as previously reported in the media and on SCI FI Wire (June 16, July 7 and July 8).  Shyamalan said SCI FI should be forgiven for the hoax. "If they erred, they did it out of enthusiasm for the project," he said. "But they're really cool people. You know how, in basketball, there are those 'hustle errors.' The coach always loves that. It's cool."
