And I have almost an entire day of it tomorrow, followed by two free days (what we call a weekend) before I return for the actual week of VBS. Today, I had the privilege of moving trees, sticking old, artificial Christmas tree branches into holes beneath the stage, mounting 54 pieces of green crepe paper onto the ceiling, writing the names of all 90 kids on gold/silver stars, and hanging fishies. (Yes, Ash, we hung the fishies today! You'll love them! And yes, they were tripped over... several times. Oops...)  Nothing else to say. Bored as all get out, but that's the way it is for most of us, I'd say. OH! How could I forget the fact that I broke an Ayu CD while trying to get over my parents' crap in the garage? I may be thin, but there are some instances when squeezing over - and not through - is the best way out, even if it means having to import another CD. :(  "Get up off your knees! You're too young for that..."
