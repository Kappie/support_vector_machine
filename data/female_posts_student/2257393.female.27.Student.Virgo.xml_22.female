MS doesn't pass.  and when that MS diagnosis finally came, i felt destroyed and betrayed and damned.  but, the more i've learned about it, the better i've felt.  and as i said in that e-mail i sent out to friends today, knowing that this is a disease that has a lot of ambiguity in how it affects different people, it does me no good to live any other way than as if i'm going to be fully functional for a long time.    i'm reading this book called _One L_ by scott turow.  it's a terribly mainstream book to read for the soon-to-be law student, but i'm reading it out of curiosity and the need to read something relevant to my life that isn't about MS.  it's about turow's first year at harvard law school in the 70s, and it makes the experience out to be almost physically painful--12 hours a day of studying, upped to 20 hours a day during exam time; cutthroat classmates; pretentious professors; never seeing non-law school significant others.  now, i'm not going to harvard law school...on purpose.  i don't want that kind of environment.  but i'm excited about the school i've chosen and i'm excited about immersing myself in being a law student.  and even if it gets even remotely close to what turow has described, i can't imagine it being any worse than what i've just gone through.  so, pitt law, bring it.  piece of cake.
