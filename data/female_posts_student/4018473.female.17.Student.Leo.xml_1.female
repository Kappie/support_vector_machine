Isnt that great! *blah* Well, I'm not insane or anything... but Nick and I used to talk about how I do everything for other people. From people like Jessie tohim... but yeah. I dunno, I feel so bad if I dont wanna go shopping with Jessie and tell her to f*ck off. Man, I hate her, but like, because I feel bad about telling her to go away so I end up going and being her "best friend" and I'm sick of acting! I mean,I like it when people tell me shit, like their problems and stuff cos it let me know that poeple kinda trust me. And everyone needs someone to talk to. So yeah, I like being that someone because I know people are letting their thoughts out and stuff.   But I dontlike itcos I'm so sick of trying to handle everything and last time I didnt help someone when they were uspet they killed themself and left me phone calls and crap just before they did it.   Like, if theres something I wanna do   and something Ramona wants to do (that I really dont wanna do) I'll end up going with Ramona maybe its cos I know shes upset and wants to talk and I wanna be that someone there for them. I act happy, and smile, and act all intrested in their lives and everything but inside I'm screaming... I just want out... I wanna be free fromit.   I dont know what to do anymore, be a slefish bitch and start to do stuff I want to do. Or just be the person who people come to for comfort. Thats the thing, I like the sound of the second one. It sounds so nicer... besides all the things I like to do are way too expensive- flying / sky diving / racing / travelling the world / etc. So, till I get a steady gob and alot of money I'll be the person here for others. The person who comforts... The person to turn to when theres no one else around... etc
