But it is a known fact that there are plenty of us out there to share our stories with all of you. It is a hard job and one that is often taken for granted. The military spouse has to maintain a household, and care for the family that was left behind while their loved one devotes their life to serving their country and fighting to keep the U.S. a free and safe place to live.   I have no children to care for, but I do have myself and because of the dish that God served me, was forced to change my way of life. I had to revert to where I was before I moved out of my mom’s house to live the life I had known for the last 2 ½ years but this time I am a wife with no husband. It’s a strange feeling to be some ones wife but not have them there. People tell me that I should have expected this whole thing, but I tell them they are very wrong in saying that to me. My husband was not always an Active Duty Soldier. His ARMY career was something he did one weekend a month, two weeks a year. It was like a school that he attended part-time where he learned new skills to help him in life like discipline, loyalty, strength, perseverance, and technical understanding. When he would go away for A.T., he would be gone for 3 months or so, and I was ok with that. I missed him a lot while he was away, but I knew that at the end of the 3 months he would be coming home to me and everything would be just as it was. Jesse never let the ARMY change him as a person. He would pick up habits and sometimes I would catch them shinning through, but I always told him to turn off soldier mode and that I wanted to talk to my Jesse now and no matter what the Jesse I have grown to love would always be there for me.   So it was my choice to pack up our life and tuck it away in a cozy 9 ½ x 10 x 9 ft storage unit and move back in with my mom, back into my childhood room, and make best of what God had given me. One of my favorite saying is,  When life gives you lemons, make lemonade  so that is what I am doing. I have taken this time away from Jesse to concentrate on the things I have always loved doing. I am drawing again, I am enjoying crafts, being with my family and even though life offers me downs, I try to make the best of what I have because I am fortunate to have my Husband on the other side of the Iraqi border, to have him safe in Kuwait. Where he can here echoes of bombs, and gunfire off in the horizon.   Sometimes life throws you rotten lemons and all you can do is toss them aside and keep on picking up the ones that would make the best lemonade and that what I have been trying to do. I am going to attend my first full semester of school in August and I know that it will be quite a challenge but I am not going to let the lemons get in my way of taking this time apart to grow as a person and to work on the parts of me that I feel need to be fixed (my self esteem).   I guess its good for me that I love Lemonade!
