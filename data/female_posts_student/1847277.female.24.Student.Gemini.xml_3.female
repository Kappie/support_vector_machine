But it is cool to see what people are up to, even if only in a marginal way.  I've spent the majority of my time trying to find a new laptop.  I think I'm going to end up coughing up way more money than I originally planned.  Dell now sucks, as they redesigned their laptops so that the hard drive is directly underneath the left palm rest.  So if you have anything over a 20 GB drive, the palm rest will always be uncomfortably hot to the touch.  Right now I'm thinking about getting an Alienware, which would certainly draw attention, but would set me back something like $2150.  Ouch.  That's about $500 more than I spent on the Dell that I ended up sending back.  But it would be wicked souped up, so I shouldn't be pining after a new machine for a long time.  And given how much time I spend on the computer each day, both for work and for play, I guess that isn't THAT much money.    So I met with Liz today to talk about her experiences in India.  Sounds like it's going to be a good time.  Of course, it also sounds like I'll probably spend at least a week or two being seriously ill.  Which also happened in Peru, so, whatever, I can deal.  I hope.  Although I do remember honestly wanting to die for a couple of those days in Moquegua.  One reason to work in a first world country, I suppose.  Less chances of death from weird things in the food/water.  But it just seems less exciting to be an archaeologists working in Germany than one who works in India or Peru or West Africa.  I'm determined to find a way to do some work in Africa in the next year.  Then I'll have fulfilled my goal of 5 digs on 5 continents.   Wazoo.    Okay, time to move from the computer to the TV for a half an hour of Yu-gi-oh fun.  Wheeeee.
