It's a wonder i haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet i cling to them because i still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.  It's utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering, and death. i see the world slowly being transformed into a wilderness. i hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, i feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when i look up at the sky, i somehow feel everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too will end, and peace amd tranquility will return once more.                      -Anne Frank, in her diary, July 15th, 1944  It's amazing how this was written so very long ago, yet somehow, people can still relate to her thoughts.  i don't know, i guess that's how i feel right now, pretty hopeless. i don't know why this sudden turn for the worse. i'm struggling to keep happy...i just don't know anymore. i'm hoping with the new school year, things will settle down.  Sometimes it's a flash flood. Other times it comes on like a slow-building rainstorm, the kind that gives You enough warning you might even have time to get inside before the clouds burst. Once it starts, there it nothing You can do but let the sorrow pound You like the most powerful current, the strongest waterfall. When the sorrow hits, small losses come crashing over You in one suffocating torrent.  i'm trying so hard to keep from feeling like this. It's as if i've fallen overboard and spend so much time working at getting back in, when i finally manage to pull myself back into the boat, it turns out that the boat has a giant leak.  :( michelle
