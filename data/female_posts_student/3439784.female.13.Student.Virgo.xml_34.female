You have to work out whether your roots are become so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part." -captain corellis mandolin   "if you never take it seriously, then you never get hurt. if you never get hurt then you always have fun, and if you ever get lonely you can just go to the record store and visit your friends"-almost famous  "I don't scratch my head unless it itches and I don't dance unless I hear some music. I will not be intimidated. That's just the way it is"-remember the titans  "Crazy isn't being broken or swallowing a dark secret. It's you or me amplified. If you ever told a lie and enjoyed it. If you ever wished you could be a child forever"- girl interupted   anyway im tired of looking for quotes now. haha i suck. and im also a loser because its 1:23 a.m. and im sitting on the computer when is hould be sound asleep.   for the record...   remember the titans   and   the notebook are   the  WICKEDEST  movies ever. 10/10 for both of them. i suggest you see BOTH!  .chels.
