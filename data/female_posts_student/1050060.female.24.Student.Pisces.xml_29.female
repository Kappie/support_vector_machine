Everyone needs to take it easy. I just need to relax. I dropped out of one of my classes today. So school will not be so stressful. I talked to my mom yesterday and we did a lot of talking. I got a lot of my feeling out. Which felt so good. My brother has a girlfriend now. Which is kind of weird. I always though of him as a little kid. But his growing up. Well thats all for today. Have a good day!
