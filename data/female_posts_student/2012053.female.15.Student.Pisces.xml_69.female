Koh Santopheap newspaper said the pair were subjected to the unorthodox interrogation after being arrested on Sunday night on suspicion of stealing five bags of soap powder from a car parked in the impoverished southeast Asian nation's capital.   However, top Cambodian policeman Yim Simony denied any official wrong doing.   "They were hungry and annoyed and they refused to answer our questions," he told Thursday's edition of the Cambodia Daily. "But after they ate the bananas, they answered the questions."
