Run back upstairs and mindlessly irritate my friends over the instant messenger all the while praying  someone  could possibly break up the monotiny of lol, hehe's and all that other filler garbage that works for conversation. Eventually I tire of everyone's happy moods and skip (I don't think it is possible for me to walk if I wanted to) down the hall and pull out my flute. It shreaks and moans as I'm not in a good mood and am not being careful about how I play the notes. It comes out more as a peacock hollering than anything that could be remotely called music. Giving up with complete exasperation I go downstairs and open the somewhat creaky hinges of Mama's upright piano. I go through a few songs yelling at myself for the fact that I can't seem to focus on anything and, once again, my music is not sounding like music at all, but rather a coyote that got stuck in a trash compactor. I use that phrase so often that I wonder if anyone has ever heard a coyote stuck in a trash compactor, and if so how the poor animal got stuck in it. Giving up on doing anything constructive I slather sunscreen on my olive colored skin, grab a book, hat, sunglasses and water, and bounce down to the basement and outside to soak myself in sun and read. Being extremely sick after a wet and altogether dreary weathered camp and having gotten stuck on antibiotics, therefore not having tanned for three weeks, I am extremely happy to put some of those irritating things refered to as tan lines on my skin. I flip to my marked spot in "Little Woman and Good Wives" and start reading. I read through Amy going abroad until Beth is getting so sick that everyone knows she is going to die and then put the book down. I hate reading the part where she dies. People shouldn't die in life. It ruins the perfection that has been placed on earth. But of course, we humans had to mess that up and go and eat an apple. And if Eve hadn't done it you would have, so stop making me preach. After an hour of 95 degree weather I can't take anymore. I convince my sister to come in from the pool so I don't have to watch her anymore and mosey up to my room again where I bury myself in the latest story I'm concocting. That doesn't last long because no matter what anyone says, the only time imagination flows properly is at night when your dreams can get big and you can reach for the moon.  I think perhaps I reach for the moon too much. But, as Audrey Hepburn in "Sabrina" says, "Oh no father, the moon is reaching for me." So perhaps dreams do reach for us and we just pick them up as we go along and never think twice about claiming to have found them.  If perhaps life were simpler I might have the lesiure to write all day and not have to worry about being called away. However, right now life calls once again, and I must go on and live life like it was never meant to be lived. The American way - to rush on with life never stopping to smell the roses and then decide they are so delicious you simply must stay and sketch them.
