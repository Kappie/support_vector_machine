But here's what I told her (in case some day I'm old and senile and don't remember how I do this):  My stew changes every time I make it, depending on what we have --   But here's what I did Sunday night.   Sauteed a chopped onion in some olive oil, added some sliced carrots and diced potato, let them saute for a bit.  Added a big can of stewed tomatoes (I would normally add diced tomatoes, but didn't have any) and their juice, added some veggie bouillon cubes, and some water.  A can of corn, a can of blackeyed peas.  Let that simmer for a while, added some thyme, oregano, celery seed, and a bay leaf.   Once everything is all stew-y, I added about two tablespoons of flour to thicken it.  Then I mixed up a package of pre-packaged biscuit mix (the one I used was cheddar and garlic), added a little extra cheddar, and spooned it on top of the stew.  Let those cook for a bit, and ate it.   Nothing major, nothing complicated.  If I were adding chicken or something, I'd do it right after the onions.   So there, for posterity's sake.
