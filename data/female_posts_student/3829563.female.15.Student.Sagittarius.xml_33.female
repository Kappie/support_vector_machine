AHHHH which is fine i suppose. more time to be with myself. joy.   going to see a musical today. thats gonna be fun. this week is gonna be so boring i dont even wanna think about it. well i guess im just gonna have to drown myself in diabetic recipes. oh did i not mention my summer job? well its not really a job, im not exactly getting paid, which is really the whole point in a job but anyway, i have to make a recipe book for diabetic people.. well ok fine it is pretty cool in some ways, but, no. well its actually not that bad. maybe i should go skating. why didnt i think of that? god, sometimes i confuse myself. im really missing school, which is probably one of the saddest things ive said this whole year but i really do. going to get some ice cream, mmmmm... ice cream.  adios
