       
      Okay, so I had a little change of plans this weekend.  Today I will take my long trek out to school in the hopes of getting some productive reading done.  I will be leaving my lonely computer behind, so chances are I will actually be able to get things done without the lure of the internet at my fingertips.  Expect an update tonight when I get home as to the level of my progress.  It's really starting to get scary now, when I think about the growing mountain of things I have to get done, so hopefully that scared feeling will stay with me and motivate me to be productive.  It hasn't failed me before.
