I really wanted to go to there concert on June 2 but since I am not very smart I forget to buy tickets and they are sold out..I have get one on ebay for 20 bucks but my mom would never let me go to some concert by myself. I CAN'T WAIT TILL I AM OLD!!!!!!  But the concert tonight would be so freaking scary is I went. The band there is called like Zao or something and they are some super hardcore christian rock band. Hahha. SCARY. He never does anything but go "AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH" Hahaha. I wonder if he ever looses his voice. That would really suck to be in concert and not be able to talk. Haha. Well I guess he never talks anyways so it wouldn't make much of a difference. he just yells and screams. Haha.  My brother andhis friends are searchign for ear plugs. Good idea. ;)  Not they are doing a demostration of what to do in amosh pit situation. Hahaha. I can't think of much to sayy sayyy sayyyy. So I will go awaaayyyyyyyy. Maybe.
