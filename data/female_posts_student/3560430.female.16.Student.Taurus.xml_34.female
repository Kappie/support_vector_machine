At the moment my mother is watching a sappy show about a kid who just wants to cook but whos father wants him to play base ball! GASP cooking isn't for boys (rolls eyes in a sarcastic manner!). Ever wonder how a cat knows exactly where you're looking when you're readin? My cats really good at it. I can be reading the sunday funnies  and there he'll be on the exact comic strip my eyes are on, it creepy. I swear he reads my mind!
