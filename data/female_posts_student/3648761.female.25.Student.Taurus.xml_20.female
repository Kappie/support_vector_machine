And of course we brought out the beer, and booze. Between me and her we went throught a twelve pack and a couple drinks of brandy and coke. We really missed each other, we were up talking about everything we've missed in each others lives in the last year. I am at work today woke up at 7:45 and made it to work on time I am a little out of it, and having trouble consintrating, but at least I can go home and catch some zzzzzz. Christine has to go to a wedding tonight she has a couple more days of drinking, i guess that is ok when you are on vacation. I will post some pictures of my friend Christine and her sister Katie. Her boyfriend Dario, is alright looking, but she seems different around him. I will know more, when I get to know him this weekend. Good Luck to Shannon!, Your mom is on my mind. And see you at Italien Fest Angela!
