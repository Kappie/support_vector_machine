Then when I was seven, we moved again, this time to New York.  I am a self-appointed author. I have written two full-length novels and I'm currently working on my third and fourth together. These first three are all part of the same series. I write mainly fantasy. I may post my novels here in the future. I do my writing on my laptop, which is an out-dated model my dad's company bought for him in the mid-1990's.  blech . however, it recently crashed, and though I was able to get it running again, it is on it's last legs. I will replace it very soon with money paid to me for good exam grades. DUDE I'M GETTING A DELL!  I adore horses. They are my life :). I ride once every two weeks at a small privately owned stable. I do not have my own horse, and instead ride a paint gelding named Okie. I ride English, and hope to one day have a career involving horses --- maybe breeding. My favorite breed of horse is Arabian, but for a beginner rider like me, I am more suited to the temperament of a Quarter Horse. One day I may lease one of the latter.
