Alex Skelly is gay, he broke up with Tarah because hes "worried" about what to say to her, what a moron, yeah i'm pretty sure he used that excuse on Jenna and probably every other girl hes gone out with. Grrr... yeah but she can do much better neways, like he said to her "i dont know why you even like me, i have 4 friends and all i do is play video games" ... what a dork. but anyways.                I'm so tired... Friday i worked all night then Saturday i worked all day then i was supposed to go to All-Stars for baseball after work but it was cancelled because it was raining. Which is really weird cuz my aunt lives upby the park(across town) and she saidit was liekhailing andShear park was like a lake and my coach said that too, and atmy new house it was POURING (which is right over by steele street. Yet at my houseliterally 2 min drive from my new house, there was not 1 DROP of rain... it was CRAZY!! So since baseball was cancelled i went over to the new houe pretty much right after workand painted my room PINK, i didnt get home till like 10, then i had to wake up Sunday morning to work, then go to the movies... then tomorrow me and tarah are going to go to the mallif i get my paycheck tomorrow... which i better because i NEED it. I have like less then $1 in my bank...                Ohh good news... Me and Troy are goin camping from July 26th till then 29th... We have to b home when our house closes on July 30th :-( ... I wish we could go up longer, i want to spend alot of time with him because we dont hang out as much anymore and it stinks... probably just because i'm working ALOT now, which meansi'm making ALOT of money! wee... But when we go camping, at killbear... we can go like swimming, dingy boating (lol), rock jumping, have fires, so many things, im sooo excited! i wish i was going tomorrow! woo i love him :) ...                His mom always tells me stories about Sarah (his sister) and Ian... and she says advice that she gives to Sarah, and wow does it ever relate to me and troy and i want to say " wow that reminds me so much of what troys doing"but his mom doesnt know that me and troy are more then friends (no matter what troy says )lol fooling around isnt what "friends" do, haha... troy used to say we were seeing eachother until about a week or so ago we got in a fight so were not anymore yet we've stillfooled around, yeah itdoesnt make sense to me either...but so much of the advice his momgives relates to me and troyexcept me and troy went out for alot longer so its much more harder for me to actually take the advice and go thru with it... i dont think i could do it.                Me and Troy went to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight, its a pretty good movie, like the concept andinformation is really interesting, just the way they presented it sometimes was a little boring... Ha Bush told Michael Moore togo get a real job though... poor Michael. But dontworry, Michael made fun ofBush ALOT!!!Bowling for Columbine is somuch better though! I love that movie...                I'm really bored... Troy told me he was going to come on MSN when he got to Mike and Kyles, but he still hasnt came on and that was like 2 hours ago, so bleh this succcckkss... I'm really bored, i'll probably end up doing a bunch of quizes and posting them haha...                But i'm off to get started on some quizzes!        Stay Classy! (hehe i love anchorman)
