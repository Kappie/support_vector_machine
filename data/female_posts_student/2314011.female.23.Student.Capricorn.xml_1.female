If the weather's going to be as joyous as last weekend, I think I'll zoom through Boise instead.  Not too excited about dealing with the remaining 300 miles of two-way highway, but you just never know.    So the big dinner went off without a hitch.  Grandpa and Grandma were wandering around, going through the motions and everyone there tried (pretty successfully) not to talk about the big boulder sitting in the middle of the room.    "We don't own this house anymore!" / "I sure am going to miss this house."  Were pretty much Grandpa's conversation pieces all evening.  Still can't shake the feeling that this whole "new house" business is the beginning of what we (the fam) gets to look forward to for many years to come.  They'll pack all of their boxes of shit into a house a fraction of the size the one they've lived in for 44 years, move it around, get organized and it won't be home.  Sigh.  Went to Burley today to spend the biggest shopping day of the year with Mom's mom--Grandma Leah.  She used to not be my favorite Grandma for a while, but now she's a riot.  Very much a little old lady on a farm in the middle of nowhere who, when venturing out to get her paper/mail, will run back behind her bushes if she hears a car coming down the road.  She hates cats and has about 5, 3 of which come around regularly.  She won't see "The Green Mile" because it has a mouse in it.  We cruised the Twin Falls mall, prowling for bargains.  She walked with her arm through mine; it was adorable.    Had beers tonight at my cousin Rob's and his incredible wife Trish's new house.  You think MY house is a mountain fortress, honey...jeeeezzz!  Talk about a party!  Just on our way home when said incredible wife started dishing about her in-laws (Dad's brother, my aunt and uncle).  I love talking to kick ass family members about the shitty ones behind their backs.  Good times.  Then her youngest daughter quit breathing, turned blue and we left.    Now all packed up and not at all ready to drive back.  One week of school before the big push.  Not really worried too much, just trying to convince myself I really am prepared.    Then it'll be time to do it all over again, only this time we'll call it "Christmas."  How does Seattle sound, hon?  I know someone we can stay with.
