Here's what I got:  Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare All Quiet on the Western Front by Remarque The Joy Luck Club by Tan The Iliad by Homer Les Miserables (with the little accent over the e) by Hugo The Arabian Nights  I also got Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll, since I've been wanting that book for a while. I love Carroll's works. And he has my birthday, too =p Oh yeah..and I got The Inferno by Dante Alighieri because I've been wanting that for a while, also. The only other book that I really want now is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Darwin..heh. I'm going to wait 'till I can get a really good copy in hardback, though.  So. A summary of these books..  I've already read Much Ado About Nothing..it was really good. I like Shakespeare's works a lot, fortunately. My favorite poem (for the time being) is "The Seven Ages of Man", which he wrote. He always seems to have one character that is very witty. I like how Beatrice is the one that's endowed with much wit in this story. It's always good to have a strong female in a story. Especially one that's very good at making fun of people and mocking people that are in love, and love itself. Whoo!  hm..I didn't want All Quiet on the Western Front, but it was required. And I didn't want The Joy Luck Club..but my mom insisted I get that. I already know the story in The Iliad by heart..but I still needed to get an actual copy of the poem.   I've already seen the movie Les Miserables..it was interesting, I suppose. But..like The Iliad..it's something that I needed just so I can re-read it at times, and to have on hand.   Lastly..I just knew I had to get Arabian Nights because I love folk stories and fairy tales and..yeah. It's gonna be fun reading that. I'm thinking it'll accompany me to tennis camp next week. That way, I won't be troubled with stopping points, since it's just made up of many short stories.   Ohh yeah. I'm going to  urlLink tennis camp  next week.  It's my home-away-from-home. I went there the first year that it opened..the first week, actually. And I went there for two weeks last year. I'm going for two weeks again, this year. I leave on Sunday (June 6th), and I'll get back on Saturday (June 12th). I then leave on Monday for Journalism Camp at UNC Chapel Hill..and..I have no idea when I get back from that. I think it's for three days, but I'm not sure. I'm going there for the literary magazine info, not for journalism, though. Soo. I have no idea what that's going to be like.  Ok. This post is getting long. I need to finish my comic-listing, however..  6.  urlLink Applegeeks  7.  urlLink Queen of Wands  8.  urlLink Megatokyo  9.  urlLink Little Gamers  10.  urlLink Mac Hall   Two honorable mentions..:   urlLink What I Learned Today  This comic just isn't old enough to know if it's really a keeper, I guess. There are some hilarious ones, though.   urlLink InkTank  I just found out that this comic was up and running again. There are many many funny comics in InkTank's archives. I just haven't gotten the chance to look over the latest ones.  Ok. Time to actually..do stuff. Like clean up. "God forbid company comes over and sees our house in a mess"...company meaning Aaron, who could care less if our house was messy...and..the quote being a..mocking of how my Mother goes ballistic the day before people come over, because the house isn't *clean* enough. Oy.  Oh yes and..I have no idea whether to italicize the names of books or to underline them or to put them in quotation marks so..I'm just going to leave them plain like they are.
