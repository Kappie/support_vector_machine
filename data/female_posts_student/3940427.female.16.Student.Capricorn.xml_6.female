I made a forum for the private use of myself and Shaz so we could do a roleplay... But aparently it wasn't as private as we thought. It kept saying there was a guest hanging on the forums... And they were there for a really long while, watching... Maybe it was a government spy sent to steal our brains and sap the creative juices so they can sell themon the black market. >.> So I ran around in triangles screaming like a deranged headless chicken for a while, and they eventually went away. And thenThe Lurkercame back!! AAAAAHHHHH!! The Lurker ish scareh.     Aaanyway... I found the coolest Kingdom Hearts site on Avidgamers. Check it out if you like:  http://www.avidgamers.com/GWFire
