She's been with her friends or just walking away.  I know she doesn't like him, and I know she is avoiding him.  Even though it's Ferrell that's just mean.  To accept an offer for a date and then try to shaft him.  That's cruel.  Well they had swim today.  There's no way to avoid him there.  So she'll get what's coming.
