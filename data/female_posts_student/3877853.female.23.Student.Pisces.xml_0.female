Also, bad news with the sketch show. Well, I don't think it's bad news, necessarily, but it's going to suck. Dan and I had a  long  talk about it yesterday, and figured that it might not be the worst idea in the world to put it off for, maybe, several months, until we can do it right. If that means doing it next summer when we have enough money to rent equipment and have tried to get ourselves into the comedy scene then so be it. I don't think Rob and Vicki are going to be so enthused about the idea. I don't even care any more. I just want to go home.
