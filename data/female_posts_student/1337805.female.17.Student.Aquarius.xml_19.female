Its not fair when they go ahead and tell the entire school what I did. So now, I just wont tell anyone anything. Let them guess. I'm tired of the world knowing about my life.  Except on this blog, of course.  And yes Lyndon, I posted your name and it is there. And hey...aren't you going out with someone? (if not, why isnt it meeee!:P)
