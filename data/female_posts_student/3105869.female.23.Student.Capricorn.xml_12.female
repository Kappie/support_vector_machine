Torts looms next on my daily schedule.  How did I get only 16 speaker points on my 4th round of moot court.  The wonders never cease.  I was a debater in high school, now a law student, it seems my faculties have diminished.  Yes of course I get nervous in public speaking, but 16 points when most are around 22-25?  Hmmm. I question my capabilities.  I am woman hear me roar.  Or, in my case maybe stumble and stutter.  I guess this qualifies as one of my areas of weakness, but how to improve?  Karaoke?  Anything to defeat the fear of rejection from public performance.  My persistence in school seems to have gone as my patience did long ago.  What is in store for me next?  Public persecution from being called on in Torts.  Preferably not.  Does life progrssively suck more as you age?  Yes I have my first little wrinkles developing on my forehead.  I call them the "oh my goodness" wrinkles as the expression of shock makes them surface.  Note to self:  stop being so surprised.  Shouldn't I be more jaded at 23?  I generally feel my new liberalism after living in europe twice has left me affected, but not enough apparently to thwart the furthering of forehead creases.
