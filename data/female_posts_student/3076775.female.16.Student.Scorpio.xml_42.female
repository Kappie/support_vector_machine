I can't help it. and, I know that not many people read this, but I still like to vent. It's like my little diary.    The thing is, I'm so unsure about me and Nick right now. He's told me so many times that he loves me and that he cares for me, and he seems to, and he has plausable excuses for when we can't be together. I  want  us to be together...SO MUCH! But, when it comes right down to it, we just can't. And, well...I think that I'm just now accepting it for real. We  can't  spend time together, outside of school. His parents won't allow it, because I'm older, I can drive, and we'd be alone. There's NO way they'd allow their son to be with me for very long, where they can't get to him in 2 minutes if that have to. And, being in this relationship will only tie him down, limit him. I don't want him to be tied down when we can't even spend time together. And I really don't think he wants to be tied down either. Don't take this wrong, I'm not saying that I want to break up with him, I'm just saying that, if he wanted us to, then it'd probably be for the best, because it would make him happy. Heh, funny, isn't it? I just wish that it was  really  funny to me. Because it's not funny to me at all.    I really REALLY wish that Chelsea was here right now. I really need someone to talk to. I've tried talking to April, but she doesn't know what to tell me, and if I talked to her any more about it, she'd probably not feel comfortable trying to comfort me. I just don't know what to do!!!!    Well, other than my relationship turmoil, I guess things are alright....a little dull, perhaps, but peaceful, none the less. I'll keep you all posted with what's going on in the wonderful world of Shannon.       Shannon      Question of the Day: If you could wish for anything, what would it be?
