If i keep feeling this way i'll be talking to my parents to get me medication or to see someone. I heard they lock you up real good.lol Also I'm asking bill if we could do a recall so i can see the root of why im feeling this way. Last night we did a recall of my old house. he really freaked me out with some of the things he said about my room and the kitchen!..just..weird but fun.    Hopefully he wont pick up some of the 'bad'things we did at school(some ppl know what im talkin about) lol But he wont care he's done worse believe me lol.   I don't know where i'd be with out all of you...probably dead. '    Thanx!
