Christmas has passed and so has New Years... this is usually a very depressing time for me, because I love Christmas, but you know, I'm glad for the rush to be over... that and it's less time till my 6 month secondary license is up. And my birthday is like two days after that. COOL EH? We'll be able to do something vehicle-related for my birthday. No more bus. But I like the bus... farewell sweet bus. But freedom is almost mine!!! Catch me that horizon. (Eh? Eh?)       No school today, snow storm... it's weird, I used to LOVE the snow. I mean, I still do, but I have absolutely no urge to play in it. I guess if any of my friends could make it to my house, then we could have fun, but it's impossible. I hope we don't have school tommorrow. Cause I'm procrastinating on the paper I'm writing right now. Blargh why do I have such a problem with homework?? K I really have to go. I guess.
