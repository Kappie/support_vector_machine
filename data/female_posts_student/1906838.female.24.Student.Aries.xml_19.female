Although i had psyched myself to stay up this morning to do work, i ended up sleeping anyways .. right through the morning. Was about to leave the flat to take the bus to Ninewells when i decided to check the timetable for today's seminars. Well guess what? Seminars dont start till 12 ..Since i was just about ready to leave flat anyways, i decided to just go out and instead of taking bus to the hosp i walked to the main campus so I could take the free shuttle bus later. So here i am at the IT suites in the tower building .. feeding my blog .. hahahha.. im kinda pleased with myself for being able to keep this blogspot 'alive' for quite awhile now. I have tried blogging many times before and none of them have survived more than one or two entries.  My weekend has been fairly uneventfull... ohh ohh.. what am i talking about? Uneventful? I forgot all about the phone calls. yeps .. On saturday, after i had finished speaking on the phone with my best friend, two 'private number' calls were made to my mobile and each time i answered, the call was ended. I thought it might be my best friend but then when i called him back , he said it wasnt him. Then last night the exact same thing happened.. 2 more. Only this time, the caller held on long enough during the first call for me to repeat my hellos and the second time, i didnt even have time to pick it up before the call was ended. I told my brother about it, and initially he thought it was golliwog who was trying to play a joke on me .. but i knew of course it wasnt golliwog because of the time those calls were made ( last night's were made at about midnight). Plus i know golliwog wouldnt think of making such calls as much of a joke! My bro then suggested the possibility of THAT person making those calls .. i said.. HOW? how COULD THAT PERSON POSSIBILY KNOW MY MOBILE NUMBER???!! plus .. i doubt that person would just hang up on me after making a longdistant call.. that person would most likely speak his/her mind out and tell me how he/she felt about me .. not like that person has not done that already. Im just hoping that whoever are making this phone calls would stop soon. I mean.. hell its not me who is paying for the calls .. if anyone wishes to confront me .. if they have this burning desire to tell me anything .. JUST DO IT. Calling me and not saying anything whenever i answer is just F**KING STUPID.
