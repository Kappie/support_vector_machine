Messed up the whole house trying to find your cash Cause i've taken it and I wonder wher i've stashed Forgot to cook dinner and you came home hungry Oh, dear, would you ever forgive me?  Found your pen but it had rusted to the tip Meant to feed your fish but I never did It died, I didn't buy a new vase and the keys are still missing Oh dear, careless, careless me  Sorry I lost your money I meant to return back to you I will unless I find it which I hope I do Dinner not done and I've no money to buy it Oh dear, careless, careless me
