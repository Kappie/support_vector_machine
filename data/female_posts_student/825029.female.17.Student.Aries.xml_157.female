I’m so glad this past week is over.  It sucked the big one.  Between projects, lab reports, essays, band, etc etc, I was way too busy.  Friday was even a crappy day, even though it was Homecoming.  But it’s all over now : )    Yesterday was a lot of fun.  Charles and I met up with Nick, Tasha, Ross, and Chelsea to see “Matchstick Men” (which was really good) and then we went out to eat at Macaroni Grill.  We had an awesome time, so hooray!  Then… let’s see… Chelsea had other plans so she had to go and we all just kinda split up, and then Mooney joined me and Charles and we went to Marble Slab for some ice cream.  Then, we walked around at Andy Brown East for a while.  So, all in all, it was a good day.  I just got back from teaching Sunday School this morning and that was fun.  But now I have to do tons of homework : \  Then church tonight, so that’s pretty much my day.  I have a feeling next week is going to be another sucky one, just by looking at Blackboard and seeing the upcoming homework.  Plus band and the stupid NHS induction ceremony on Monday after band (a wasted hour).  Oh well.  No game on Friday, so that’s kinda nice, although it means Saturday is gonna be wasted.  And to anyone confused, on my last entry, I did not mean to say Guster – “Amsterdam”.  I meant to say what I did say, which was Coldplay.  I’m not that stupid.  Yep, so I don’t really have anything else to say.  This, Nathan, is why I don’t update my blog very often.  There’s just nothing to say.  Oh well. I guess I should get started on my homework.  I hope everyone had a great weekend and has a great week!
