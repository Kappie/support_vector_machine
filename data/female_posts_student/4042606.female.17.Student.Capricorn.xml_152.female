Instead I drank a lot of wine and watch   urlLink Cool Runnings   twice before I finally passed out on the floor. I awoke this morning in a pool of my own drool, and my dad was not to pleased to find me there, on the floor unconscious, with   urlLink Cool Runnings   playing in the background. We then had a little talk about my drinking habits and how I am underage and shouldn't drink. I told him that he need to trust me more, and that I only get drunk when I am alone. He didn't like hearing that either. So I think I am in a little trouble for today, but I will be back in a little while.
