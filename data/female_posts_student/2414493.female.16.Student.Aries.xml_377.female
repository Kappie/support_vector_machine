Other people as a rule mean so little to us that, when we have invested one of them with the power to cause us so much suffering or happiness, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of one's life a sort of stirring arena in which he or she will be more or less close to one.  But Odette isn't into Swann now. How sad.  I honestly enjoy this book, though that enjoyment has increased enormously only because I've gotten to part 2. It's much better than Political Systems...I tried going back to it after much Swann and didn't like it. I was lost in the tribal lineages, etc.  I need to shower, but it's too late and I'm obviously too lazy.  No music for now. It'll disturb the peace.  I met Victoria for coffee today at the Starbucks in the Garage. She's still the same as I remembered. I think there's a distinct style about her. For some reason, I always get the sense that I was just the little cruddy freshman and sophomore who idolized her for being editor and for going to Harvard and that she has every right to stand me up. But she's been nicer than I thought I deserved. She's called me twice already to meet up somewhere and offered to take me to parties...There's just something missing, though. With Sylvia at Wendy's we can just talk for two hours over lunch and keep laughing, etc. but I guess it's just because Vicky and I don't really share much in common anymore. She has a boyfriend. She's turning 18 next year...oh, September 2. Not next year. The thing that makes me think the most is her telling me that her first year at Harvard was difficult academically. It's not important to estimate how difficult that is...that's just irrelevant and intrusive. It just makes me think that ok, if I get into Harvard it's not going to be all fun and games.  And I apply it to life even now. Am I going to get my courses under control here? I really want to get A's in both classes, and the biggest mystery is lit. I'm keeping up with the reading and everything, but our first paper is due July 20 and I haven't a topic. I have some sort of inferiority complex and don't think I have anything profound to share.  I guess getting A's isn't really the point, but I don't want to come away struggling either. How bad could it be? It's just so confusing, since it's true: I idolized her, and to know that Harvard's not a walk in the park for her? I have to ask myself, what am I good at? Not math or science. English? But only if I'm comfortable and learn to speak up.  Well, I have more thinking to do.  Even though we can't talk much, Victoria's still very nice about things. She told me that if I got in, I could stay with her during pre-frosh weekend...  If I get in.  It's probably not healthy that I'm on a power trip right now. One of these days I'm going to experience something humbling and I'll be moody and quiet and reflective for a while.  Matt didn't confront an Asian girl today--he chickened out, even with all the pretty ones in Annenberg. Ahem.  And I just finished watching Requiem for a second time. It really just sets in on you. I feel almost dead, or asleep.  I'm getting the camera cord and the credit card sent to me. Yay.  For some reason I thought of a reason to panic just now. And I forget why I'm panicking. What could possibly be wrong right now? I'm thinking.  Oh, the Crimson. I don't know if I should go in and help out. For brownie points. Vicky knows Mike Conti, who's the design chair. Apparently he's good at getting drunk.  I might go.  Anyways, too much rambling.
