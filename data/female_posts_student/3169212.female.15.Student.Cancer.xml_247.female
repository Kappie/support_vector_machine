The same can be said for Kuronue, except he's a bat demon.  Kuronue was killed long ago when the both of them were fleeing from the Castle of the Demon World.  Kurama continued to steal, until approximately fifteen years ago he was running from spirit hunters and was blasted to the Human World, supposed dead.  He then took the form of a human child named Suichi Minamino and repented for his sins.  Kurama used to have long white hair and ears like you Inu-Yasha, even yellow eyes, but he had a tail.  Now he resembles a human boy with long red hair and bright green eyes.  I believe you also are shorter, aren't you?  *Kurama nods*  He is unable to turn back into Yoko Kurama, his demon form, because he lacks the energy.  He can transform, however, with the aid of specific spirit items like the Idunn Box.  Kuronue:  Been busy while I was in Hell, eh?  Kurama:  You have no idea.  Kuronue:  How does she know all of that?  Baka (not Lindsay any more):  Let's just say you two have a really, REALLY big fan in the real world.
