He's this loser who is obsessed with this rock band (Steel Dragon). He sings the songs, wears the clothes and is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon cover band (he insists it's a "tribute" band). When the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the band, Marky Mark is drafted to replace him and the story goes on.. etc. etc. etc. Think Van Halen. All throughout the movie I kept thinking of the similarities: it's like the Van Halen story or something. Anyway, it's really good. I didn't think it would be, but I liked it. It even made me cry.
