I let it slide, said goodbye politely, and hung up. He called back today, got me again, and when I reminded him that I was the one he talked to yesterday, he apologized- twice- for his behavior and very sweetly asked for an extension on his account. Which, due to my ever-benevolent nature, I granted without a problem. He then proceeds to call back the application line and leave an "anonymous" complaint saying that the girl he talked to when he first called (we call her "Cracky," as in "crackhead") was an "angel" and the girl he talked to next (me) was "not." So then Jefe calls Posh and demands to know what happened. And Posh explains to Jefe that she knew about the call and that the prick had apologized- twice- for HIS rude behavior and said not a word to me about being rude to him. And then she got pissed because he was questioning whether she had control of her department, and, as she told me, she desperately wanted to tell him, "I know what goes on in my fucking department!" (but unlike me, who has called him all manner of names, including "dick," with no regret, she's too scared to tell him to his face what she thinks about his interference). Oooooohhhhhh, my aching head.  And Cracky didn't show up to work today, and Barbie came in two hours late, and I asked Jefe to buy me and Blondie some lunch for having to make up the slack, and he said no. So I ate Pizza Hut again. And now my tummy hurts.  So, like I said. Knowing that if I stay here, this is what my life will be like for years on end, I say "NOT." I choose to move on. Screw every one of them.  In other news, I have discovered that yes, my father really does hate me. I am not exaggerating. I called my mother today and casually mentioned that I had not gotten a response to an e-mail I sent my father a week ago and she said, "Oh, he told me to tell you blah-blah-blah." I asked Mom- "Why couldn't he just hit the "reply" button and tell me that himself?" Neither of us answered the question because we already know the truth. He fucking hates me. So I told my mother he's not getting a Father's Day gift since he does not know how to behave like a father.  She also went against my wishes and told him I am going back to Mississippi. She said he "hopes you do well there." Yeah, right. I only hope I do so I can have the pleasure of NOT inviting him to my graduation. Asshole. That'll teach him to treat his own daughter like she's expendable. Nothing like having a goal in mind, huh?  I'm only a  little  bitter.
