I really don't" That prob isn't an exact quote... anyway I'm real excited - we're getting a puppy this weekend!!      It's a little bitter sweet though - I still miss Andy - I feel like I'm ditching him.... he's only been dead since December, and that puppy will never be as cute or as funny or have half the personality of Andy.... but I'll love him all the same. Anyway, I prob shouldn't be writing anyway - I'm in the middle of a Breakfast at Tiffany's final paper for film study - PS I love that movie
