NOT THAT I MIND, I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE FAIRLY MESSY.  well at the request of Tr0y and the neurons exploding in my head I have taken refuge in the office to blog. By taking said refuge, I have left the two toddlers alone watching Nemo in my room. By doing this, I am risking the lives of everyone involved and while nothing serious may take place, I can guarantee you that I will lose a couple knick-knacks.  and yet at this point, I would give all the knick-knacks in the world for a little peace and quiet.    I am spent. spent when I didn't have much to spend in the first place. This has been by far the worst spring break ever. I am tired, so tired, and sooo fucking aggravated. For the last five days these people have been scraping away at my reserve and have completely lost it. I have surrendered to the bloody wrath that is "the toddler" and I just can't handle anymore.  I was supposed to relax over the break. I was supposed to sleep.. a lot! But, ironically enough, I have slept less this week than I do in a normal school week. I stay up until midnight cleaning, chatting, trying to compose myself, then am awoken by the cacophony that is an impatient child. "daddy! Mommy! Get me out o' dis cri-ubb! waaaaah!"   SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU LITTLE MONSTERS!  while I don't consider myself a violent or short-tempered person, I have wanted to slap the shit out of this kid every single hour of every single day at every single whine or tantrum or screaming fit or, the worst one, when he completely ignores the yelling and does exactly what you told him not to do. Perhaps this wouldn't bother me so much.. But he always fucking gets away with it!!! How many times has he been in my closet ripping things out whilst we make ourselves hoarse trying to dissuade him. Then if he actually DOES get in trouble, the screaming crying whining goddamn tantrum that follows makes the whole effort hardly worth it.   I think I'm done bitching for now.. I mean, they are leaving tomorrow. I'm just counting down the seconds...  on a happier note, I had a great day on Friday. I had sunken into such a slump that I could barely stand up and it made my uncle feel bad, so he and my aunt took me out to lunch and then bowling. We had tons of fun, and the fact that we weren't within five hundred feet of the kids helped A LOT. After I got home from my outing with the family, we went and played bingo!!! Even though we sat in the smoking section and I was completely asphyxiated within the first hour, it was really really fun. And the best part is... I WON A DOLLAR!!! Yes, I caitlin, was the lucky winner of one dollar. I won it from these little ticket things that you rip the tabs off of and see if you got anything. But then, of course, I traded in the winners for 4 more tickets and got losers!!! Either way I enjoyed it.   today was alright... I babysat for a bit of the afternoon and made 17 bucks, not to mention I was babysitting for the kids across the street who actually behave on some level. Now I'm at home, "relaxing", listening to the kids get yelled at. They decided on monjuni's for dinner, which only took about 2 hours of debating. Just a couple more hours until Cameron goes to bed!!! I think I'll make it!  1. I hate children and have hated children for a long time.  2. My birthday is November 19 3. That makes me a Scorpio 4. While I do hate the little bastards, kids love me. I think it's the picking up by the legs and spinning around that they enjoy the most.  5. If I were going to have a kid((which I'm so fucking not)), I think I would them Mikhail.  hope you enjoyed today's installment, but probably not since all I did was bitch.
