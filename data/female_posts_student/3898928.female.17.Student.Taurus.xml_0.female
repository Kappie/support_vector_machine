It’s quite interesting and there should be a few more books in the series. Today I’m hoping to finish “Guilty Pleasures”, which was a birthday present from Lana. It’s not a romance novel although the title might suggest it. After that I want to finish “A Rhyming History of Britain”. I’ve only got three more sections left and two of them are short so it shouldn’t take too long. After that I will only have “The Sherlock Holmes Stories” to worry about, as well as “Practical Christianity in Crisis”.  Music So, for the longest time Tchaikovsky was my favorite composer, then a few years ago I gave into temptation and decided I like Mozart more. Recently I’ve really been into Strauss but I think I’m going to have to go back to Tchaikovsky being my favorite. “He’s pretty…” kind of like Mark if you’re in on that joke.   So, I’ve got to get back to work but next time expect some talk of movies and dance.  - À la prochaine
