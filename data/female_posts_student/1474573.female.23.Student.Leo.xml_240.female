Its not something that could or even should be done every week but as a monthly thing it could be totally great!  Here's the deal.  There's poetry, then there's spoken word poetry. There are writers and then there are performance poets.  There's the open mic vs. the slam.  Some spoken word poets actually manage to write some good shit, but it doesnt always happen that way.  Slam has a specific format.  It has to be a certain length for starters.  Also, its a competition.  Many people use the slam as a stepping stone, and some have never stepped far from it.  Many people have been slamming for yeeeears, some using the same poems that helped them win 8 years ago!    I give credit to people like Taylor Mali who get into the competition using NEW material every other year.  Taylor's been around the block a few times, has won more than once, and (*I think*) helped create and solidify the rules of Slam.  I believe he slams now for fun, and for the sake fo competition, not because he has nothing else to do with himself...  Sigh.  I dunno...the whole slam scene has gotten so cliquish and tired.  I used to be such a HUGE fan of it, but after hanging out with poets for awhile I realized that many of them NEED the slam because they crave the attention and they seemingly have nothing else going for them.  Newbies are ostracised, innovative ideas get thrown aside because of egos.  OH, the EGOS!  Dont get me started.    Anyhoo, so Guy.  The man, the myth, the legend.  He's my brother from another mother...and father... He headed up A Little Bit Louder on Monday nights at Bar 13 in Manhattan.  Then he moved away and when he came back, and back onto the scene, he was treated like a deadbeat dad.  The baby had grown up and didnt 'need' him anymore.  The beautiful loving baby turned into the goth/punk fucked up delinquent teenager that didnt need parenting anymore because they knew best.  So metaphorically, his stepkid Acentos (Tuesday nights in the Bronx) still loved him and let him into their life.  Aww.  I've been to Acentos once, and it was nice.  Havent made my way back yet, but I should.  Great things are coming outta there, it seems.  Ok so once again, I go off on a tangent.  My point?  Guy has this new thing going at the Bowery Poetry Club downtown.  Its a debate.  Kinda like the McLaughlin Group with more color.  On Saturday it was 'oldtimers' talking about the slam and why they continue with it.  Taylor Mali was there with Roger Bonair Agard.  Guy co-hosted with Helen Yum and Eric Guerrieri.  Taylor was misinterpreted with his answer to a certain question about rape but he stood his ground and had conviction in what he was saying.  Roger was very much 'look at me, I'm cute and clever. I'm going to mask the fact that I'm not really saying anything'.  Roger, I'm sorry honey, I love ya, but take a stand, man!    I actually talked to Roger after the show and asked him the question I wanted to while he was on stage.  "You still compete in the slam.  Why? If you want to be heard, why not just go on the open mic and call it a night?  Why compete at all anymore?" He told me that Slam began to give the opportunity to be heard by many people and that the competition aspect of it is secondary.  Okay.  But he's been around long enough.  He's been on Def Poetry Jam twice, and he tours all over.  So that doesnt really answer my question.  He's proven that he doesnt need the slam anymore and yet he still does it.  Go figure.  What I loved MOST about Saturday was that it was too short. It left everyone wanting more.  EVERYONE was walking out of there talking about it.  The conversations continued through dinner and into the next day.  THAT was way cool.  It was the first time doing a format like this and there were a few things that are going to be tweaked before the next show (like not being able to SEE people raising their hands in the audience after asking for people's participation - next time, someone will be combing the audience for hands)  This Saturday, April 3, it will be about Def Poetry and all the things that surround it.  Russell Simmons, opportunist or patron of the arts?  You decide.
