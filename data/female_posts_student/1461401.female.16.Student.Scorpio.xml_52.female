She was cool. Tried to go up my sleeve though, and that made me feel a little freaked out... understandably. The best part though, was Steve came with me. Man, I haven't seen him hardly at all for an entire year! But I asked if he wanted to help, and he said yes! God, I had forgotten how much I miss him. And afterwards, mom took us out to lunch, and he was so funny! Honestly, the only other time I had seen him outside of school was at the play, and he wasn't with him. Mom gave he permission to marry him, lol. Something to remember, cyclops' can only have a unibrow. :-D Yeah, good times. I don't want it to end... Ugh, this is gonna be one hell of a summer... :-( No ones talking to me!!!! ~Kristin  Later~ I hate hypocrits. The kind of people who say they love you, but give you up so easily.
