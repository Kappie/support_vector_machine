I think it is quite straightforward. But, i am not going to give comments about her blog as mine is not fantastic enough to comment on others. Even though my blog may seem to be so dull, but I promise that i will try to make it more attractive. Have been reading web comics such as  urlLink bobbin  and  urlLink Slackers . Now for my life!!>> Been quite sad about the class of late. I have one thing to say to certain people(i do not wish to name names as i still have a reputation to uphold, but it would seem quite obvious to the person which i am pinpointing at), and that is to "F*** Off". You know what, they should just get a life and stop being a lifeless moron. And if you think that you are sorry, good for you but don't expect me to forgive you until you start to crawl on your knees and BEG me for forgiveness. I am so sorry to start the entry with such negative thoughts of the past few days. And another thing, if you think you are pretty in any sense, get a new mirror cause i suspect your mirror is givng you distorted images... Bad for health and you are lying to yourself. Tomorrow is Singapore's 39th anniversary!! *Cheers* school is closed for monday and tuesday!! Ok...gotta go finish up the assignment!!!
