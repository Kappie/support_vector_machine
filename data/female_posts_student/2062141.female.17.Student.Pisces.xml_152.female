It was SO sunny today and i wanted to explode in my socks. Bugga boo bugga bee bugga wtf am i writing. ......If I ...were the king... of the foRAAAAAAAAST... then that would be one ROCKIN' forest.               Art Club today, didn't work on anything cept maybe added green stripes to my sweater on my self-portrait. My mom is signing me up for CRAZY amounts of art classes but I'm glad because well I gotta be all prepared and experienced and shit. ..... ........   .....GET ME OUT OF THIS SCHOOL GET ME OUT OF JUNIOR YEAR I WANT TO BE A SENIOR I WANT IT TO BE SUMMER I WANT TO GO TO BAND CAMP AND GO TO CONCERTS AND ROAD TRIPS AND COULON AND CAMP IN MY BACKYARD. Wow sorry for that outburst but I'm sure you feel the same way. It's just I've been thinking about the Dave Matthews Concert and I'm sooo soo soo excited but it's so far away.. it's at the end of summer which is weird.. we'll have a whole summer filled with fun before that. It'll be an awesome way to end it though. This will be the greatest summer ever because I can DRIVE and I'll be home more than most summers, cause you know, we're not going to Iceland, or any crazy place like that.  GAH this year needs to END. END END END. I've decided you guys: Last day of school, we'll do our whole Seattle thing like always but then we're camping out in my backyard! IT'LL BE CUHRAZY! Well maybe not but YEAH! Sigh it's too far away to be making plans. No it's not don't talk like that.               Oh Charlotte left tonight, she's been staying with us since Sunday cause her Mom was in Las Vegas. We went to the mall and put her dress on hold, (it wasn't gone, yay!) and Saturday I'll come over and make her all purty and whatnot. Cause that's just what best friends do. Do eachother's makeup and watch Indiana Jones. Hehe. Yah good times. I should sleep now cause I haven't gotten much lately. It's so hot in my room! *stares at lava lamp for 4 hours*
