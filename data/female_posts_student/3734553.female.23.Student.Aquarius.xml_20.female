It makes me question my chosen profession.  So tonight, we had a happy hour set up by the 2Ls for all 1Ls. I think it was truthfully so all the guys could scope out the girls, since the only 2Ls there were boys. And then later tonight I met some girlfriends from school at the front porch pub, which is less than 2 blocks away. This man , who was at least 40 yrs. old, came up to our table three times, and since I was unlucky enough to have been there at all 3 times he focused on me. And he was with his 22 yr. old girlfriend ( he told us this, like it was big secret, she looked like his daughter). I don't know if he was trying to trade in for a younger, blonde version or what. But he definitely made me a little nervous, especially when he tried to give me a kiss on the cheek. I am certainly younger in this town.  So here's to being the right age, once again... and to $5 pitchers.
