What made it worse was that it was full of people who hate me. It was just so terrible. His face was just... God, you could see it... Then, I went to find Melanie and Erica and it turned out she was out back and when I found her she was standing near Greg. Morgan and I debated a minute or so wether or not I should go over there and we decided to go over and then Doof came up to me and told me not to cause he can't take it. Then, while I was looking for the car, I like totally broke down. Then, we finally found the car and it was so nice to be with my friends. I love the all so much. That whole night just really brought to light how much they mean to me. I wish I could carry them around with me all the time, especially when I leave next year. I don't ever want anything bad to happen to any of them. Then Morgan, Danielle, Erica and I met up with Cersha and Scabettie (sorry if I can't spell guys) and made them chase us for a little while. Then we went bowling. John, Rob, Rubin, and Dave met up with us at the alley and wow it was fun. Rob kept sayin to me that he was gonna blow up my car and I kept sayin not if I ran over him with it first. It was so fun... I love them... I don't know what I would do with out any of them. Debra, Erica, Melanie, Danielle, Melissa, Morgan, any of the trackies, the boys, Mick, the Canadians, the Vistana people... I just don't know what I'd do... I'd be lost... absolutley lost... Speaking of being lost... I left the alley at 10:30 and I started to get home. I got onto Hylan just fine and the road seemed to spilt at some point and of course I take the wrong way. So... I'm drivin and I end up on Bay Street in the projects. I was freaking out. So then I find Hylan again and this time I go the wrong way on it again and now I'm heading towards the bridge. Now I'm REALLY freaking out. After about 15 minutes I come accross Hylan again and so I'm at a light hysterical cause I'm lost and Mick and I are kinda inna tiff and this guy in the car next to me beeps the horn. So I roll down the window and he tells me my lights aren't on and I thank him and I asked him if I was going in the right direction if I wanna get to Barclay and he told me I was so I thanked him again and I went home. I like almost crashed five times cause I was cryin and I couldn't see straight. But I got home eventually... it was just a bad night except the bowling. That was the best. Talk to yous lata. x0x
