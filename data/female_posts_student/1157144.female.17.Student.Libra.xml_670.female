Right now, I'm packing, and having to run means that i have to pack twice the stuff, so my suitcase is overflowing and i haven't finished the laundry to put in the rest of my clothes, since i'm bringing the vast majority of my clothes with me. O well. I come back on next wednesday, 9:22pm into SFO. Why we can't just land at SJ is beyond me, it would be much more convenient for me and carlie, since then i could give her a ride home. If something exciting happens, i always have my phone on.
