We've had major disputes in the past, over a certain ex. I'd just gain his trust back, and she would say something to him, a lie that I had done, and all the trust I had spent ages getting back would be lost.  Recently, they broke up (I think, it's constant on again, off again) and we've become friends. She has a blog as well.   *Name has been changed to respect their privacy, not mine.
