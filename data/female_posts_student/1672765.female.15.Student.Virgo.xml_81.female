I'll be out of style. I'll be discarded with the warmth you once feigned.  So eager to say "hello" but you don't know me. You just know what you see. Pay the price to see the show but you don't own me.  Before you knew, would you have felt the same?"  "Please don't ask me just what I think, trust me, you don't want to know. Please don't ask me to open up, trust me, trust me, 'cause I can't."  "Everything's so easy for you, but I've struggled to get this far. I'm alone in the fight. What's wrong, who's right? I take it all to heart. Your true colors start to show, you call yourself a friend. The teams are drawn, you chose your side - you'll get yours in the end."  "Another day so hard to face."   I think that about wraps it up.
