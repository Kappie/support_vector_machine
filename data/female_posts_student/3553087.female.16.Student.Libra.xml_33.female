"yellow" by coldplay. good song. download it. so just rented scary movie three. bout to go look at it. maybe somebody will come over tonite and watch it w/me. that'd be cool. also got "you got served" whatever that is. dancing movie or something. well havnt done anything all day. lee called a couple of times askin if i'd seen cj but i havnt all day. been callin em tho. no telling where he is. :) got in a fight with DWIGHT last night. he gets on my nerve about the stupidest things. he can be a real kid sometimes, just immature and childish. and he was about to hang up the phone on me again claiming i was trying to be "superior" (!) so i just hung up on him first cause im tired of getting disrespected like that. needless to say, he called today and apologized for being a jerk. just as he should have. that is all for now. :)
