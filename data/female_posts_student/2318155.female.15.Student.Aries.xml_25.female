On Friday I came home and went on the computer, I took a shower then blowdryed my hair, ate some Chinese and got dressed and put on some makeup. Brandon called and said he was gonna be at my house in like 15 min and I was pretty close to done. Brandon came and his mom took us to his banquet for Cal high frosh football. We got some dessert and sat and watched people get awards for like 2 hours. Afterwards his mom took us to this pizza place that has really good pepperoni pizza. His sisters sarinated me with their talking of embarrassing things he did when he was little. Saturday I woke up at 6, took a shower and had breakfast, then blowdryed my hair, did my makeup, left for school. I had to go to san ramon at 7 in the morning because of a stupid speech tournament that I had to work at because i'm in oral interp. boohoo. It was sooo boring. I organized donuts for three different places, the small gym for sales, the library for judges, and then the teacher's lounge for coaches. Afterwards I got to stand in the cold and pass out maps to our school to those hundreds of people who had no idea where to go. Then, I went to the library to wait for the judges to be done with their information about what to do, and then time for their one round. That took about an hour and a half to go through all 7 speeches of impromptu of varsity level. Some director guy of the tournament asked my judge if he gave back feedback cause some coach heard from one of his students that he was. WE had to go through a long time of telling him no we didn't, and then I came with him to tell the coach so. The coach was a complete asshole who had this big wart on his mouth with hairs sticking out of it. Them I took some messed up ballots to the Teacher's Lounge, called Wilford on the walkir talkie with no success of finding where she was. Right as I was walking out she walked in, I told her that I was leavin, and about 2 other people that left. I went to the bathroom and then my mom picked me up. I went with my parents to get an xmas tree and then we brought it home and did the yearly ritual on it. Hose it down so that there's no pollen on it and to go the dead leaves off, well at least some of them. Then we stood it up on the stand, and blew it with the blower my dad has for leaves. This process is so that any dead leaves that are not off already, they are taken care of. We put up our reindeer that lights up, our icicle lights, and decorated with these signs and stuff in the dirt. I got ready and then me, Brandon, Missy, and brain went on a double date to the movies. We met at crow canyon to see "Stuck on You", but we got the tickets and then headed for subway. We had our sandwich and then went into longs to get some candy. We headed into the movies and found 4 seats all together. I thought that the movie was an ausome and so hilarious. Then, me and Brandon waited like for 20 minutes for his dad to pick us up, and then he came and took me home. On Sunday I slept in till around 11, watched some tv, called Brandon, and planned to go to the mall, which didn't work out. I had to go to the mall with my mom and we got xmas gifts for some people and some stuff for me too! (: I got this new bra which is so ausome and like all lacy, then I got some more perfume that I've been running out of, and then to top it off some comfy snowboots that are slipper like that are very comfy and imma wear tomorrow. Around 5:30ish I arrived at Brandon's and we watched "Silence of the Lambs", which was a pretty creepy movie. We had dinner, chicken drumsticks breaded, rice-a-roni, and some corn. After finishing the movie we hung out till his dad came home so he could take me home, but after waiting his mom then said she would take us home! Well at least we got to spend some more time together (: When I got home I wasn't feeling so good, and when I woke up it was the same deal. So, I stayed home sick on Monday. I woke up at 10ish and watched tv almost the whole day and taped a news broadcast for this sociology hw at 6. Talked with Brandon for a while, and then went to bed. Today I was woken up, on Tuesday, at 6 in the morning. On Tuesday are our late days, so I usually get to sleep in till anywhere from 7-7:30. My mom forgot, and woke me up like last week. Then at 7 I was woken up by my dad and then I told him my alarm clock didn't go off yet. Finally at 7:30 i got up and had some breakfast, did my hair, got dressed, waited for 5 minutes for my mom to get outta the shower, while I coulda been doing my makeup. So, I was almost late this morning, but to my relief the traffic wasn't too bad. English was pretty easy, just reading the 7th chapter in Ender's Game, which I really enjoy reading. In Oral Interp we listened to 3 impromptu speeches. In chem I made up my hw almost and almost finished tonite's hw. At break I talked with Kaila mainly and then met with Jessika. At spanish I made a card for my mom and dad for xmas in spanish. In P.e. I was sick the day before so I got all crappy events for the track unit. Discus, which I was not there on the day that we learned, 100 dash in which I would've picked anyways, the 400 dash which I wanted to pick also, but then to top it off I received the 800 which is 2 laps and I suck at. I crossed myself off for the 800 and so I have 3 events in which I hope I will do good in. During lunch I had a crappy sandwich and talked mainly the whole time, then I went to my locker. But, before I made it to my locker, I saw the lunch cart, with cookies. So, of course, I got a cookie. Then I went to walk towards sociology and I had a while so I went to throw away my cookie bag outside and I ran into Missy and Brian. We talked for a while and then the bell rang. In Sociology I talked with Devon about his fight with some kid at lunch and then wrote some notes that we had to take. In Geometry we learned a new lesson and then had the whole time to do our hw, which was fairly easy. After school I went to my tutor for the last time and went over my makeup work which was very easy, algebra like hw. I came home had 2 cookies and well, I've been here talkin with you people.
