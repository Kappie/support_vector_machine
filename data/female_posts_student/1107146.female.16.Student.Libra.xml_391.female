But I'm not sure...hell, that's why I'm in therapy.  Anyway, never said I wouldn't talk about this on YOUR site...;)  Hehehehe...anyway, if you guys are sick of my whining then you can read it in a more contained form on my site.  Perhaps tomorrow will yield a rather interesting post...My eyes don't want to stay open anymore, so I'd better crash.  Talk to you guys later.  And thanks for the wisdom, Josh.  I really appreciate it.  ~Z
