I think that's the only reason I bother growing my hair out - just to experience the novelty of such weightlessness on my head.  It just barely gets into a ponytail.  Kind of.  More like an exploding ponytail.  It's Friday, and I slept in, and got a haircut, and went to the gym... Now I need to study.  There are movies to be seen, and parties to attend, but not by me tonight.  Maybe I'll have my very own Blockbuster night, though...
