It's so strange, though, that everything I have, everything I am, everything I've desired and could get--these things can all fit into a box. Well, many boxes. So many boxes. When I walk(ed) into my apartment, into my room, there never seemed to be as much as I see there is now that I have had to acknowledge every possession. Now, in this new place, all I ever wanted is here, surrounding me, taking up much more room than I am comfortable with--just sitting. Nothing, yet, is on display, that will serve to tell who I am, what I like, what I dislike, who I love. Well, almost nothing.  I have lots of delicate things, lots. Glassware, electronics--in fact I dropped my entire new computer on the ground yesterday but I was nowhere near as afraid as when I came upon my cousin and "step father" unpacking my Top Box--the one that I cared about the most, the one filled with the things that have made my life a life--to split it in two. Apparently, I'd packed too many of my books into one rather large box, which I knew would be very heavy for someone--certainly not me, weakling that I am--but I put them all in there together because they were always meant to go into boxes together, the way that I put them there. I was mortified that they dared undo what I had done. How could they know what covers can rub against one another? Which can be closer to the bottom, take on the pressure of the weight of the others? How could they ever know anything about the care it took to pack these my most prized possessions. I will grant that this was not my only box of books, there is no box large enough in which all of my books could be transported now. But I put together books that could go together.  Yes, even in boxes, there is an order (admittedly mostly based on how it makes me feel to put this book here, that book there) to the way my books are arranged.  They didn't know that, so I gasped, grabbed my heart, cried out, and fell into the nearest wall with the horrified shock of what they dared do without my consent, without my guidance, without my own two hands!  I was, of course, ignored. They continued their task, only caring that their backs and legs would be able to move these delicate darlings of mine to my new home. And, in the end, I realized that since I wasn't going to be carrying any of the boxes of books, no matter how many they decided I needed, I'd best let them to it in whatever way would get it done.   But I was left contemplating just how dearly I love my books, how they are the best things I have, how I've never regretted the purchase of any one of them. Because I don't have much--materially--because the things I want are not as readily available. As in...Africa. I want Africa. And I want India, Ireland, Italy, France, the whole world--name a place in it and I want to see it, know it, live there so I'll  know  it. And so far, my books are the closest I have come to getting everything I have ever wanted. They are the world right now. The actual gateways to places I have never been to. Every leaf new terrain traversed. Every literary period a new epoch investigated.   I don't go in much for naming favorites of anything--although I do believe that all I ever need to know about the world I have read in  Jane Eyre  and  Wide Sargasso Sea --but my box(es) of books trump everything. I could lose all my clothes in an uprooting so long as my books made it.   And they did make it, my Top Box(es), every one of them. Still quite large, if I do say so myself. The world is a big old place, and I want to see and understand as much of it as I can while I can.  In this new, strange room, filled with dancing shadows and dust, there is one thing on display--a box of books, thrown open, titles spilling out. I had to know if  Maru  was there, if  Cyrano de Bergerac   was there...they are. Now, I'll sleep well.
