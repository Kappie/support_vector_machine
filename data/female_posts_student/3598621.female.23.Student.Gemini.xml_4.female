I know that there are many issues that I should tackle right now, for example, the knowledge assumption vs knowledge production balance issue, the challenge avoidance/procrastination issue, the shyness issue, etc. Some of them are quite urgent. But I decided to pick the low-hanging fruit first, partly because it's an easy thing to fix and would lead to dramatic improvements in my performance, partly because I want to motivate myself with success from the first project :)  If 95% the game is about showing up, then I need to make sure that I show up on time for the right events. For example, I should get to ACCP before 8:30am. This is not really a big deal, but going there at 9:30am or even later every morning could be a cause of dissatisfaction for the early birds. For many people, showing up early is an indicator of dedication and professionalism. It's fair that people would think so, and it would be good to get into the habit of getting up early. I know this is not how my biological clock operates, and I've been showing night owl tendencies ever since I was in first grade, so something as simple as waking up early won't be easy for me. But the point of this exercise is self-control. Although my biological clock hasn't changed since I was in first grade, my will power should have increased, to a point where getting up early against my biological clock is not an issue any more. As long as I go to bed early, this shouldn't be too hard. It's a pity that I'll have to go to bed during the hours in which my brain is most active, but it's worthwhile for developing such a good habit. Plus, this is supposed to be a healthier way to live.  To take this idea of showing up a bit further, if I'm supposed to show up for following up with a project, I should do so. With Terri's interview, for example, I should give her some feedback within a week -- which means I need to go to her tomorrow to see if I captured what she said correctly. I should also follow up with Gloria to see if there needs to be any further changes, with Ed about the email he sent me, with Jeanie and Jon about the evaluation forms that they sent. This sounds so basic, but I have a tendency of being quiet unless I have to respond. Are these from the pop Chinese cultural icons of beauties who are attractive because they are so quiet and (therefore) mysterious? I've got to remember that this is the American workplace, not a Chinese social scene. It's time to save the shy, feminine, mysterious quality for CSSA parties, and start honing my responsive, reliable side for my career :)
