As i started my day out by finding out that i couldn't even get a job at bulk barn...i thought the day would get only worse...but here are the things that made me feel better 1-downloading "humping around"by Bobby Brown-self explainatory 2- finding out that there is a sticker explaining not to put babies in tubberware...with a picture no less! 3-lips heart lips! 4-the fat ppl that work at wal-mart....do i really have to be wearing a one piece joggin suit when i go on job interviews now?
