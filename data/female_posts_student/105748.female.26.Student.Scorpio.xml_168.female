We watched it on Saturday night and went to watch  Rush Hour 2  in the theaters the following day. Brian had previously watched it with his dad, but he didn't mind watching it again. In part, because there were several Chinese people in the theater when they went the first time and they would start laughing before everyone else in the theater (they didn't have to wait for the translations). It annoyed the crap out of him !  It was a lot of fun. I love the out-takes at the end of the movie. Out-takes are always funny !     Tonight's DVD rentals are  Memento  and  Exit Wounds . Both movies came highly recommended.  Memento , by Glee and Louie (our favorite video store employee) and  Exit Wounds  by Brian's father David and our friend Richard. I didn't get a chance to watch  Memento  in the theaters as Glee had recommended a few months ago. I'm glad that it's now available to rent.  =)
