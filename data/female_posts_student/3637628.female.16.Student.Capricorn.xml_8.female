Good thing i never returned my copy at the end of last year.  I got my report card though, and i think it was because i gave Mr. Dietrich the COOLEST DINOSAUR CARD!!!  it had a fossil of a prehistoric cave bear (that stood a little bit like him) and it was closed with a triceratops sticker that said "that's nice".    Before i start, i'd like to introduce you to a new blog, her name is chrissie's blog, and this is her first time on the internet.  I'd like you to give her a warm welcome.  Alright chrissie's blog, you can take your seat now.  I believe there's one right in front of moira's blog in the links on the side.     1.  Reader appreciation  I'm gonna talk a little about your comments, and to kick things off, i'm going post my first picture ever!!

Please don't tell me that you learned something from that horrible piece        of crap teacher    *me interrupting.  No, i didn't, i just threw myself into working on the computer to avoid using my senses around him.  shudder*          First off, the guy never got over how "crazy them punk-rappin'-skateboardin'-nosepickin'-tamagotchi-playing kids are these-a-days."  He was constantly complaining about how kids don't recycle and get strange rushes from hanging their butt cheaks out their pants.  God he would never shut up about it.     *Totally right on this point.  But in my case, it was worse.  I had him for homeroom, and it was filled with what he considered prime examples of kids these-a-days.  Just a guess, but you probably had him in the first half of the day, when he was still reeling from our homeroom.   Not only would he get on his soapbox about it, but he would try to talk to ME about it, as if i was the only sensible one in the room.  I would move computers and go to theonion.com.  Anything i could do to avoid him*          Plus, he really knew jack shit about computers.  Everytime he pronounced gif with a hard G like "gift" i would cringe.  It's pronounced "jiff"    *well, he's an idiot, and a douchebag, what do you expect?  All of his HTML projects had mistakes in them too.  HUGE mistakes.  thats why no one's pages worked and they all looked like shit when ya finished*    Supprisingly though, some teachers google their names to see if anyone makes fun of them.     *Maybe you all have been wondering why i have stayed on the topic of Mr. Ripkey in this post.  It is in the hopes that he googles his name to see if anyone makes fun of him.  My Highest aspiration with this blog is to see Mr. Ripkey's enraged reply to this post.   Maybe if i mention his name enough, it will show up on google.*      Alright guys, final comment for today   At 10:19 PM, chris said...      I had to make a comment so it would be the 5th one.  YOU BETTER POST NOW OR I'LL BEAT YOU WITH A SPATULA AND HAD YOU BY YOUR EYELIDS!!!!...I'LL EAT YOUR SOUL TOO!!!MWHAHAHAHAHA     *wow, thats just...  beautiful. *      Alright, now it's time for the story of the big shots  My dad's play is excellent.  It consists of two charachters named Mara and Jake.  One is an assistant speech writer, one is an immigrant janitor.  On the day of the reading,  The first three guests, Jefferson, Carl, and Jessica were scheduled to arrive at noon.  We would do an initial reading, break for lunch, then discuss until the 'constructive audience' arrived at three.  After rampantly cleaning house all week, katie and matt had to go to scranton for his grandparent's 50th anniversary, so it was just me and my parents (my brother, at this point, would say "what am i, a next door neighbor?")  My dad was being a nervous nellie, complaining about everything he had to do, while standing in the entrance to a room with his coffee saying "Theres some marbles on the ground there.  Yep."  After I called him 'Efficiency Jim' and thanked him for micromanaging, he decided he had better go food shopping to get out of the house.    The first reading was splendiferous.  Jefferson was Jake, Jessica was Mara, and Carl (the director) was there to take notes.  My dad also took notes, while my mom read stage directions and I timed it.  Every five minutes i wrote down where we were, so they could time scenes and tighten up the dialogue if they needed to.  Now, the first reading was excellent.  Jefferson was superb, despite the fact he needed to do an accent, and this was the first time he had seen the script.  Jessica however, was not so good.  She didn't completely understand her phrasing and the script seemed a little beyond her grasp.  We figured that she would tighten it up a bit before the second reading.  The reading was great.  Artistic managers, directors, and artistic assistants as far as the eye could see.  Jessica was still off though, and managed to make everyone in attendance confused about Mara's charachter.  But otherwise, it was a very informative and constructive meeting  it was also funny to see myself running around like a little maid, i refferred to myself as a slavechild more than once.  With my parents playing host, there was no one else to set up plates, refill bowls and glasses, refresh hor de... ordvou... ORDERVES.  The most hectic part of my job was during the second reading, when i had to be laying out platters of lunchmeat and vegtables WHILE keeping up with the script and writing down every five minutes.  after the reading, my mom popped open the wine.  as six o' clock (and my appointment at the fair with chrissie) drew nearer, the bottles got emptier and emptier, and the discussion turned from the play to wedding pictures of my parents in 1977.  When i left with chrissie, i was not sorely missed!!

Well, it's almost over and i believe i've met them.    Anyway  We have a solid plot now, and it's fairly funny.
