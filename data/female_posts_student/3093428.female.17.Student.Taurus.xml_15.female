FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!!  MY WHOLE LIFE!!  That DOES feel good.  I made two mix CDs. One yesterday and one today. It made me happy. I designed a rad cover for both of them, with the track listing on it and a super awesome title for each CD. And then I finished burning the CDs and write the title on the CD with a  Sharpie marker , in neat little  B L O C K  letters. It's simple things like making a mix CD that make my  heart  smile.  I drove a lot today and yesterday. Remember how I said I talked a lot about driving the other day, with my parents? Well, I said something like, "I'm never allowed to ask to drive, and you never offer to let me drive, so I never get any practice!", so I guess my mom agreed, because she handed the keys to me many, MANY times today. She even let me start up the car and bring it around to the front of the building, while she went to the washroom! My brother sat in the backseat because he was afraid of sitting in the front. It was amusing. And I couldn't stop smiling. Because it was the first time I'd driven anyone ANYWHERE before (that is, without an adult in the car).  Sam, how about you and I go have some Teen Burgers on Wednesday before we meet with Chels for Lit study session? I have coupons that are going to expire soon and I don't want them to be discarded without having fulfilled their life's purpose.  2-for-1 TEEN BURGERS !!  Matt, I'm not angry about the cups being thrown. It just bugs me. Imagine how I feel. If you guys trash the place on a regular basis with slurpee cups, my caretaker will get mad and have to talk to me about it. Plus, are you guys coming to visit me or drop off garbage before church? That's just my take on it. I'm your friend, not your maid. I don't come to your house and throw slurpee cups around! (But then again, I've never been to your place. But when I come over this summer, I'm not going to be throwing slurpee cups around!) So I accept your apology and no biggie, but think about it first. Litter is BAD. Don't make me get all hippie on you! :D
