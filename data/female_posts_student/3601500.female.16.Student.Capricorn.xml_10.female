I decided to drop one science next year.  So, my exams schedule is :  Monday: Chemistry (lab and written... we'll see how that works out...)  Note before exam: between 79-85% Tuesday: Physics (damned physics will kill me - so I drop them)   Note before exam: between 79-85% Wednesday: Biology (easy, easy, I knew everything we learned...)  Note before exam: between 90-95% Thursday: French (I'm the best in French. bwaha. ha. ha.)  Note before exam: between 85-90%                         *I'm only guessing my notes before exam, taking in considerating all my tests...  Did I mention I slept only 4 hours last night (I mean, this morning)? I had to do a physics 'cheat-sheet', a sheet on which you write whatever you like (notes), allowed on the exam. I always wait til the last minute. Physics is the only exam which worries me (my note is only this high because I did well lately... I really need to study the previous chapters...).  The end of school, the beginning of studying.
