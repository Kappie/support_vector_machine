It made some good points that were worth internalizing; however, I thought the book was suggesting a lifestyle that only clergy could relate to.  It talked about totally surrendering one's life to God, and that if every aspect of one's life is not driven towards pleasing God, then one will never find happiness.  One section I really had a problem with was entitled, "We Bring God Glory By Loving Other Believers."  What about Jesus' pivotal message of loving your enemy?  Should we then despise non-Christians and pay no atttention to them?  I was hoping for some explanation in the section, but was left with the same feeling as when I read the title: utter disgust.  My parents seem to love the book, anxiously asking one another everyday, "Have you read it yet today?"  Give me a break!  The book is more disturbing than life-changing!  Don't waste your time and money on this one.
