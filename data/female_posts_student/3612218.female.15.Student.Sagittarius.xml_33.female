Im so.. so afraid.  I dont wanna lose a thing. I dont wanna fall asleep thinking that you'll be there for me. Cuz, im so so afraid to lose you. Somewhere in my mind, there is a picture of you. Im thinking of you..  I want to be there for you, always and forever. Just lookin at you, makes me feel so fine.    My feelings are so strong, it pains my heart knowing how you feel. Simply cuz i love you.. My heart will go on.  Im falling so hard, falling so hard for you.  .. i love you. it aint no fling.  you cant lose wad you never had? true...? -shakes head-
