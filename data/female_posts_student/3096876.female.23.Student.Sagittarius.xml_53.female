Steve's funeral is on Monday.  I'll be carpooling with people from work, and we were told today that as a salute to Steve, his wife wants us all to wear jeans and our favorite t-shirt.  'Cause that's just the kind of guy Steve was, and since we obviously didn't do enough for him while he was alive, we ought to at least fulfill this.  I'm still just so ... heartbroken over this.  I try to picture what his last moments must have been like.  Was he in pain or was he strong and resolute at that point?  I have such a hard time understanding what kind of pain seems so hopeless that there's no solution.  A really hard time.  To think that he was this fantastic man, loved by so many, but who felt like he was so alone, is the most tragic thing I've ever heard of.  It makes me so grateful for all the people that I know I can count on--people who can't always offer solutions, but who can at least offer a laugh.  That's the best part about good friends, no?  My parents have been absolutely the most insensitive people lately.  Like, for Pete's sake, the surgery that I had, and they never even asked about it!  All I've heard in the weeks since has been the toothache that my Mom got  very coincidentally  the night before my surgery.  Granted, she had to have a root-canal, so it's not like she made it up, she just seemed to completely forget about me.  She also made some pretty dumb-ass comments to me when I told her about Steve.  Comments of the "What the fuck, why didn't you (collectively) notice?" variety.   Fuck off, Mom, like that's not what's been going through the heads of every person he ever knew.   I keep thinking that it's something related to her.  My behavior has been pretty much the same, in fact I've been doing a lot more to help her out, especially since I'm not in Milton half the time anymore.  She's been really forgetful, as well as really moody, so it's gotta be either THE CHANGE or maybe a thyroid problem?  But of course, like any woman, I know that the thought of someone ever blaming a woman's mood on a her cycle is enough to warrant daggers to the eyes.  So I'll keep my mouth shut.  I hope, I hope, I hope she figures it out.  I've got my post-op chit-chat with my doc next Wednesday.  We'll get to talk about what he saw and what he found and what the next steps are.  Oh, dear bloggy, I really hope that everything is ok.  I really hope he doesn't say " oops !" or " How about some more surgery ?" or " wait, I knew I forget to tell you something... "  I'm usually such an optimist, but this stuff has just got me petrified beyond belief.  I don't wanna die, and I wanna have kids.  As long as nothing happens counter to that, life is sweet.  Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.   OK, enough of that.  Worrying sure as fuck won't help me sleep, and it won't change anything anyway.  I think Ally is back with her loser boyfriend.  And, I'm pretty damn sure that he's not working.  Again.  At least this job lasted for almost two months.  That's a record for Jeff.  The lazy shit.  There go Ally's paycheques for the rest of the summer.  I wish that asshole would just leave her alone.  I wish Ally would place a higher value on herself and stop dating such retawds.  Faak.  So many things in life I wish I could change and can't.  It's impossible to read this blog without feeling a little depressed, so maybe on that note I'll put an end to this misery (and log-out).  I'll try back in a few days when things don't seem so grim.  Maybe Sunday--Mike's taking me out for a super-fun-day tomorrow.  He owes me BIG TIME!  He's been working so much lately, not getting home until 8 or 9 or even 11 at night!  Then getting up at 6 the next morning and doing it all over again.  He'll pick me up on his way home, then drop me off on his way out to work again.  I hate just getting to sleep next to the guy, I wanna actually go out on the town with him, dammit!  So luckily he's also feeling the same way, so Saturday is our day.  No one elses, just ours.  It should be a really good day, and either way, my faithful blog-readers, you'll hear about it.
