My mind runneths over but Ive been feeling outta the loop w/ a dear dear loved one. Things seem as if they are changing and change to me is scary. It could be just me and my over active over worrying mind, but I dont feel as if we talk the same.  :(  and this saddens me because this person is the one thing i wanna hold onto the most..But is expecting that someone to hold onto you as well too much to be asking..to much to expect? Why when it comes to love things get complicated and confusing ..and why does sometimes your mind play tricks on you..whispering things to you, that you in fact know arent true yet the more you hear them you wonder as well? Well..That feeling Sucks. If Im wrong I wish someone could scream it or at least come stamp it on my face so when i look in the mirror i see..!
