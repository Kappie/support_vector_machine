I miss him more than the world and wish I could of at leaast said goodbye and this is my way of expressing my feelings.     This guy was close,     He made me laugh and cry more than most,     Just the other day,     The death angel took him away,     I look over my shoulder,     A shiver makes me colder,     Knowing he is there,     that guy still is close,     I will cry in grief of him almost as much of his brother,     His mother and father recieved a call.          A call which I also soon recieved,     My mind could not comprehend,     A silencesoon exsistedbetween the people on each line,     A staggering broken heart,     This heart tears,     Through the shredder it goes,     Another tissue,     Another tear,     I know he is near,     This friend to whom I was close.
