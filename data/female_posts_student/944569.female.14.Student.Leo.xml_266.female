Are interested for a short while.  Post up a few words. and their short attention spans are cut off.  Did you guys know that blogs are for thoughts like philosophy?  I mean, who wants to read the life story of six tfsers? huh? HUH?  Well, except for that weird girl in gr 6 who stalks me...*looks over shoulder cautiously*
