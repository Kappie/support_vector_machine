Since I wasn't really in any rush, I sat down and watched the first half of the show with them. I really did have to see what all the hoopla surrounding this show was all about. Apparently, this particular episode was the season premeire of Dead Like Me's second season on Showtime. After a couple of minutes, I was intrigued. Unfortunately, since I had to go downtown, I had to stop watching the show. But, I made plans to watch the episode the next day on Showtime on Demand.  After watching the episode again, but, this time, in full, I discovered that the series was definitely worth watching. Sadly, Showtime didn't have the first season available on demand, so I made the impulse decision to purchase the entire first season on DVD (I know, I know. Impulse decisions and me? Who would have thought?). I did this promptly, using Barnes and Nobles. A couple of days later, the DVD set arrived (Yay for faster delivery in Manhattan). I have since watched the Pilot episode and I remain in awe. This show kicks ass.  Now, excuse me, I must go watch Episode 2.
