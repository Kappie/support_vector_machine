(meh.) we went to taco bell and pirates of the carribbean. that's all geoff knows. yep. well we all know the difference between a 10 second kiss and a 3 minute make-out session. I'm gonna kill nate. seriously. makes me sound like i threw myself at him, unwanted and kissed him first. lets  look at some of the things nate said to me:  Brekenmuth (1:57:49 PM): if anything, that kiss was my fault, i started it  then nate on mikes comments on my blog: Brekenmuth (1:58:58 PM): and besides, mike said those things. . .mike says a lot of things. . . Brekenmuth (1:59:10 PM): and half of which are just coming out of his ass  I'm so sick of his 2-faced bull shit to save his own ass, because everyone knows he's been lying. and I can back my shit up. oh god, i'm so angry.
