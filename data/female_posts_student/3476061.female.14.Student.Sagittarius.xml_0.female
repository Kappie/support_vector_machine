It may sound all too simple but pouring glue in random objects, waiting for it to dry, then peeling it off is quite fascinating. The other day i made a condom out of glue. It was pretty interesting.   I got this new shaving creme that i desperatly needed b/c ive been using conditioner and my bros shavin stuff for a week. It smells really good so i was tempted to try a lil bit. Needless to say, i fell into the temptation and it was grody. Not everything that smells good tastes good...remember that.   I believe that most of our girl "issues" have been resolved. Theres only one person who i need to talk to...peanut. I think that we've just been spending so much time together that everyone is PMSing at the exact same time. When you have too much estrogen together the outcome is always negative. (arent u proud of me using all these big words)  alright well im off to do w/e it is im supposed to be doing. i might end up at the movies tonight or the pool. later days
