I've always said I'm always gonna stay here but now that I think about it, theres nothing here. I only wanna stay here because of friends, not family just my friends. I did absolutely nothing today, John called last night at like 12 and we talked for like 30 mins. He was suppose to call at 12 today but didn't call till 2:30. I drove up to Alex's to go get here and we left to go up to walgreens. I got some film and took some pictures to put on here. Already took the film up there to get developed so hopefully I'll have em soon. But after we got back from walgreens we just sat around on the porch until John came over to Man's house. It still was boring, Me  Alex went down there and he wasn't even talkin about nothing so we left. And now I'm home, doing absolutely nothing. Ain't nobody at home, Michelle, Aaron, Sterling, Travis, Lasha, Mario, Bryan, Amy, .. dunno where any of em are. Cell phone ain't on so they can't call me :(
