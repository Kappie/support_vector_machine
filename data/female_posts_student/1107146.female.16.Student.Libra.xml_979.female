Rosie, call me if you want to talk.  I've spent the last couple of days watching the Westminister Dog Show on USA.  The Boxer came in third.  "Mick" the blue terrier one.  He was really good.  Yeah, well, you see what my life has come to.  So, what is happening with yall? I can't really say anything since my life consists of sleeping and watching dog shows.  Don't even eat.  I've lost an official 10 pounds now.  Don't really look that different though.  'Tis too bad.  I'll see yall sometime this month, I hope, I hope. Come visit me or at least call!
