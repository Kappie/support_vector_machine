I watched Spirited Away today and it made me so sad about not being able to live that way. Wouldn't it be nice, amazing adventures and romances and working towards an exciting goal that gives you some kind of wonderful thing. Just a fairy tale, a big fairy tale and just nothing but having this life experience. I want a fairy tale. I guess I could make my life into one couldn't I? Loose weight, overcome obstacles to learn what I really want to be, and have a sucsessfull life with love and I dunno everything. Ooch. That first part, the loosing weight. Ha Ha No. I like myself like this a little. I mean I don't, and it gives me problems, but I don't honestly care. Well, fairytale less and alone again. Kayle And they lived happily ever after.
