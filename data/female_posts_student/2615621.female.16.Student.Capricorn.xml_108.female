Theres people behind us that sound like snakes...and it gets on my nerves and its weird. i dont like it. Then, theres a hot guy that sits behind me at like a diagonal, i tend to always turn and look at him through out the service..haha im sure he notices, i mean, how couldnt u? but i dont care, hes hot. hahah hes a skater, and he has the coolest hair. its sandy colored and kinda curly at the ends, maybe wave-y is better to use. but hes hot!! haha im tempted to ask him his name next week. After the jesus pep rally dad and i went to the mall and i found a Dooney and Burke purse i want REALLY bad and its $155 or a lil more...i can make that in about a lil over a week!! hahaha but i think i'll check out the guitars down the street and if they are reasonably priced i'll get one of those first and get the purse later. There is a lil purse, its tiny with a strap on it, something like u'd take to a bar with ur id and lip gloss in it and theres a wallet, both around $55. I might as well go all out and get the purse if im gonna spend that kinda money. lol   All i could really think about today was what bailey and joe were saying or have said to danny today. They spent forever on the phone last nite talkin over what they would say to him. GOSH i hope they said good things and hes intrested. lol WELL..i would know what all happened if one of them would get the hell online!! but nooo..make julia wait. i want everything to work out...even if he was ugly (and i hear hes a cutie) it really wouldnt matter, cuz i mean..he fits the list!!! haha and that must say something about him if he can fit my stupid lil list that was meant to be funny not really happen. And u can make boys cute..hell, i could take an ugly boy and make him hot hahaha Anyways, wish me luck!!! :D
