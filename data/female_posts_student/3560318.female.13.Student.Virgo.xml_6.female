CHAD! i got to know him pretty well tonight. hes an awesome kid. we hung out with us the whole time. im glad i got to meet him. but anyways. we walked around for soo long. i saw alot of people i havent seen in forever! it was crazy! people that i accually cared about seeing were: nathan, brandon, katie, ashley, alicia...and other people. i cant remember right now because today has totally made me tired. yeah we had alot of fun...bridgette and chad are awesome.  ill talk to you later....                       aLySsA*
