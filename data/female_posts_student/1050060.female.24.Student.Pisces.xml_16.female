Well i know someone who tryed to help out these street kids out. She gave them a place to live for a month. She did this so they could pick money and find a place to live. Well last night the teens decided to bring over a friend at 2AM. My friend got a little upset and in the morning told them that they had to leave. So in other words she kicked them out. I totally understand her and her decision. People try to help other people and these other people don't even give a shit. They got a free ride and i guess that is what they wanted. That is all for now. Have a good day! Peace out!
