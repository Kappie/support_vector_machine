I got it out just in time to. But I felt so scrodie...I didn't even do a thing with my hair...to lazy I guess. So I came back home changed into my suit and laid out from 1-3:45. I bet I saw 3 clouds thats it. It was soo great! The bugs weren't annoying and there was a breeze to keep me cool. They even played "What A Beautiful Day" on the radio. LoL...Good song actually. So yeah...It was nice...Except now...My back is super burnt in the places I couldn't get sun screen. And just now it started to hurt. Oh well...Im alot tanner everywhere else. I love the sun. Now if only everyday this summer would be this nice. *sigh* Summer is great! :D Well...I guess we're gonna be eatin supper soon....so I better go....
