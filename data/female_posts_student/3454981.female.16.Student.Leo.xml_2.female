I sort of wish it was like old times again, where a guy would send flowers to a girl that symbolized something like their intentions. And leading someone on could only last for so long. Or the simple angle of a fan could ask the questions you don't want to voice. And when at a dinner party, when a girl stood up, the guys at the table would even stop what they were saying and stand up as well---as a sign of respect and courtesy and downright sweet chivalry.   So I have decided to dedicate today's post to all I know about the language of flowers; if anyone actually reads this, then this is a message for all you guys(if any):  Flower language= brownie points w/ any girl message for girls: tell your boyfriend or whoever about flower language.
