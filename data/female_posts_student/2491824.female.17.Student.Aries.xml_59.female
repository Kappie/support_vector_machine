Even with more than three words.  I'm stupid.  We have show tomorrow. Well, it's not really a show. But it's the real deal. The directors are going to be graded.  I'm nervous.  Jordan and I made each other laugh--I don't think it was  too  noticable though--while we were on stage at our last run-through. He wouldn't give me his pants.  I think you'd have to see the show to understand.  Claire, our director, told me that I have to get his pants off him even if it means pushing him down on the couch and taking them off of him myself.. Believe it or not, the scene is not sexual in the slightest way.   You should see it. It'll be good.  Plus you'll see six plays for $3. Not bad, eh? It's Tuesday, 6 o-clock at Jefferson.
