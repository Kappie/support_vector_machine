My initial reaction was to say "No, sorry, but I don't have any money on me", but without hesitation, he insisted on doing it so I gave him my brush and he did a damn find job of it.  When all was done, he gracefully left without saying a word.  As I sat down waiting for my car to warm up, I started to think about his motivation for doing it.  The pessimist in me said that he wanted me to remember him so that next time we meet, I might give him some cash.  The optimist says that perhaps he was doing a fellow human a kind favor.  Alternatively, he may just have been really bored!!  I guess I won't really know until we meet again.  I will obviously remember him, but will he remember me?  Will he ask me for a handout?  Or will this memory fade into nothingness like so many others?  Whatever happenes, this one small gesture has impacted my life in a semi-meaningful way.  I hope we do meet up again!  3d
