I'll get to bond with a bunch of girls from my youth church, hopefully build new friendships. AND I get to go to a Mariners/Red Sox game, I not partial to the Mariners (especially not this season) and the Red Sox are okay (I would rather see the White Sox), but I love baseball, so I'm excited for that. And then we're going to Pike's Place, yay for throwing fish!! I'll post about everything we did and probably put some pictures up (speaking of that...how do you post pics, lol, i don't know how). So until Friday, goodbye all and have a good week...and Michelle, I'm so sad you're not going! I'll call you every night! I'm bringing my cell just for you! ;-D
