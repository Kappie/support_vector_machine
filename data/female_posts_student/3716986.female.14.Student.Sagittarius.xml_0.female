I had rehearsals last night. And I am  crap at singing . Also, I always cough when I've been singing, which is stupid. My voice is the poopsmith. I'm in the chorus because I was too scared to audition, for aforementioned reasons, but I don't mind...  My brother has just finished Uni and got his results back yesterday. He got a first!!! He did Computer Science and he is very clever and good at that sort of stuff, so I feel there is warrant for some more exclamation marks. !!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! I'm proud of him :) Also, it must be a damn good birthday present (he's twenty-two tomorrow).  Nothing really happened today that I can remember, except my friend being very confused and frightened by herself. She really fancies this guy who she also kinda doesn't like, so you can imagine her problem... anyway...   Random Crap For The Day:  If you don't already know about these sites, you should do.  urlLink Weebl and Bob  Most people have seen at least one animation from this site, but I was watching them  years  ago before they got popular. Seriously. When I first went on there, they only had 10 episodes.  urlLink Homestar Runner  heh.  urlLink Hackles  Don't worry if you don't understand this... Can't think of any more right now.
