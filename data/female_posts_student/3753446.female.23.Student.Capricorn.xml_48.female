I went to Bath and Body Works, the Limited, American Eagle, Victoria's Secret (Semi Annual Sale again baby!), Banana Republic, and Lazarus (store closing sale, yay!). It was all I could do to tear myself away from Express, Forever 21 and Kaufmanns. And now that I've said all that, I'm thinking, damn, my life belongs in a teen mag.   All personal greed aside, I did do a very good deed today. My friend Kat and I made an unbeatable care package for our dear friend Crystan who is serving overseas in Tikrit. We know the "new" military Crystan has to be professional and official and stuff, but deep down we know she has a thing for all items neon, toe socks, and coloring books. So of course we're sending them over. I wish I could see the customs officials when they scan our package to find Dunkaroos, Goldfish crackers, Crayola Markers, and a set of pink pajamas. And of course, an Elmo coloring book. Its not the typical cigs and beer care package one might expect. I can't wait to hear if she got it! Kat and I totally agreed that its more fun buying gifts for friends than shopping for yourself. The reward is in the thought.  And finally, as we shopped for a card for Crystan (Ultimately settling on two: "Friends Forever ... In any kind of weather" and "All I wish for are 1) World Peace and 2) You to come back.... But I can do without world peace."), I ran into the following card. Enjoy!  Outside: Girlfriend, we're at an age where if the gynecologist says "You have acute vaginitis." Inside: "We say THANKS!"  I thot it was mighty cute. Cute enough for a vaginitis. Aight thats it for tonight. Time to rack my brains. THANKS Y'ALL!
