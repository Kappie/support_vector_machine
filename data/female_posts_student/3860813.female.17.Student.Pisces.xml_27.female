"i've already been here.." i tell myself..   I'M WALKING IN CIRCLES...  wanting...   i want to find a way..   i want answers to questions...   is life real? or just a mere fantasy?!   i'm clueless...  living...   i'm living in a place of unfamiliarity... where all are strangers..   and everything's new...   i hide all the fears i have...   PRETENTIOUS.. that's what i am..   this is my world.. this is my life...  i search for a destination.. i want to find a way.. i live with what's new to me..  now, this is what i know... in myself... i  SEARCH  for the  WANT  to  LIVE ...
