It was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I was not looking forward to this event at all, but it was actually kind of nice.  The food was good (it was at Trio, a restaurant in NYC on 33rd between Lexington and 3rd - run by a St. John's Law School and Journal alum), I finally got to meet some of the people on the Journal, and the conversation was nice and actually veered away from the standard law school fare of classes, professors, and complaining about the amount of work.  There was a speaker - Judge Carmen from the Court of International Trade - and he was good as well, though I was sitting at a very odd, uncomfortable angle throughout his speech.  Wednesday is normally my worst day, but yesterday was even worse than normal.  My alarm didn't go off, so I missed my first class.  Then, I had a rather unpleasant commuting experience, which is probably not fit for blogging.  Then a full day of hurring through my journal assignment and re-reading the Evidence stuff for class.  Found out that, as usual, the school doesn't tell us anything, and that registration for the summer (when I have to take class, having started in January instead of the Fall like all the other 2Ls) starts on Monday.  More unpleasantness ensued with that.   Finally, I got home and called my Mom, easily the best part of the day.  I watched a little HBO - for once, Bill Maher did not annoy me to death.  Then, I snuggled up in bed and drifted off to sleep.    And now we're at today.  I'm waiting for this lady from school to call me back, and so far she hasn't, so I'm a little bit annoyed by that.  But I suppose there is still time.  Only there isn't, since if I want to do an Externship this summer (I figure if I'm not getting paid for work I might as well at least get credit) I need to meet with the professor by tomorrow, and if she doesn't call me back, it's going to be hard to schedule a meeting.   I may have to take matters into my own hands and just go up to the office to schedule it in person.  But since I've got 10 million other things to do, this prospect annoys me slightly.  But we shall see.  Tonight is the Public Interest Auction at the law school.  Should be a fun time.  And this time I plan on being sober enough to remember most of it, so that's even better.
