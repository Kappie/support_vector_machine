And since I know you're reading this, study-pal, I know I said I'd print off copies for you too, but the Property exam alone's 17 damn pages, so you'll just have to use the allotment from the school, sorry.    So think I'll be going to this little discussion later about "What Women Want" because, you know, I should get that figured out at some point.  And if the interim director of the Chick's Center wants to hit on me while I'm there, that could be fun, too.  Should be good for another blog entry at least....
