I went all the way out 1604 today... got to campus an hour early (so I had parking)... found my class... sat outside the lecture hall, and wrote a letter.  Then about 30 mins before the class was to start, we all checked the hall, and no one was in there, so the few of us early birds went on in and sat down.  Then about 5 minutes before class was to start, some misc. girl yelled into the lecture hall, "Hey, there's a note out here saying TX Politics is cancelled today!"  You can not even IMAGINE the jaw-dropping action that went on in there!  Man, so... it was my only class today (Mondays and Fridays will be like that).  And so I went all the way out there for NOTHING.  That pisses me off!  Oh well... I think maybe this guy is new to UTSA and to TX.  Because for the professor it said TBA until about 5 days ago.  Otherwise I'm generally excited about classes tomorrow.  I have my Education in American Society class, my World Lit since the 16th Century class, and my Music class.  Then Wednesday I have my Wednesday only class which is and Early Childhood one... Play/Creativity/and Learning.  I'm thinking that the most difficult classes I'll have this semester (ones that would actually take effort to get an A in) will be TX Politics, and probably Education in American Society.  I'd be more worried about about the lit class, except I really LIKE english related classes.  And I've always gotten A's in those classes thus far in my college history.  It won't take any effort at all to pull an A in my music class.  Plus, I've already had that prof. before.  And the early childhood class will be a breeze.  I know all about play/creativity/learning.  I had to know about that when I worked at the child care center.    Other news, I think after a few weeks (seeing how classes are going and how demanding they are) I'm going to get a job.  I'd like to work long enough to save up money and go to England probably during Spring Break or after finals in mid May.  I'm really excited at the prospect of going.  It's either save up to do that... or seriously consider and talk to my parents about doing a study abroad in Australia attending the University of Sydney.  So, we'll see.  However, I dunno if I wanna do a semester abroad.  I'd be gone for my 22nd birthday... cause I'd leave for Australia like, July 22.  So, we'll see.  Anyhow.... I'll post more tomorrow after I meet the other professors.  We'll see how demanding this semester shall be.       urlLink  postCount('13Jan2003');
