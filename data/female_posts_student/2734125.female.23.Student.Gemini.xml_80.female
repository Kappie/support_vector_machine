There are some nights that you are glad to sleep alone, happy to be able to kick and shift and be uncomfortable and groan and get up and take a cooling shower and all that is needed to finally reach sleep alone.  Otherwise you would keep that other person up all night, poking them, talking to them, drifting in and out of confused sweaty moments.  But that is what summer nights are for.    This weekend I swam in the river.  It was cold and I got out and felt pink and new.  I felt rocks cut against my feet.  It was a fast current, tugging at my legs the way forgotten things tug at your mind.  Branches and leaves and fish swam past me in murky water that sloshed over my breasts.  My friend and I fought up current, set a goal and made it.  Did we revel in that victory?  Did we marvel at our own joy and making it?  I think that we just stepped onto the ground and continued talking about the ups and downs and grim grins of life.  That went as it should have.  My feet were tender by the time we rose, and the air that was hot closed around me like a hug of fresh dryer sheet, and I was not safe, but I was content.  I have stopped living in safety.  I don't know where I left it behind, but I realized that somewhere over the last semester I found that being without any protection made me stronger and less frightened.  The fear that I had felt for so long, a comforting lover even when we know its not, was gone, and I was not safe, but I knew it.  When we let go of safety we never have to fear safety being gone.  We can begin to expect the unexpected, stop worrying about next and maybe.  I feel more here then I have for a while.  I am treading on knifes, sword edges, and I expect that I will likely bleed before the end, and I expect that I will heal.    I need to start writing again.  Anything.  I doubt that this is read anymore, but if it is, you might be getting some of my dedication.  I was thinking to try to write in the cool of the morning this summer.  Wake up at 6:30, do some work, write and pray and be cool.  I want to store up that time of alone for when I trudge into a room full of children who are watching and needing.  Not that I mind.  I play all day, I dance and talk and make up answers to questions.  When asked what some thing at the library today was, I told a young girl that it was a retinal scanner to ensure library security.  This is good practice for being a teacher I would guess.  Too hot to write.  I feel like either my computer is melting to my thighs, or my thighs are getting sweaty enough to soak through my case.  Time to stop.  But I wanted to write tonight... and I think this has given me some ideas...
