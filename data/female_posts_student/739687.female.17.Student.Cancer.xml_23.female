And I was like "...she's taunting me...I know it!"...    Current Song: Jimmy Eat World- Sweetness   Well, not much going on right now. I'm really kinda bored, and I'm feeling very energetic and athletic...a strange thing for the same person who has sat around all summer. I will just have to get out and do something today then! Not much else is really going on lately...I'm dreading school starting back up. That is definately no fun. But I get to see everyone, so I guess it isn't so bad.  I like how it's seemingly human nature to be a hypocrite. People contradict themselves so much...that it's absolutely hilarious. Well, that's about all I have to say...
