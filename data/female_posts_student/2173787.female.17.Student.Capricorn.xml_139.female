Tonight I can't find anything of the sort to plagerize so instead I'll sculpt a song.  A song filled with minor keys speaking of isolation and frustration, lyrics mournful and steady, of loss of normalcy, of over analyzing.  I can almost hear it in my head, can almost feel it within me, and yet at the same moment feels fake and cliche.      People who can causally dismiss things bother me, but people who come up with polar opposite opinions make me feel out of it.  Add the two together and you get isolation.  What we are plays a dramtic role in what we see.  No two realities are the same, things simply can't be.  Some would dismiss the multitudes of possibilities saying that such variability makes them all false, but I choose to see it differently.  Everyone is at a different angle, a different vantage.  This allows us to see many similar things but still have an individual part of the world that no one else can see.  without seeing things from another person's vantage makes it unfair to judge their actions yet we do it daily, hourly, constantly.  There is something vaguely depressing at this perpetual cycle of misjudgements, especially when you look at our nation's penal code, but that is not the subject of this entry.
