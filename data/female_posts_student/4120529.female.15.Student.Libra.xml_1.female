You were da one who left me neglected.. apology not accepted.. add me to da broken hearts you've collected..   You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it And all the memories, so close to me, just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending..  It's nice to know you were there Thanks to all my ex for acting like you cared And making me feel like I was the only one.. It's nice to know we had it all.. Thanks for watching as I fall And letting me know we were done...  Wish I could tie u up in my shoes and make you feel unpretty too I was told I was beautiful.. But what does that mean to you?..
