Yea i know, not much competition, but a win is a win. Yesterday i had an eyedoctor appointment. O my gosh i hate the part when you get those air puffs in your eyes. She always catches me on a blink. its so annoying. But all in all my eyes were great she said. After that i went to the store to pick up a few things and then i came home and watched the yankee game. yeah it was pretty boring. I hope today is a little more exciting.
