I'll see her on friday. It will be fun. But it will all be another day. For now, I'm still waiting for today to end. But then, at midnight, it will be today again, and it will all start over. Tomorrow never comes because even at midnight, it's always today. Tomorrow may be a better day.  But will I ever reach it?
