First (for me) we walked to Ikea where we both determined that the shoes we chose were not nearly as good as we had anticipated. As well that particulare route we chose was riddled with baby diapers. Ew ew ew! Once we got to Ikea we headed straight to the resturant. We had a great breakfast and determined that the other Ikea meals looked pretty good (even though they had a rather large selection of fish beth agreed.) Then we completely scored the second floor. Beds shelves accesories chairs, it was beautiful! First we checked out the bed she wanted and the younger sister of it that our friend raven owns. Then we were confused by the replica of it in a show room that totally confused us because it seemed WAY wider (we determined that that was becuase it was the King sized version). But before we did even that we veged out in the computer chair section where we tried out various chairs. Then we wandered about a bit more, that was cool. Then we determined that we were wandering around three quarters of the floor and completely skipping the section of shelves that we were trying to get to. Finally finding the shelves we found this Uber Awesome square shelf of square shelves. It sounds really retarded but it would look really really good in bethany's new room. It would be perfect becasue she would be able to get rid of her dresser (wich was a total stitch in our sides) and her book shelf, as well she won't have to put shelves on her walls. We worked on the various reasons as to why this is the better alternative to the other options that would be applicable and expected. She's determined to get it and I'm with her on it (we didn't argue at all on anything!) We also determined that the gothic/tacky candelabra she needs to turn the room into what she wants is going ot be my christmas present to her. This means I can get other people to give her the REALLY tacky looking accesory table top holders and holders that hang on the wall to match the candelabra. It'll be so awsome. I also have to get somebody to get her the blood red camdle sticks. her mother is going ot have a christmas corinary.   Onve we were done with the second floor we headed down to the first floor and checked out the accesories. Our fet began to hurt again and we determined that the wicker garden swing looked really appealing so we sat there for quite some time. We did the usual down there, found the curtain rods and rod ends that Beth liked as well as the curtains, probably (it'll cost almost $150 with tax if she gets all the curtain stuff she wants). But then we were thrilled when we saw the perfect duvey cover for her room theme. It is completely red with these little flower things and cute little oriental loops and knots. It is beautiful. Just to make sure that it would look really good on the frame we carried it all the way to the double bed version of the frame to make sure, we got some wierd looks but damn it did look good!  I threw out the idea that black satin covers would probably look really good with the red and beth thought so to. We prety much finished it from there and headed to the bistro for frozan yogurt. I wanted to stangle a mother there, she was talking to her child like an idiot. I was frigtened how does this woman expect her child to grow up with a decent vocabulary?   We travelled over to Linens'N Things and saw some neet stuff but really spent our time searching for the bathroom (the one at Ikea was closed) The thing was hidden. We did see this really cool bed tent made of velvet, gauze, and beading, it was great! beth plans on saving up for it.   There was nothing spectaculare about Home Sense. They did bother me with the fact that they already had halloween stuff up. Really that is pretty bad, it's the beginning of August. After that we begged my dad to pick us up because both of our feet were crazy sore. I'm blistered all over. my feet. We vegitated for some time after, on my bed. It was good. We just sat there, blah. Yay. Then beth headed home, I think that she is stopping at Wal-Mart to chek out the different shades of beige.   Well I'm off now.
