Her and my dad are leaving tuesday for Illinois, I decided not to go with them.  But my brother will be up Wednesday so that's alright.  My dads parents were going to come for thanksgiving, along with some aunts, uncles and cousins from his side, and now they won't be coming and I don't know what I'm doing.  Thanksgiving will be kind of odd, considering my mom won't be cooking for us this year.  Oh well though.    I really should be working on my homework.  That would probably be best.
