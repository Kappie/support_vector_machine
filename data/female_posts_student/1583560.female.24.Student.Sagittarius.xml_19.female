While searching for my hotel (the streets here are horrendous) I was listening to a radio talk show on some AM station... The show was about lobsters, and fisherman's and scientist's discoveries about lobsters. During the show I realized what would be the perfect job for me; I should learn pointless useless facts and forget them again. I love doing that. Listening to random crap on the radio, or reading an obscure (but well written) book, or whatever... But then... This is key... I forget so much of what I learn. See, I learned all about lobster's sex life, scientist's recent methods of studying the lobsters, fisherman's method of tagging the lobsters, and a bunch of other facts that I can't tell you about because I have forgotten most of it. I somehow don't think this is going to be all that marketable... Ok, off to the internet to learn some more obscure and immediately forgotten trivia. Maybe I should spend more time thinking about my career goals too....
