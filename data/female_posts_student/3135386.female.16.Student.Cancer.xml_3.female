When did life become so screwed up? It's strange. I was venting some of my anger out, how I hate how people take advantage over other people and use them, how they don't realize how lucky they truely are. I know life isn't fair, but why can't it be?  I have a goal I'm aiming for. To be a long-term Rotary exchanger. But I know for reasons, stuff that it wouldn't be fair to vent on here, I may not get to fullfill my dream.  Why does it seem that some people get all the luck in life? Why are some people blessed with all these amazing talents, and skills and items, and they just waste them?  I think the thing that bugs me the most, is sometimes I see these traits in myself also...  Why can't life be like my logic puzzles? If you have 'a' and you add 'b' the result is 'c'. Simple. *sigh*  Only 48 more days...
