At any rate, things are coming along nicely... tomorrow Angela, Kristen and I are picking up the stuff from the Support Resource Center at 8am and taking it over to Steubing!!!  Afterwards I'm heading home to shower and get ready for work from 1-5:15.  Yep, it'll be a full day... but, it's gotta be done.  I'm getting excited about seeing the kids again... I can't wait!  I've missed them all... even the ones that gave me a hard time last year... I really miss Josh Towell... I wonder how his summer has gone.  Anyhow, I have a pretty packed week... gotta take a few more training classes... and Thursday I'm teaching a class on "Listening to Children."  Then Friday morning I have my CPR training... (I'm planning on going over my basics and checklist beforehand so it's really easy!  I mean, my parents paid money for me to take First Aid/CPR for a reason from UTSA!)  Then from 4-6:30 Angela and I will be at a table in the cafeteria at Steubing for the "Meet the Parents" night... I'm hoping a few of the new kids' parents will stop by and say hello... I wanna start that good raport early.  I'm really excited... really, really excited!  I've gotten a bunch of little bins ready for different things... we're going to start this year nice and organized!  And it'll stay intact til May 2005... and I mean it!  Okay... I need to go to bed now... because I have to be up early as HELL tomorrow morning...
