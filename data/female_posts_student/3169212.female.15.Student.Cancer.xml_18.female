Hito said standing thinking for a moment, "Did you go to 'The High School for Demonic Creatures and Various Other Creatures not Able to be Classified as Humans, Tokyo Branch?"  "Yep yep!!" Baka said cheerily, "And my bestest friend went there to Saki-"  Hito covered her mouth shaking her head depressed, "I don't go by that name anymore, I dropped that name...125 years ago. don't ask"  "Saki!! IT'S REEEEEEEEEALLY YOU?" Baka said praticly jumping up and down  "DON'T CALL ME SAKI!! and yeah, It's me" she said dropping her head as baka hugged her Hito tapping her arm  "What is it my Best-y-est Friend?' She asked smiling  "air!" Hito said weakly   Hiei walked up to Hito as Baka released her, "You went to high school?"  "Yep, in college i majored in pyrotecnichs and explosives and weapons I miss those days."  "The good old days when we worshiped Baccius...how i miss them. I'll be fine" Baka said mock holding back tears  "Baccius, Who's Baccius, you?" Kurama said pointing to Baka  "No!! Baccius is the Greek god of Drunkeness and WILD PARTYING!!" Hito said excited, then quickly returning the nearly emotionless normal state  "we should really try and find the others, it's getting dark. We need to set up a camp or something" Hiei said, turning and dissapearing  "What's going on?" Baka asked as Hiei dissapeared  "The rest of our group, a few friends of ours. He's right we should try to find them. Keep your eyes out for anything." Kurama said walking on down the path the two odd demons catching up with him quickly.
