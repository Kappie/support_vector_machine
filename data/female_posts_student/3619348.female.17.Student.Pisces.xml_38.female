Spent yesterday in Cedar rapids with the Chicas, bought some clothes, saw ‘Spiderman2’, went to Target, and of course Emily insisted on Arbys, it’s a ‘Studer Sibling Classic’ as we would say. Good old classic fun. Did the pool thing today, the girl from the homeschool group who shall not be named was there.  She talked to me, and I had to respond and pretend to be interested and what not…truly the grace of god got me through it.  That girl is the essence of cheekiness and mood swings.  You who know me well know who this girl is.  Blah and things.  ***  Conversations from the hood that make me laugh inside and out.    Camille:  Ew, Laura makes me feel dirty. Emily:  I know it’s like just look at her. Camille:  Ew.  ***  Mom:  …so the bear takes the hedgehog back to his lodge and puts him on his straw –like bed thing… Camille:  Wait, wait, wait…is this a ‘co-ed’ lodge?     Mom: Well they’re all boys…  So I guess they could be gay… Camille:  Yeah, because these days ‘co-ed’ doesn’t mean a thing.  ***  Mom: …wow… Emily:  Mom, you can’t say ‘wow’ anymore, it isn’t the thing. Camille:  Yeah, now you have to say ‘She bang biz ba boo’ to be hip. Mom:  Well I’m afraid I’m not going to do that.  ***  Mom:  Are you sure you don’t want any? Camille:  No I’m fine, if I start then I won’t want to stop…so I should probably just stay away from drugs…and food… and alchohol…and sex… Mom:  *Laughs head off*
