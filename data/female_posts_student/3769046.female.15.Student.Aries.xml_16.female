That, I will never know. Bleh. Don't want to think about that. Told my parents that I would concentrate on school before thinking about that. So I have to stay true to my word to my parents. And I do think that I may stay at st pats 'til I graduate..=). Yes, I love this. Thank-you god. I promise to do those things in that very heart-felt paragraph. I do promise to do well. And I promise to try my hardest. And now, I must enjoy summer time..=).
