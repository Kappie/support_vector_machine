His size was good, 6 lbs 2 ounces (exactly the weight Felicity was on Monday) and he is doing good! The only trouble they are running up against is that he has not quite got the sucking and swallowing down on his own yet and his digestive tract isn't quite developed yet. He will probably be admitted to the hospital until the problem is resolved. But otherwise he is the newest addition to our family!  I was lying in bed last night (this morning) pondering many a thing. My mind wandered to my friend Tyler. He and I go quite a ways back. Tyler was my first boyfriend and we were together a year and a half. It has been years since we have had time to catch up, but we seem to find the time recently. We hang out, talk and what not, and I honestly have no idea what is going on. We will see what happens.  I thought about Chad as well. Hi Chad! I know he reads this and is disappointed that he does not make the ranks. But he does�boy does he! Just not real open to talking about it�I think he understands. It is always great to see him, hang out, talk and what not. hehehe  Well, if that wasn�t cryptic enough for you all, I will try and think of something much more mysterious for the next entry. Otherwise things are going good. If you haven�t seen them already�I can give anyone who is interested the dates and times for my show at the college. It is really, really good! I recommend coming to see it, even if I was not in it I would. It�s wonderfully acted and directed. I am not sure I can plug this anymore, but I will try.  Talk to you later!
