I hate emergency rooms and chiropractors and pills and pillows and ice packs. I hate uncomfortable cheapo rental cars with teensy little horns. I hate towing companies and repair centers that forget to order parts and I hate, hate, HATE cheap insurances companies. Cheap insurance companies that don't give a rip about inconveniencing me for 4 weeks while they dink around and don't return my phone calls while I walk every place and then rent me a car so cheap it hurts to sit in the seat and don't go look at my poor Jeep while it sits in the repair center NOT getting repaired. I hate back pain and neck pain and headaches that never go away even though I am supposed to have fun at DisneyLand and go to class and learn my orange belt in Kenpo and get on with my life. It could be worse, but I still hate it.
