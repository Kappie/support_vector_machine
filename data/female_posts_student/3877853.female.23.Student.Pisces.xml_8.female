Whenever I wake up really early for work I always feel like I'm going to puke for about an hour or so, until I actually start working and I forget about it.  It made sense when I used to have to get up for work at 6:00 am.  Now, however, waking up "early" for me means before 11.  I had to cover a shift at 11:30 today, which meant I had to get up and shower and stuff at 10.  I thought I was going to die.  There's so many people who hate me right now.  But, like I said, it's because I don't really go to school and I work in a pub.  Unless I work another 11:30-3 shift, I really never have to wake up before 2 in the afternoon.  To be honest, I don't really have to wake up until 7:00 at night.  But that would be odd.  In other news, I saw the  Curb Your Enthusiasm  season finale today (yes, it's taken this long).  Without trying to spoil anything, it contained the most brilliant double bluff I've ever seen on television.  Brilliant show, that  Curb.   Larry David, if you need a staff writer, I'll be back in New York in October.  I'm not dying to move out to L.A., but I'll take what I can get, you know?
