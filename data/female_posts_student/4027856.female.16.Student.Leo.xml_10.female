The one where everything is peaceful and no matter how down you  feel, you feel amazing, because its an "everything is going to work out" smell. You know, the spring clean smell, or the beginnings of fall, end of summer smell. The happy start over because its a new season smell.  I like that. I am attempting to organize my room, so it is senior year acceptable. Right now it is a cluster of little girl ornaments and sweet 16 artifacts. I am not going to be sweet 16 as of saturday. I am going to be 17, and older and ready to tackle my school year with full force. Frankly that is something I have never done, and it is time I started taking action, inseatd of being all talk, which I have been pretty much my whole life. The worst thing is, about this all talk thing, is that I talk myself out of things, before they have even begun. Now that is just pathetic. So I am kind of stuck in this moment, I want to go back to school , but I am a little afraid of the upcoming changes. I have to get a job, which is something I havent had here since last year, and its scary, because if I do things, I like to be good at them. I take alot of pride in doing a good job, and getting good feedback. And I never have really been in a good job down here, well considering my only job down here was at IGA and that wasnt the best of places. Working in New York was awesome because people are so nice, so its not hard to get along. But here....well quite frankly its intimidating! Also starting college, even if it is just PSEO...and getting my license, and balancing them all nicley, urgh....so much. lol, its really not that big a deal, its just coming to realise that life isnn't going to be as easy as it was junior year. It is going to be harder, but it will def. all be worth it...SO BRING IT ON
