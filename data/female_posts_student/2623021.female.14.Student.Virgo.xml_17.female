One minute you can be on the   top of the world    and then all of the sudden, you feel like   shit  . You're   angry and frustrated   and everything all at once. I had the  worst day  I've had in a long time last week, and also the  best day .I figure I'm doing pretty well if I can get that out of the way in the same week.   In my blog I try to say what I feel, and I   try   not to edit it, but I always end up going back and taking things out that I wrote. I never know who could read this. For all I know my parents could be reading this. Which it's alright if they do, I'm not saying anything in this to discriminate against myself, so it's all good. Today was a lot of fun, we didn't do much of anything just had a  good old fashion crazy day at home .    Everything is in bloom at my house it is so beautiful. I look out my window and we have  purple  fox glove,  orange  and  yellow  lillies, and a big white bush in full  bloom!    I just realized that next year, not only are we going to be Sophomores, the Seniors won't be there! That is such a weird thought! Felicia will be complaining about Wit not being there ;) JK, actually I'm only half kidding, I know you will be missing him, but I'm just giving you crap. We will have people lower than us, and offically be allowed in the mall, not that I haven't eaten lunch numerous times in the mall. I think it's stupid that Freshman can't go into the mall, next year it will be something else, the incoming Freshman are quite annoying ^o). Well I think I've written enough for right now. This is my fourth post today :|
