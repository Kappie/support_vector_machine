Ladies and Gentlemen, I am talking about this girl gave him his own heavenly body,  A gaseous mass, a ball of white gobule, something he cant touch but see using certain coordinates.  Needless to say, they are no longer together.  Be fore-warned for such gifts like a blog just might lead to beakups, divorces, or estranged families.  Okay, I would give one to my brother's room-mate.  I hate her anyway.  But then again she might be ranting all night on it for me giving it to her.  Merry  urlLink Krispmas  to Everyone!
