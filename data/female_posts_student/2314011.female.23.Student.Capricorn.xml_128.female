AOL's been acting up the last couple of days and I thought I'd have to turn my back on it forever, but oh no, the ever-so-helpful technical service staff at the corporate monster fixed it up all purty and new.  That really was the breaking point last night, being unable to sign on and surf the net, check in with my favorite bloggies.    So the day ended pretty well.  Checked out the "Human Rights store" I've been seeing flyers for and came to find out about a big peace rally protesting the local ultra-conservative-neo-confederate pastor's "History" conference at the SUB.  The guy wrote a pamphlet discussing how harmonious southern slavery was.  So, the local diversity-loving hippies planned a get together across the street in the Catholic church; they love a good fight!  Have to say, a rally against hate sounded like just the thing I was looking for, but my night was already booked with a campaign strategy meeting.  Ever the loyalist, I decided to stick to my commitment and headed home after buying some bed-wetting liberal propaganda.    As I was cleaning the apartment, which is always a good stress reliever, I couldn't escape the thought that I should be going to this rally/march instead of the Garden.  "Do these people even  know  there's a march happening?  Maybe we can catch the tail end of it after the meeting.  Student Bar Association presidential campaigns are important too, after all."  When the phone rang, I knew what the call was about and was relieved before I even answered.  No meeting.  All rally.    And it was pretty damn good.  Those Catholics know how to throw a party!  The head of the Seattle Chapter of the NAACP heralded a great calvary charge.  Then we battled the blizzardy night up to the Administration Building to listen to a journalist-turned-Southern Poverty Law Center-publication guy recount the history of neo-confederates and how their messages so closely, clearly, painstakingly match said local pastor's.  We needed our NAACP guy back.  Desperately.  Skinny white journalists don't, can't and shouldn't compete with emboldened African-American preachers.  Two hours and years of boredom later, I slunk from the auditorium.    Now that I have my precious AOL back, everything seems complete.  And tomorrow's writing assignment isn't looming as large as it has the last few days.  I'm sure there will be blood and tears running down the hands of innocents before it's all over, but for now, there's a fragile peace, one might even say...(gasp!)..balance!
