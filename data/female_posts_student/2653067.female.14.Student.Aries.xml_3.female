Kevan's mother then dropped us off at Cal's house at 11:00.  Immedietly, Kevan, Jasmine and I ran up to Robin's room and started to clean up the brushes and paint.  Half of the room was already painted so we started from where we left off.  By the time we finished painting the walls light blue, it was already 12:00.  We weren't finished yet.  Jasmine pointed out that there was a can of darker blue paint so we opened it up and painted the door.  The thing thats took the longest was painting each and every little individual crack.  It took atleast a good hour and a half to finish painting the cracks.  The cracks took way longer then expected because we didn't have any paint brushes.  Kevan and I experimented with diffrent "painting techniques".  When we rialised that we didn't have any paint brushes, Kevan took a roll of toilette paper, riped off a reasonable sized piece and started painting with it.  It was a good idea until the paper started to rip and leave behind little chunks on the wall.  Next, Jasmine decided to use fabric instead.  The fabric worked way better then the paper but it was hard to get a big enough piece.  Then, I went downstairs and came back upstairs with a couple of sponges.  The sponges worked the best out of all three ideas.  After painting the walls light blue and the door a darker blue, Kevan decided to do this really cool painting design but it was then ruined by Jasmine so they painted the border white.  When the border was finished, I cleaned out the room, swept the floor and we all painted the floor with the darker blue paint.  It looked really good.  By the time we finished painting, it was 2:57.  We then took a half hour break and ate this tasty "Western Family" popcorn.  At 3:30, we went upstairs and put in this nice blue rug, set up the bed frame, brought up the two mattresses, the dresser and desk, made the bed and added our final touches too the room so it would look perfect.  Kevan then wrote a note on behalf of all of us, to Robin explaining to her why we did this for her and that we spent two weeks planning this surprise.  When Robin walked into the room, we all yelled "SURPRISE!".  She screamed of joy and then started to cry.  She loved it.  Our hard work had payed off.  It took around 5 hours but the room was perfect and it was worth it.
