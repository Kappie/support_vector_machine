Now, two of my earlier problems are solved: The photo, and "That summer feeling" with Jonathan Richman... Ain't tht great?  ~:~  On the other hand: I've been in touch with Robin on MSN since I met him in Tom's old home town up north, and a while ago he tells me he's coming down here in a week to live with Tom or Linda and just hang out with them. I've been speaking to both Tom and Linda since, but they haven't even mentioned it! Apparently they want Robim to themselves. Sould I ask them now, or do I wait until Robin's already here before I tell them, to embarase them more?  ~:~  This Saturdy it was the big Gay Pride Parade through town. Me and my cousin Jennifer went to the parade area and met Tom and Linda who were already there, and we decided to jump into the parade. As the parade mas starting to march we got a bit confused though: Which people were we supposed to march with? See, the parade consisted of different groups with separate banners marching together. So which group? We soon found out we belonged neither to "Disabled Gay-people", "Gay-doctors of Sweden", "Gay Scouts" or "Christian Gay Movement". Of course Linda and I should've marched with "Proud friends of homosexuals", but Tom couldn't walk alone, could he? Finally we jumped in with a group of cheery transvestites behind a huge pink bus playing disco hits.  When we were dancing around in the streets, some of the people in the parade started shouting my name. I moved forward and shouted "Yes! What?". "They're looking for you!" they replied, and pointed toward two guys standing among the huge group of cheering spectators crammed up on the sidewalks. I immediately recognized them: It was my friend Josie's brother John and her best friend Jim. They looked so baffled to see me marching in the parade I couldn't help laughing. I couldn't get to them so we just waved to eachother, and when I turned around after we'd passed them they were still staring at me. Haha, now they think I'm a lesbian... I might have to explain myself to Josie the next time we meet.  ~:~  Kisses
