I'm getting the feeling that it's one of those bad-dream episodes when you just think you can go back to sleep and everything will be all right again, but will I let it happen? Can it happen? I don't know. Panel was exactly as I'd expected, with deja vu moments from last year: being somewhat late, not practicing, the lady with the jade pendant, a weird piano...and not doing too well. I know I can't pout considering how much I practiced (not much) and now much nerves get in the way (too much). But I just made mistakes I knew I shouldn't have made...as in forgetting key chords and just momentary, random memory lapses. Ack. I didn't like how I played today, and I'm pretty certain Monday I'll get the evaluation back and just not feel too happy about it, but c'est la vie? Moving on, moving on. At least it's over, that's as much as I can say. But now what? I still have that master class and the Ravel to patch up, and either take extreme measures to get the Szyumanowski fixed or change it for Colburn.  I just can't believe that I'll let panic and fear get in the way of good piano playing. And the only way to bypass this crippling effect is to overpractice for it, but who says I have the time? I need to set aside some good piano time, though...I don't think I can afford to cram anymore, and it's also the fear that I'll upset Mr. Francis, too.  I have to email K. Hm.  And sometime this weekend I'm going to have to see a movie. Oh, journalism woes too. I don't think I've ever been three days away from deadline official and not known what's going on the front page, but I guess that's the issue now. What was I doing before? Too much sitting and pondering, perhaps. I still need more pictures...and something big. My attitude towards journalism is changing, though--more going off-campus, which means that on the other hand, I don't spend so much time in at lunch. And I have three days to get my stuff together and go through the other 17. FRONT: nothing! maybe acadeca (old) or MT (embarrassing), a good 2nd story, a visual focus please SECOND: currently I have the library, HK, uh...aca deca too. J has yet to get me MT. THIRD: book buddies actually has a picture that might be good. anatomy story needs more fact and less stuff on the side. oh man, I still have to write that one story. need the ring picture. Should we cover the choir show? that would be an interesting stand-alone graphic. and I thought we were going to do something about calculus, but I haven't seen anything materialize yet, so I'm assuming that either it was never assigned or the person who was supposed to write it didn't do so yet. I like the column. But that's about it for this issue, and it doesn't look good, particularly when I promised myself I'd look at pages earlier to make sure we didn't have any more glaring mistakes, etc.--to make sure I'm doing my job as copy editor, not news editor/procrastinator extraordinaire.  Anticlimax.
