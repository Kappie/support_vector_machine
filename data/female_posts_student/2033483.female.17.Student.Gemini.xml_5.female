Although I ask you do I look like a Junior?  My aunt came today from Virginia and was talking to my mom and said "Kayla must be about a sophomore now, right?"  (rolling my eyes) And then Jason.  He has an excuse though because he didn't know me last year.  At lunch he saw my ID tag and said "whoa, you're a junior I thought you were a sophomore."  Yes, peoples I was a sophomore last year!   I know I may be about a year younger than everyone else in my grade but that doesn't mean I'm a grade level younger!    When I came home from school I laid down in bed and started to watch TRL but fell asleep (maybe it was because Britney Spears was on it?)  But I only got an hour nap in b/c my mom woke me up!  GRRR She got all worried and kept asking if I was sick.  NO! I'M JUST TIRED LET ME SLEEP!  I hate it when ppl wake me.  Isn't it unhealthy, too?  ~tata
