I owe many many people many many words:  *~*~*~*  You inspire me. Your optimism is bigger than life. You make the best out of everything. You amaze me, because you are stronger than anyone I know. I admire you.   *~*~*~*   I thought about you today. I thought about the last time I saw you. You were so full of energy. You criticized the way she dressed, and you joked sarcastically about it. But you didn't know you'd never see her again.  Do you still have your energy? Do you still have your optimism? I pray that you never lose your spirit. Have you already? Don't dismay, dear...all will be okay.   *~*~*~*   You always put a smile on my face. You always cheer me up. You are always there for me, through good and bad. I am myself with you. I am honest with you.  And honesty is so hard for me these days. Please don't ever ever fall out of touch. I just don't think I would be okay.   *~*~*~*   I'm sorry. It's been so long. I'm sorry. Don't rely on me. I'm horrible. I'm so sorry I make so many mistakes. I'd be surprised if you're still there for me...   *~*~*~*   For the record, I'm not trying to be emotional or depressing. This is just my outpouring.  :)  Ahhh work at 7 tomorrow. :-/  "She left the suds in the bucket, and the clothes hangin' out on the line..."  Tomorrow's gonna be good. If I remember to take some meds. Like my Actonel. And the Zoloft I haven't taken in many days. Oh dear.  I called it an early night tonight so I can read and rest up. I need it.  OOooOOooHHhhHH my jaw. Omfg.... so much awful pain.  Okay time to read.  CrAzIeS....;)
