That was what I promised myself when I made this blog, and I have to keep it (because my mom is already getting suspicous).      I probably broke the rule right there...         Totally and fully OUT OF IT...      I'm so skrewed. I'm a bloody nothing (Think I broke the rule again... How 'bout we skrew the rule?).      I've beena fat sitting potato all summer long. Nothing. Nada.Zilch.Zip.     Kill me now.    I'm probably feeling this way because of my mother (If you hadn't guessed).       I've always been a bit anti-social... since the 5th grade. And, come on, the best friends you have in 3rd grade don't count just because you sat next to them the first day of school.     Youprobably are thinking, what the hell is she talking about. SHUT UP AND LET ME VENT! I'll probably erase this afterwards anyways. And if I don't, it'll just be another bad day...    I'm regretting it already.        I'm going to meet up Katlin tomorrow and hang out with her. Of course, itbecame this whole fiasco because my dad is always telling me thatIhaven't hungout with anybody from school this summer (he's also the one that constantly reminds me I'm fat... but, ya' gotta love him). And my mom is freaking out because she doesn't know where she lives, although we've dropped her off at her house. Half the time she saysshe trusts me and lets medo what I want, and the other half shethinks I'm going to get myself killed.    We were going hiking in the Utah area and we went to thiscliff that over looked an 's' bend in the river. My mom is terrifiedof hights, as is my brother. SoAuntieCamille's sonand I were lying on our fronts peeking right over the edge, and evenAntie Camille was getting nervous. So she sat betwen us and held on to our shirts. Mom got HELLApissed at me.She starting yelling and screaming and commenting (not very nice things). And her best friend is trying to calm her down.      Trust medoes she. Trust her best friend?        That was alltotally irrelevant, butan example of the many times she has show she is a HYPOCRITE. And just last night she was going on about fufilling promises and crap.            Kinda makes you want to just.... jump of a cliff.                            Okay, ignore everything I just said.      Oh, and instead of going to London or Greece or Australia... because of the amount of time we have, we have decided to go to Alaska.          I've never been to Alaska.          Then to Las Vegas for business and then to a JOSH GROBAN concert. Gina hates me, I know.            Wow, and my anger level dropped like 10 degrees.           DAMN HORMONES!    THE END
