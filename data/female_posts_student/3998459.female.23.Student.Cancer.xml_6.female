Lauren and Seth were just one of those couples that everyone expected to get together, they were really close friends all through Middle School and High School, but they never dated each other. They dated others, but no one ever really fit. They finally got together last summer. It was SO special to see them together, they were very obviously in love, but you didn't feel uncomfortable around them.  Lauren and I graduated togther, played in our Christian High School's worship band together, and were pretty close friends. We had a mutual friend that we were both close too, and so it was just natural for us to be friends. She's a great person, I have HUGE amount of respect for her. OH, and she also got me a job at a fruit stand one summer when I couldn't find a job. I ended up getting fired from the job, but she didn't have anything to do with that (I don't think).  Seth is an AMAZING drummer! We, too, played in the worship band together, but we really got to know each other just because the two of us are crazy, and we have a blast with each other. He plays drums in the band  urlLink Mindhead , along with another high school friend of mine, and I've become friends with them through that as well.  Ironically, of all the people I knew and were friends in high school, Lauren and Seth are ususally two of only a small handful I'm still sort of close to. They are truely good friends!  Seth Fikkert and Lauren Burr were married at sometime just after Seven Post Meridiem, August Fourteenth, Two Thousand Four in the Year of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.    Seth and Lauren at their reception  I wish these two an amazing life together, they are good people and it was so awesome to see them together! Conrgrats guys!
