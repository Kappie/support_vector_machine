I have a piano lesson at 5:30, and then I'm tutoring. Tutoring tomorrow as well. I don't know why I do this to myself: it's all right, I suppose, since it's gas money, but I always get that "Oh no, not again" feeling right before I do it. And then when it's done and the money's in my pocket it doesn't feel so bad after all.   I'd like to take a nap, but I haven't practiced piano all week. Every Monday at around this time I plan what I'm going to play for lesson, but it's always a pathetic selection since I'm not diligent at practice. Bach, maybe. That's old. Beethoven's all right, but I need to finish figuring it out. And I want to take a nap. Sad thing is, I know if I fall asleep I won't wake up until I have to go.  It never ends.
