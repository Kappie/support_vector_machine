My good mood, has lasted for the longest I think a good mood has ever lasted. Oh, wait. It hasn't lasted 11 days yet. *cough* Yeah. And I actually found a ska band that I can stand longer than I work out. There called 'Madness.' Well, I only hurd one song, so I dont know if I could stand them for that long, but..eyeah. I need to find a new drummer. The ska band needs one. If anyone is a drummer, and good, IM me @ xsurfpunk07 or sign the board with your info. If you do, I will have mad love for you for life and go out on a date with you (^_^)   I seriously need a life I swear. All I do is sit at home on the computer, or reading.  If anyone would like to come save me sometime, be happy to stop on over. I need some company.  Okay, I lied that good mood is kinda going away. Don't ask me why. I dont feel like going into specifics. I just need a few ears to talk it out with. Yeah. (I'll translate the Heather language into normalcey for some of you..) That means I wont talk about it because .. A. No one cares. B. Ppl who do care..dont. C. I dont like talking about my problems. There you have it folks. That makes it possible.  Im gonna go talk to some more ppl. (which means ima go aimlessly click the screen) It's gonna take more than just a flotation device to save me.
