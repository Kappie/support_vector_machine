I walked around downtown greenwich.  there is a rather long street called greenwich avenue, or "the ave" as the locals seem to like to call it.  loaded with upscale shops and pretentous restaurants they call bistros (have they even been to paris?).  coming from outslide L.A., i've grown accustomed to trends and culture of these areas, but connecticut definately has a unique feel.  firstly, the town is much more homogenous than its L.A. counterparts.  secondly, fewer people seem to smile.  but that's okay, i found a cute cafe that had great salads and little sandwiches.  and, i met a guy.  i was eating my salad and reading "a prayer for owen meany" and sitting in the sun when a landrover pulled up and 5 guys got out and went into get sandwiches.  one of them remained behind.  i looked up and smiled and he smiled and came over.  he asked about the book and if i liked the food, and told me his name is carter.  i introduced myself and told him i was new in town.  it turns out that he knows tyler from school and the lacross team.  though tyler will be a senior in the fall and cater a junior.  after a few minutes of the typical chit-chat, he friends came out and called for him to get in the car.  it ended with a simple "hope to see you around".  at least he knows where and with whom i live.  perhaps if he's motivated, interested and confident, he'll ring me at my god parents' house.  then again, how many high school guys have I known who are anything but confident?    I also picked up a train schedule.  NYC is only about a 30 minute train ride away.  i'll certianly venture into the big apple from time to time.  Chris (god father) tells me that I don't have to bother with a summer job; that i should instead take the time to meet people and adjust to my new surroundings, and (he said this with great hesitation) possibly see someone to talk about my mother's death and my father's strange behavior.  that's all well and good, and though his heart is in the right place, and understanding the possibility that he might be right, i am really not in to mood to talk about it with a therapist.  at this point in my life, I need to move on - to turn over the perverbial "new leaf".  tyler is working for a local architect and issa is a camp counselor by day and hooker by night...j/k! she works at a video store a few nights a week too....yes, she's something of an over achiever.  i think i'll look for a job since i've got no idea how to meet new people (unless more cute guys just pull up!) without school.    hmmm, what type of job should I get?
