Because I am one of those people. I haven't made a new years resolution since 2000 and that ended up being a disaster in some respects. So here I am again. Along with the millions of other people who are making this resolution I am going to say that mine is to eat healthy and try and just try to take the steps I need to, to accomplish my goals.  I hope year 2004 would be a better and a more productive year! Best wishes to everyone...
