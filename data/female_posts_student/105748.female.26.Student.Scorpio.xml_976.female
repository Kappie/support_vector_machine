The new link is: urlLink http://netzlog.blogspot.com    The ramp up to DANO has destroyed the cache settings for my old blogspot name.  I can only view an old cache file of my blog at work.  Rather than wasting the time to figure out the problem, finding a solution is more progressive.   Congratulations to the S.A. Spurs fans out there you deserve it!  You all can rub it in.  just expect the same when the Nets win next year. =)  more to come...
