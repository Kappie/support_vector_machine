If you show up with Mary Jane, we will sedate you and place you in my backyard where you will be ceremoniously sacrificed to  my cat .  Josh, skip the stupid lan man, I dare you. And all you other CareBears, come to my party. Love-alot, Lucky Bear. The Vineyard gang perhaps, if you guys don't have more coolest stuff going down.   Oh yes...
