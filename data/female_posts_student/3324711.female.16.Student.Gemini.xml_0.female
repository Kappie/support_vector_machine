But who am I to talk, its a week, a funking week..168 hours :| feeling very much like a dork.  And Im contemplating whether or not I should go to Jillians party.. but its 9:00[ish] already and Id have to walk both ways. So Im thinking no... but Im sure theyre all having lots of fun without me. I kinda feel like being alone anyway.  And I miss Lydia. I think Im going to kidnap her and take her hostage for a while so that she cant leave, because I honestly havent done anything outside of school with her for too long. wayy too long. And since Operation HPB is well under way, I think Ill make a new one.. Operation Steal-Lydia-so-she-cant-leave-anymore. Anyone want in?   Listening To: Battle of Who Could Care Less- Ben Folds  [ahh Lauren I just did it again!!!]   Do you not hear me anymore I know it's cool to be so bored I know it's not your thing to care But it sucks me in when you're aloof It sucks me in, it sucks it works I guess it's cool to be alone Will you never rest Fighting the battle of who  Could care less Everyday you wake up late Sometimes I wish I was that way   My guitar is calling, as is my front porch. I think that chocolate upstairs is too. Night
