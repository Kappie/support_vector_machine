I can't do the 19th because its my dad's birthday and jason would like me to mention that he wont be here the 22-4 of december.  i guess we can do it any time during the break and we wouldn't have to od it at night, we could do it for lunch or in the afternoon too.  so whatev.  Oh, and listen to this biotches! i already got an acceptance letter from a college.  we won't mention that the college is chico, but hey! if all else fails, i can go north and hang out with Amber and Danny Johnson.  For whoever got me here's a list of nots: -no thongs -no starbucks cards -no tower cards -no movie (blockbuster, hollywood, etc.) cards -no gift cards of any kinds -no baby baths like i got last year, i want something I can actually use or whatev if you get what i mean -no obscure dolls that i'm never gonna play with  Here's a list of something that i just thought of that i want: -electrical tape in cool colors (not the scotch kind that comes in that 4 pack at like target because that     stuff blows big balls) try looking at home depot or other various hardware stores, but the one by target only has it in black, if you even want to get it for me, thoes were just a few pointers, let me add a few more commas, and make this totally like, a, run, on, sentence -a cool hat or beanie that's not hella ugly -sanrio stuff -cool soccer gloves (they are different because they have this special material on the tips of the fingers so you can do throw ins and the ball doesn't slip out of your hands) -a new soccer bag, but i'll have trouble explaining to you how i want it so i'll just stop talking now -cute underwear (size med/6) that is actually functional, let me repeat again, NO THONGS! i already have enough of thoes  now that i'm done typing, ill stop
