We went to go see  Little Black Book which was a pretty good movie, and if you listen it has some pretty good advice thats slid in there.  Not your typical romantic comedy, not anything life-altering (so few movies are) but pretty good.   I went to the beach today with Emily.  We jumped in, the lifeguard yelled at us for not doing free style and as soon as we got to the raft they blew the whistle for everyone to clear the water.  So we spent about 4 minutes in the water and 2 and in a half hours talking.  I also got some Cold Stone ice cream (which is so hard to finish) and I saw Julia, Joanne's sister, who had just started work.  Speaking of work, I have it tomorrow. Blah.  I hate my job. I hate my job.  I hate my job.  Only three more days. MCG
