On Tuesday I left there to ocme back to Robyn's house to stay with Alex and Max for 3 days while her and Edwin went to the Cape for their anniversary.  Longest 3 days ever.  I love my nephews to death but they can be real crazy sometimes.  At least I now know that I can keep a 4 year old and a 1 year old alive for 3 days.  Pretty good, eh?  ne ways on Thursday I went back down to CT with katy and stayed till this morning.  We camped at this wicked cool place and I got to drive a golf cart around a lot, that was sick.  On the lake they also had this slide with water coming down it that was wicked high and when you got to the bottom you would skid across the water.  I loved it.  I also found out that this 20 year old guy I met on sunday thinks I'm cute!  That was a little confidence boost =) but ne ways I wicked wanna see Kind Arthur! I had Alex and Max on Wednesday so I couldn't go to it.  This week definately! =)
