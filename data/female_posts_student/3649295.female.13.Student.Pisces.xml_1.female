Held it for a while (like 5 seconds) and someone tried to hit me with one I blocked it and threw the ball at him knocking him over.  I was in the zone.  Then after that we had basketball.  We played bump instead.  We started with only six people, and by the end of the third game we had 23.  The people who got out first all got lack of participation points because the game lasted 20 minutes and Ms Jensen thought they werenâ€™t playing because Ms Jensen is a bitch.  After that, I had band and I got to spend some time with Meghan.  All the band did that day was turn in all our music and sight read.  After that I did some service by putting away everything for the end of the year.  I wish that I could spend more time with Meghan, like maybe
