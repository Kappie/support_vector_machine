I normally get up at 6:45 to go jogging but this morning I was so tired I just fell back asleep and woke back up at 8:40 but didn't think anything of it and closed my eyes again but then my mom knocked on my door and asked if I was getting up. I forgot all about having to leave 10 minutes ago.  Me and my dad ended up leaving at 9:10. Turns out he wasn't ready either.  We were on the road but then it started to rain so we turned back. This is the second time this week the rain has...rained on my parade. I have to stop with the puns, that's to entries in a row.  So now I have nothing to do at all. Monday I think I'm going to Richmond with my Dad. I think we have to leave the house at 6:30. He has an eye appointment. He goes to Richmond which is about an hour and a half away because it's this veteren hospital place and he's a veteren and all and they get great stuff there or something like that. I want to go to Plan 9 which is this independently owned record store. They have stuff I can't find anywhere else. And I need a place to go because I hate being stuck at home all the time so I'm going. I love Richmond.   While I was typing that an  ENORMOUS  bug crawled out from somewhere on my desk. I don't know where it came from. It was so nasty. I squealed like a girl. I'm so ashamed. I tryed to pick it up with a tissue (what was I thinking?) but it got out and fell on the floor so I stepped on it and heard it pop. Ew. Man. It was nasty but it's dead now. That was horrible. Normally I don't get scared of bugs and such but it was RIGHT there and really caught me off guard. Besides it wasn't like a spider or anything cool like that. It was horribly horrid bug. I wish I knew where it came from.  What if there are more???      Music: Say Hello to the Angels - Interpol
