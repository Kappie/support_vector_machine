I probably spelled that wrong too...this whole week sucks. I'm going to go watch Edward Scissorhands....and eat ice cream...That always makes everything better....:) o and forget about romance and what not...I was watching one of those Feed the Children commercials, and I was moved to tears(perhaps a fault of hormones) and I realized how privelidged I am and I should embrace my opportunities...although it doesn't feel like that now...please come cheer me up!!!
