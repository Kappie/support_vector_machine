Daniel just asked me if I did and he was like "Evveryone thinks you do." and I was like "Who told you that?" and he was like " I don't remember.." I don't like him! I barley even ever talk to him. My goodness.  [Return to normal]  And I saw this box of rootbeer in the freezer and I was like "Mom..not again!!!" One time she put pop in the freezer and it exploded. Haha. but it was these really tasty rootbeer float things. Yum.  I have posted so many posts today..I am that bored. la de da de do.
