I gave up blogging quite a few months ago but I think I've hit rock bottom so I should write. What else is there to do?   So, if you care to read on, this is the boring life of a shy girl. Mainly consisting of my travels through the world, and possibly my bumps along the way.  3 days ago, I think it was, I met him. And I think it was him that triggered this longing inside me. A gap that Jason could never fill. Meet Max... Sexed up, crazy, dirty most of the time (which sort of turns me off), but he's so well spoken that you could give this man an hour of your time and you'd be begging on your knees to fuck. Interesting isn't it? I thought so...  So I broke up from my 2 year relationship with Jason last night. I'm crushed but handling it quiet well considering the circumstances. I hope he doesn't do anything stupid. Angie told me to put everything aside for a month and then see if it's worth getting back together... I think it will be. I just need time to find my independence again, perhaps find someone who can refresh me from this ongoing quarrel with Jason.  James is talking to me again, I don't know if it was the pirate hat or what that helped him forgive and initiate me into the percussion section. I'm feeling more at home now that the guys have started talking to me. Not really fun being the only down-to-earth girl in the section. Nadia and Michelle annoy me so. I'm not even going to get started there.  One more hour of school... I just want this hell to end... I need a cigarrette.
