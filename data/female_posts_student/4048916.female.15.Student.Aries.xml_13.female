I was going to be hanging out with Ad√®le, Steph, Alice etc. after school, but that was brought up ages ago, and then I kind of felt like I wasn't really invited, so I just went home, and met them at school again at 7.  Then halfway through, after interval, Ingrid, Ella, Lizz, Steph and Alice went and sat upstaris, and me and Del were left sitting by ourselves!!! But it was really good, because the  Taylor was on and it was the best, easily!!! Anna was really good as Bill, who was retarded, and she picked up the best actress award. Phil got best supporting actress - she was an old woman called Molly, and it was one of those old woman characters that I really adore. I really loved that play, it was so amazing and I felt a connection with it the whole way through. Del cried ... I just sat there, emotionless - it hit me sooo hard!!! We won, naturally ... and when Anna got her award, me and Del stood up and cheered so hard, because we were ecstatic. (And then when it finished, we checked the time, found out it was 11:45, and I got in a shitload of trouble ... but it wasn't my fault it went overtime!!!).  I invited Fazz to come, but when I smsd him yesterday morning, he never replied, and he never turned up. So I don't know what's up ... hopefully nothing big ... I tried calling him, but the phone was off. So, I'm not exactly going to sit here waiting for him to come on MSN - I think it's his turn to make an effort to contact me ... perhaps say sorry .... and then it'll all be better.   ~  * ^ *  ~  * ^ *  ~  * ^ *  ~
