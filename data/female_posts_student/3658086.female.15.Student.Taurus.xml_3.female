However, I would still like you to take in to account what I said as it does upset me. Anyway... I have succesfully failed all of my exams... except maybe french... music tomorrow, and latin... anyone know anything about Sagae Thesalae that they would care to share with me??... he he, that reminds me of miss simpsons lessons... when talking about covalent bonding... now children.. they're caring sharing electron.. (see me if you want to see my impression... its not so funny written down.. bit like achoo!) love you all xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
