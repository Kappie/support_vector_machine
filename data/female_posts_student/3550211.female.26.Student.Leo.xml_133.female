And my poetry to protect me. I am shielded in my armor. Hiding in my room, safe in my womb - I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock. I am an island. And a rock feels no pain. And an island never cries." from the song "I am A Rock"   An island never cries ? What is  that  about? I love that song, but come on. An island never cries? (shakes head regretfully.) That's just to cheesy for me.  Hippie bullshit, I suppose. I can't say I hate it though. It's what I bloody grew up on. And please don't ask me why I'm listening to this. I really couldn't tell you. Sometimes, I just fancy to.   Go figure.
