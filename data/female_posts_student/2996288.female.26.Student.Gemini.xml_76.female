We wear green capes with a big "C" on the back. Not really, but wouldn't that be cool???  Nothing much interesting going on nowadays.  Cruise in four weeks! Disney World before that! New York City before that! LOTS of working out at the Y before that! Yippee! I've become an official Y junkie. Now, when I am able to make it (being a super-hero psych consult person takes a long time) to the Y, I'm there for like 2 hours. Fun.
