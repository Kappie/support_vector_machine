Who knows what our lovely school board has cooked up for tomorrow? At this time of the day, normally I would be counting the seconds until I get out of Kifner's class.  But not today.  Oooh, no.  Now I'm just sitting alone, watching old episodes of "Super Secret Movie Rules" or a bunch of crappy music videos in a row.  It will not get warm in here.  I turned up the heat, but I still had to put on my jacket.  Ehnh.  It needs to be warm now. Gasp! Is it snowing again?!  I believe it may be.  Just a little.  Keep coming, keep coming. Yeah, well, it just stopped.  Humphh. Today was not a good day for the glasses.  Shlee and Joncie (I think this was with you guys) suggested I get windshield wipers.  They'd have to be really small.  That would be interesting.  Haha, can't you just see me with little red wipers to match the frames? Dammit, there's no coke here.  And not really enough snow anyway.  I wonder if I could order just a coke for delivery from Domino's.  I don't feel like pizza.  Oh, well, they'd probably charge a lot, the scallywags.  Domino's pizza isn't even very good.  You think it is, and you eat it anyway, and then one day you realize that it's just not all that good.  Eating things because they're there.  Tsk, tsk. Eww, there were so many men in my house last night.  My dad hosted the monthly all male book club meeting, activities including eating spaghetti and drinking wine and being really loud.  :(  The only thing is that I couldn't complain about the noise.  The last time I had a bunch of people over here, we were reeeeeally loud.  And my dad selfishly was ok with it.  Just said, "Remember how loud Ellen and Mary's get-togethers used to be?"  He's got a point.  I was just thankful that I had enough batteries to crank up my discman the whole time last night.  Phew.
