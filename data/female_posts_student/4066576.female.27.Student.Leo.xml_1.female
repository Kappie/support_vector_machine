That is only for Friday. Today was from 11:00am to 3:00pm.  For Saturday, It will be from 7:00am to 6:00pm. That is the most difficult day. You know what?  My work place has no chairs. That is why my job is so hard to do.    Now, I am home and My roommate is beside of me.  You know what?  I was idiot. After work, I was waiting a bus to go home.  Two guys in a fancy car had been passed by me while I stood at a bus stop. They asked me that " Do you have a time?"  However, I answered " I don't have the time, so I can't let you know the time, now."  IDIOT!!!!!!!!!!  I know I am a terrible listener.  Moreover, they were pretty hansom.  If I can go back to 2 hours before,  I would say " YES, I HAVE A TIME."    My roommate, Jay told me. " Billy, you have been in here almost 1 and a half year. What is wrong with you?"  She is right.  I need a boyfriend who is canadian.   I can say I was not so much foolish because they was listening music loudly at that moment.  That is the big point why I could not listen correctly what they said.
