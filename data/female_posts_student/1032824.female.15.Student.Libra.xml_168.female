Thank god I applied heaps of sunblock lotion, cos' the UV rays from the sun was piercing into moi skin cells. Oops. I'm all red and hot now. Hehe. My lil' sister and mom have gone to the mall to buy some chocolate ice cream. Yummers! Anyways, I was really disgusted by the sea weed but Gabriel kept throwing them at me! *Yuck!* Jess treated us to ice cream cos she was the last in reaching for the metal pole. Heehee:P The life guard caught Gabriel and Richie twice, hehe. Once for not putting on their life jackets and another time because they were fooling around with the tyre-like floats in the waters. Haha! Crazy dudes. We also saw the 4B1-ians from CTSS last year! What a pleasant surprise! Mr Simon Liao(sp?) was there as well. We washed up and headed to town for lunch at Yoshinoya. We met some CTSS peeps who were very bored, to the extent of actually standing at The Heeren, counting how many people they know from CTSS. Haha! They could've at least brought along their Chinese shou-ce! *Teehee. Ooh, which reminds me, our Chinese mid year exam is 29 days away.  Okie dokie, gonna polish boots and get ready my uniform for tomorrow's training. Keep loving friends, and Happy Good Friday! Lotsa love! :)
