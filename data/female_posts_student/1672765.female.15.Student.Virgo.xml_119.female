I usually just get that feeling, you know "I know I had a strange dream last night but I can't remember anything about it...just that it was weird."  I don't want to talk about this dream, it wasn't bad or terribly embarrassing but still. Oh, yeah, I guess it was  kinda  embarrassing, but could be alot worse. Ha.  Hey, the weirdest part of the dream was I was looking at my blog right 'cher and I had comments left everywhere.  Hint. Hint.
