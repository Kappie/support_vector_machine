Maybe I'm spending too much time online! ;)  Hehe...Actually, that's definitely the reason why. I can't help it though. I think I'm trying to run away from work...  I can't wait for school to just...end. And I don't just mean school itself, I mean my whole schooling life, as in high school, college, university, the whole works. That is, if I even qualify for university in the first place.  As you can tell I'm in a horribly bitter mood today. I have been the whole week. I wish I could just throw a tanty and get it over and done with. I can't work out this unusual crabbiness in me. :(      Amelia
