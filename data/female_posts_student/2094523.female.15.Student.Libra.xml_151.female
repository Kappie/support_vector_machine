'Donald Duck never wears shorts, but when he comes out of the shower he has a towel on. whats that all about?' -Chandler (Friends)  -----just thot that was a clever remark.   normally i cudnt care less but just feeling slightly lonely at the moment. not that im complaining or anything. just dont get the luck regular people get alrite.. i mean regular hot people but hey what can ya say. u get what ur born with and u stick with what ur born with. unless ur rich and are able to get plastic surgery.. lucky bastards....  Never give mixed signals i cant take em i just get mroe and more confused.. well give em if u want me to come crashing down... the perfect formula. always. sometimes u just cant control anything u feel. even tho u know its not right and in the end ur just gonna get hurt. but ur mind doesnt realize that.. i mean if we were all able to not feel wud there be sadness in the world? i think not. so id say when things dont work out, when things are bringing u down, coming close to tears, when things get fucked up just coza ur uncontrollable damn feelings.. then its time to move on. yup.. looks like its just me tonight again.. i need a guy nudey pen..
