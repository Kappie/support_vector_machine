After you get through the picture on the homepage, there really isn't anything else.  But anyhoo...I was reading and it's quite funny actually, these pro-life people.    If you should decide to brave the really really really gross picture, the link to "The truth about Planned Parenthood" is really funny.  They try to slander that so badly, placing these weird quotes, and coming to these absurd conclusions.  Such as, Planned Parenthood advocates child sex, the head is a racist (I don't see how that would intrude on the organization), they respect privacy (keeping an abortion secret from the girls boyfriend), and...this is really funny, a quote, Planned parent hood advocates humanism, which is, "It seeks not to educate our children in moral values, but to indoctrinate them into the Humanist philosophy that proclaims there is no objective moral code, and that right and wrong can be decided solely by the individual."  So I suppose we should never trust the kids.    I suppose the only non-bias one was "Politics" because it listed many parties and what they thought, instead of just the pro-life ones.  I thought it was gonna say how some parties could change the world and what not.  Everything else is VERY pro-life, and don't even look under "No Convinced?" because there's another disgusting picture, I'm sure (I chickened out, and stopped the loading before anything appeared, what can I say, one gross thing a day is good enough for me).   Yeah, so looking at the site has made me realize that there is no way I can ever be pro-life.  Pro-choice is a good thing.  AND a message: Abstinence is where it's at kids.  Remember, Abstinence!
