I went to dinner with my moms old friend Nancy. I feel so good now, mainly because Nancy and I, though two decades apart in age, are the exact same person. She's also takeing anti-depressants, the same prescription as i am in fact, and she just...understands. It makes me so happy to connect with an older female, seeing as how i don't have a mom and such. She's invited me to go to a fashion show with her, and she said that i could come over anytime i wanted to, or call her whenever i need her.  It almost feels like having a mom again. almost. After dinner I cried in my car on the way home.  And the black storm cloud loomed behind me.  It was good to cry though....things just build up and it feels so good to just release them finally. I feel much better now thats i've done it.  I need to go think on some things.
