Here is my blogging from thursday and friday :)  Thursday- 9:30 PM Oh gosh,,,,so many blog worthy things happend today, but I wasn't able to post any of them because my stupid sister got my in trouble.  On Wednesday I used like 5 minutes more than my time and my sister  told my mom so I can't use the computer for 2 WHOLE DAYS!!!! Shoot me while I am still alive. So now I have absolutely nothing to do. I think I am going to kill myself :P Oooooooh! I will tell you about my day. I woke up at 6:45. Ahh! It was bad. Then my brother was in the shower so I couldn't use it for a lonnnng time. So finally I got in the shower and took a 10 minute showe. Then I blow dryed my hair and put crap on my face :P  I looked suppper bad :P  Then Sara picked us up.  Nothing interesting happened  until lunch....  Taylor threw her apple at me for some reason. The apple then hit my can of sprite which then spilled ALLLLLLLLLLL over me!  It was so stinkin' funny! We laughed till we seriously cryed. But then my pants were all wet and sticky. Yuck.   Then I went to CYT. It was fun. I saw htis guy named Tim...he is cool Then i met  this other guy who is a freestlye rapper, which is obviously my dream job. :P  Then I was saying good bye to this kid named Kaysee and for some reason I said "Bye...you" to him and in this REALLY creepy voice he goes "Just call me...blue eye lover..." then he smiled weirdly. I was wearing my blue contacts..it creeped me out. What a loser head. Now I am computerless which really sucks.  to     bad                  i                          don't have   aaaaaa LIFE!  Love, Laura
