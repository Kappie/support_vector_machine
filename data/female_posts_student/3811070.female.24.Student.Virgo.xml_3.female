So if I go into labor I have no way of contacting him... except maybe by the Red Cross, and how long does that take? Will they get him into the hospital before I have the baby?  Irrational pregnancy fears again.   Nothing much going on lately, other than I'm getting enormous and I'm ready to have the baby like now. But I have to wait until Hubby gets back.   More later.  -Me
