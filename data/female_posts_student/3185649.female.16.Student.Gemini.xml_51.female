I agree with the whole idea I guess, you know about helping people with alzimers (sp?) and parkinson's but I do NOT agree with taking apart unborn babies, cause that's what they are; like it or not! But  urlLink here  is something that I heard on the radio and did a little research on. Maybe we can agree on this.  Bah.
