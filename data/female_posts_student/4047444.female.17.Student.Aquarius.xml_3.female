I just want to scramble up that tree and ravage him, right there on that branch. There's something about the makeup, thestrapping red suit, and the elegant black dress that I find very sexy. Maybe it's because, despite his formal wear he is savagely perched in a tree.    The picture and his look reminds me of Pyxis, if I was ever to bring that character back to Ruby Grail, I'd get Stef to model for me.          urlLink      I love the bands style, Plastic Action Star. It's so hot, look at Stef.*  urlLink              I can't wait to see this boy again. I must admit I really like him. He told Jaime, and I quote: " She's gorgeous, she's really cool, and I want to see her again soon." My heart jumped with extra eagerness. I wish I had a webcam in the privacy of my own home :P, things would probably get pretty heated.    I spoke to him for like four hours yesterday, it was so much fun. He should me this site where you can make your own south park characters, it's super fun. I think his looks exactly like him, I made one for myself too. If this stupid blogger bot and picasa hello thing wasn't so retarded and difficult to use..Maybe I'd be able to post them.
