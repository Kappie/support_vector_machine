We talked with his sister and niece for a while, and left. Headed to Dairy Queen and ate. I got a Brownie Batter Blizzard. It was alright. And fries. And it took about 10 minutes to get it (Alex got a blizzard and burger, too). So we ate that and started to drive back. It was so wonderful. We were on Murfreesboro Road, pushing 80, windows down, music blaring. It was such a rush. So pleasant. I wanted to scream. We were enjoying music thanks to Sugarcult, Madcap, The Trio, Blink 182, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Movielife, Autopilot Off, Glassjaw, the Starting Line, etc. It was awesome. I had a good time.  So now I'm home. And school starts tomorrow. I'm not looking forward to it. Not looking forward to meeting with my friends, comparing schedules, and not having any classes with them. Especially Bob, 'cause like I said. We lucked out with not only having the same gym period, but the same teacher. And I'm 99.999% sure that we didn't sign up for the same Wellness period. ._.; But if he has Mr. Roberts for Biology (I HOPE he does), I can help him. That'd be nice.  Anyway. S'all.       ------     I took the personality disorder test that Andy took (again) and everything came back High or Very High except Schizoid. Or was it schizotypal? I don't remember. But I always, no matter what, come back "Very High" as Borderline. I self-diagnosed myself with Borderline a LONG time ago.  ..I'll see if I can get the HTML to fix itself then post it.
