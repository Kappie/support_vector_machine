When he turns 21 I'm bringing him to Vegas for me. The three games we played, we played for money, and like...each of us would have to put in ten dollars (the first game) and then five dollars for the games the other nights. Dieter won almost 200 dollars....what's a 13 year old need money like that for??? Grrr. Haha. Ah well. I really am off....for a bit at least...
