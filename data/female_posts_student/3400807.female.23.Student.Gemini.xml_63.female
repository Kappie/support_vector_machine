Note to self: in the future, tirades about (or directed to) incompetent apartment managers and infuriating Kinko's employees should be postponed for a minimum of 24 hours while coping with intense menstrual cramps and hormonal swings resulting from fussing with birth control pills. Please take due note of this information for future reference and more pleasant relations.  

After having read the  urlLink previous  (somewhat vitriolic) post, I realized that a good deal of my frustration may be chemically induced. Sorry, folks...
