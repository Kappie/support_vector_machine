Haiz. didnt noe tt so many ppl actually gossip abt *erm, erm*. Was really quite shocked. Anw, can c tt many ppl distanced frm both of us. Who cares loh. So wat if all of u tink she's diff? She' not. She's still lyk us, normal n need frens. I jus simply dun understand it... I make e decision I make coz I tink im not wrong. Jus bcoz i not wif e cls doesnt mean ath. Argg, bringin dis up is hurtin... I jus wanna make sure tt my feelins r heard. I cant stand it any longer to keep it inside me. It jus isnt fair for her. She may be in e wrong but nobody wish for tt to happen too, dun they? Imagine if tt person is u, constantly bein avoided, how wud u feel???   The world has changed, changed too much. I wish i could go back to e time when gay= happy. Wont tt be jus great? Oh no, my head hurts... Argg... Sobz. Tml is pw, die le. My Pw file is in a terrible mess n i'm e leader. Guess jus hv to prepare tml morn.   Mr Ling is goin tml. It's so unfair. Y do our cls always hv to deal wif dis kinda of separatin stuff? So many teachers hv come n go. I totally agree wif Kenny... Y does all e gd teachers go n e bad teachers come? Simply cant understand. I tink Mr Ling is so sweet to us. He was willin to be embarressed jus to show tt he cares. Noe wat? He played e guitar n sang two songs jus for us. It's so sad n touchin. Our cls is so damn evil to him yet, he tot so highly of us. 1 mth past so quickly... Hmm, saw my ex-form teacher Mrs Tay. She lk tired, mus be stressed by all her studyin. Almost our whole cls rushed out to c her when we noe tt she was here. We tok for a while. Sadz. Brought back all e fond memories...After a while, she went back. hehe. hmm tt's abt it. cont if i rem ath...
