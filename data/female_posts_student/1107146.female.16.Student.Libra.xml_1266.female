In fact she was talking about it last night saying that she was so happy to be having 1/3 of the party devoted to "Becca Worship."  Well, ok, she wasn't saying exactly that, (in fact nothing close to it) but she still went on and on about her "third" of the party. Something needs to be done about that then.  We don't want an unhappy Becca.  Its not a pretty site.  Anyway, my cookies got VERY good reviews.  Kyndall (my friend from school) said they were the best chocolate-chip cookies she had ever had.  I'm not trying to make you feel bad or anything....haha.  The bags are just about done anyway.  And Travis is gone.  Please re-send the convo, Linds.  It didn't work.  I'm kinda worried about him, is he alright at all?  Peace out.
