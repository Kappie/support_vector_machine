I had so much energy, and I don't know why. I sang my version of the alphabet song, and here are the lyrics in case you care: (sorry, its all spelled wrong)     A you are an antelope B you are a buffalo C you are a cantolopue with ears D you are a dinosour E you are an elephant F you are a fruitloop in my bowl G you are a goodie-goodie H you are so homely I you are and inky binky boo J you are a jellybean K you are a kindney bean L you are a lima bean too M N O P I could go on all day Q R S T, alphabetly speaking, you disgust me U you wear no underwear V you are a vegstable W X Y Z I'd like to go through the alpahabet with you and tell you how you nauseate me I really mean it and tell you how you neauseate me one more time and tell you how you nauseate meeeeeeeeeeeeeee  Another good thing that happened today, which made today the most exciting day of my life, was when i poke Sean in the stomach, he giggles like the pillsbury dough boy!!!! YAY!! that made me so happy  the only bad thing is everything with you-know-who. I want to see him tonite, but I'm sure he doesnt wanna see me. I want to go see the white castle movie and go to the zoo.
