BAHHH! so my brother brian bought me the billy talent cd for my bvirthday and its very good i suggest you go buy it if you like that kinda music. my parents got me a 40$ gift certificate to a store i hate. and my other 2 brothers got me 15$ each to hmv. yay. wahoo. but yes....i have soccer in less than an hour...perhaps i should get ready for it. au revoir.          happy birthday to me!
