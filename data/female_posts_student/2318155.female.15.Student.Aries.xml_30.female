Me and Adam talked for awhile and then he told me he'd call me back when he got home since that u can barely hear him when he's in his car. You see someone broke into his car and the back window is broken of course so he duck taped it but it still doesnt do the job. And then i was very dissapointed in him, he didnt call me he just texted me and said "sry i just got home" and that was it. nothin like o im tired and gonna take a shower and go to bed so ill talk to u later. o well, anyways the next day i get woken up by my dad callin me on my phone sayin he needs me to do a favor for him. now im so not a mornin person, so if u could imagne me tryin to go online and look up a number for him, well, its just not a pretty sight. he told me the city was palo alto, i typed in san pablo (who knos what the hell i was thinkin). well i went back to bed and then at about 10 my moms like danette dont u have to babysit and be there at 10:30, o shit is right. well i just threw my hair up, washed my fase, ate, dressed, and left. the kids name is ryan and he is such a cutie, hes 2 and a half yrs old and we played with play dough at first. then we painted for a while, and then i asked him if he wanted to go to the park. i got to go and say hi to my buddies at the pool and introduced him to them. i babysat for liek 3 hrs and then she took me home. after that i just kinda hung around the house and watched movies and well just plainly bored. my parents said hey lets go out to dinner, so we went to celias which was awesome as always. there was a mariachi band and all and they played a song for us which was pretty cool. then we went off to blockbuster and i got to see my sexy adam, o was i excited. after i was in there forever tryin to pick out a movie i finally figured out what i wanted and then went home. ricardo called me and we talked for a couple hours and then he got tired so he said goodbye. that was my chance to call up adam so i could talk with him and we talked until he got home and was gonna take a shower and go to bed. lol he told me if i can wait our first date will be the day after my 18th bday, and he wants me to wear a skirt since i never do. adam is a funny one only thinkin bout me and a skirt. but u never kno maybe me and adam will keep in touch for another 3 yrs and maybe we both wont be with anyone at the time and maybe we will have our first date the day after my bday. i dunno its just adam is an awesome guy that i luv talkin with and i dunno i dont feel stupid round him when i go on and on bout nothing. today i woke up to my parents pissed at me cause of my phonebill and the fact that i was on the phone during work and not just on break, which i swear i wasnt. o well its kinda weird how u think u did one thing and u really did another. i took a shower and then had to go to the doctors cause i have a god damn bladder infection and then came home and found my dad, cousin, and his friend cuttin down our palm tree. we got some lunch for them eventually and yea roamed around the town goin and buyin stuff up that we need for vacation. i watched the rest of my movie that adam told me to get and also watched some tom cruise movie which both were really good. but the endings needed more in my personal opinion. so yea i finally got around to packin most of my crap and then cleaned my room. now if u were to see my room before hand u wouldve asked me how it was possible to clean it this much and the small amount of time that i did. well i dunno i just did lol, my desk wasnt the prettiest thing in sight. the way i typed on my laptop was i had to raise my arms in the air so that i could reach other the papers that i had in order to touch the keyboard. and also the laptop was slanted to the side cause of the only spot that was available. well now i threw away a lot of the crtap that was layin round my desk like candy and crap from valentines day that i just hid under months of papers that stack up day after day. my desk now i am proud to say looks somewhat organized to my best i can and now i have this huge area to be able to type to u people and not be uncomfortable at the same time. my bed i actually made and then i cleaned up a few odds and ends on the floor and well my room hasnt looked this good in well i dont kno when. it wont last long tho, i bid u that. o well it makes the parentals happy, cause the fact is, is that were goin on vacation and my dad said i couldnt go unless i cleaned my room. and now just o throw some things away and move some stuff to another place, but an actual clean the desk so that it looks nice and so on. well i think im satisfied so hopefully my dad will too and then well go to blockbuster and see my adam. whenever i call him or he calls me u kno what he calls me, "my love". o and do i luv it when he calls me that, i just say heyyy sexxxyyyy lol. well u all ppl prob think that im crazy and a ho for wantin to be with a 22 yr old, but no were not gonna do anything. were just friends that luv to flirt and kno that we gotta wait til im 18 and hell be o, 25 about. wow and speakin of him he just imed me and said he got off of work early. now he just called me.......damn. today i was gonna be nice to him and surprise him and wear a skirt for him and now he gets off early and now he missed out, he's sad but happy since the fact that hes not gonna get home at 1 in the mornin. well he had to go cause he'll be in the car and then go to dinner and then yea! were gonna talk on the phone. lol i told him that im not a virgin, o and to all u ppl r like what? yes danette winkler is not a virgin, think what u want but thats the way it is i luved brandon and he luved me. we lost it together and it was the best feelin ever. anyways i dont think that ive ever felt so excited in my life because whenever i get off the phone with adam i just wanna scream and jump around cause wow its gettin to be too much. im fallin for a 22 yr old this is nto good at all, i just have to be friends with and and flirt insanly and not have to act upon it thats it. o well the slut i am..... i think now i will go tell my dad that we need to go to blockbuster and take the movies back which we do need to do and then come home and watch tv til my sexy adam calls me. o is it gonna be hell without seein him for over a week ): well ill be back next sunday so i wont talk to u guys, whoever it is whos lookin at this, until i get back. ill have tons to tell all of u ppl and yea im hopin that the last time at tulloch is gonna be the best and craziest time ever! hottie here i come! blo job betty on the way to rescue u!
