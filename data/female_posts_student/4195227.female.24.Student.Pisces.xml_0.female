That was fine.  Then he got out of the shower and didn't have to go into work until 1:45 because he had some OT to cut....so that knocked an hour and fifteen out of my reading schedule.  And then Angel was incredibly restless so we just went for a very brief walk in the park...enough to get her heated up and ready to sack out on the nice cold tile for a nap.  So now I've eliminated as many distractions as possible and HOPEFULLY when I pick up my giganto book on psychopathology, I'll be able to buckle down and read with some considerable speed.  I hope.  I finally broke down and bought some reading glasses to combat the itty bitty print.  Makes me feel old, though fellow grad students have informed me that they've had to do the same thing.  Trying to save my eyes from getting monumentally worse from all the reading.   Poor Angel is miserable here and Murphy's depressed because she's depressed.  He misses the puppies something awful but he said not to bring either one again because there's no yard and neither of them like being cooped up inside.  She's a big distraction to me as well...keeps on climbing up in my lap.  Lord I hope I can get back into the groove of things.  I need to go read while she's napping and knock out these two chapters in psychopathology.  I promised her we'd go back to the park for another lap when I did.   Yours, Maggie
