I wanted to lessen my texts because my bill was really WOH. High. My dad is kinda angry at me for that. So I'll lessen my texts. Then. I got to talk to my speshie for a while.. hehe! I love him sooooo much! He's like a best friend and like an older bro to me!ü Then, after a lunch, my cousin came over and playd with my bro while me, my sis and my parents went to Podium! We bought stuff there and did something with my celly! Then, me and my sis watched A Cinderella Story! (well, it was my 2nd time..) Ahhhh.. I love that movie! CMM's there! He's soooo hot! Gawd.. t would be my wish to spend a day with him! He's soooo cute! The movie totally rocked. Sad,funny,perfect,fantasy and everything!Ü B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L! WOOOOO! After that, I went to the 6:30pm mass. The mass ended early.. like early by 20 mins. or less. Haha! And now, I'm here.. Writing my journal.. what happened today.. Too lazy to do my kumon.. haha! And of course..waiting for my speshie to text! (if he will..) Well, I just hope he will. I really love him^_^ As a friend..
