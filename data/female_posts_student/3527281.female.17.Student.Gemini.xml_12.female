I hope I get busier than I am now soon because if my whole summer is as boring as it's been the past couple days, I won't be too happy. I don't want another yawner like last summer.  Yesterday, after I finally got dressed around 3:00, I took my brothers for a ride in my car because they had been wanting a ride in it. We ate dinner and then I drove my dad to church for his brass practice just so I could get some more practice driving stick shift. So I sat there and read one of my books until he was done. Then we went to Brooke's baseball game in Hayesville. They were doing pretty bad when we got there. They put Brooke in to pitch, and he did pretty good, but the umpire was really bad. His strike zone was so small it was ridiculous. So my dad kept complaining, really loud. And eventually....he got yelled at. It was embarassing, but the ump was really bad. It makes us appreciate Scott even more. *sigh* He really needs to start umping again. He's awesome and funny! What more could you want?! I saw Brooke Stoner, my coach from last year, up at the park and talked to her some about the team this year. She said she wishes I could still play (makes me feel good!). They have a game tonight up there so I told her I'd like to come and watch them sometime, so my mom and I might go tonight.  Today my mom, brothers, and I went into Mansfield to go shopping. I figured I'd drive so I could practice some more. It wasn't too bad, I guess. I was getting really frustrated a few times, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been. We went to Kohl's to take back a skirt my parents had gotten me for my birthday that I really didn't like. So I got one shirt from there (a black and white tank top) and then we went to Taco Bell for lunch. Then we went to Target and I got three more shirts (a red-ish tank, a blue tank, and another red tank; they're all really cute!). And then we went to Best Buy. Dan still wasn't working today, which was disappointing. We were there FOR-EV-ER!! My brothers are worse than my mom and I shopping. They finally found something and I got a casette adapter thing for my car to hook up to a portable CD player so I can listen to CDs in the car. Then we went to JCPenneys and then we finally came home.  So that is the excitement for the past 24 hours. Not a whole lot. LeeAnne called last night to see if I wanted to go to Alive with her today, and I really wanted to, but my parents didn't think I could spare enough money for it because I have a car insurance payment coming up soon, so....I didn't go obviously. I really wanted to though because I've always wanted to go to that. Oh well.  Well I was going to post a survey, but I have to go eat, so maybe sometime later.
