It's just that everyone, mum, dad, aunts, uncles, always warns me, "The net is very dangerous ah, all those ah mao ah gou ah zhu ah niu will send you virus. And then they find out where you live, come to your house to rape you!" Ok, so sometimes things do go wrong. But as long as you are cautious enough not to give others your phone no., address etc. etc., who would come and rape you?
