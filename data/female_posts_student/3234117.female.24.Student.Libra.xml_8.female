I think this is so cool and today marks the day of my dating hiatus.  Now I haven't been dateless for more than a month so we'll see.  Just last Thursday I was into the whole experimenting idea.  Date all that I can, see what all is out there. Next Thursday who knows what I'll come up with. I tend to vacillate at times, but that's just me.  Just ask my friends.    I think my friends find my dating stories amusing.  Maybe they're laughing at me, maybe they're laughing with me--- who knows?  But the two questions I always get without fail are: (1) You wreaking havoc on any poor new boys? and (2) Have you talked to Travis?  It makes it a little more interesting these days when I can say, which Travis?
