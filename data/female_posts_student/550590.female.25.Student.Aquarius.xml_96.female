Seeing as I don't have papers to write or graduation to worry about I see this as my only opportunity to procrastinate.    If you're really bored (and you must be if you're reading this drivel) check out the quiz in my AIM Profile...if you're really REALLY bored, I have a different quiz for when I'm at work.  Okay, I'm really, really bored.  On an up note, I'm going to a kick ass party tomorrow night.  Time for a nap.  Then it's martha stewart cleaning and redecorating time.  Sheesh.  The happy pills are making me nuts...
