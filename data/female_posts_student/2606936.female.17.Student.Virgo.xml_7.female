(if you've never had braces, imagine soreness every time you turn your head more than two inches or so.)  Yet, there's a triumph in this pain!  You see, there's this wonderful way of relieving tension known as ACUPRESSURE. basically, the idea is that when you have a knot in a muscle, you force it to relax by apply pressure. It's easy to do to yourself... What you do is take either your finger (or if you have nails, the flat end of a pen) and push into the knot until you feel that "good hurt" and hold it, either until the pain goes away or until you can feel your pulse in it.  Well, today, while waiting for a friend to get off work so we could all go out, i was sitting with two guy friends,a dngot one of them to hold a pen against this awful knot at the edge of my left shoudler blade that i've probably had for months. The muscles in my back actually twitched when it released! Unfortunately, now that my upper back and neck are all loose, my neck is SORE from being tense and clenched for months. It actually hurts when i laugh, which isn't good considering i went out with friends and then watched the movie  Clerks.  But whatever....  i suggest anyone who (a) attends high school, (b) works, or (c) has children, try acupressure. It is absolutely fabulous, because event hough i'll be sore today, my neck is so wonderfully loose! Extend that recommendation to all wind players and singers as well....
