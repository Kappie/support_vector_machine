Umm saturday i ws up at about 8 am went home at about 830 am as i crashed at shawns house. My mom was all frantic so i got mckayla dressed and me dressed in 10 min no breakfast . got her to swimming lessons. the after her lessons had her dressed in 5 min and scooted her out to shawns dad.They agreed to watch her so i could do what is called spinning for an hour. Went into the  class and felt really guilt as she was the lady who had made up the workout regime for me and i had only done one day last week.(pathetic) There is always this week. Died in spinning i missed the week before also . walked 20 min to shawns house. then had a shower after about 5 min wait for mckayla and everyone to get back. I then went to my house got dressed was frantically looking fora  piece for her tricycle. couldn't fine it:(. rushed to the car we went to the mall , costco and the meat store then back to shawns house. By this time it was 430 i am exahusted oh well gotta keep going. so did stuff with mckayla in the backyard ect. We finally went home at 9. Sunday was a little easier but things were more moody as my friend had borrowed my exspensive rollerblades and hadn't returned them when she said she would. I got them later that night. so i was grumpy making shawn grumpy. But we finished most of mckaylas kinda house that shawn and his dad made for her.(finished painting). today is laundry:P  floors and litter day then out we go. to the park. I am hoping to get a run in and weights today as the gym babysitting wasn't open today:s. Hopefully tmw will be more action packed again.:D
