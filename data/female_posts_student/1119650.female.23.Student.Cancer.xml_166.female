I know you all missed me  TERRIBLY  whilst I was out sailing the high seas and drinking until I could hear my liver scream, but fear not, kiddies...the diva is back! (Please, stop your groaning, I can hear you!)  I haven't really learned much, but I will share a few memories  ideas with you: - The Dominican Republic is a big, fat garbage dump.  If you can avoid going there, please do so at all cost. - Celebrity cruise lines is secret code for "Kevorkian Cruise Lines"...old people who are on their last legs literally vacation there, but some of them have hot grandchildren and children. - Irving needs to shave down there...NOT ANOTHER WORD! - Indonesians make the BEST martinis and know the coolest magic tricks: SUDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! - Dana the bartender thinks I'm a big drunk, but loves me for it anyway. - Jon is embarassed to be fat and hairy when we were surrounded by 600 lb. gorilla men who wore permanent sweaters.  Please tell him how cute he is! - More Jon related news: Jon's back is "crap"...at least thats what the masseuse sitting on his head told him. - Barbados has a rockin' beach with a bad-assed beach cat! - St. Thomas has a cool-assed lil bar with a Jack Russell Terrier Bar dog!  I took his picture!   - St. Thomas also has a Sanrio store!  I loved all the great lil hello kitty, my melody and little twin stars trinkets!! - I missed my friends terribly on this cruise and I've decided at some point, we all must cruise together! - Some old people can be cool, especially guys from Grosse Pointe who look like Dustin Hoffman.  Thats all for now...embarassing photos coming later in the week!
