Ask them if there's anything more to do than my share THen they said, its ok la, nothing much to do alreedy, I'll settle it.. Wah.. Thanks.. my hero! haha... I think I'll stick to this attitute for my remaining 1 more year in SIM Sad thing is that there is no more projects for Investment anymore! Argh....  But these 2 guys in my group are really funny man.. There is this guy Z in my group who belongs a little to the nerdy type.. He speaks so softly that I can't hear him sometimes... Then there's this other guy A who likes to make fun of him.. Here is a scenario: We are all eating noodles in the canteen, Z then went off to buy a piece of papaya  A told him; So Mu (wooden) already still buy Mu Gua(Papaya)! hehehe Hmph but when I laugh behind his back then my gal mate say.. then u also cannot eat papaya ah... Sad ah.. =( But he is so funny.. When my friend's bf called her Z tot that she was talking to him then reply him.. A saw that n was laughing so loudly everyone could hear... Hehez... so bad.. BUt I think Z is ok la.. A very cute person.. hmm.. maybe its becoz he is also blur blur like me... But NO I dun mean that I have a crush on him!!! Juz tat he was in the same poly as me.. Then feel tat he is smart and bao ka liao in project.. Nice guys always finish last la... hehe maybe we r the same species thats all..  Tml is one day off from projects!!
