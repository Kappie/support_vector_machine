But anyhow, my yesterday consisted of waking up at 9 am and going shopping in Champaign which was great. I got the coolest boots in the world...they're all Herman Munster style with like 3 inch platforms and buckles all the way up both sides...I did borrow them from him after all...we're pretty tight. I got a couple pair of sunglasses, a Texas RoadhouseT-shirt,and some pink capris too, but they're definetlynot as fun. Todaystarted outok...then it got better...then it got worse...then it got better again, so I'm good.I went to Rieman's for a cookout thing, mainly to see Tyler...but everyone else was there too so it all worked out; except for the stupid girls. There were 3 or so girls there that I couldn't stand. They were the type that found a stupid way to get around the guys, but really it just made them look more retarted. Then they were doing a bunch of dumb stuff that they apparently thought made them seem cool...yea it didn't work. We got away from them after an hour or so though and went to ol' Brockies house for band practice...then came home. It could've been better, but I suppose it was good for what it was.I was just happy because I got to see Ty. I stole his shirt...haha, I'm such a thief, but it smells good...just like him, so I'm keeping it hehe. But for now, I'm gonna chat myself up good and tired on MSN. Night!!
