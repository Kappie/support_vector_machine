Maybe it's because all our clothes look different hanging from a line than they do in the closet.  I look at my jeans, or a shirt of Matt's, and think, "That actually looks cool."  Maybe it's because I'm harnessing the awesome power of the sun to do my bidding.    Maybe it's because I'm saving seventy-five cents.
