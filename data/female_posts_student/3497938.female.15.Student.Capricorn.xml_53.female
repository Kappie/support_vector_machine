TaLlDuDe1120: ........ purpleXfairyXtar: u dont wanna talk to me? or what? TaLlDuDe1120: .......purpleXfairyXtar: whatever then TaLlDuDe1120: whatever purpleXfairyXtar: what is your problem? TaLlDuDe1120: ....... TaLlDuDe1120: im sorry  for being an ass purpleXfairyXtar: ? TaLlDuDe1120: im sorry TaLlDuDe1120:  for being an ass purpleXfairyXtar: what are u talkin about? TaLlDuDe1120: i d/k TaLlDuDe1120: kayla to me to apologize TaLlDuDe1120:  for being an ass purpleXfairyXtar: if u dont wanna apologize for being a jerk, then you dont have to TaLlDuDe1120: well i did purpleXfairyXtar: do u mean it? TaLlDuDe1120: yeah purpleXfairyXtar: ok purpleXfairyXtar: do u still like me? TaLlDuDe1120: not really purpleXfairyXtar: ok... TaLlDuDe1120: ok... I am sooo hurt right now. I am depressed, yet again. I hate Mark. I hate guys... God, I hate the way I feel. And I cant believe I still like him. I am so stupid! I am not going to fall for another guy. At least not for a while. I feel like I could die. Things Im thnkin about: Why do you care about me now when I want to die, and not then when I wanted to live? The scars will last forever, But nothing compares to the pain that put them there. How can someone come into your life for such a short time and leave such a bad scar on your life and heart?
