So, we put our heads together and thought that if we were to just hit my grandmas house, and swim for a while in her pool, that if it did rain, we could run inside. So we were laying out in the sun, that was shadowed in the distance by some strengthening thunderstorms...we thought, we'd wait until it rained to go inside, to recieve the most sun possible, without being fryed--by lightning. So...we sat in the sun, watching as the edge of thin clouds approached the bright star, and...right as we thought the sun would be gone for the rest of the day...it seemed as though the clouds went in reverse! They moved away, and south. Couldn't have asked for a nicer hour and ahalf of laying out in the sun; watching as thunderstorms plummeted the west of us.   After our oiled up afternoon poolside, Kelly and I hit up Brookfield Square. I bought a pair of lounge pants at American Eagle, as Kelly shoveled out $70 at Charlotte Russe. My Pants we described by Caleb as "Smushed Peas-Green," doesn't he sound intelligent?  After our rendevous at the mall, I went to the regional game, North vs. Kettle Moraine. Well...it was a game well played by everyone! Geis pitched an exceptional game, and Cal had a double play, but wasn't so successful at the plate! The game was tied 0-0 through 7 innings as it ended regulation. In the 8th inning, with a mix of horrible calls by the field umpire, Cal had a hit, but with no luck the inning ended with no one crossing the plate. As the bottom of the inning approached, the group i was with concluded that the umpires were bribed...by KM! They the most obvious out, safe! I was livid! NO WAY! I was watching from the 3rd baseline and I could see that he was soooo out! Fucking Umps, I swear it is their goal to fuck over North Athletics, be it, softball or baseball! This game related to our Sectional game, against West. We lost in the 8th inning. With runners on 1st and 2nd, the batter, who i think was the pitcher, hit a line drive past AJ at 2nd, and scored the runner at 2nd, thus ending the baseball season!  After the distraught of the fact that I won't have anyone to cheer for the rest of thesummer, Meyer and I decided that we wanted to chill later on tonight. So I hop on the phone, and invite people over to my house. For a while, it was just Nicole, Me, Greg and Jenny, then the couple left, and we waited for Brian and Kelly to arrive. Kel left for her boy toy (whom shall remain nameless) and brian went to the store with the innocent brother of mine, and Kevin. Around 12, Abby, Caleb, and Kraus arrived (attached at the hip of course), shortly followed, by the one-the only--AJ Garcia! I was surprised to say the least! But hey, hes definitley a cool guy, and I enjoyed his company. He was quiet, and cordial...compared to the rest of the testosterone in the room! Contra theme songs are still flowing through my mind right now! Damnit Kraus and Brian! AJ and I reminiced of our childhood...Northview Kindergarten! ahh...memories that i don't remember! lol AJ brought it up, I didnt even know he was in my class until an hour ago! wow thats funny! They all left around 1:45...to do nothing other than "pool hopping." Enough of that...especially when i walked out of the house and saw Caleb standing in the street naked--changing into his "pool hopping" gear. Wow.   So now its off to bed, cause Nicole waitd for me tomorrow at the Gift Shop, bright and early at 9:30...damn, thats in 7 hours! Wow...Gnite!
