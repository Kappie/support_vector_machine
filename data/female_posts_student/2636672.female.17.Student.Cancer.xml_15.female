For instance: I received my Miss Tullahoma personal sheet or whatever, and I  thought about answering every question as if I were a stuck up B*tch!? that's not me, and we all know that. So maybe i have schizophrenia, but that would totally suck! Partly because i'm supposed to write a personal statement... and well...I can't write it for one person, so how in the HELL am i gonna be able to write it for TWO?!  Speaking of personal statement. I'm supposed to find out who "i am" and then write about it, but well i don't think *I* really know "who I am" ...that's where EVERYONE else comes in. ok...so since my comments DON'T work...GRRR...STILL!!!! i spose you'll have to email me...and be honest folks...if you have to...call me a b*tch...'cause i spose that's one thing colleges MIGHT wanna know. so do your thang. and i'll do mine....or try to. and *Maybe* go to college one day! :) that'll be cool! ;)  -tori
