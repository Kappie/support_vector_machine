First of all, Mardi Gras is not, by any stretch, a New York event, so kudos for my fellow students for thinking outside the box.  But, alas, Mardi Gras was in February, so it seems to be too late for the theme.  But at least they tried.  It was actually very nostalgic for me, because where I grew up Mardi Gras was a holiday.  So for a couple of hours tonight - despite the accents - I almost felt like I was at home.  I even got beads for purchasing raffle tickets.  It was actually a fun evening.  And me and some of my friends actually bid on something.  I think we must have been the only four people there who actually wanted this item (well, us and the other guy that was bidding against us - he looked older so he might have been an alum), since everyone else seemed to largely think we were insane for bidding.  Well, maybe there were others but they had trouble rounding up four people to go in on it.  We did as well; in fact, one of our fellow companions was a bit reluctant and only came in with us because he lost on some other thing he was bidding on.  So we will be going with one of our professors for a tour of a historic cemetery in Queens and then out to lunch.  I'm actually looking forward to it, because I'm a big history geek.    The one disappointment of the evening:  I didn't win the raffle this year.  I won it last year, and was hoping for a repeat, but alas, I missed out.  There's always next year...
