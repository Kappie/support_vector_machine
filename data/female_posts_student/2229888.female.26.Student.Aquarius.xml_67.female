Robbie and Sheena bought me a cute outfit (i haven't had a cute outfit in forever!) and we came home planning to spend the night watching christmas movies and munching on pizza.  Ant called and ruined it for a while. he made some death threats against me and Robbie (my brother) and said a bunch of other stupid shit.  i hung up on his sorry ass and hung up about 6 times after that without giving him a chance to say anything.  i know it's gotta be freaking him out because usually i'm all about working everything out. this time, i'm not.  i'm just too DAY-UM tired of his bullshit.   i guess it's safe to say that friendship thing i talked about isn't about to happen anytime soon!
