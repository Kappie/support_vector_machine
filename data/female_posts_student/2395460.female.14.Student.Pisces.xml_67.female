And after all the   urlLink Momints hype  in glossy magazines like  InStyle , I found them in a 7-11. [note to 7-11: please re-think the banana slurpees, blech.] Please don't ask me why, but I'd actually wondered after seeing pictures, if these mints were like little tiny hard candies or something that you chewed or maybe even swallowed. The answer? Neither! They are like those bath oil beads that instantly dissolve in hot water and start gushing out artificial rose-scented grease, only the mints contain a tasty/nasty (75% tasty) liquid like the kind inside of Freshen Up gum. They're not as strong as Altoids or those lethal Listerine breath strips, but instead leave a Lifesaver level of mint taste in your mouth.  The most fun part, though, is when the liquid is gone and you just have the bits of gelatin stuck to your tongue. It's just like when you were little and eating  urlLink Botan Rice Candy , with the rice paper covering that seemed for all the world like something inedible until it started to dissolve in your mouth. I suppose inedible things could also dissolve (like Lemon Pledge maybe), but Botan really is just rice, you can eat it, it's true. At least that's what my sister told me. It's also possible that this is not universally nostalgia-inducing and you may find it a little gross but just wait 15 seconds, and the mo-mint will be over.
