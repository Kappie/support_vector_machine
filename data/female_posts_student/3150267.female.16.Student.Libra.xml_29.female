Not tt the day is bad (ok the day's bad, hot n humid n stuffy, n no fan... wat else can i expect? *roll eyes* haha...), but the torments i have gone thru... Think abt suffering twice in the same day... Chem n E maths paper... like wat my frenz were saying, "study = CMI, might as well dun study..." So true it is... I mugged for chemistry yesterday nite till 12... n i think i did not do a gd job today... feeling so sori for mrs siew, thinking that she needs to mark so many scripts n see so many wield answers (iodine chloride is one gd answer)... haha... ms lau too, i think she has very high expectations on us (high expectation meaning tt muz pass the paper)... so guys, don't feel sad ok? muz think tt the teachers will have a harder time... so we should be glad tt we r not piled up wif junks... keke...(or u guys already numbed?) haha... we still got a maths n chem n physics paper 1 to go. so muz work hard hard for it ^_^V.  After the exam, i went out with qt, dori, ms n some of dori's frenz to ginza to distress.... actually to fill our stomachs. haha.. reminded me of wat dayima had said yesterday, "ning ke dui bu qi mdm poon, ye bu ke yi dui bu qi du zi..." *giggling* he forsake studying geo for his precious recess... keke... ture enough... on the way there saw wm, didn't say hi to him again... duno y... haha... think he also wun reply if i said hi... somehow i feel invisible sometimes when i m simply in front of him. lol.  *burb* i m so full now... after eating sour n spicy noodles at famosa.. haha... thanks to the gals, i had a wonderful lunch.. ^_^ (not like someone who promised to cook for me but didn't, coz tt person is too busy preparing for a maths tml... promised) nvm nvm... i forgive u... haha...  think my blog is getting more n more crapy n lotsa language mistakes.. haha... but m too lazy to correct them.. keke... maybe writing casually can make me feel more at home? haha... crap... maybe will write something which is more constructive n more innovative bah.. haha.. man, do i luv blogging.. *grinning from ear to ear*  i m thinking of: py n toilet... not tt they r related... but really need the toilet. As for py... really miss talking to her... tried to say bye to her yesterday when i got onto the bus, but she seemed alittle bit surprised... *sigh* still not getting any better... y? (maybe i m the one who should n muz answer this...)   anyway, will stop bloggin rite now n pay my respect to my darling toilet... haha... so everyone plz take care. ^_^   ~A penny will hide the biggest star in the Universe if you hold it close enough to your eye...~    ::Change a point of view n u can soon see another prespective from a different angle... things r not as bad as u think it is *wink* God bless..::
