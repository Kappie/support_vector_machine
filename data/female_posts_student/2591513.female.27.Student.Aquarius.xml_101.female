Corny, like any other teenage thing written...haha But a lot of the things we planned came true...not exactly in the order or the way we would have wanted, but maybe in a way it was better.  Take for example we planned to take many trips, such as one to Hawaii (I was supposed to go with him and some of my friends, but my parents ended up punking out on me.), then a trip to Catalina Island (have not taken that one yet either), a trip to the PI (haven't done that one either) and well the ever so corny, trip down the aisle (HA!  Did that one twice, once in Lake Tahoe, the other in an actual Church).    Okay so there's that...oh and a side note, we have yet to take a honeymoon....maybe when our children are older and we have more money to dedicate to it and splurge with.    Then according to my little dedication to him we are going to have four children...well that almost came true this year.  As you all know I have three...our fourth would have been born this month, actually around this time was my due date...well things happen for a reason and I am sure that when we are ready a beautiful little one will come along.  Sad news, I didn't get the job.  I guess that is sad news, but gives me the opportunity to still search for another job.  I am sure something will come along.  I have every faith in it.    So how is every one doing?  Here are more of my high school memories:  (As you can see, I like the memories, they make me laugh...when you are around sreaming kids all day, you tend to stick to things that humor you.)  * Driving back and forth to Vallejo and San Leandro to see Ed.  * Going out with a guy just because I didn't have a bf in high school (ended being a BIG mistake...I mean come on...when you start as a Senior you are itchin to have a bf)  * Taboo- Keiko and I had the best team...all I have to say is giraffe!  * Driving with Sheryll and my sisters to and from Great America...never danced so much while driving.  * Who could forget the big conversion van I drove to school...Can we say BIG BERTA?  Don't ask where the name came from.  * Ballejo and Nachos...gotta love Aunts..."Lan you want some nachos?"  * Sneaking out of the house...sneaking Ed into the house.  * MY PERM (when you have hair as think as mine and down to your ass...DON'T GET A PERM...well don't get one anyway!)  * Going on numerous dates does not equal dating...especially when the guy sees you as his best girl-slash-friend...oh my bad!  * Swim meets...band "geeks" a Florin High tradition.  * Stresses of yearbook...  * Going to a dance and mom forgetting to pick me up...alone in the parking lot for 2 hours is not fun.  Those are all I can remember for now...sorry if this not amusing to you guys, it is very amusing to me...LOL
