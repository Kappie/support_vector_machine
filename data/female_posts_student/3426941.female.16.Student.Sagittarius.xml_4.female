Anyway, if you had to go thru hell and back to figure out how to get onto this site, I thoroughly apologize for the lack of positive success. Either way, you're here now:)  So, I'm going to this graduation party today and I'm a bit nervous because all of Ryan' fam is going to be there. I mean, I love his family, its just that whole, I hope I come off in a good way. I try to always be myself, it's just that at times myself is a bit "unique" and I tend to ramble, (see name of blog). Anyway, I'm excited. It'll hopefully be a good time.  I was thinking about what I read last night on Ryan's posts and it was cool to see things from his perspective. I feel I got to know things about him that are a bit further below the surface. It's a good thing.   Well, my grandma's calling me to come make eggs for Sunday breakfast. It's the only day of the week I get to play Emeril. (Don't ask) C-ya.
