But then omg me and chels and travis went to Dairy Queen and he bought us those chocolate utopia things oh man were those things to die for!  Then later that night we went to Llody's and we went roller skating/blading and it was soooo fun.  I got to take my mind away from everything and it felt so good.  Alex bought me a rose and Travis got Chels a rose and Travis bought us some fries and like a million glow sticks.  He also gave us a ride there and back.  The funny thing is though I thought I liked Alex but I felt really uncomfortable with him tonight and well I felt this really kind of strong relationship/connection with Travis and not Alex.  I am still gonna go out with Alex on Sunday but I just don't thing going out with him is right at the moment but I don't really want to offend him.  I am really trying to give him a chance but everything he left when we were roller skating I felt better and more like me and stuff.  I thought tonight Alex was acting kinda like a total idot and well he was sort of embarasing in public.  And well I HATE it how he always were those army pants or shorts and stuff and GRRRRRRRR tonight he wore army shorts.  I HATE those.  I mean clothing and looks aren't a big thing but I mean when someone wears that same friggin thing for even and you ONLY see em wearing like one thing it is like a big turn off.  Like ewww man get some new clothes or something!!!  I just don't feel Alex is right for me like at all....I thing Travis would be way better and I still have had that crush on Chester for like what seems to be five billion years!!!  I said I would go out with Alex on Sunday so I guess I am still doing that but I don't really want to but just this one more date and if I still feel like I don't want to be with Alex then I think I am really gonna have to tell him cause I can't hide the truth and my true feelings!
