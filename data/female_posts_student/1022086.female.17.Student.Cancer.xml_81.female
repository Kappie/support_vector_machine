I'm excited. Gradulation yesterday was good times. Jumped and cheered madly for all the fortunate fellers that I love oh-so-much that are leaving. It'll be my turn in a year! That's really exciting.   Though I was envious, it really hit me last night, and I just thought, "Whoa."   Indeed, whoa. I feel so old yet so young, and it's actually a pretty good feeling. I'm not sure what I'll be doing with my life, but I have a few ideas to try out, and whatever will be, will be. I have a life to go to decide.   "Everything is gonna be alright."  Well, I have two parties to go to and another shower to take as the five minutes I spent outside grossened me. Tada!
