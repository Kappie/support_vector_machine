I'm stealing someone else's voicebox and using it for my own evil uses. Bwahahahahaha. I should really go and get a new website, try to make it what I wanted it to be before when I made one. Unfortunately, I messed up that one and I can't really fix it. Grrr.... evil twist of fate. DARN YOU!!!  DARN YOOOOOOOUUUU !!!!   AnywayZ, the last meeting of the  Blue Nile Rites of Passage  program was this weekend. We went to upstate NY to  Camp Deer Run . It was actually pretty nice up there, except for the rain that screwed up my hair and the  FREEZING ICY UNFORGIVING PNEUMONIA-CAUSING PAIN IN THE REAR END  nights. :) AnywayZ, I got to hang out with one of my friends, Mariah. ALSO... and this is a BIG also.... I got the phone number of this really cute boy named  Jason . He's like 15, but we traded numbers anyway. I mean, what's a year's difference? Anyway, this is how the story went...   On the night we got to Camp Deer Run, we had a talent showcase at the cabin (which was really a very nice, two story building with about six bedrooms on each floor with either 2, 3, or 4 sets of bunk beds in them and showers/toilets. I sang a song, most of the other girls did a ghetto fashion show (ugh, seeing all that bad talent over and over... that's what hell must be like). Jason was leaning on the wall next to Mariah. I was on the other side of Mariah and Mariah and I were sitting on the ground. I thought Jason was sorta cute, so I asked if he was gonna do something. He shrugged. I told him he should sing, so he was like "Alright". I asked what he was gonna sing and  OF ALL SONGS , he chooses Usher's " Burn ". He sang it with a lot of emotion, slightly flat, but I've heard worse. He ended by falling to his knees and singing like he really meant it. It was.... unique. All of this was on Friday. By Saturday night, I was sure I liked him. We had made plans to trade numbers and probably give each other a call. He was really nice, laughed at my jokes, and was overall just a really cool guy. On Saturday night we had a party (Jason wasn't there). I was talking to my friend  Amire  and I happened to mention that I thought Jason was cute. So he looks at me and is like, " Do you like him? " and I keep going " maybe " and he's like " no, seriously, do you like him? " and I'm like " Don't tell anyone! " until finally, he says " NO, Jason's like my best friend. I can get you the hook-up, " so now I'm thanking Amire and telling him I love him forever, but by the end of the party, he says " I might not be able to hook you up because I'm trying to get with someone myself, " which I can understand, even though he refuses to tell me WHO he's trying to get with. On Sunday morning, we had church in a back room and before it begins, Amire tells me " I have bad news " and I  HATE  bad news, so I tell him to wait until after service, so afterwards I go up to him and say " So what is it? He already has a girlfriend? He doesn't like me? " and Amire says " No, he doesn't have a girlfriend and he knows you like him, but he doesn't like you like that. " I thanked him for at least finding out for me, but you know Naia does NOT give up! At lunch, I gave him my phone number, got his, and I'm waiting for him to call me.   I'm type afraid to call him in case I get his mom or someone else in his family, so I'll see if he calls me. I'mma give him about a week. Then I might call him; tell him I'm calling all the people whose numbers I got and seeing if they wanna hang out. LOL. My friend Tiffany keeps telling me, " You never know, Amire might be lying, " so I'm still checking for signs to see if Jason might like me. If he doesn't, I'd be a little hurt, but as long as we can still hang out. If he doesn't call me, I'll call him probably on the 18th of June to see if he wants to hang out on the 19th (that's a Saturday.... I think... I'm pretty sure it is...).  This Saturday, I might hang out with  Davia , maybe go to see " Shrek 2 ". I'm planning a sleep-over for me, Tiffany, and Mariah. That'll probably be in the summer, though.     Everybody out there, keep your fingers crossed for me and Jason .     See you next time, God willing and the creek don't rise,   -SmOokie
