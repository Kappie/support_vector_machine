Two items of note:  1)  The authors' use of the expression "pony up."  Very nice.  I like that a lot.  2)  I don't know whether the summertime exhaust/humidity combo has gone to their heads, but what kind of sucker would lend their cellphone to a total stranger?  Or am I just on the lower end of the wicked friendly scale?  I just picture some seemingly hapless tourist asking me for my phone and the next thing I know, I find myself $150 in the hole, and I'm telling people, "They said they were lost and just needed to call...."  Please.  Also, the News has published their  urlLink "get-in-the-know-guide to the summer's hottest, hippest happenings."   Care for a digest of the digest?  Some highlights are:  - The best pick appears at the end. I have to put it first.  The summer beverage for the hottest, hippest, in-the-know New Yorkers is Bacardi Silver Low Carb Black Cherry.  Damn. Thanks god for the Daily News. Otherwise I would have been drinking the new low-carb  urlLink OE 800 .  - #1 on the list is the new Catwoman movie with boring-ass Halle Berry.  I would roll my eyes like a 15-year-old about this movie either way, but come on.  When will we get over Halle Berry?  What if  urlLink Eva Mendes  were Cat Woman? Aw, yeah.  (Plus, Cat Woman juxtaposed with Spider Man?  Boring. All boring.)  - The item, "One Piece Heaven" is about a bathing suit.  Behold the trimmings: "It's a one-piece, and one-pieces are usually so boring, but the leather and clear plastic straps make it exciting."  Nothing makes a nice pattern of 3rd degree burns like clear plastic straps baking in the sun and pressing against your skin. Awesome!   -  Usher. Bill Clinton. My true loves.   - Conventional wisdom is that as soon as the New York Times runs a piece purporting to expose the "Chicest Bar Scene," that scene is officially dead, and was probably dead 6 months ago.  But what about when the Daily News does it? Hm.  -  Google e-mail.  Google IM.  Get a job. Get a life.
