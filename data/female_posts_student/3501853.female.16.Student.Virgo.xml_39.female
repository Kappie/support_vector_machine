We went back to their house or my house w.e (lol) and Anthony showed me and Mikala how to play Texas 'Hold Em poker. I sucked ass but I won one round and I just like the game itself now that I know the rules. After playing, I went next door to my house to get ready and Britta-ny picked me up. We went to the October Fall show in Wheaton with Clay and Rachel in Clay's car following us. October Fall was real good and played their new songs too, the last song they played they played really good. Inept was okay but the other bands werent good. We left right after Inept played, I think Clay got annoyed of me for that :-\ but anyways, even though the show was good and all..I don't think I'd want to go back to Wheaton. We got lost SOOO bad going to and from. I've never been that lost ever in my life but it's okay, no biggie, ew I've been saying that a lot. I didn't sell the spare ticket, oh well, wut can ya do? I don't really care anyways (lol) I'll just pay Tom, no big. So now I'm home talking to Mikey who I haven't talked to in forever, I'm really glad he IM'd me he's a cute kid but I'm REALLY tired, seriously its been so long since I've been this tired, I definitely need sleep..._Camille_  ..."remember when, the music played, you held me, you looked down at me, i smiled up at you, you smiled back, it was magical and a moment nothing can touch; well that moment stil makes me cry even w/just the music playing again"...  ...."What did I do?
