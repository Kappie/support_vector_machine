I took a picture of the barrack and some nice mountain ranges along the way. The flight yesterday was ok, but for some reason I got sick to my stomach on the flight out of Sacramento. Danielle and I were very happy to finally get off the the planes and onto solid ground. When we got to Texas Jesse and David surprised us. Jesse almost knocked me off my feet, he startled me. I was so happy to see him and all I could do is hug and kiss him. God, I miss him. I am glad I got the oportunity to fly out here and see him before he goes overseas.
