It started off horribly-- confrontation with dad (whats new) and dealing with my wildly unrestrained siblings as fun as that is; but hey, the day did get better. I worked with Heather and Kenny, my two favorite Hardees people of course-- my best friend and my boyfriend (God I feel so weird saying, or typing that rather). I argued with my dad again when I got home-- again, absolutely horrid experience. But... we apologized through eye contact at dinner, and I feel okay now. I read some AP, listened to the Les Mis soundtrack, watched some Friends reruns, and here I am now.  No, not the greatest of days indeed. But, I have all of my limbs, I am not plagued with any serious contention, no illness thwarts my ability to live my life to the fullest, so I'm good compared to some. And I guess that's all I can ask-- to realize that when I am having a bad day, that many have it worse than me, and I really need to remind myself that everything happens for a reason, and God is always on my side.
