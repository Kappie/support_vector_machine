Saturday Night: My husband who wishes that should being calling him SOMETHING other than my hubby and shall henceforth be known as Bear...anywho we sat down and watched a tape of HBO's version of "Angels in America Part I." (See past blog for photo of a play production that I was involved in at OU in 2000.) It was awesome. It was at times also as if Tony Kushner (the author/playwright/screenwrighter) might have sneeked into our performance of the play. So many similarities. Then I remembered that Vince Cardinal (the director of our version) saw the original Broadway "Angels..." but I also remembered that I sat in on every moment of rehearsal for that play and that he let the actors determine their own actions to land with every line. He was not a heavy handed director. Well if the cast saw this version of Angels they should be pleased that their interpretations were so agreed with. Some of the HBO cast even LOOKED like the OU castmembers. Eeeerily so. Perhaps the script is just so well written that it doesnt leave room for alternate interpretations...and then I remembered going to OSU's production of "Angels in Americal Part II" in Columbus and what a terrible awful mess of a production that it was. Disgraceful really. The second part of the HBO series will surely do better by Kushner's work.  We also went and saw New York Minute yesterday as a Matinee....Hmmm...what to say. The best moment of the movie I dont want to ruin, but can I say Full House flashback! The soundtrack was good, the editting was well done, the director seemed to be slacking, and so did some of the actors aboard the cast. MK and Ash did a fine job...although I rememeber seeing an interview with them saying how their were each playing their opposite in real life...Ash playing the wild one and MK the reserved one....in reality this was not the case. And other than their costuming I still cant tell the non identical Olsens apart for the life of me. It was still enjoyable - not like the remake of the Time Machine where every moment was like there was less oxygen in the air...but it will not likely receive any oscars. What future does the careers of the soon to be 18 year old Olsen's hold? I say, produce produce produce. Design fashion...if it can be toned down a little...and well keep acting and singing I suppose but PLEASE dont hire the former Joe Dirt Director EVER again. The Olsens could have done better themselves. By the way - I cant help but wonder how Simple Plan and the Wakefields - two fairly well known and decently received punk bands...are keeping face having participated in the Olsen twin flick. Or will it soon be alt/punk to dig the twins?  Ah, we have almost mastered the digital camera we purchased. Many a photo we have taken at this point...moving, up close, far away...etc. Testing its very limits. We are really really happy with our Minolta Z2. I have even started to grasp the Manual controls as well.  Books: Just finised "Ella Minnow Pea" by Mark Dugan. A very funny book about what would happen if we were suddenly forbidden from using certain letters of the alphabet.It is a love of language and words that created "Ella..." and its a quick fun read for anyone. If my county library had the book there is no excuse for anyone not to be able to find it! I also finished two mysteries by Patricia Carlon - an Australian writer from the 60's. Either book would make a GREAT movie. "Hush, it's a Game" and "Crime of Silence." I would love to produce either. If only I had the money and the film rights. Someone will make a million or 10 on my suggestion/idea to turn them into films someday. Mark my words.  Today is still Monday it seems. Homework to do. Cat to cuddle. Cleaning to accomplish. YMCA training starting again tonight.  All the news in fits of print... Mack
