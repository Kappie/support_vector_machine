We just said hello and they kinda took it from there because they asked where you were and I said you were in the bathroom.  I don't know where they got everything else.  All thirteen year olds are drama queens cuz they want their lives to be interesting and its not.  Sorry if she cried; she brought it upon herself.  And you don't help it much by tolerating her controling you're life.  But I'll stay out of it.  No more advice, etc.  Bye, Josh.  See You Monday.  If you want to get mad, fine.  If you want to sink to their level, that's cool.  Just don't bring it out on the DI team.  Oh, and we're about as happy with you as you are with us.
