I did miss the Folk Festival that I so desperatly wanted to go and I heard it was a blast. So I feel poorly on a bunch of different fronts. But, we all need to get sick, and I"d rather mine now, when I"m of no burden to anyone...  So I think its like 19 days till I leave. Not only am I excited, but I"m truly looking forward to starting school again. Theres something for me about learning, about drawing ideas and being in a atmosphere where everyone is there for the same reason that inspires me to do my best. The only thing that I am trepadacious about is not knowing anyone. Academics I can handle, social interaction...that scares me. I have a few quasi relatives in Calgary and one friend I haven't seen in ages. Something that has been going through my mind for the past several months is when someone I knew, only through being in the same seminar class with him, proclaimed that I'm an introvert. I had always thought of myself as an extrovert. My whole life. But shortly after he said that I was forced to take a personailty test, and it was reconfirmed that I am indeed an intorvert. I fight against this label, all the time, but its now plain to see, especially in the area od social interaction, that I am an introvert. Evertime I move somewhere (Dublin, Cape Town, Calgary), I"m faced with the realization that I have a hard time meeting other people. Eeep. the very thought again is making me ill. I"m sure I'm giving myself an ulcer....
