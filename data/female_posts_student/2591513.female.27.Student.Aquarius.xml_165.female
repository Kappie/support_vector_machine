I am tired and trying to get my bills and things of that sort straightened out.  Gosh, it is starting to get more tedious than anything else.  I don't know.  Well anyhow, I better get going for now.  I have to finish a few things around here before I am free to go about my business.  Take care and hope your week is going well.  Oh Curie just got back from NYC.  I am so jealous.  I want to make a trip up that way when I can.  I want to go and visit Heidi and her family.  I think it would be a good way to get away froma ll the stress that will come as soon as Ed leaves.  Ed will be leaving in about a month.  I don't know if I am ready for this.
