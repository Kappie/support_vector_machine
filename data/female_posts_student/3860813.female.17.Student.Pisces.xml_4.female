I've been meaning to buy it since last month, but I never had the time to buy it until now. The two CD's are supposed to be an early birthday gift for me from me. Wheee. I love it I love it I love it but not as much as I love you guys. Hehe. Wala lang.  Enough with the mushy posts! :D Tomorrow is MONDAY. (Oh that's new. Haha.)  YAY .  Oh, Ateneo beat FEU today. 67-64. Hahaha. Let's hope this winning streak lasts until the end of the season.
