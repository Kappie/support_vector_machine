I mean maybe i am biased as you know what i feel for Jason. As much as he hurt me i don't want him hurt, well part of me does, part of me wants him to see how much it actually hurts to be cheated on or played around with. I mean, Jason is practically a lie in himself,he doesn't know how to be faithful or be honest, and thats him, thing is i believed him when he said to me he had changed, which sucks, because when it dawns on you that he hasn't it hurts much more to realise what an idiot you have been... He said he loved me? Maybe i have a stupid opinion of love? Maybe i don't know what it is? But i know i am never going to use it out of context again, i did love him but it doesn't felt like he loved me, i wonder if he will now throw out the book? I hope not, i was trying to work out whether i would want it or not, i should just say no, throw it, maybe if i knew he was throwing it out it would make me understand more? What i can't understand is how he can lay all over me on Wedsneday night, be nice to me and flirty, and constantly remind me of the past, talk about this Emily that he likes and then the next day he is going to get with Laura? He is playing mind games and i don't have the mental strength to work them out and try and get back on him. Eliot was right to yell at me, its pathetic, i just really really want Jason to kick himself and want me back, i'm not expecting it, but for that to happen would be great. Carlos... Not much going on, just want to be his mate, and i don't want anything else. Dave... Now i am having trouble working out what i want with him, i catch myself thinking about him a bit, and wanting to text him.. We get on well when we talk online, which is cool, but when we saw each other Weds night, we were both a bit distant, i just needed the guts to go over and talk to him, i impressed him with getting over the fence though! Even though i almost tripped over! But again Jason was there, and i was talking to him and he was being nice and i was so confused at it all. I am easily confused it seems. I am so glad no one actually knows about this blog, its full of stupid crap about Jason, its all pointless. In a way i don't want him and Laura to work, but in another i do, as then i might be over him, its going to be very hard to see them together, if they are going out? At the cartoon or whatever, kissing etc, and i keep thinking he'll call her things he did to me, and it all seemed special with me but its not when he says it to everyone... Who knows, i'd love to think deep down in his heart, he does still care, when he hears a certain song, or reads the book if he ever does, but he doesn't dwell on the past, and i can't seem to shrug if off me. I'll be paid soon, and that means i will be able to go out, maybe i'll get Dave to come with me?   ~Lisa~
