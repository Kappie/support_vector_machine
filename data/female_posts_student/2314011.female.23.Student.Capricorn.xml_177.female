The fan's in the window and the spring air's circulating nicely through the apartment.  As though the emotional changes, growing, and sharing wasn't enough (we'll get to that in a minute), the whole experience has just been topped off by an email from (you'll never guess) Lorraine and I'm sitting here in a new place at last.    Something's been building for the last few months, something not-so-vaguely resembling the final blow-up/breakdown before the Age of Silence this November.  But, with the gift of experience and Susan's advice, I've been able to prevent any nasty expectations from causing more trouble than they're worth and have been able to accept anything Lorraine's given me by way of communication in the last few weeks.  It seems I'm still a problem; an issue, sword, card  to be unleashed only in the most heated, raw discussions.  Despite all her best efforts to maintain peace and balance between us all, Lorraine seems to be losing.  And rather than rushing to her aid, to be there, to listen and to hold (albeit over the phone), I've sat back and waited, resisting the urge every bit of myself is compelled to act upon.  Reading her message today, I found myself waiting for the spark of being slighted, of being put aside in the interest of waiting to see how things worked themselves out.  It never came.  Instead, I felt incredibly sad for how she must be feeling and smiled when I pictured her outside, playing in the dirt.  I will be here when she needs me, but I won't be counting the minutes until she does.  Not out of indigence (finally), but out of patience, trust, and resolve.  I can't attribute my reaction entirely to the experience of this weekend, but I can't deny its impact, either.  And when I think about it, what we did as a group wasn't that extraordinary.  We sat in a room, walked across it a few times and talked.  But walking across a room can be the most difficult, profound thing one can do when one's exposing more about the self than one ever thought or intended to do.  And that's what we did for a day and a half; even when we weren't in the "walking" exercise, we exposed ourselves, sometimes to the core, and held one another together as a cohesive, bonded group afterward.    The idea was to learn how to be more multiculturally competent in order to better serve our clients, colleagues and ourselves.  In so doing, I didn't expect to delve quite so deep into who I am as a person or to listen quite so intently to the people around me.  But, if you want to make the world a better place, free of bias and injustice, the first place to start is yourself.  By the end of the day, I didn't want to leave the room and renter the world at large.  I felt like we'd done so much work together and how was I ever going to incorporate something so big and meaningful into my everyday life?    I guess I'll figure that out as I go along, and I can already tell nothing will compare to the ride.
