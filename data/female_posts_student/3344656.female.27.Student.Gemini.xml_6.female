And "Life is a placebo masquerading as a similie" is actually a metaphor.  I forget with whom I was arguing this, but it is.  It just contains a similie.  It's a funny day.  But not funny Ha Ha.  Just funny.  And although I slept normally last night, I have an unhappy sinking feeling in my stomach anyway.
