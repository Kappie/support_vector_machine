And then last night i had that strange dream Where everything was exactly how it seemed Where concerns about the world getting warmer The people thought they were just being rewarded For treating others as they like to be treated For obeying stop signs and curing diseases  changedfish For mailing letters with the address of the sender Now we can swim any day in november  Dont wake me i plan on sleeping...  (now we can swim any day in november)
