Besides getting out of school like....5 hrs early......Me, Brittany and Jessica went to our first NHL game together and it was Brittany's very FIRST NHL game.  We made these awesome signs but we didn't get on the jumbotron because i think the camera people were lazy.  Here's what our signs consisted of: * Eat More Sharks * Don't Touch Him, He's Finnish! (me and Jess' sign) * Mo, score a goal for me, its my 1st game (Britty's sign) * What now San Jose What now?! * Go Stars! (the generic one) * NHL: Nonstop Hockey Love They were awesome signs.  Very colorful.  My personal fave was the 'Don't touch him he's finnish" one, but Niko was scratched that game so i didn't really get to hold it up for anyone except for Jere.  Oh well.  I would just like to blame Tippett for messing up our night.  First, he sends Antti Miettinen (Jessica's boy) back to frickin Utah AND THEN he scratches Niko.  The only person that was really there was Mike Modano, but i guess that was important since it was Britty's first game.  Then Brittany and Jessica came over to spend the night and we watched the last of the Colorado vs. Anaheim game (in which Anaheim won in overtime) and Paul Kariya is soooo cute!  He's so little and tiny and he skates so fast! Now that he's not on Anaheim, i can think he's cute.  Why couldn't i think he was cute last year? Well if you take a look at my note to Sarah Casey in her yearbook, you'll know why.  I was boycotting the Mighty Ducks and everything Disney with Brittany last year during playoffs.  I secretly thought Kariya was cute, but if i told that to Brittany, she would kill me.  So i waited until he was traded and now i can like him! lol, that was my random story of the day.  Anyways, Brittany's friend called at 2am while we were sleeping and thats why i felt really tired today.  I haven't really done much of anything today except watch movies.    Sports update: Coppell plays Marcus at next game.  And i'm really scared because 4 players (Drinkwater, Habibi, Wszolek, Kukla) are suspended for the next 3 games after that stellar fight against Jesuit people after the loss.  I will never forget that fight.  Especially the part where T.J. came in and was just ripping the guy apart as it seemed.  Dallas also plays Pheonix tonight at 8pm.  Scared about that too, i don't think we've ever beaten them yet.  I dunno i can't remember.  Yeah, so, represent.    I think i'm going to go eat now.....  Go Stars!, ~~~Taylor~~~
