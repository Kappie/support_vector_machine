Following the success of pineapple growers who developed sweeter pineapple varieties, growers in Japan and the Philippines are growing sweeter varieties of bananas.  The folks at  urlLink Chiquita  have hired a research and development outfit to come up with different varieties of bananas that may come in different flavors and colors (how about a lavender, cappuccino banana?).  Bananas already come in a variety of wild colors, but not all are edible.
