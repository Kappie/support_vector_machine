I hope later in life I have a lot of money and stuff so I can have the best vacations with my family and husband whenever I want and just do huge fun things. I'd love to leave a lot to my children and family also. And be remembered also. I wish I was a princess. haha I wonder if living with a Monarch goverment is that bad, I think the United Kingdom is doing pretty good. Wow, Harry has more money than William, But William get's to be king so I guess that's fair. He get's soooo much when he is king. Anyways, I'm just amazed. Anyways, Angelina Jolie amazes me so much more. I'll write about her sometime, there is no way I can say everything I'd ever want to about her though. She's working on her pilot license right now, that's so cool. I'd love to learn to fly, I'm going to hopefully get my license just for fun someday. It isn't that expensive really. Oh, well Ashton Kutcher is on now, and I've already seen this, but gosh he is beautiful so I can't let this distract me! Aloha
