I wanted her wardrobe and she is most definitely the mot stylish woman in Britain at the moment (gosh she even won an award for it). More importantly despite the allegations of affairs, and the hatred of the British media Victoria has remained the most glamourous and down to earth celebrity on the planet.  In an interview on Parkinson I was suprised to listen to her talk about how normal this couple is. They do all the normal things that couple's do and as a mum she has all the normal concerns, just on a much larger scale.  Victoria Beckham is a woman who deserves our admiration and respect, after all that she has been through to get her man she deserves him - I hope he makes her happy.
