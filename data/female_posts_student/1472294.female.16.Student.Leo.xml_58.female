My brother's friend got free standing tickets.   - Saturday. Finally got to go, went there early in the morning with my brother's  friends. Heh, Heh, I am the oldest, I am the oldest.... But what I was displeased that my brother's friends fooled around at Silso Beach in full clothed. I mean, almost everybody was wearing bikinis and board shorts and except the BB 31st Coy and some organisation, WE DO LOOK WEIRD.... Continue...   - The concert was GREAT! First there was SHIN Band, Elva, Qiu Zhe (??), Fang Fang, Jolin, 5566, 5566's mentor teacher who is about to release his solo album and 1 more whom I can't remember, sorry... But my photos turned out badly. *Boo Hoo* We went there late lah.... Haiz.... All heads, I am only 160cm, ya know.....   - Sunday. Took the NEL all the way to Dobby Ghaut. I mean, from Rumbia (don't ask me, I also did not know there was such a place) in LRT then travelled up (?).... Went to PS but did not enjoyed thoroughly. My brother's tution was at 5pm and the whole family reached there at  2pm. So it was RUSH, RUSH AND RUSH!   So, there is the end of my 1 week journey. Spend the whole of this week lazing around and finishing up homework...     8 MORE DAYS TILL THE RELEASE OF -+- *THE TWINS EFFECT* -+-
