They impose the endless fight     To always be perfect.     It seems they have been chosen     To be above the rest.     But the contradiction stands     Between these perfect lives     And the words that they've misread...     There was no reading.          Say all the things that you really want to say     The truest of forms will show,     Finally you'll find your soul.     Say all the things that you really want to say     The truest of forms will show,     And finally you'll find your soul.          The landscapes of being     Are endlessly competing,      back and forth     For an answer to existence     That we can never find,     In all of the places that we've searched out,     In all of the pulses that we've taken...     There was no reading.          Say all the things that you really want to say     Then you'll find, the truest of forms will show     And finally you'll find your soul.     Say all the things that you really want to say     Then you'll find, the truest of forms will show     And finally we'll find our souls.          Give us the answers     And the ability to hear          The landscapes of being     Are endlessly competing,      back and forth     For an answer to existence     That we can understand.          Perhaps we're looking far too closely.     We can't see all the evidence in its entirety...     The air in our lungs,     The complexity of our love.          Say all the things that you really want to say     Then you'll find, the truest of forms will show     And finally you'll find your soul.     Say all the things that you really want to say.          Say what you really want to say     And the truest of forms will show,     Finally you'll find your soul.          (p.s. thank you betsy for mentioning they are one of your favorite bands..)
