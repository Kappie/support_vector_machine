Adam had work to do on me comp and sam just came with him it was good to talk.  Then i had to work and i saw leslie, she and michelle got back from idaho and said it was a pretty good time, and then came home and ate some subway and adam came down and then leslie came up and sammy showed back up And now im talkin to michelle on the net and shewrote me a comment that was so sweet! .  aww i missed my friends i dont know what ill do without them.  The only one still missing is jacklie- the tijuanna trekker herself.  Hmm the daily show is on now.  bill clinton is on tonight.  so i think i will watch this one- see what goes down.  g'night.  P.S. tomorrow will be fun! "Im thankful that the sun came up" Until Time Next
