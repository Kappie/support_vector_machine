Well today "little" stinky (our nickname for him) was really having a hard time staying awake. This is nothing new because he normally snores during class but it was unusually loud and obvious today. Well he sits in front of me and he was doing the whole sway thing that happens when you sleep sitting up. I think my life flashed before my eyes because I thought he was going to fall out of his chair this morning. I almost laughed but I held it back.   In other funny things that really aren't funny I was part of a conspiracy to set off the alarms in the library. Now our offices are in the library and so we have to walk through those sensors that set off an alarm if you have a book that hasn't been checked out. Well there is a boy who copies all of our answers and doesn't do any real work so yesterday "they" (a party that will remain unnamed- I didn't do it although I knew about it) slipped a small book (more like a phaphlet) in his book bag among a bunch of papers. Now we didn't get to see him leave last night but we did follow him out this afternoon and we almost died when the alarm went off. We had to go back up the stairs before he saw us to keep our identities unknown but the best part of the whole thing is that it hasn't occurred to him that there is something in his bag he thinks it is the bag itself which had never before in 6 months set off the alarm. Well they will let anyone in grad school- I mean they let me in.   Last Item and I know this is a totally long blog. I am giving up alcohol for Lent so since it is fat Tuesday I am going out with the girls and we are going to have a blast because although I can go out I will not be able to drink for 40 days. Its worth it just to keep up the support for everyone else and of course its for a great reason by itself!  HAPPY MARDI GRAS EVERYONE!!!
