When Fifi was dumped by the landscaper (that horrible loser), I emailed her an extremely encouraging email ...  Dear Fifi,   I was absolutely appalled to hear what the landscaper did to you. What kind of lowlife dumps someone by text message? I just want you to know that you have the support of all your listeners, and I doubt any of us will accept invitations out from landscapers any time   soon! Don't worry, you'll find a better man in no time! From Brittany P.S. Marty better stay off your back for a bit, seeing as you are obviously emotionally distraught and unable to put up with any of his crap. I wonder if he could go a day of not being a complete and utter idiot...  To my amazement, they actually read my email out on air the next day, and Marty said he was very hurt. I also received this reply in my inbox:  Hey Brittany, Thanks so much for emailing Fifi.  We're printing off all the lovely letters of support and binding it up for her to remind her that we all love her and she doesn't need the landscaper. Cheers, The Shebang.     I also emailed them about Fifi's CD compilations, and received this reply:  Hey Brittany, Unfortunately Fi's done this on the sly, and hasn't got permission from the record companies or the bands, so she'd get into massive trouble if she made more copies and give them out.   So sorry about that, but in the next coupleof days we'll post the tracklisting on our website, so if you are able to make your own, that'd be cool. Cheers, The Shebang.     Yeah, so maybe it means nothing to anyone other than myself ... but still, they aren't the only replies I've received ... I'm just wondering if I should join the cloudstreet war ...
