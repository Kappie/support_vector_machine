I'm prolly not gonna listen to anything in my classes again. And i forgot to call bill. Dammit i feel weird right now cuz this stupid internet thing wont let me onto the bloggies. And it sucks!!! all morning i've been trying to see Francesca's and tried to see if i have e-mail from her but NOOOOO page not found. Fuck the page i want to read it!
