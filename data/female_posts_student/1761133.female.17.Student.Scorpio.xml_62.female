I know i told you i don't feel the way i used to I know i said things that were hard to accept from me But please believe that now tha pain's catching up with me Tell me how can i make you see That, baby, all the hurt i've caused, i'm making up for it now And i've had some time all to myself and i think i've figured it out  I never miss you 'til you're gone away from me I took your love for granted, now it's killing me And every time it happens this way, right when i let you go Imean stay, and i never miss you 'til you're gone away from me  And it's so funny 'cause i never though i'd feel like this now And if you never come back what am i to do now Will i ever mend this broken heart, i know i'm the one to blame Know i need you in my life for everything to be the same Was searching for someone i thought would be everything i need When love was right in front of me
