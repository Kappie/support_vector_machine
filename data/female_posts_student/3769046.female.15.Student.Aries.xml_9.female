If you look at me you'll understand,  all I want is to hold your hand.  I felt this way for oh-so-long,  and it hurts me that I don't belong.  Wanting you to want me it's all a dream,  my heart aches I just want to scream.  I smile and laugh just thinking of you,  together here I wish it was true.   I always imagine of your gentle touch,  if only you knew that I felt this much.  Not being with you I'm falling apart,  'cause I don't know how to get your heart.  If you could only see the love in my eyes,  of all those nights when I sat and cried.  Just look at me I'm standing here,  just call out my name and I'll be there.  How the long the wait I do not know,  but when the day comes I'll let it show.  If only you knew me feelings for you,  I'll stay hopeful you'll feel the same way too."
