It was even worse today, they kept talking to me asking me, what my name was, where I lived, if I had a boyfriend, where do I go to school, EVERYTHING.  It was awful, but worst was when one of his friends came over and said “He wants to take you to a movie, then he wants to get you real slow.  He thinks you look like a really special girl, so he said he’d go slow for you. But just so you know, hes a player, I don't think you'd want to go out with him. ”  "Ya think!"  OH MY WORD!  GAH!  So yeah, no beating around the bush.  Cripe, this is going to make swimming in the same pool with him REALLY awkward, if I see him again I am going to have to scream it in his face, he can’t seem to take a hint.  “NOT INTERESTED!”  Man, if I ever wished I had a good guy in my life today was it.  I wanted someone to get in this guys face and say “Hey watch it, shes my girl.  And thats not how you talk to a lady.”  But alas…I had to fend for myself.
