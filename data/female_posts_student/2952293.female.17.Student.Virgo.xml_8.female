He was stuttering since he was really nervous, and I laughed at him. Then this kid talked about how he used to get drunk a lot, but he didn't like it, cause he threw up. He didn't like waking up to a trashcan full of VOMIT, as he put it. I laughed. I mean I felt bad, but he was getting graphic, and girls were grossed out. Then I had a very unproductive study hall. I sat in the library with Elizabeth and Sammy. I was telling Sammy that I am allergic to flea bites, and that when I get them they get all large and pussy. I meant that they're full of puss, but I definitely didn't say that. People in the library laughed in judgement. Talked to Margaret awhile, and Elizabeth revealed to Margaret that she had been mean to me and I was sad. But I told her I let it go, but now she knows.  We went in Meghan's car to tutoring. When we were pulling in, everybody kept looking at us awkwardly. Little did we know that tutoring was canceled AGAIN. ERIN MCCAFFERY, GET IT RIGHT! We went to Starbucks and got some stuff. Meghan got a cranberry type of food and it was good. Then I saw Sarah Gold's brother, and I shouted, "ISAAC RULES!" then I waved and he was really confused. Mrs. Gold pulled up next to us to see who was harrassing her son, and I don't think she remembered me. We drove back towards school, and we saw this middle school boy and girl who were getting all snuggly, so Meghan beeped the horn and I "woo hooed" at them. They were in SHOCK! HAHAHAHAHAHAAH! I was gonna get my backpack out of Meghan's trunk but she kept pulling away. GRRR. So then I went home. Now I am here.  Ooh and apparently somebody's really attactive brother came to school yesterday. MICHAEL KELLEY RULES! ahahahahah, Ann doesn't read my blog, so she will NEVER know I just said that. But I tell her everyday anyways. I am going to force her to let me watch the Apprentice tomorrow at her house. It probably won't happen, but I will let you know if it does.  I just want to mention Jessica Tidd, cause I love her. And she's really, REALLY FUNNY!  Thanks bye!
