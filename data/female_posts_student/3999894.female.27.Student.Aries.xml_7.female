The Group are currently planning their "International Day" event at the library on the 4th September and they are looking for local entertainers and performers who can help represent the range of cultures and nationalities living in Lea Bridge at the event. If you think you can help out get in touch and I'll put you in touch with the Group or come along to the meeting on the 1st.
