Haha...most of the other bands sucked though. Like the first band was a bunch of losers who SUCKED ASS....and those crazy baby killers...haha. Oh, and the fact that I was up till about 3 washing that blue hair dye out of my hair...bleh. HeHe.  The single life can be fun, I admit, but currently, it's sucking. I don't feel like being single any more.  Well...that's about all that is going on with me. I'll see yall laters.
