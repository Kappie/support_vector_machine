It feels like summer. I really need to get the a/c fixed. I don't htink that I will be able to live through another July without it!!! (But that comes after the fridge and freezer) Yeah. So anyways.  Not much is really happening here. My grandfather is coming out soon, but I have decided not to go with him. I will be here!!  It feels so weird not to have anyone here. (Friends I mean. My brother and sister are still here.) But yeah... Well, I'm done rambling for now. Maybe I'll come back later and talk some more, but I doubt it. If any of you know how to fix afrdge, please tell me!!! lol Although, I'm thinking that none of us do know how to do that. Ah well.   "I never tire of being useful."
