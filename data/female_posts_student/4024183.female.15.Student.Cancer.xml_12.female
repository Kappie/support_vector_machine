I like all my teachers with the exception of one. Angie Bishop. She teaches accounting. I had her last year, for business communications, and needless to say, we didn't get along. But its ok, because that's my first period, and I get that out of the way right at the beginning of the day. Well, I had better go get situated for tomorrow. Bye!
