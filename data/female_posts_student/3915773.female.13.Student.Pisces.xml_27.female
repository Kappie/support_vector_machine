Or should magazines accept money from anyone who wants to advertise a legal product?  That question was highlighted in The New York Times today, by a group who is upset that National Geographic Kids has ads for sugary junk food (especially since the cover story of the grown-up version of National Geographic this month is on obesity).   "The Center for Science in the Public Interest has sent a letter to the National Geographic Society, publisher of the magazines, complaining about the ads for products like Hostess cupcakes and Kellogg's Smorz cereal in the publications.   "It is unconscionable that the National Geographic Society, with its esteemed reputation and longstanding educational mission for both adults and children, has chosen to cram National Geographic Kids magazine with advertisements for sugary cereals, candy and snack foods," the letter says."
