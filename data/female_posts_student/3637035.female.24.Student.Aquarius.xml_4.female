I finally realized today exactly what he meant. For instance... Whenever I needed a drive somewhere (to do my groceries or whatever) I'd call on one of my parents to drop everything and take me to do my grocery shopping. I didn't realize how this might have made people feel, until I sat down today and had a long hard THINK TIME about the way I am treated, and I am continually taken for granted every single day without fail.  Taking for granted isn't the same as using in my opinion. My terms are as follows:   To 'Use' someone: Intentionally befriending somebody, being in a relationship with somebody, or holding association with somebody with the motive of 'personal gain'.    To 'Take for granted': To expect, and depend on others to pick up your pieces for you. In other words, too highly expectant of other people, and the key word here is  EXPECT    I have this friend. She continually comes to my door each and every day for the sole reason of wanting something. Either she wants to use my phone, or my computer, or she wants this or wants that. Wants wants wants. Today, however, I got extremely pissed off. Because its not the fact that she's constantly asking for shit, its the way she does it. She does it in a round-about way. She hints at things. And if you choose not to take her hints by giving in, she makes you feel like your the lowest piece of dirt on the face of the earth by crying, and carrying on and all that other crap. And if you DO give her what she's 'hinting' towards, then voila! All Her problems seem solved, and she's happy again. But if you don't give in, she pulls this depression thing, saying no one cares about her and all this other crap.   Some examples... A couple of months ago, she had no cigarettes. I certainly am having a hard enough time supporting myself and 2 children let alone someone else who makes nearly $20.00 an hour at her job. So, she came over and was 'beating around the bush' about how she had no cigarettes. I knew what she was getting at, but I didn't give in. She was hoping I would feel sorry for her and offer her a bunch of my cigarettes. So, whatever... She then startted crying and shaking and alllllllllllll this other stuff, so finally I offered her a couple cigarettes.  Same thing yesterday. Carrying on. But, when I didn't give in, she got on the phone to my mom and started crying to her how she had no money. Well, my mom is nothing to her. My mom doesn't know her that well. So, my mom suggested to her "call the welfare agency and see if they can help you until you get paid on Thursday". After that was said, my mom and her said their goodbyes, and she hung up the phone and made a face. She said "Your mom told me to go to welfare for a MEASLY 20 bucks", as if she was completely astonished with the fact that my mom never offered to help her. NERVE! To make matters worse, this person is in her mid 30's acting like this. She wants everybody to pick up her mess for her. I don't understand exactly what the problem is... She makes all that money, she pays her rent when its convenient for her, she has no cable, no phone, no cell phone anymore... All she has is all these animals to feed. Well, if you can't afford to look after yourself, why not get rid of your animals and start taking care of yourself, instead of relying on everyone else all the time.  Like, I don't mind doing favors every now and again. That's not my issue. But this person seems to be the type that if you do one little thing, it becomes expected. I've asked her for favors, but I've always repaid the favor, AND THEN SOME. Now I feel like I have an unwanted member to my family. Don't get me wrong. I like the girl, but I shouldn't be expected to pay her way. I have an income that is 10 times lower than hers... I have everything that I could want, plus I am able to feed myself, my man, and my kids adequately, and I even have enough left over each week to be able to go out for a drink. So, what's the problem? She never comes over just to see how I'm doing. Its always when she wants something. She came up here FIVE times yesterday looking for handouts. And its hard to tell someone like that to stop, because of the guilt trip you get afterwards.  I was talking to my sweetie about it, and I asked him "Can't she just appreciate the fact that we've done so much for her? Why doesn't she just go and ask for her handouts somewhere else?" And he said "No! Because people like that DON'T appreciate what you've already done for them. They only appreciate what you can KEEP doing for them!" Good point! But it's messing my life. Everytime I want to go out and spend time with my kids, she's at my door wanting something. Everytime I want to spend time with my man when he comes here after work, she's here. Like, she can't just think to herself "gee, maybe these people want to be alone for awhile". Like, my man and I were watching Runaway Bride lastnight... Late lastnight. We were finally happy that we got some time to ourselves. We were cuddling on the couch with a bowl of popcorn, and all of a sudden... a knock comes to the door. "Oh shit!" I thought, "what now".  Well, of course, it was 'you-know-who'. She comes in and starts telling me about her gas bubble in her stomache. Like, god, I care? "I really wish I had some tylenol for my pain", she says. Well, its no secret I keep a generous supply of tylenol on hand at all times. So, there was the hinting again. I just brushed it off. So, finally she comes out and says "a cigarette would be nice too". OMG!!!! Again, I shrugged it off. I mean, if you want something, ask. Stop beating around the bush. So, she comes out and says "Do you have any tylenol I could get off you?" I gave her one. I gave her a cigarette too because I knew that would be next. Like, I just don't understand. She talked to me all through the movie me and D were trying to watch.  Its ALWAYS SOMETHING. It used to be wanting to come up here and use my computer everyday for hours on end. Well, I put a stop to that quick, by telling her I got a virus in my computer and couldn't be used. So, the other night, I went into the bathroom to have a shower when she was here. She asked if she could 'play' for awhile. I said "No, because the computer is still down from that virus I got". Well, i come out of the shower and sure enough, there she is on the computer.  She started talking on chatlines through her phone, and began talking to a dozen or more guys. So, next thing I know, because she gets her phone cut off, she went and gave all her 'virtual guys' MY phone number to get a hold of her. Next thing I know, my phone's ringing at all hours of the day and night with phone calls from guys she's never met. I was PISSED.  So, there's a few examples of what I mean by being taken for granted. I am using this blog to vent my frustrations about this and other things, because I really don't want to burden all of my other friends with this crap. My advice to whoever reads this is please don't take people for granted. Because then you will find you get the same type of animousity toward you. People will only act for so long like they don't mind helping you out, but if your given an inch and you take a mile, people start really questioning your motives. I know only I can do something about this. But, it is in fact easier said than done. I do like the girl, but I mean, I think I should be able to help people out without them thinking that I constantly owe them something. Anyways, signing off for now.
