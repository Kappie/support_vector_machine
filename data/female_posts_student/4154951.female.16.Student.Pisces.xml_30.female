At a place called Technicorp.. Sounds swanky enough, but it was a surprisingly very small office. They had like, what, 4 computers there? But it was alright- if it gets me out of school for a week, it's cool with me. The Manager there hardly gave a rat's ass about me.. I'd just stand there and ask politely- "So what am I going to do today?" or "So what should I do now?" and a couple of times, he'd just grunt and that'd be it. Then I'd go off into the other room ( with a TV, radio and scotch...didn't take advantage of free liquor- DANG ) and just do some 'data entry' ( i.e Copy and Paste ). Well I'm glad it's over: I've missed my friends too much.      I've been thinking about this guy I saw last Saturday... Let me fill you in. I've 'known' him for a couple of years now.. He worked at the supermarket near my Nan's place, and whenever we'd do groceries for her, he'd be there... serving me and my Mom at the counter, or bumping into him at any random aisle... Yet I never knew his name.. I don't know why I never noticed his nametag... Nyeh weird me. Anyhoo, yeah, turns out his mom is like the bestie of this lady my mom used to work with and is great buds with. And that lady's 50th birthday party was last Saturday...and I kinda knew he'd be there, so I kinda tried to make myself look spankworthy, but of course, all I can manage is a decent look. Nyehh. So my family and I got to the venue of the party.. and we just sat, waiting for the party to start. (It was a swanky kinda thing- with performances and stuff, not just an eat and run kinda thing..) and I was fiddling with my nametag on the table- kinda funny really..here's a pic:   Then I looked up, and  there he was . And at that moment, the DJ played "I Knew I Loved You"... I know, I know, it's pathetic as all heck, but to me it was the sweetest.. I gave myself a mission to get his phone number by the end of the party, but I failed miserably. I kept looking at him the whole time to see if we could make eye contact somehow... and we did a few times, but I guess he was just looking at whoever was behind me or next to me at the time. Then at the end, when he got up to leave I smiled and waved at him, and he smiled and waved back. I doubt he even remembers who I am.. He must've been like "Okay..some weird chick is just smiling and waving at me, so I'll just smile and wave back...WHO  IS  SHE?!"   So I'm hoping I come across someone else who knows him.. Like, a degrees-of-separation kinda thing.. Filipinos have a crapload of links to people (especially in the Woodcroft area). I really want to ask the birthday celebrant lady (she's really sweet) for his number, but that'd just be wrong.. And what if he has a girlfriend already? *SIGH* Just so my buds know who I'm talking about... I had a look at his nametag, and his name's Mark. (Forgive me, if you ever read this, Mark.)      Anyways... My voice is getting much better and I'm glad. I've had a cold for about a week, and the Year 11 heats for this school talent quest I'm gonna enter are on next week.. I'm still thinking about what to sing..      My choices:       Only Hope - Mandy Moore       Heaven - Nina       Foolish Heart - Nina       Jealous - Nina (Can you tell that I like Nina's songs?)       Open - Roselle Nava       Breathe - Michelle Branch       Just Believe - Sarah Geronimo       So yeah.. I need something sweet and simple, with just an added high note to impress my poor audience.. Any suggestions??    I'm majorly bummed that my favouritest forum ever is gone... It was called Rubberneckin' Dhani Harrison Forum and the maddest people were on there... We had like, 88 members, and I had nearly 500 posts!! Seriously bummed!! Anyways, we were all pretty strong buds on that forum, so hopefully Rubberneckin's Creator will create a stellar Rubberneckin' Version 2.0?? *wink*    Well I'd better set my profile and stuff... >oP
