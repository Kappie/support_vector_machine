It was perfect.  I felt the exact amount of fullness desired.  And it came with a spearmint leaf, which I ate afterwards for fresh breath.  It was a little weird, eating a leaf, but it worked. Yay, I'm having an interesting conversation with Sarah.  Take a look: AndNowSarahSays: i wonder how much guys think of sex siriuslymad15: see, they can make a "what women want" siriuslymad15: but a "what men want"... siriuslymad15: would be nothing short of pornography AndNowSarahSays: HAHAHAHAHAHAH (Haha, yes, as you can see, the usual topic of discussion is still...well, the usual topic of discussion.) AndNowSarahSays: guys. I hate them all sometimes. siriuslymad15: yeah, yeah siriuslymad15: as do i siriuslymad15: sometimes i just want to slap any random one i see AndNowSarahSays: that should be a holiday AndNowSarahSays: 'slap random boy day' siriuslymad15: HAHA siriuslymad15: i love it! siriuslymad15: we should actually have it AndNowSarahSays: we sooooo should AndNowSarahSays: kind of like lesbian day, hahha. siriuslymad15: oh, yeah We actually had a Lesbian Day that we created for some reason.  Like we need a reason or a day to be lesbians.  We couldn't remember the exact day, but it was something like March 17.
