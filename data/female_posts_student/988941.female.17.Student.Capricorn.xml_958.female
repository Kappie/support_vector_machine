Fortuantely I don't have alot to do, otherwise I would be stuffed.  I have till training at 5pm tomorrow, I hope it all goes ok and I don't end up looking too stupid! Anyway. I got my lovelly fleece and my name badge yesterday, I haven't got my trousers and my shirts yet, so at the moment I have to wear my own black trousers, a whiote shirt, and keep my jacket done up, lol. Fair enough. Anyway, I really should go and do some work now because I should. Otherwise I'll feel vyer bad. My bargain buy for the day was 3 paris of tights from Primark in Bromely- red, blue and turqoise- £1 each. To go with my bargain boots and my bargian skirt. Wahey. I'm strange. Whatever. See y'all later guys. Bye
