Hell no, hah, I never do bad on essays. Doesn't mean it wasn't impossibly hard. I memorized quotes from the wrong damn story, the theme we had to write about was Determination. Determination sucks, I am now determined to shoot it down. Hardest essay I've ever had to write.  Oh well, I wrote about rock climbing, how fun is that. Hehe. At least for the Creative part, my critical essay was a bit, umm sad... and only 4 pages long when it should have been 6 or 7 at least.  We're giving Maple away today, so I'm sad over that, but She'll prolly be happier. Not that She ever looks unhappy, I swear You could scream bloody murder at that dog and she'd still love you to death.  My brothers room stinks, avoid it at all costs. (I have no idea why thats in here... maybe because he left the door open.)     Her feelings she hides. Her dreams she can't find. She's losing her mind. She's fallen behind. She can't find her place. She's losing her faith. She's fallen from grace. She's all over the place.     Ohhh, and I've decided to redo the design for this blogger, something brighter, summery maybe? Not so dark. I don't feel so dark no more.
