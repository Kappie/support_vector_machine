All that babysitting...I have a feeling I'll never get Patty LaBelle's version of the alphabet from that Sesame Street video out of my head since I was forced to watch it 41 times (oh yes, I counted..). Oh, and don't let me forget the wonderful Disney classics I revisited this week: Peter Pan, Cinderella, Snow White, Beauty and the Beast, and Alice in Wonderland. My body is more sore from those kids jumping all over me, more than the dancing we did for the show. Nah, it was actually fun, and the kids are really cute. I even taught Emily how to say 'Brad Pitt is hot.' oh, speaking of scandalous things, sara has her house all to herself this weekend. I kind of want to go over there tonight but its already 10:30, and I dont want my dad to have to take me over there because he might not let me stay if he finds out her parents arent there, even though he's let me do it before. But tomorrow I am definately spending the night, and we've got to take advantage of this oppurtunity since we didnt last time. I want to hang out with Bam Margera for a few days, he would be so fun.
