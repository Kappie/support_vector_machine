And i was like ok u guys owe me, no opening (5a.m.!!!) for the next while and they're like ok ok and shit. SO, this weekend when i look at my shifts, lo and behold, I OPEN NEXT SATURDAY!!! whuch f's up my friday AND saturday cuz im hella tired. omg sometimes i think this job isnt worth it. i shoudl just do like baldeep, drew and kyle and just quit... ahhh but then id have no money. damnit! aarrgghh. but on the up side, ive given in new availiability (no opening, and 10h a week!) lol, because im failing 2 of my classes. and summer school= NO! well i gg cuz im neglecting the people im talking on msn to. Peace
