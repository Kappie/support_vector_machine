He tells me he wants me to die and tells people lies about me...so that's pretty cool! But I'm tough and I make it through. Mr. X is still a hottie, too bad he's too young. Well, maybe he's not TOO young! hahaha...  I met someone new. He's a real sweetheart and I love to be with him. There is just one problem...he has a crazy girlfriend who has taken over his life and changed him completely. He's still sweet, but she's changed him, almost brainwashed him. I miss the old Zore! The bad thing is, so do all of his other friends. They want me to break them up so the old Zore will come back. I feel really bad because I don't want to lead him on and then break his heart. I know after he breaks up with her he'll never want to talk to me again because he'll realize that is is all my fault he broke up with her. It's such a soap opera. I tried to tell him what people were feeling, but I think I only made things worse. I feel so bad. Who does that...hurt someone they love? I wish I could go back in time and change the way things went.   I'm one of those people who try to please everyone. That's why I cut. If I couldn't fix everything I felt so bad, like it was my fault there were problems in the world. I hate being that way. If only I were a normal person, I would have less scars and more happy memories. I think the depressing me keeps all the boys from becoming more than just my friend. Or maybe it's Jason's fucking lies! I feel bad for him. He's new girlfriend is such a slut. She is really nice, but she likes her boys. I went to this concert and I guess they were making out...I wasn't there. As soon as he left, she was all over another guy. That is so sad. He's a jerk and stuff, but he really doesn't diserve that. Well, honestly he does. He needs to feel the hurt for once. How mean is that? I guess that shows how much he hurt me.   Other than the 2 major things going on in my life, I've been really happy. Only 9 days of school left! How crazy is that. I honestly can't wait. It seems so wierd. I'm going to graduate and never have to go back to the hell hole of High School. It seems like a dream. I'm sure I'll meet lost of cute guys up at CMU. I've decided a guy needs 3 things for me to like him...Shag hair, skateboards, plays guitar. AWESOME...I can't resist a shag! They should have a great personality and of course, they would NEVER lie to me!   I was talking to Teffticles, he's so much fun to hang around when it's just him and I. We talked about a lot of stuff. I feel like I can actually be myself around him and that's kind of nice. We were joking around about him being a doctor and me being an attorney then we'll get married and have 2 twin boys and live in a huge house and be rich. Everyone's dream...Wierdly enough...I could picture that happening. AHHHHH! But I best be off. I love you hun! talk to you later!  Peace and Love,  Melissa
