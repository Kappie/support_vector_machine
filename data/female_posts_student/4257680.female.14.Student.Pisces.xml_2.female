And it took me time to cope with that but I have somewhat and I realize that there is nothing I can do but stay intouch with those friends I keep close to my heart. Make sure that you stay friends with them and it's not the end of the world you will no doubt make new friends throughout highschool so there is really nothing to worry about. or so we think......
