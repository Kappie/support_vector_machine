Yeah, never give up and try and try again no matter what. so after the 4th attempt, I passed the driving test in just 5 minutes. Yippee! ^__^  Busy! Too many homeworks to finish, espeacially math. homework which never come to the end. Ah, I try my best to finish the homework. My friends in science class are really suffer from the sciences subject in English version, good luck people! But then, I'm not better then them, I'm still struggle to understand those complicated math. and some concepts on the business and economics. Life's like that!  P/s: Miss you so much, tomoko. I received your mail 2 weeks ago when the pejabat pos phoned my house to ask me take the mail from them. Actually it was all the postman fault, because he didn't leave the card in the mailbox when he's here and I was not at home. >.
