I decided tonight to start a blogspot so that you can air your thoughts and opinions on every topic using only myself as a mediator (and we all know what a pathetic mediator I am). I want to hear stories, debates and just about anything else you would like to talk about. Not even religion and politics are barred. So go crazy! (And you know how intellectual we will all look carrying on elaborate conversations via the internet.) Correct grammar and punctuation are not a must... but don't be surprised if someone fixes it.. we're a bit anal around here.
