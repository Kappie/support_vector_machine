Frens r suppose to brighten ur day but wat is happenin seems e exact opposite. LIfe is lyk a pure torture. I may be jokin n laughin but tt may not be i wat im feelin. It is so hard to live a life tryin to live up to ppl's standard. sometimes when u wan to say sth yet u dun get to say it, u'll feel terrible inside.   Anw, today is sports heats. It was rainin b4 tt but aft awhile it wasnt. My frenz n i was runnin 4x400 n it was e laz event. We waited den when it was e 4x100 Relay tt time, it started rainin. Light at first den it started gettin heavier. It was a total waste of time, waitin for e rest n not runnin in e end... lolx. Rylz brought umbrella but she didnt wanna use it. I didnt hv one wif me so we waited for e rain to stop. While waitin, a man chased us out. kinda sad coz we wanted to prac aft e rain stop but i guess its fated tt we cant run. We went tm aft tt... Saw a few sickenin ppl. Argg. Tink its pure shit!!!  * Livin Life e way u wan it, is e bes way as u are the one who is in control of ur own life...*
