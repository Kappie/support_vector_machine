(Val, just try it.  It feels good the first time you do it). 2.  I'd like to do soemthing on Friday since Jason can't drive otherwise.  Also, I want to do something Sat. with Cortland and John. 3.  Carlie, I don't want to have sex with Jason's dad.  "FUCK THE POLICE" is a line from an NWA song.  It is really good and it is really funny.  SO FUCK THE POLICE AND YOU, j/k... AND FINALLY, 4.  Enjoy the CD's I made, I really had fun picking the songs! And with that said, peace out my niggas (OH NO, IS THE MULLET BLACK LADY GONNA SUE ME NOW?  GOD DAMN YOU HUCK FINN, DAMN YOU TO HELL)
