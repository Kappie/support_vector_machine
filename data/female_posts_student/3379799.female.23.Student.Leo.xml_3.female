Me, the legal guru, spent the day in the clinker.  Ya'll I spent 6 hours in jail for being careless in taking care of a few tickets, I can't see how people spend years in there.  As with all major life events, there was a lesson to be learned.  My mama always taught us(me and my sis) to stand still, and let God do his work.  Think about it.  Have you ever heard that if you are being attacked by a bear or a dog, you should just stand still.  They won't know what to think.  Look at life like that.  When things are not going your way, people are just like dogs.  Life's trials are like bears on your back, breathing down your neck.  Stand still and talk with God, I promise the trouble will go away.  My mama is at home and doing good now.  My sister called me and said she loved me.  And get this, she offered me money(totally out of charachter for this chick).  I am a freebird(after being a jailbird)!!  LAWD, I'S FREE, I'S FREE!!!  Any way, I stood, even when life tried to beat me down.  If I can stand through adversity, so can you.  DO BETTER!!
