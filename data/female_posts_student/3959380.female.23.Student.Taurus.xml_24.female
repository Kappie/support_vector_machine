Jez came, then Gus with the shirts, which look really good, then Suse and about three quarters of an hour later Alex and Frank and Kosta showed up.  We couldn't do that much because of the wind, so we just did some disc handling skills and then played a little zone.  Catching was great cause the wind kept floating them, except when it was me and Frank going for the disc.  Just a little bit unfair  :)
