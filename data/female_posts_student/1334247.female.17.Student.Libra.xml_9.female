I got scared at the part with the little girl in the doorway...just because that kind of thing is really freaky. But, it didn't scare me like I thought it would.  Thumbelina is on right now. I haven't seen that movie in a really long time, but I'm kinda excited. I know that makes me sound like I'm 5 years old, but it is a cute cartoon movie...with many songs, which is a plus.   Well, Chelsea's prom dress is perfect. It fits just right. So, I'm getting excited. Prom is only about a month away. I'm excited.
