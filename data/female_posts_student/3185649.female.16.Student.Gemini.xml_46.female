I asked the guy who led it a billion times, what are the dates, he FINALLY got me the dates and I said okay.  Then about the beginning of Summer I realized that I did not have time for this trip, so I have been calling him for hmmm may 18th or so trying to tell him "Hey, I can't go!" because the trip is about 11 days, which is fine because then someone else could just take my spot.  I left about 5 messages on his phone saying "Hey call me!"  and he ignores them and then goes on vacation for 2 weeks and finally i get a hold of him today and he tells me that there is a meeting tomorrow, oh but not only that, but he is adding an extra day so it is now 12 days and I have to miss the photo party.  I want to tell him, "well that is too bad, I can't go because I have a previous arrangement for teh night of the 16th", oh did I mention that I have only paid 100 out of 450 dollars for the trip because I couldn't get a hold of him.  I want to say "Too bad I am not paying, get someone else to go!" but my dad would be mad because then I would make the guy angry and he might be on my eagle board of review, which is unlikely but possible, nd my dad doesn't want to be rude. (which is unusual because most of the time he wouldn't care and if it was anything but scouts he probably wouldn't) so now I am stuck going on a trip that I really don't want to go on for 12 days and then I have another trip after that and I am left with 14 days of summer in which I am home. gggggggrrrrrrrr. I rarely (like maybe 4 times a year)get angry but I am right now. I am missing so much more, it is not even just the photo party, I am missing a ton of stuff even when my friend from Rhode Island is leaves, and this is the last time she will come to colorado.   I hate this trip with the firey passion of a 1,000,000,000 burning suns all exploding in one enormously cataclsymic violent hateful blast!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thank you for listening to me vent, it doesn't happen very often so thank you for enduring.
