Its made me do alot of thinking about how I want to live my life. I want to lead a life of purpose - I want to make a difference. I may not do something as great as bringing down communism and the Iron Curtain, but, I feel that there is alot that I can do. I can't even begin to explain how bad I want that job with the foreign service. I feel that I'm setting myself up for disaster by thinking about it all the time, but as any person who has suffered through a real crush understands, its just one of those things that will not easily leave the mind or heart. Another thought on Reagan is that he reminds me of my paternal grandfather. They looked somewhat similar, and they suffered the same ailment. Anyway, as much as I love school, its time for me to graduate and move on, and to make a difference in the world. I hope that next year this blog will be called  "Liz's Reflection's on Life in an Embassy" . Even if its not, I will do something to make a difference... even if its as small as cooking people breakfast at a fast food joint. If I'm not contributing to society, please come and knock me in the head.  2. I've either been really up or really down here lately. There are times I feel rock bottom. For instance, this afternoon I saw  Jon  and  Kim  working for  GHP  Brague . I don't know why, but I felt absolutely shitty afterwards, and it definitely wasn't to their fault. I dunno what it was... I imagine it was because I remember a time when I was close friends with both of them and now we barely even speak. I know that friendships change and move on but there are times when it just hits you in the gut. Its not that I miss Jon, its just that I miss being in the company of two fun and great people, for they are in their own right. I can remember doing things with Kim back in the day and having alot of fun doing it. Sometimes they act as if they don't want me to exist... that is how it was today. Both of them were rather kept their distance and seemed to reject me. I really did nothing wrong to them in my opinion, if anything, I have been the "best secret friend" for Kim. I have kept back and not interfered, that would be just plain childish. Maybe I'm delusional in wishing to be friends with them... I'll probably regret writing all this. I see Jon as a friend and Kim as a sister. Oh well. Things and times change.  3. On a happier note, there are times that I absolutely feel on top of the world.  Today I couldn't walk from Martin Hall to West Hall with out being shouted at by someone I knew every few minutes.  I mean, that was really cool. I have never been a popular kid. I consider myself as a girl that no one wants to dance with but a rather a girl that has an alright personality that overall everyone can get along with. Recently I have had moments when I have felt that I was on top of everything.   4. Its cool how many people I really know. As far as true friends are concerned, I have a lovely handful. But as networking is concerned... all I can say is Damn. I had to trot around campus alot this week. Here is a short list of people that randomly (or not so randomly) bumped into and had a conversation with.  Adler Gaston David (Starling) Stellemacher Brague Tina Karin Marie Levy Peterson Winder Leeks Barnbaum Noll Baun Josh Gary (Sigma Nu Gary) Rick (from class) Becky (AGD) Megan Ms. Amanda Anna  And these are only  folks that were  RANDOM!  Its makes me feel good that all of these folks stopped and took the time to speak to me. Its a bit of an ego boost.    SO ON TO MY PROJECTS   Okay, I've got some things going on this summer.   1.  I am trying to learn German.  I know it sounds crazy, but I really want to learn another language. I want to be able to communicate. Comes w/ being in the comm dept I guess. I just think people that can speak two languages are cool. I remember meeting a student on the program last summer who was a model. I thought she was beautiful of course, but I really didn't give her any credit. We were later traveling around London and met some college students from Russia, and without any prompting, the girl started speaking Russian. I couldn't believe it.  Here was this girl that I had "labeled" ditzy and she was fluently speaking another language - and a hard one at that.  I was very impressed and that was a changing point in me. I decided that I no longer wanted to label people upon meeting them... I have to give them a chance to prove who they really are. I want to learn another language. I was told years ago that being able to speak another language was like having two souls in the body. How cool would that be?  2.  I am trying to learn how to play the guitar.   Danny  is helping me out with this. For 5 days into the project I'm actually doing pretty well. Its easier to practice than horn. I usually just sit and indirectly watch TV and practice chords and scales and stuff. I have to change the strings on it, and once I do that I think I'll be able to notice an improvement in its handling. I want to surprise my folks when they get here and I can play a few songs on guitar. They have no idea I'm doing this.  3.  I'm reading a book called Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos.  Its about astronomy and physics - it has nothing to do with romance as the title might imply. Actually the lonely hearts refer to the lone scientists that are trying to solve the mysteries of the universe, of being, of existence. I want to improve my "mental game" if you will and I am going to do this through reading. I actually love reading, I just have to make the time to do it.   4.  I am working on my knowledge of music.  By this I mean I am up-ing my daily listening and such. I'm tired of being behind of everyone else on this topic.   Overall, I am trying to improve myself intellectually. You always hear folks saying "I want to lose weight" and so forth. Nah.. not me.  I want to add weight to my brain.  I want to be smart. I want to be ahead of everyone.   As far as activities go, here is what I've done this week.  Study Sleep See advisors Job Search Sleep Eat Sleep Stretch Sleep Eat  Sleep  Just kidding. While I have done that I have also gone out to hear some local bands in Remerton w/  Danny  and I have also hung out with  Rick . My friend from home  Davis  is still in town so we got to hang out last night and that was fun.     Overall its been a good week.
