I can't wait 2 leave school, its been a long boring day.   At lunchtime Hannah and I practiced our dance 4 Middle School Performing Arts because our tryouts are on tomorrow. It's good, it still needs a bit more polishing of course, but I think it's good enough that they'll let us in. But the thing that is annoying is that there are these other people who are also doing a dance, Sian and Kelly, and they are really good dancers, like National Champs and stuff, and I'm just sick of everyone saying, "Hey, how good is Sian and Kelly's dance?" Like right in front of mi face, and I'm like, well,  thanks!  Sure, it's good, I can't deny it, and I'm not really jealous, I'm just sick of everyone going on and on about how good it is and kind of shunning us. That's the worst part about dancing against Sian and Kelly. Ahhh, meh  Mel's coming over this arvo. She usually comes over every Tuesday, 'cept she hasn't much latley, so we are finally reigniting the tradition of "Potato Day" Yay. I think we're gonna do a post together this arvo, so yeh.   Looking forward to this arvo, and night, because it's "Pizza Night", which is basically where mi Mum and I have a girls night, and stay home and make gourmet pizzas and watch America's Next Top Model, where we imitate their voices, in sterotypically nasal sounding American accents. Its fun. Meanwhile, mi bros are out at Homebush at cycling training, because they're like National champ freaks, both of them, so they train all the time, and yeh. I like to get them out of the house. Peac, quiet and girly times work 4 me.
