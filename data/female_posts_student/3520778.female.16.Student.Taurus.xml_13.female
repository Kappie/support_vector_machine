Once we get through that, once we realize that we can be imperfect, flawed, broken; those kinds of things are the ingredients of spirituality. - Mike Yaconelli  Awesome qoute.  James might've used it, but i honestly don't remember.  But this is truthfully my life in a nut shell.  I always thought you had to always be committed to praying EVERYDAY and reading your bible EVERYDAY...and if you skip a day...UHP!  You're in trouble!  And though these things do really incredibly help our realtionship, doesn't mean they MAKE my relationship with God...  At youth conventions I feel really...attacked.  They do altar calls and ask the crowd all these questions like if they've doubted God and things like that...and I always feel myself saying 'yes' to every question...and I'm already a CHRISTIAN!  So I never go up...but when I talked to Heather i found out I'm just vulnerable...I don't have a very high opinion of myself as a Christian...and those youth rallies just ATTACK ME spiritually...which is kinda messed up.    But this qoute makes me think of a true christian...one that isn't perfect...one that I am.  That's encouaging!  Yay for Mike Yaconelli!
