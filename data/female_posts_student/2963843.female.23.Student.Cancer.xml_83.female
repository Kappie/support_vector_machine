Am so looking forward to shouting WAHH while admiring the spectacular sparkles...  Went for my poly gathering at suntec, then watched a midnight movie... The Notework is one of the most touching movies I have ever watched.. I wish there would be someone who loves me as much as the old man... It was so cold inside the movie theatre! We had to share my shawl as none of us had brought a jacket.. I should have brought my warmer black shawl!! Brrrr.....  Anyway Marina square GV should fucking think of being  more accessible while under renovations.. We spent a frigging long time trying to find it!  It was nice to meet up with my poly friends.. I felt so nostalgic seeing familiar faces again.. Brought back alot of memories of my poly days where life was simpler compared to SIM...  Does love last forever? Well maybe it does happen to the 0.1 percent of the human population... Gee..  I was freaking tired and fell asleep all the way home in the bus... When I opened my eyes, BAM! I am in Yishun!  God I feel hungry,,, gonna get something to eat! Ciao..
