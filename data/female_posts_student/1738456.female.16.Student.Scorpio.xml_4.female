I picked up one foot, and placed it carefully in front of me. Immediately I was standing on grass again.  I turned around quickly and stared at the place my house had been standing. Now there was nothing but trees. They were tall, and thick, visibly growing taller by the second. I stood in awe wondering if I was really watching vines creep slowly up those trees. I felt small, and I wanted to go back to my once comforting room.  I started running, and crashed through the brush. I ran until I couldn’t breathe, and then flopped down on the ground. I tried to catch my breath.   Leaning back on the tree, I looked up. It was hopelessly tall, and an odd color. Not just brown, it was light tan, and thick. I reached my hand up and pushed myself up. The grass had grown to my waist. I swam through it, feeling the grass quiver around me. I was enjoying myself. I spun in circles and looked up. The sky was a lavender color, and the sun was a deep red. It was going down.  Goodbye , it seemed to whisper.  “Goodbye sun! Hello moon!” I called into the air. “Hello stars, hello night!” Then I fell.  “Ouch!” I screeched, as I landed on a rock. That brought me back to reality. I was in a forest, at night, nowhere near my house, with no idea what was happening to me. The air grew cold around me, and the wind whipped around the grass, creating a cool blanket for me. I stood up. I couldn’t just lie there; I had to find home, or a way out of this. I began to shiver…Where the hell was I?
