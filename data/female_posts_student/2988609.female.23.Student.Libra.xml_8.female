I did 2 out of 7 of today's list, but I feel pretty good about it.  3. I was bored in Japanese class, not because I couldn't understand anything, but because I could, and others couldn't and the teacher spent 45 minutes on the same topic.  4. I saved a turtle's life today.  5. The day isn't over yet: I'm going dancing tonight.
