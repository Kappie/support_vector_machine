Oh, but I digress! This list was on my own accord. This is more for my personal remembrance, but feel free to comment or ask me to clear up anything, 'cause I know I can be somewhat confusing.  Veronica's List for Self-Improvement: 1) Say "dude" and "awesome" less often. It gets really old. Expand the vocabulary. 2) Be a little less shy when meeting new people 3) Help others more often...do some good in the community!  4) Take more time to talk to God (this is actually top priority on the list, I'm just typing as I think) 5) While I'm on that topic, I think I need to learn how to better express my faith. It's hard to explain...I'm sure that is really gonna get misintepreted. See what I mean? I'm much too vague. I guess on a broad scale I need to be less vague. 6) Take a photography class, in other words, improve certain skills. Think about maybe even brushing up on guitar...hmm. 7) Be more empathetic 8) Laugh more often.  9) I always say, "There's always room for improvement". This list could get longer, so I'm going to stop.  Just a little taste of what goes on in my head.  Trust me, you don't want to see the whole thing. It gets quite messy. Plus, there are cobwebs in certain areas, I believe.
