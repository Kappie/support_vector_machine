Oh well... it feels a little better now after some chocolate ice-cream. You know what? My sister dropped the whole box of gummy bears and wasted it all! Geez... thanks a lot Julie. *roll eyes* I liked those gummy bears too! :(  Nima's hurt... *sighzZ* I hope he'll get better soon. I wanted to talk to certain people today but oh well... didn't get the chance to.   Oh my gosh... I'm so pissed off at Konez. Who the hell does she think she is?! She said that I didn't deserve Nima and that someone else would be better for him. She said it behind my back. (duh!) I don't know if I do deserve Nima or not (probably not) but the someone else would be better for him part...?! Psht! Bitch. Probably talking about PURPLE. (haha *dryly*) She acts all nice and casual around me when asking how things are with Nima and then talks behind my back like that. Dumb fuck.   There's a song writing contest from FairChild Radio Station, I think... My mom told me about it. The song HAS to be in English (yay!) and I'm thinking of joining with Moca and Nima. We could do this! If we actually end up joining, then we'll have to perform the song on TV... this might bring our group somewhere. I don't know... Nima and Moca are both busy tonight so I'm just gonna play around with my guitar tonight and hopefully start writing a melody. I've got a scary gothic rockish thing going on right now on my guitar. Haha... it'll sound wicked on electric guitar. Anyway... I'm gonna go work on it. Blog later. I'm off for now. Peace out.
