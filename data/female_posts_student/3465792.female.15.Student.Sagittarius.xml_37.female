Charlie s girlfriend, Jesse (same grade as us and school) is a bitch. She broke up with him and his heart must have been crushed. He has such a fragile heart…. he had even bought her an expensive promise ring. 3 diamonds in the middle with rubies outlaying it. During track one day, we had to run for 25 minutes, so she runs home with a few friends while i'm yelling for her to stop and wait 100 yards behind them. They would only look back and laugh harder every time I called out. I gave up and went home depressed. Then Monday night, Charlie calls my mom and she puts him on speakerphone. Found out he was NOT working until 2 am but smoking weed with co-workers. On a lighter note, I’ve come up with a few ideas for remaking my room. The first one would be taking down my mirror doors from my closet and putting up two of these really cool Asian curtains (shower) made of silk. Then, instead of my bead being on the ground, i’m getting a bunk bed. Hopefully the one with the lower half being a futon. I’d sell my current dresser for something more slim. I’m keeping my desk. We’d get rid of my fan, I no longer use such things as those. Painting my room black and red. Red above the divider, black below.im going to have to stay somewhere this weekend from Friday till Sunday evening. The only available place would be my aunt Deb’s but I don’t want to stay there, too far from civilization and a non-aol using computer. The only good thing would probably be that shed get me anything.hmmm, is that an unauthorized piercing I hear. The only other thing could be my cousin Lindsey staying over. fun… yeah… kinda…..not. SOMEBODY SAVE ME!!!!!!! I’m great with sleepovers! Camping is fun! I’ll even play dollies but someone has to save me!
