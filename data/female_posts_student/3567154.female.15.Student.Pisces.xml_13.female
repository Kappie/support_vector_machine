A tear falls from her check it hits the animal she holds He gave her it, a birthday gift In the other hand she holds a picture all her hope she once had fades instantly.  They told her it was stupid, it wouldn't last she faught, she lost, got right back up finally she buxkled, her strength broke  They won she said, he left her there after The other force won.  She put down the picture she picked up the knife once again a tear falls hits the cold steel blade her breathing stops. He cries at her bedside, shes lost forever    Deadly Mix   Look at my finger, theres a ring flip it over, my wrist bleeds. This pain felt, it's loves fault this pain felt, it's influenced by the knife. Which is worse emotional which is worse phycial both caused by me my stupid f**k up I lost my baby. My best friend. The knife keeps me company the blood and tears mix death falls upon me a never ending slumber. Don't let another tear fall, thats why I did it. Just move on, she'll be there, she loves you too. Just pick and choose join me if you wish it is so peaceful here you'll learn soon my life is your life too!
