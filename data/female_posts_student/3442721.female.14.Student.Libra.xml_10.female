Lol    Tuesday   We went to a store to sell coupons and we ended up leaving and going back to the station. We played a game (DAMN DREW!!) that was about reflects with Jesse and he won and i got a shock a lil.  I tried to get him back but i lost. Goes to show if you know your bf has good reflects don't play a reflects game with him. Well thats all i got right now see ya all.
