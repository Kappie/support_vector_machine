Even things that "affected" me didn't affect me. I'm so content right now, I feel like a purring cat. I love little decisions, listening to the same song over and over again, and making a big drama over what to read next. I love talking to Emily Jo, I love making useless blog posts, I love being tired and full at nine-thirty. I love being to lazy to go get cake. I'm so happy with the world right now. My life is working out for me. I have nothing to complain about. I love life.  Sudden revelations are amazing.
