It needs padding out a bit...  So - Daniel Bedingfield. Pity he has 2 be creepily and scarily religious and immature. Who would have thought it? I spent whole minutes of my life thinking about how great he is, only to be disillusioned by my dream of perfection... I don't intend to detract from his talent in any way - listening to the album right now and I defy anyone 2 say it is not BRILLIANTLY IMPECCABLE IN EVERY WAY, (can't WAIT til the new one), but how can such an amazing songwriter/singer be so immature and - well before i say this, let me say i have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING against religion in any shape or form other than FANATICAL. Anything fanatical is scary and fanatical religion has caused so much strife. Not that I'm suggesting Daniel's religion is leading him to being the next Cromwell-mentality or terrorist, etcetera, but he is scarily religion-obsessed, and as for immaturity, I lost respect at the last concert when he said, "I'm speaking to the bloke with the bum fluff [beird] on his face" - riiiiight. Niiice.  Having said which, "If You're Not The One" is the best song to be released this century.  Moving on  Looks like I'm off 2 Yorkshire after all - here are my choices:  1) Stay with a friend for an entire week 2) Going (obviously) 3) Mum staying with me and everyone giving me hell about having ruined their holiday.  Great.  So I'll go and make their lives hell mwahahahahaha!!!!  Dad appears 2 have lost the train tickets anyway (100s of pounds worth) so naturally everyone thinks i am the culprit - riiight - thy'll probably just buy new 1s. Idiots.  Friends. The word instantly conjures up images of that great tv prog we all know and love, bt i was actually on about ... well... actual friends. Fascinating eh. I wonder how many others classify/categorise their friends, subconsciously or otherwise. There's the conventional ones:  Best friend Good friends Acquaintances etcetera  Then we add our own.  Useful friends Weird friends Notfriend friends! etcetera  Yeah I'm babbling/talking random crap as per usual ignore me    Everyone should read Pride Really. It's great. NO-ONE SHOULD READ THOMAS HARDY UNLESS THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO GET SUICIDALLY DEPRESSED!!   My dog Kiri is a sweetheart - Muffin is a knobhead. I'm sorry but he is! Very handsome dog, but no brains...  Other knobheads include Mr Ashley my old (OLD!!!!AS IN NO LONGER YESYESYESYESYES!!!) physics teacher - cesca caz nay jade etcetera will remember the avoidance and windup tactics, alison jade caroline and klara will remember the pidgeon reincarnation episode - or maybe they won't! teehee.  The Shrek2 website ( urlLink  ) sucks dudes, it really does. It's slow and boring.  hehee if u look up "Bethany Golding" on  urlLink   , (which u do if ur really sad like me!!!)(oh and if u hav my name) there are 2 actual references 2 me!!      urlLink   and www.leemac.freeserve.co.uk/answers3.htm  anyways...  Table tennis.
