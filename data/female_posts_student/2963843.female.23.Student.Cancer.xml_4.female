The objective in life is to look forward Nothing is stagnant, everything changes What is left are the memories.. Faces that once brought us above and beyond. Are vividly imprinted in our minds..  However hard you fall,  No matter how much he had hurt you.. They are just past tense...  When you miss that chance, you miss it forever.. It hurts both ways.. Somehow I hurt too.  But it took me here. What's left to regret? I ask myself again.  Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow. Yesterday is far, and distant Memories makes it seem so near. Future seems to beckon to me, reassuring me that its alright. And I move on today. I hope you do too.
