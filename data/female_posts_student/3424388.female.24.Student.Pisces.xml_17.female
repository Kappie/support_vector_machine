So, here's my hopelessly impractical idea - an RFID scanner for reading material with a built-in searchable database.    As I've given up the quest for normalcy and have given into my eclectic-clutter-friendly-newspaper-clipping-absent-minded-inner professor, I could really use a personal RFID device for reading materials and notes and such.  Of course, this would require  coding a good chunk of the planet, including internet pages (which might not be such a bad idea).            How long will it be until we (as in humans) are all RFID-friendly?  How does RFID work anyway?  I mean, will we ever run out of workable radio spectrum if RFID becomes as prevalent as our techie determinists say it will?
