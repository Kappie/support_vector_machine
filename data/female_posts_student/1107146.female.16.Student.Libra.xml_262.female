I hate school more than I ever thought possible.  Wish me luck on the Drivers' Ed thing.  Did you do it?  if so, was it evil?  I'm REALLY not looking forward to it.  Oh, and also, do you know whether or not you can take your driver's license test right after it or if you have to make a special trip?  Writing and driving tests, I mean.  Gotta go.  Talk to you later!  ~Z
