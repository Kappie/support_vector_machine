Except the lady making a sandwich was being a bitch to everyone, but i guess since hte place was packed and she was kinda stressed, she had a reason.  I swear, there's this guy that works there that i see everytime i go......i swear he looks exactly like Phillippe Boucher.  Except Phillippe might be a tad bit taller.  And this guy's italian or something.  i saw the short blonde kid today, i approve of his yellow shirt and jeans.  jeez, i feel bad that i don't even know this kid and Lauren and I critique his color choice and clothes everyday.  I have discovered that C lunch is the BEST lunch to people watch in.  Seriously, i think out of all the lunches, we have the most interesting and unique people to watch.    It ends up that i'm going to Brittany's house tonight because i made plans with her a few days ago that we would watch this game because she loves St. Louis and Keith Tkachuk and all that......but then again we always watch the hockey games together, its kinda assumed.    Have fun this weekend you guys, ~~~Taylor~~~
