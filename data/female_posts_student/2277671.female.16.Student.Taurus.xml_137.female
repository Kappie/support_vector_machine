The former Arizona Cardinals safety was killed Thursday night in a firefight while on combat patrol. A sergeant with the elite Army Rangers, he was 27.   ``He is a hero,'' Cardinals vice president Michael Bidwill said. ``He was a brave man. There are very few people who have the courage to do what he did, the courage to walk away from a professional sports career and make the ultimate sacrifice.''   Lt. Col. Matt Beevers, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Kabul, said a soldier was killed by anti-coalition militia forces about 25 miles from a U.S. military base at Khost, the site of frequent attacks.   A military official at the Pentagon confirmed it was Tillman, and the White House praised him as ``an inspiration both on and off the football field.''     old barbie?      urlLink sacreddotnu
