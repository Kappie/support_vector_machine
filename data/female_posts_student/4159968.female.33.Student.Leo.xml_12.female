Although I am a bit of a troll and love my alone time, I am starting to get tired of spending ALL important days alone.  Well ok not alone, I do have my dogs.  But they are hard to have good conversations with =p.   With the most important person in my life thousands of miles away again things around here get rough at times.  I am a very self sufficient person, used to being seen as powerful and strong, but not feeling that way at this time.  I am hoping this will not become a lesson in frustration lol so am ending it for now since that is all I feel at this time.
