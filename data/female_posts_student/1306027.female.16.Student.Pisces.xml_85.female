I didn't do too bad either, which quite frankly shocked me. Here's the lineup of my final scores: Vocabulary: 100% AP American History: 85% Algebra II: 90% English: 92% Physics: 89% I only have one more final left, and that is my lit final. It's on   Breakfast of Champions , which, is to say the least, a disturbing book. I get five essay questions and I get to choose the three that I want to answer. So.. after my lit final tomorrow- I AM DONE FOR THE SUMMER! Woot! I am sad to say, that I will miss this year. It was an ok year. Next year however, is going to be a nightmare. S.A.T's, A.C.T's, P.S.A.T's, G.E.D, you name it I'm taking it. So, needless to say, I may be looking and acting like a zombie next school year. Which really blows, seeing as I finally have some courses that I actually want to take coming up this school year. Let me outline for you: English B Advanced Literature AP World History Trig  Stats Principles of Molecular Virology Design of Expierements Genetics Does that sound a little heavy?? Lol.. I'll be ok, I love at least 4 of those classes so, I'll be ok.  So, I know some of ya'll are wondering about what I'm doing for the summer, and here it is. I'm working my butt off most of the summer, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here all summer long so if you want to hang out, just gimme a call and I will see what I can do. Sound's like an exciting summer eh? Well, it hasn't even started yet. Hopefully I can go see a concert or two.. maybe go out a couple of times, redye my hair. The possiblilites are endless. I may even start a story entitled "The Chronicles of TICTM". You know you would read it...  To end this post, I will simply state:   Do you know the muffin man?
