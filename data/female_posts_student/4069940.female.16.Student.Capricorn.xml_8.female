Before that I was a loner.  Actually, that’s not true.  I had always been very talkative, and out-going with lots of friends, but for a while in Jr. High I wasn’t sure who I was, or what I wanted to be.  Then we got new neighbors, and everything was put into perspective.  They had a little girl, who was only four at the time, but was my everything.  She was sick.  She had cancer.  And as a component of that, she wasn’t able to do a lot of things “normal” little girls do.  So  I took her as my own, and played with her and read to her becuase she couldn’t do it herself. As soon as they moved in, I became attached to her, and spent all my time that I wasn’t in school, with her.  She got me through, and inspired me.  I believed in myself and what I could do, thanks to her.  I owe so many things I have learned in my life to this little girl, who will no longer have the chance to do anything herself.  Cheyenne died in January this year.  A peice of me is now gone, but will forever live in my heart.
