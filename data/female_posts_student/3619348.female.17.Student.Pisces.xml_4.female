I don’t want to chat with people from Vinton!  Ah well.  We might go up to the parade later, I will probably go just to make the folks and Emily happy.  Blah.  We finished ‘Aliens’ and watched ‘Alien3’ last night.  How fun.    I’m not trying to be this dull, I just feel blah.  I want a job, classes, a project, something!  I would even love to just paint my room!  Gah!  I wish we could move.  Dad always talks about moving to Germany, and lately even more often.  I would love it.  But I guess it doesn’t really matter where they move, I ‘m getting older and will have my own chance to pick where I want to live.  Still, it would be nice to be near them, I realize how close we are, and I know it would be tough if I just up and vanished out of their lives.  It’d be hard for me as well.  I need to make some CDs for Zach’s birthday present.  I’m burning him two mixed disks, and buying him ‘The Green Mile’.  Yeah, but of course just when I am trying to get MusicMatch working, I am all frustrated and Mom comes in and asks what I am doing, I tell her and shes like that isn’t necessary and she says the minute we get our computer fixed no more downloading!  I am not downloading!  I am copying some cds of Seth’s and a few of mine to make the mixes for him!  She has no idea what she is talking about.  Neither does Dad, they think they do but they can barely figure out how to send an e-mail.  I swear, if they keep hounding me like this EVERY time I get on the computer I am so buying a laptop.  Then I will have a little peace and a computer that hasn’t been totally screwed up by children.  That’s my biggest problem, my parents give me so much work and responsibility, but they hardly let me do anything and when they do they act like its SO good of them to allow their young daughter to do things the average parent wouldn’t bat an eyelash about.
