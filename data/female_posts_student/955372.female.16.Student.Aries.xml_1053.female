I DON'T EVEN SPEAK ITALIAN" Besides the fact it's two and a half years away, I have no idea what I want to study in college or what I want to do with my life including carreer, education, and all that other stuff. I'm like "yeah pressure much?" Actually I didn't say that but if I did I bet you so much money he would say "Well I don't mean to put pressure on you, but this is something you're going to have to start thinking about. You know, college is only two years away." And it would sound so patronizing you would be forced to punch him in the face. Thus my silence.
