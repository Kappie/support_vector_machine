Kick ass weekend is about to happen: Party for my birthday tomorrow night (my birthday is acutally Monday, but a lil pre-emptive partying never hurt anyone, right?)  If you're interested in the details of it or wanna come:  send me a saucy email.  Dashboard/Get Up Kids concert at PNC Saturday night.  Sunday will be my recovery day (as the boy will be at his *real* home most of the day), dinner at F.I.S.H. and then a pool party on Monday proper.  Its gonna rock the socks off of last years birthday.  Yayayay!
