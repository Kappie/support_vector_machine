And then I'm done and will be off to the field. I'm psyched, but I'll miss Matt.  :/  I really can't believe I survived this year.  Nor can I believe that I actually kept this blog the whole year.  I was reading some of my old entries, and damn, I'm a whiny bitch sometimes. ;)  So my schedule appears to be as follows (for those of you who are stalking me- I know you're out there!)  April 3-April 11- Hungary and Austria with Calvin and the Chuck (yay for vacation!) April 11-May 12- Montenegro, trying to avoid being the one stuck in the bottom of the 75 foot deep trench May 12-May 13- (is this even worth putting on here?)- visiting Dave (and Noah?) at Cambridge May 13-May 21- Ann Arbor, visiting Matt (and making wedding plans!) May 22- Spending 14+ hours in Heathrow (good lord, let me find an alternate plan!) May 23-July 1- Israel, working in the faunal lab on the Givat Ram campus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem July 1-August 1- Southwest Kenya, digging and walking in straight lines looking for archaeological sites  For those who are counting, that's three continents (four if you include N. America) in four months, with lots of digging and research and a bit of fun here and there.  Here's hoping it'll be a good time!
