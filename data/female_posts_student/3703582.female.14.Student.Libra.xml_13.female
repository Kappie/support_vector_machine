JeNnIeH89: want me to call? o.0   EmiliEMariE08: hehe. might be fun to see dad actually breathe fire.. he'd be like one of those rotund little cartoon characters that their ears get all red and big and smoke comes out hehehe. enjoying that image.    Ok, I wasn't going to blog tonight but I changed my mind. I have to respond to the following comment from Emilie, then I have to sob some....       .....If I have ever suffered or wanted for anything if I had to do that so I could have you in my life Jen, I would. I know that sounds incredibly gay but it's true. I think you're probably one of the few people I'm not friends with because I have to be. It's voluntary. I would rather have you as my only friend and no one else than have everyone else (ever) and not you. seriously. ...    I just want to know what I did to really deserve that? Being in the mood I am in, and have been in for the past few days, I think that I deserve anything in compensation for my life but I know that's not completely true. If anything, I at least don't deserve what she said. I don't deserve her to care that much and mean it. And I especially don't deserve to even know Emilie Marie V.. .... I'm trying to some up with something that can even half compete with that but I can't. So, I'm going to say that Em is the bestest friend I have ever had. She deserves the world and I wish I could give her that, or at least a book deal.    I love ya Em. Stay brunette and awesome. Feel free to Space all ya want. LOL.
