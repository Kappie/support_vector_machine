The line to get inside was a living hell, they've separated the males on one side and females on the other. While standing in line the sercurity would yell from the top of their lungs, " Get to the left hand side of the fence.". I felt like we were in a Nazi's booth camp for some reason. The female line took forever so I jump right over to the guys line. It was cool, I got in hehehhehe. The person who searched me took all my candies and gum. Damn those are what I really need most dammit. It was hell of a good thing that I didnt empty everything in my purse. I told the lady the rest are my make ups and she let me go.  Once we've got in, walked around looking for friends. I was with about 35 heads or more I forgot. So there I am walking around and guess what I spotted? A man thats probably in his late 40's or early 50's, sucking on a pacifier and got at least 6 or 7 beads necklace on him. I thought that was trippy. I was laughing, I know thats very rude of me. After seeing that I was wide awake.  The music was jumping and I was temped to roll. Drop about 10:30 but that shit didnt start to kick in, so I drop another half. An hour later thats when everything was so nice and so breautyful to me. I was gone, my eye balls was really wide open, I was sweating so bad. I drank so much water and smoke so many ciggarette. I would scream and for ever scream people would turn their head and looked at me and their expression was like "Dame she is hella gone". I think I'm getting to love wearing tennis shoes now. Very comfortable I jump around, did some cart wheels, did lots of dance battling with people. I realized that I didnt get freaky on the dance floor at all. Maybe I didnt want to get intimate with anyone there. There was lots of cute guys but I didnt want to bother or get involve with anyone. Hey, I've got to say this, I'm very proud of my height because there were girls that was way shorter then me. :) Now I dont feel bad for being 4'11", I feel good about myself, yeah yeah I'm not the shortest person in the world YES.   The whole night I was trippen over IBM dude. I thought about him. I told myself not to but I couldnt help myself. I wanted to break down and cry but I've learn to control my feelings just kept screaming. After I scream really loud I felt relief, I felt free, it felt good. Took lots of pictures and all my friends was e out. Cant wait to see the pictures lol, I bet you everyone looked hella fucked up. It was fun, I'm glad I went with them.   Half of my friends went to 1015 afterwards but I came home. I was tired, I wanted to sleep. Coming home alone isnt a very fun feeling. I wish there was someone with me to fool around in bed with oh I'll finish this later gotta go.  Wow, what a great feeling dammit. I slept the whole day!!! I am very well rested but still tired tho. As I was saying before I log off, hate sleeping alone when I feel like I really need someone to lay in bed with. The bearable cold night I slept alone naked. Feels really good just being betweens the sheets. I dreamt about him again. The same person whom I would always dream about. Yep thats rite IBM dude. Heres how the dream go.... We was making out in my room, he kissed me on my forehead, we've french kissed while his hands rub all over my body. He travel down to kiss my neck while his hands rub my nipples. We've rolled around in bed, we've tickled eachother, we've laugh, we've moan, we've drove eachother so crazy, all we both wanted to do was to just go for it. And so we did, the sex felt so real and it felt great. Of course I woke up wet and horny. But it was just a dream. In reality it would never happen. Damn I really miss that boi tho.
