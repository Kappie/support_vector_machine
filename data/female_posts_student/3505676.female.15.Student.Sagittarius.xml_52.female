I hadn't seen that boy in forever! *geez* Worked from 1 til 6:30 until the pool closed because of the bad weather.  I was so glad that Robert [[shifter]] let me leave! THANK YOU ROBERT! Although work was fun...haha carla asked me where i was going to COLLEGE! haha! then..how many years do you have left? 1? HAHAH! MORE LIKE THREE! Clint was busy robbing my cradle again--"all my dreams came true when i first felt the touch of your fingers against mine." Some weird dude was stalking Krystene..haha!  Lee and Jen picked me up and we headed over to Hickville! AKA Garner! Went to brad's, had dinner, met up with everyone [[rachel, lauren, danny, kenzie, brad, lee, caitlin, jen, alyson, oj, jessica, erin, danielle and peter k. and david b. later]] Went over and watched the fireworks! haha with the car alarm and symphony playing + ash falling! Went-a-boy-huntin' w/ caitlin, lauren, and rach..haha that was funny now! Playing ten fingers...serious stuff has happened in my bed! Chilled @ brad's afterwards w/ everyone.  Tons of stuff happened but it ended up like this:  Kenzie, danielle, and i sleeping in brads room, Lee in brad's brothers room, danny on the floor w/ brad and oj on the couches in the living room! It was a blast but boy am i tired today! Danielle and Kenzie--thanks for a great time! The priests knees..good times right there! So then this morning got up, ate breakfast, and then went to get danielles car cuz she left it the night b4 due to no after 9.  Well it was locked in, we hadta call the police, took more than an hour to get it unlocked, then got lost on the way home, but made it to millbrook just in time!  I worked @ millbrook today cuz they didnt have a cashier scheduled! woot woot? *haha* Always fun meeting new pple! And now im home and i think we're gonna eat then go see the fireworks tonight! *family time* WOOHOO!!
