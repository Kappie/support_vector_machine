AFRAID - im afraid to do alot of things. forget abt that asshole.. he's not worth talking abt.   sometimes, i want to go up to my frens n tell them that it's ok; that it will b ok. tell them that i understand. tell them that such things do happen after all. that they are not alone. but i nvr did. somehow it's just extra difficult. i keep telling myself that at the end of it all, i will only b giving them the wrong impression. like as if everything will go wrong if i were to tell them. im afraid they will think that i said so just for the sake of agreeing with them, to make them feel better.   sometimes, i really hate myself.. for not doing what i think i shud b doing; for not saying what i shud b saying. im just too afraid to let it out. the only thing holding me back is the fear of having to understand their reactions. kinda crappy i noe.. but really.. i just dunnoe.. or mayb i du noe.. just dat i dun wan to understand it myself.  if i du get drunk one day, n if i can remember to du one thing i've always been wanting to du, here's wat i'll do. i'll call him. tell him how i really feel. but wat if.. just wat if.. everything turns out wrong after that? wat if i dun get the reaction i hope to get? there.. again.. im afraid of wat to expect...
