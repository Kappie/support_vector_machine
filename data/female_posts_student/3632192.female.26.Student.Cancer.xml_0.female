To symbolise the Buddha, in the very early art, one can find the Eight Spoked Wheel and the Bodhi Tree as symbols for the Buddha. The Eight-Spoked Wheel, or 'Dharmachakra' (Sanskrit) symbolises the Buddha's turning the Wheel of Truth or Law (dharma = truth/law, chakra = wheel). It relates to the story that shortly after the Buddha achieved enlightenment. The Buddha is known as the Wheel-Turner: he who sets a new cycle of teachings in motion and in consequence changes the course of destiny. The Dharmachakra has eight spokes, symbolising the Eight-fold Noble Path, and in the centre are 3 swirling segments, which represent the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. It can also be divided into three parts, each representing an aspect of Buddhist practice; the hub (discipline), the spokes (wisdom), and the rim (concentration). (http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/general_symbols_buddhism.html) The “'Dharmachakra” has been a great influence in my life. When I was a kid and living in my school hostel, the head matron sent us to the Buddhist temple to practice Buddhism.  Decipline was taught to me and my fellow Buhhist friends by the monks at the temple, teaching us how to respect yourself and then others.  Decipline is also taught in the prayers which is in Sanskrit.. The five main deciplines are refrain from destroying living creatures, refrain from taking that which is not given,  refrain from sexual misconduct, refrain from incorrect speech, refrain from intoxicating liquors and drugs which lead to carelessness. Even though it is hard strictly obey the five percepts, I make an effort to abide by it.  There might be occasions where I have lied, or killed bugs or even had wine. But I believe that if you try to follow the five percepts it helps to discipline yourself.   I have meditated in several occasions to improve my concentration and wisdom.  Meditating is not easy as I have a hard time staying in one place.  But I can assure it helps to concentrate in studies and think calmly when you are mad.  My wisdom is yet to be gained.  Because I believe we never stop learning in life.  Lord Buddha gained his achievements through great sacrifices in his life.  I know I can never come to Lord Buddha’s stage of life, but his teachings have made me who I am now.
