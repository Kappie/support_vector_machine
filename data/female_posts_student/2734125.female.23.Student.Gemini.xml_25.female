I go through phases with it where I will ride all the time everywhere, and then I quit for a week or two, normally corresponding with crappy weather.  The weather is clearing up.  I'll have to ride in tomorrow morning.    Sometimes I crouch down in the shower.  I bring myself as low to the bottom of the bath tub as I can and feel the shower more like it's rain.  I do this sometimes when I'm sad, and I feel like its too hard to stand up.  I do this when I am really tired occationally, after I have washed my hair and smell like mint soap.   The other day I crouched low and watched the water coming off the edge of the tub.  It ran in crazy rivers, merging and opening again.  I watched the water as it ran out of my hair that was a hanging cave grotto through which I witnessed the dynamic chaos of water.  I could change things just by standing up, make the rivers flow differently, but could control nothing.  I watched my feet against the yellow lighting and beige bath.  I moved my consciousness to my back, where moons cascade down my spine in thirteen perfect circles.  Felt the water running past the ink raised marks, and off to where my mind did not reach.  Its comforting some times, to bring my thought full into the moment.    Sometimes my mind plays while I walk or lay in bed.  Plays with high stress crisis situations.  What would I do if bombs fell on campus tonight while I was in class?  Do I organize the survivors, giving strong commands that save those of us that live?  Do I cower thinking about the implications?  In my mind today I lit a cigarette off of the flaming building and watched, once the crews were there and I was no longer pulling people out, watched the flames of war dance into the night.  I though about rage, and moving all my people into our house (I think that we have the biggest house).  Bring everyone for safety and comfort, collecting food, and wondering why the campus was a target.  Maybe there were experiments going on in the sciences, things that the enemy wanted destroyed.  Maybe it was just war.  One long run across Colorado going from Colorado springs, through Denver to us.  Maybe they'll hit Wyoming too.  I don't think we'll find out for a while, as the power is out everywhere, and too many phone lines were cut.  I use my bike, and gather my people to me.  I run to the dorm and make sure Dylan made it.  She has, as this isn't a fantasy to cry over, but my post apocalyptic theme.  Sometimes I will have long story thoughts meant to make me feel pain.  I used to do it a lot, when I was little and a teenager.  Kill off people, have someone take me out of class while I was at school, and tell me what had happened.  I would make myself feel the fear and pain and deep deep sadness.  I would end up sobbing into my pillow in the dark. I don't know why I did that.  Maybe just to feel.  I don't do it so often anymore.    I have many themes that I play with in my mind.  I have romances, and fantasy, and adventures, and rarely mysteries.  Mysteries aren't as fun when you have to think up all the twists and turns yourself.  They become too hard to keep track of.  I will run into a scene that I really like, and play it over several times to see why I liked it, play with the lighting.  I don't think that I have ever articulated this tendency outloud before.  It seems natural, most do this, right?  Hummm.  Something to ponder.  I am procrastinating.  Damn.  I better go focus on reading, huh?
