'cuz i'd still like to go, but yeah, maybe we should wait for better weather and plan out the transportation and crap. and you know, there's more beaches than santa cruz and san fran. ((i have a feeling that the beaches that i'm gonna name are all gonna be in S.C., but oh well)). but yeah, besides the boardwalk, there's that one beach with the old battleship beached on it, and then there's another one too, but i don't remember what it's called..i'd have to ask my mom, she knows these things.   but yeah, let's at least do something on friday, i don't really care what. this week has been hell, and i wanna get it over with.
