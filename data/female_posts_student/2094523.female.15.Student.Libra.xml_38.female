U do the same things over and over again and then u stop to think..what the fuck have u accomplished over the 15 yrs of ure life? thats rite. nothing.  Anywho.. for university i dont wanna stay in edmonton.. i dont need more of this repetitive crap. I wanna leave somewhere nice... like montreal, vancouver or toronto.. yah the bigger cities of canada or boston or cali... chances are it wont happen. but hey i can dream i can dream good.  Wudnt it be fun to be a bar tender in cancun.. i think it wud... party it up, party it up while u can.
