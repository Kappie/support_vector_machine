My very, very good friend Ky gave me the 411 about this particular B of the B.  Her bro, Kaleb, is in this awesome band called  urlLink Storm Without Cease  and they are playing at this show.  For 15 bones, you know I'll be there cheering my little heart out!    Let's here it for reliving your teens...in your 20's!  (Gah!)
