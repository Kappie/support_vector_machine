You know how when you are landing on a plane, you are supposed to turn off CD players and other electronics? Well, I don't do that. When we were right about to land in Chicago, I was listening to Fall Out Boy. The fifth song came on, which doesn't seem like a big deal, however the first lyrics are: "Landing on a runway in Chicago". Isn't that strange!
