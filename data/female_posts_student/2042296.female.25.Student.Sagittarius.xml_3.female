And it brings nice memories of the Steely Dan concert on 2000. It was amazing to see the band I've listened to live. I mean, it had its top moments in the 70s, before I was even born. The audience was a mixture of old fans and young people. The meeting of different generations =)  Hmm... The last time I wrote was on Wednesday. Nothing much has happened, the usual. On Saturday we went to Zurich with Rico and Serge (a friend of Rico's), spent some time there and then came home. Then we went to visit Rico's mother shortly, brought her some cake I had baked. Yesterday she sent an sms "thanks, the cake was Delicious!", so I guess I have it easier with her ;) Especially when I told her I can knit :D So far she has been the one to repair Rico's socks and now I'm there to do that. Saves her time =)  Yesterday we were very hard-working =) We slept till one o'clock or so but after that... We cleaned up the whole apartment together etc. Then we went walking on the hills for 90 minutes or so. It was so beautiful up there. You can see the whole Wettingen from the top! It was a little bit misty and the air was so fresh... We also walked through a farm and saw two adorable pigs :D They came to see us and grunted, I think they just came to see, if we have anything to eat ;) When we came home, we made burritos, had a couple of beers and watched Matrix: Reloaded on dvd. It was ok, the special effects were great but otherwise it wasn't really anything special. But it was a perfect Sunday! Relaxing indeed.  With Rico everything seems to get better. We go deeper in our relationship and that feels goddamn good. This morning I was surprised about my feelings getting deeper, too. I haven't experienced the Great Awakening with my feelings and that makes me sure, that I'm on the right way with this thing. You know, the Great Rush won't last long and the risk of the relationship coming to its end is greater. It's also possible that the feelings don't grow to be love at all and that's problematic, too. In my case it has happened slowly but securely. I discover the whole time new things in Rico, that I like and that make me want him to be my man even more. I respect his intelligence, kindness, tenderness, sense of humour etc. But I don't adore him, that wouldn't be healthy any more. I'm just soooooo happy that he's my partner and my friend and I hope we stay together for long.  (My english is getting really, really bad... I already have to check words from a german-english dictionary... :/ )
