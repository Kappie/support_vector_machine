The book ( The Untold   Story )cites a eureka moment for Mr. Calder's hero and inspiration, Generoso Pope Jr. 'Gene was caught in a traffic jam and observed motorists rubbernecking to see the mangled bodies of crash victims,' Mr. Calder explains. 'If that's what they want, he thought, that's what I'll give them.' So he did. And he threw in physics, U.F.O.'s and strange diseases for good measure."   The paragraph above describes how the NationalEnquirer, one of the world's most recognized tabloids came into existence. Iain Calder, who worked for the Enquirer for 20 years recently had his book  The Untold Story My 20 Years Running the National Enquirer , published. It describes how the Enquirer gave gripping photographs, one of their best photos was of Elvis in his casket.  "(Capturing a photo of Elvis Presley in his coffin was, by Mr. Calder's lights, one of the publication's greatest achievements. The fake priest with the camera in his Bible couldn't get the shot, but the Enquirer, with its famous largess, paid one of Elvis's cousins to help.)"   The Enquirer also paid a Ross Cutlery $17, 500 dollars to say that he sold a knife to O.J. Simpson that looked like the knife he used in his famous murder.   This is just a look at how tabloids, in this case the National Enquirer, got its information to publish that made them so successful.
