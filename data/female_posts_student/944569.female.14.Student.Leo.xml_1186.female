He has a carefree attitude and is also quite childlike.  His hobby is brushing his teeth (He's obsessed with his toothpaste and goes ballistic if someone else uses it.).  He's known for his "acrobatic play" which consists of doing acrobatic feats while playing tennis (because he adores being the center of attention).  His best friend would probably be Oishi because they're known as the Golden Pair, Seigaku's best doubles team, who are ALWAYS in sync.  Allow me to explain by comparing them to the team's least cooperative double Ryoma and Momoshiro:  Oishi:  Can you pass me that thing, Eiji? Eiji:*while sipping a drink*  Here ya go *tosses towel*  Momoshiro:  Echizen, pass me that thing Ryoma:  What thing? Momoshiro:  That towel under your ass, dobe....  I especially thing Kikimaru looks sooooo cute as a chibi (as seen below)
