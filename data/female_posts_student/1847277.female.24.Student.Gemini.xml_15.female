I'd be going about my business and before I knew it, it was Thursday again.  Wednesday is that day this year.  I can't believe another week is more than half over.  Time goes by so fast, and I feel like I never live life to the fullest, as it were.  There have been so few times in my life where I've just sat back, taken a deep breath, and let myself live for the moment, shoving aside all thoughts/worries about the future.  I was so proud of myself because I was able to do that in Germany.  The last week I was there was so amazing, partly because I finally just quit worrying about everything...    So my life is starting to come together.  Well, not my whole life, but the next year.  The pieces are all falling into place.  Which is good and bad.  Good because I like knowing what I'm going to be doing, bad because it's looking like I won't be able to make it to S. Africa this year.  The dig in India runs from Jan-Mar, and while I thought the project in Montenegro would be May-June, it's actually Apr-May, meaning that I'll only have a couple weeks in between.  But that leaves June open, now, and who knows where I'll end up. :)  It also looks like I will be heading to Israel, which will be an awesome experience even if I don't get to play the tourist.  Good times.
