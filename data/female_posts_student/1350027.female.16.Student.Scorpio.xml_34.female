I don't care how vain that sounded but I believe I'm female and I'm entitled to whine and combust about my wardrobe and vanity misdemenors and complications.  Yellow top? Red perhaps?  Jeans? Pinstripe pants? Can I wear sneakers?   IS THIS PLACE OVER 18 ONLY!?!  Bleh.    EDIT:  Hmmm. I think I've been to comfy wearing the same old things all the time that it's reached a place where I forget there are other clothes besides Jeans and Shirts. It's just such a burden to find something decent to wear somehow. Well, I'm sure all you girls are there have tons of clothes and what not since y'all so nicely clad all the time - but as for me, I'm ... through a .. phase with my wardrobe. So I think everything sucks. And quite frankly, everything sucks. Everythings wrong, doesn't fit and has a strange color. HMMPH.
