I know that when I put it on it's going to hurt like a mofo...   We got the Ashlee Simpson cd yesterday from wally mart...My guilty pleasure I suppose, My name is Julia and yes I like Ashlee Simpson...don't help me...lol. She's alright. She has this song called "Lala" She says "You make me wanna LALA, in the kitchen, on the floor, I'll be your french maid, where I'll meet you at the door..." It's funny, but yuh...   I went for my interview yesterday at TJ's andI believe it went well. Everyone seemed nice and smily but of course we have to be...but we had laughs, I think I left a good impression. I also talked to this lady that works there and she kept on saying " Oh, you're in..." lolz...She was cool. Wish me luck, I hope I get it guys!!!   I have senior pictures today...whoop dee doo daaa. That'll take all of like 10 minutes. Tomorrow I'm going to Denay's house to swim with my chicals that I haven't seen in a long while... yay!! Then on thursday I'm going to the beach...yay!!I finally get to wear my bathing suit without worrying about my tan lines for pictures!! yay! lolz...   Ohhh! yea, while a burger king yesterday in the drive through I saw two cops bustin this guy, I thin khe had some drugs or something....There were two guy sitting in the back of the cop cars and they were searching their car...it was cool.   My heart is conflicted.... It gets in the way....so does my brain....lolz   P.S. I miss fishing....
