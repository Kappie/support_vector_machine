I'm really good at pissing people off or blowing things out of proportion, which only causes more people to pissed off at me. I don't know how I came about this talent. However, through this so called talent I possess I've also learned that being extremely immature is not anymore annoying than being too mature. I'm not quite sure how all of this ties in together, but I'll figure it out one day. I just thought I'd make a list of how I go about completing my purpose. I really do picture it as a purpose because people can't go through their lives never being mad so I kind of give them the opportunity to get pissed off you could say. Back to my list:  1. Always being serious and getting mad when people don't take things as seriously as I do  2. I'm very judgmental  3. Being possessive  4. Blowing things out of proportion  5. I complain quite a bit  6. Jealousy   There is no one that can say these things aren't true because even if they don't annoy you you realize they're there. There are more but we'll just leave it at this for now. One day I'll make a list of positive things but those aren't as much fun.   On a happier note I went to hang out with Maddie and DAnny earlier this week. I wasn't  too  serious then, but I could still use some improvement.
