I missed out on CHS by one freaking place, so close too :( And now im cut cos i feel lazy, i dunno shoulda trained or warmed up or something (or cooled down after hockey hehe, the reason y my legs were cactus). THEN the relay -- we could have easily made it -- the 1st runner just pulls out and goes home. no particular reason. Gee, what a team player.        Oh well who cares - im not at school for athletics, i'm there so i can get into uni. bigger and better things... not that i hate school or anything. i'm gonna miss it but thats another story. I have nothing of any great interest to post.        seeyoubye
