I just finished three surveys on the school and class and my future plans and ugh this is boring. I hate having to go to college, it eats up free time. I don't mind the summer classes though, since they provide me with the excuse that I can't take a whole week to go to my mum's down in Dora (four hour drive, evil). However, the wire bends the other way since I can't take a week off to go down to Arkansas, and thusly have to wait until early August. I'm looking forward to it though, I'm supposed to get a suprise from Dave...   Current Mood:  Curious
