He has guests over so we can't talk on the phone. :( He'll try to get on MSN but I don't think he'll be able to so I guess I won't get to talk to him until Monday.   He's at Demetri's tomorrow for Demetri's birthday and I'm at church and then I'm going home. I'll probably go outside with Moca. Iunno... maybe. Called Jae back and we decided to go golfing next weekend instead, so yeah.   *sighzZ* So bored. Blah, had some Woody's this evening and it was like... yum. Well, I'm off to sweep the floor downstairs and I'll be back within 5 minutes hopefully.   Nima -> I love you.
