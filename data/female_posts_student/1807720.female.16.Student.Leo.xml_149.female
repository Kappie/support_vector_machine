Edi and I went to Starbucks for an over two hour date on tues and yesterday night we went out to the movies.  They didn't even ID me cause we went to an 18A movie.  It was amazing.  He is so mature and I will admit he is good looking.  We have another date this Wednesday night.  I am excited.  Everytime he comes over he always wants to go eat, but I have always eaten already so this time we planed it!  lol.  Oh and after the movie last night we rented another movie and went back to my place and watched it.  The Bio quiz was slightly difficult I though, but I did my best in really trying to understand that stuff.  It was just "ok" though.  I have been driving everywhere and practicing all the time.  It's getting easier.  Although I do notice that is has taken me like 3 times as long as most people to get the feel for it, and just to be good at it.  I have to admit I used to find it difficult, but now I find it really fun!  I went shopping today and yesterday.  I got these amazing capris from old navy.  Pink!!  I own pink capris!!!!!!  NO NAVY, NO WHITE!!  AHHA!  And I bought some black sandals and I got a shirt from The Rocket that says: "bubble cat."  It is so cute.  I also bought my bodysuit for underneath my costume for the play and I got the other part of chelseys b-day present.  It is really great and amazing, and I put so much effort into this present.  It's like a 3 part thing, but I ain't saying nothing here incase she happens to read this.  Did I mention I had a Wendy's salad for lunch yesterday and today.  YUM.  And tonight my sister, her fiance, her fiance's mother, and her fiance's mothers boyfriend are coming to celebrate my sisters b-day even though it's really on Monday.  Tomorrow morning I am going to check out the new value village in Midnapore Mall cause I have never been there and I have to practice parking.  Then Sara, Chels, Monet, and maybe Ash are coming over for dinner and then sleeping over.  I don't know when I am going to study for Bio, but I will find some time.  I suppose I could do some right now, but I need to relax a little.  I feel like I am just on the go all the time now.  But I kind of like being busy all the time.
