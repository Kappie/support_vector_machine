Pride reinforces love.” –Margaret Truman   Family.  Where would we be with out it?  Family is the tie that holds together civil civilization, as we know it.  Family is the one thing we are born with, seldom learn to appreciate, and grow to need more that we are willing to admit.  Now I am not going to tell you that family is only those we are born attached to for life –including the ones we wish we weren’t, take my cousins for example!  Family could be friends when you need them most, friends you grew up with.  Still, whatever your family consists of, family is the one thing we could not live with out and still function as a normal society.  Take this example to heart; look at many people in Jail, criminals, serial killers, rapists, etc. if one reads up on most of them we will realize that they had a damned bad family life, or perhaps on family at all.  Or God forbid created cults as a way to make a family.    What brought this on?  Well, I hardly ever have the opportunity to see my family. My parents, sisters, etc. mostly all live in sunny California.  However, my mom, dad, and sister Candi are coming to see me and I am so excited.  I really miss them, now I get to see them, if only briefly.  So in short, don’t take your family for granted.  When you don’t have them within arms reach you may miss them more that you would know.  ~Kristyn
