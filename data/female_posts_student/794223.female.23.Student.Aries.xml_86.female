I know it's not Mimi's fault; she's completely helpless.    I've taken up running, which I haven't done since I was a sophomore in college.  But I absolutely must have some way to release this stress.  I'd like to just run and run and keep running on out of here, but I usually just run to my cousin Jamie's house and play with her dog and cats before I have to run back to my house and try to put on a happy face.  Oh well.  I might as well go back to my old schedule of staying up all night and sleeping during the day, because it would appear that I don't have an option.  I'm praying for some strenghth from the Lord, because how am I supposed to handle grad school if I'm too damned tired from all the life-altering traumas that have occured since I graduated in December?  So much for a semester off of rest--I've spent it in the hospital with my cousin who has a brain tumor, in the hospital with my grandmother who can't walk or do anything by herself, and moving from the place where I was born to a town of maybe 1,000 people.  Could I PLEASE HAVE A BREAK?!  Sorry for the bitchy, whiny rant.  I'm blessed and I know it, I just need a place to vent.
