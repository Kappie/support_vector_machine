I find that I miss Jesse a lot more as the days melt away one by one. It is hard for me to wake up and start my day without him by my side. Instead of homesick, I am sick for Jesse.  Yesterday when I came home from work I found a big heaping stack of mail for me.  The one thing that caught my eyes first was a large USPS envelope with Jesse’s handwriting all over it. I less than carefully opened the envelope and pulled out a nicely folded plastic airport bag and laughed to myself. I opened the bag and pulled out a small stack of things he had placed in it. There were two postcards from Ireland, and Iron on Patch from Ireland as well, but the one thing that caught my eyes was a small silver necklace with the Claddagh symbol on it. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.  The Claddagh symbolizes the trinity of "Love, Loyalty, and Friendship" and has been the base of our relationship since well before our wedding day. Both Jesse and I have Irish in our background so we felt that it would be appropriate to choose this symbol as a representation of our relationship with one another. Jesse, If you read this, please know that I love you more than anything you could imagine and I absolutely love the gift.   urlLink     To read a little more about the Claddagh please visit   urlLink Claddagh Story
