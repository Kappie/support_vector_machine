Stupid amount of exams are gonna come my way in the next few weeks, why the hell do we do 11 subjects anyway? It's just stupid. Damn educational system. Damn testing. Damn my Birthday's in the middle of it :( In all my Birthday cards there's gonna be good luck with your exams notes. I shall never be freeee! I'm gonna go soooo insane when we get to Glastonbury! I wish we were there now!
