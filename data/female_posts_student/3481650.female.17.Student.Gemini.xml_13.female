We spent like an hour and a half in American Eagle, and I got the perfect pair of jeans, and a cute brown shirt. After that I got another perfect pair of jeans from Dillard's, and then a cute long sleeve shirt at Penney's. I love new clothes...they make me so happy :D I still need a pair of shoes. I think I'm going to get some Puma's, I love the colors, and they look comfortable. Megan has like 6 pairs! I'm at  urlLink www.puma.com  right now. While Lena and I were at Penney's, a crazy kid sprinted out, yelling, right in front of Lena and she screamed, it caught her off guard, it was hilarious. We had so much fun! Okay, my dad's making hot  JUMBALAYA , and I'm excited  hungry, so I'm out.   :D
