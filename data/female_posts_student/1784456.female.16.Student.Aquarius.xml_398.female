Hmm... maybe if I cleaned my brain out I could swap it for a newer modle... uhoh slightly interesting thought, if you swapped brains with some one would you be the person in the other person's body or would you be the person in your body? ...Well I did say slightly interesting... Yeah, I am mad. Ooh, Have I Got News For You was sooo funny! Charlotte Church was good. She said to George W Bush that she came from Wales and he asked what state it was in! (Eek!) I think he needs to get out more...
