Although my self-analysis is not nearly in the same class as Michele’s, I am going to attempt to deconstruct why I insist on having too many drinks on weeknights, resulting in my making an ass of myself at the Taco Bell drive-through (although I did get our order correctly completed).    1.	 Addictive personality.   I am aware of my own self-control shortcomings, meaning that when I am confronted with a vice, it is highly likely I will take full advantage of the chance to participate in said vice.  I like eating, drinking, gambling, and spending money, none of which I am very capable of doing in moderation.    2.	 Alpha male shifting.   Normally, Sabrina is the alpha male of our circle of friends, which is fine with me.  I don’t like making decisions for other people, and I’m usually okay with whatever form of entertainment everyone else chooses, so I don’t make a good leader for group activities.  However, an interesting phenomenon that should be studied in more detail occurs whenever Sabrina and I drink:  she becomes less dominant, and my alpha alter ego takes charge.  This, combined with #1, means rounds of shots for everyone, even if they don’t want to take them.  This personality shift comes complete with a full range of synonyms for calling someone a pussy if they don’t drink as much as I think they should, and sneaky methods of getting people to take shots they don’t want to (Blue Hawaiian, anyone?).    3.	 Competitiveness.   Having grown up as somewhat of a tomboy and feeling compelled to do everything as well as or better than the boys, I cannot do anything without making it into a contest.  When I was younger, this meant proving that I could run as fast, work as hard, drink as much, and tee off from the men’s box.  Today, I time myself on things like blow-drying my hair to see if I can set a personal record, and I’m constantly trying to shave a few minutes off of my commute to work.  This competitiveness (obsessiveness?) carries over into my extracurricular activities with authority, making me take three shots when one Windex would have been plenty to ensure that I talked too much and about inappropriate topics.    4.	 Environmental factors.   These include my impending sense of losing friends (physically, at least) to jobs, schools, and husbands.  In a few short weeks, I will be 800 miles away from everything that is familiar, and I feel compelled to squeeze in as much fun and games as are possible before that era of my life begins.  I’ve lived in Waco for five full years now, and my initial distaste (hate) for it has gradually evolved to the point that I now consider it home.   Waco, I barely knew ye.  5.	 Dietary restrictions.   Beer has been and always will be my beverage of choice.  Unfortunately, I actually like the taste of beer, which precludes me from drinking any of the “low calorie” versions, which all taste like club soda.  I like real beer, with real calories, and since I have sworn to myself that I’m going to lose a couple of pounds someday, I have altered my drink of choice to include diet soda.  I’ve always been a big fan of the Jack Daniels, and so I reason with myself that having a few Jack and diet Cokes is much healthier than having a six-pack of Budweiser.  I have noticed a marked difference in my ability to filter the things that come out of my mouth when I drink whiskey, however, as well as an increased likelihood of a debilitating hangover.  I’m still debating on which I’d rather be:  thin and obnoxious, or not-as-thin and pleasant.  As you can see, I’ve put a lot of thought into this.
