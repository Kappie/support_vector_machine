Its much bigger than that and it is so retarded that people put such great emphasize on the importance of getting a career, getting a huge pay check in order to be successful. So what if i think successful is becoming famous, or wearing versaces , or shooting someone you hate in the head. I have my own belifs and u take ures. Im not gonna work that hard so when i have kids they dont have to feel as if they need to live up to my standards. Its retarded as helll
