But whatever ill start with yesterday.  Me, eileen, lynn, and carissa went to eileen's grandparents house and swam in the lake for her b-day. Well me and eileen swam but it was a lottt of fun! some memories.. my sandles floating away, and the dog "deer" pissing on the canoe haha. That night carissa, eileen, brian and me chilled at my house. Macart stopped by for a little too because he's not gonna see carissa for likee 11 days :o who by the way got her belly button peirced and i finally got to see it! haha my mom said it looked cute but i just dont want it done. But whatever..me and eileen jumped in the pool and it was a good time..it was suposta be a surprise party but yaknoww.. the St. Pat's picnic got in the way and some people just couldnt give that up for the night.. hmm eileen: "I want to be normal Chet!" wow discussing Boy Meets World haha. Then she slept over and we went for a walk and got home at likee 12:45 ish lol shit that dirt road with NO lights was scarry!!.. and we stopped by Lynn's house since nobody could come with us. That was cool tho.   Today I just layed outside and read some of "Lord of the Flies" ..which sucks. Oh yeah and then i was cleaning the edges of my pool haha but then i gave that job to my  brother John. Now I'm sitting here in a wet bathing suit trying to see what i'm gonna do tonight. I beleive that Mandie and Heather are comming over but i'm not sure who else so I'll find out and wirte more later.    The Who- Teenage Wasteland   "Don't cry, don't raise your eyes. It's only teenage wasteland...They're all wasted!" haha .. what a quote.
