At one point he was talking for 15 minutes straight, and the crowd was laughing the entire time.  The music was great of course, and his band was wonderful.  He had his band members come down to the front of the stage and perform quite a few times.  I went to the concert with Faye and her mom.  We ate at Reno's before going, and stopped at the Regatta after because Faye didn't want to go home yet.  Unfortunately nothing in Lexington stays open very late.  The Regatta bar was full of drunk college kids hanging all over eachother.  Not really our scene.  I had a great time, and I think that Faye did too.  It's good that she's able to get out of the house every once in a while.  Robert and I are going to see Tim Wilson at Comedy Off Broadway tonight.  We've seen him twice before.  Hopefully his show will be a little different this time.  The second time that we saw him, it was basically the same show as the one we had seen before.  There's a new smoking ban in all public places in Lexington that he'll probably have something to say about.  Maybe he'll touch on the election, Reagan's death...I don't know.  I just hope it's different.  It should be fun regardless.  We're going with his friend Terry and his wife, and two of their friends.  I think that they bought the tickets, and I'm a little uncomfortable with that, because they bought our tickets last time too.  In return, last time, we paid for the pre-show dinner.  This time however, I think that their friends will be at the dinner as well, so I don't know if we'll be able to pay.  We're eating tonight at Bella Note, an Italian restaurant that I LOVE.    It's raining again today.  Imagin that.  I don't think that it will ever stop raining.    I was supposed to go to an auction with mom tonight, but plans changed when Robert told me about this Tim Wilson thing.  She's still going to the auction, so hopefully it won't rain all day.    That's all for now.  Not much on my mind today.
