I told him I wasn't really... Not that I wouldn't, cause I would. She's pretty.  Anyway...Seth was supposed to call. Dave was supposed to call. And Dale gave me the distinct impression that he would call.  Seth is this really hot guy that is co-owner(?, manager) of Rain in Milwaukee. I had an interview with him. He wasn't calling "for a good time", he would have been calling to offer me a job as a bartender or server. Dave is the owner of the flat that my brother and I are interested in renting in Milwaukee. It's not the greatest place in the world, but it would be good for now with some new carpeting. I'm kinda hoping that he doesn't call, that way we won't have to move right away. I have a shit load of bills that I would love to pay before I went back to part time and moved out. And Dale, aka the stupid boy, just didn't call. I thought that maybe he would, but he has not. Preston said to be patient. It's only been 2 days. I will try. Even if he doesn't call I will be fine. Just kinda want him to.  And to all of you who know me well: I just caught a glimpse of the reflection of my fingers as I was typing this and it kinda freaked me out a little cause I thought it was a giant spider. Yes, I am retarded.  And you're all... I can't remember what I called you guys yesterday... assholes ... dill holes ... butt plugs ... fuck tards ... bastards ... crotch monsters ... your mom? Well, whatever it was, you're defintely still 'it' today for not posting.  Bastards.
