I'm not so sure what this is going to lead to... or if I'm even totally misreading the situation. I think he and I will have to talk tonight because I'm confused, and chances are if I'm that way he is too.    Second:  I think people need to just get over themselves and move out of the past and into the "Now". Come on folks, I mean really. Why do we just bang our heads against the wall only to cause a headache on top of a heartache?    Third:  I need a drink.   Fourth:  German is almost over. I ended up with a 69 average, and geez... the prof would not up it to a 70 and just call it done. I have to watch two German films this weekend and then write an essay on them. I hope they are good. Oh well...  We must do what we must do.     Fifth:  I wonder if Debbie has fallen off the ends of the earth. Are you out there?   Sixth:  Grunt, I really don't want to drive to Griffin tomorrow.  That's it for the moment.
