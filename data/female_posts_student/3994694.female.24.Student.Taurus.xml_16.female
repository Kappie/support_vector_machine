Christian Books  Oswald Chambers "My Utmost for His Highest" This is the only devotional I've ever found worth reading, absolutely brilliant insights that lead you into really considering your relationship with God in detail. Hannah Hurnard "Hinds' feet in High Places" An awesome allegory that brings you face to face with the Shepherd and your own narrow path of transformation. Rick Joyner "The Final Quest" and "The Call" This fully leads you into a vision of climbing closer to God, and the battles on the way.  If you're a picture person, some theoretical ideas you've thought you understood with your mind really imprint themselves on your heart. Fenelon's Letters -- Bishop Fenelon's letters to various people encouraging them in their walks.   Fictional Books  Oscar Wilde "The Picture of Dorian Gray" See my posts on this book Mary Shelley "Frankenstein" Classic story, you can really see some strange truthes about humanity in it. Jung Chang "Wild Swans" Three generations of women in China, awesome intro to history can't put it down Stephen Lawhead Songs of Albion trilogy -- this is an absolute masterpiece in my opinion.  The story is excellent fantasy, but with the King/Bard relationship fully reflecting the King/priest relationships in Kings etc, and the whole idea of a theocracy in some ways.  Amazing stuff. C.S. Lewis: "Out of the Silent Planet" and the other two in this trilogy: sci fi that's quite unrealistic but brilliantly thoughtful in terms of 'what ifs'.  Awesome analogies   Development Books  Armatya Sen "Development as Freedom" A whole different way of looking at development Naomi Klein "No Code" Globalisation thriller -- an analysis of the world. George Ritzer "the Mcdonaldisation of Society" title says it all.  [oh no um, yes I have read a hundred books over my course of studyin development and I would recommend... um um maybe tommorrow]
