After that we went to class which was pretty cool.  The first hour was spent watching Mr. Agasi cook with him throwing out Hebrew words while we all talked amongst ourselves about such things as "G-dness" and which people Elie knew.  Then we went on to Kabballah which was really cool.  The guy (whose name I can't remember) had us write down the ten things that make us and draw the connections between them.  I sat there and struggled to come up with 10, the first 3 blatantly obvious and the last 7 just seemed to be words that suited my mood at that moment and I have changed a dozen times in my head.  The three things that compile me: Energy, Order and Randomness.  Or maybe: Energy, Structure and spontaneity, but you get the idea.  I also see those things as linked but had trouble finding all of the connections.  My energy forces me to do things, but i cannot operate in chaos so I must be ordered, but my energy also creates chaos.  But order and structure give me energy and strength to do something more chaotic.  Or maybe its that i find chaos in order, and order in chaos, and it is the knowledge that nothing is absolute that gives me energy.  Whatever it is those are the 3 primary things i see in myself.  I am also demanding, observant, oblivious, amused, and myself (is that a copout?). Well at least thats 8...  Things to think about while I fall asleep.
