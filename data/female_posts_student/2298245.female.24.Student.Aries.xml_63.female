You see, I have these dress boots that are too big for me, so I have these big socks that I have to wear with them, and I've been wearing them a lot lately because I bought some new clothes and I don't have that many shoes I can wear with them and I've been a little lax in my laundry duties...Anyway, so I took them off last night and all I can say about the smell is...Wow, it was really bad.  I mean rank, putrid, the worst of the worst smells.  Anyway, I just felt like sharing that, as a warning for the future...don't get too close to my bare, stinky feet.  The smell could be lethal.
