But that man who has known the immense unhappiness of losing a friend, by what name do we call him? Here every language is silent and holds its peace in impotence."  - Joseph Roux   I don't know, the quote actually took me by surprise, cause its actually very true. I'm thinking that its very true and it got me thinking. What DO you call someone who has lost a friend. This gives me a wonderful story idea, a fanfic even. I'm fully prepared for a horrible, horrible day. I'm also preparing for a move to my room. i/e, the internet shall soon be in my room and I can play all the mmorpgs I want. *cheers happily* :D. I'm thinking of heading to Full Sail in orlando. Maybe I might finally be able to go to a con and stuff. I might even get a roommate who likes anime.   We might become good friends!!! :) Ahhhh, the blissful melancoly of dreams. I love the 90s is tonight at like 9. I also have a new sunday addiction, 4400 from 9 to 11 at night  I'm also waiting for Lost and Desperate Housewives. I really can't wait for fall. Its going to be off the hook 4 sure!!  edit: Another quote!!!   "Reality is wrong. Dreams are for real." - Tupac Shakur      (did I mention not only do I love kanye but tupac as well? *grins* :D)
