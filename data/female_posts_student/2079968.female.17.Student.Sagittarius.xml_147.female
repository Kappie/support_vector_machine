Dunno what we'll find to do, if anything. Only reason I'm getting portraits done is so I'll have something to laugh at in the yearbook ten years from now.  There's this buzzing sound coming from the wall. It's annoying...either it's a messed up clock on the other side or there are bees in the wall. Or i'm just crazy. Maybe that's it.  A lady from Anderson College called me yesterday...caught me totally off guard. She was talkin' about how she "received my SAT scores...congratulations they were great, especially for taking them in June!"  Don't lie to me. They were awful. Maybe not AWFUL awful, but nothing to brag about, definitely.  She did some sort of phone interview, asking about extracurricular stuff...I hear typing in the background, got nervous I do believe. I guess I didn't do too bad though, 'casue she said I could have a good chance of early acceptance scholarship if I wanted to take it. I felt like a geek the whole time.  *sigh* I just don't know though...all this college junk is driving me crazy. I want it over with...too much to think about. I used to know where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do, but I've changed a lot even in the past few months.  Going to sleep, goodnight.
