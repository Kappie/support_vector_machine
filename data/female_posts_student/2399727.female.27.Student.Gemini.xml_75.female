I went to three different libraries, returned three books, picked up six more, returned those essays, got good news about that Psych class (I'm approved, just have to try to register on April 12), and even went to Mass today so I'm not beholden to go tomorrow (all about Lent).  This afternoon was a different story.  I was tired.  I needed to eat and watch  Starting Over .  I needed milk.  How did I run out?  Usually I don't let that happen.  Then I came back to read.  Got caught surfing the net.  Found www.ratemyprofessors.com/canada and had a royal hey-day there.   Even a high school site.  Sweet, still had many teachers I knew.  Added a few of my own ratings (all good, I swear).  Laughed at those ratings that were extremely accurate for those few people I knew shouldn't be rated highly.  Looked at my watch.  4:50 and I did nothing with my afternoon. Oh well, I suppose there's tomorrow after the final OOTC.     I'm becoming more and more convinced that the way that I am feeling right now, emotionally and psychologically, is not completely terrible.  I think it was only on March 12 at that good ophthalmologist's appointment that I realized completely and for the first time that this eye condition is chronic and potentially deteriorating.  That's hard news to sink in, even though she put a very positive spin on it.  I had been sailing along thinking that by 7 August 04 I would see perfectly, and now I understand that is just not true.  I have moved and am still in the process of moving from denial to anger to depression to acceptance.  I'm not wallowing in self-pity and crippled by this, unable to do anything.  I am facing this head on, making plans for the future, seeking help for the way I am feeling because I know I don't want to feel like this forever but I do need time to say goodbye to what is gone forever -- with the added qualification thanks to PP that it's gone for this life, not forever and ever.  Amen.  I wonder if that means we'll need eyes in heaven?  More to come...
