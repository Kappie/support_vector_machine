And we all know that you would never take off Abby's Barbie's head.  That would be cruel and naturally we would be forced to beat you up or something.  Also, you WORK?  Oh, and Rosie and I got our "defying the social norm" project approved.  For those who don't know, we're going to McDonald's and eating with a random family there.
