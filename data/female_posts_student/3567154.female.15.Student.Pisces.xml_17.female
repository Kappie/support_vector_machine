I think the world might end becuz he bought me a ring. And you know wut i am really sick of everyone thinking they can run mine and Jakes relationship. They all think they know what is best for me and Jake and they don't. Me and him kno wut is best for us so why does it seem like we can't run it? Everyone says "you guys are too young" or "you guys won't every last" i am sick of hearing it. It doesn't last cuz everyone else gets into our realtionship. I am so sick of all this. I am sick of Kristelle too i know i shouldn't be saying this but all i hear from jake it seems it Kristelle this and Kristelle that. She is always staring at him and i am just sick of it. I am sick of kim constantly comparing me and Jake to her and Keith. We arnh't them so stop tellin us to do the stuff you do. She just makes him more upset all the time. she thinks she doesn't but she does.O yea and on top of all this just to make this whinie bitchie blog even better i havn't talked to Jess in forever i think she is just tryin to ignor me. When she does call i am at band pratice she just desn't have time for me anymore and i guess i should just except it now.  Ok this is to clarifie and the ring thing. I love the ring Jake got for me it is sooooo pretty. It is just causin WAY to much trouble.  Ok on to a better topic i leave for band camp in like in two days. I am so excited. It should be fun fun fun....RIGHT. well in sum ways it well be but in others it won't be. O yea i evn missed a concert i really wanted to go to tonight so that i could be at band pratice. O well. well i am gonna go i think i am gonna go to bed i am too pissed to stay up. Night yall
