Or, more likely, it's that women do not generally look for a boyfriend at a clothes shop. Moving on, I know she's grounded, but I miss my Lindsey. And where is Laura? o.o Usually she's got about a million posts a day...tha's what she's here for, dernit. In conclusion I would just like to say that I am extremely bored, and will welcome any sort of entertainment, including naked photos of your pets. XD
