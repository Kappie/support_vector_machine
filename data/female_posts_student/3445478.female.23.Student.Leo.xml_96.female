He's has also been much more expressive the last few days with his voice  and  he's ticklish! G'ma Lu discovered this one. I tried it once this morning...ok, twice...and he squishes up his face and laughs! It is so funny to watch.  Nick has got much better at putting his fist in his mouth and anything else he can grab! G'ma Lu  Billy are getting Nick an excersaucer! "To support Christian's weight loss." My mom usually calls Nick, Christian. Hopefully today or tomorrow we can get that because both Nick  I are so bored...It's going to be a very very long day. Duluth is cloudy and today is supposed to resemble yesterday which means periods of rain here and there all day long. And it's cool out, which is fine by me!
