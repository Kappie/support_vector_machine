See the whoel day revolved around the theroy of Abortion being wrong, and while I agree it's wrong until today I felt it was the mothers choice wether to do it or not.  So any way, this priest started his sermon in the auditorium and like I found him kind of annoying cause he kapt comming back to the "innocent babies" thing. While it was true it was kind of annoying and he had us like say these psalms and readings outloud together and stuff. Then came the video. Okay this thing was very graphic. It started out with a person sticking a like metal thing up I guess the woman and just pulling out things. Then there were pictures of baby   parts  . The camera would show baby hands, heads, arms, legs, feet, there was one of half a head and the eye wide opened. Then there were some pictures of 9 month old babies just layin all crumpled up and dead. This went on for about... oh... 3-4 minutes. I wanted to kill myself and what hurt even more was that, that could have been me ya know? What if my birth mother had decided she didn't wanna go through with all this "pregnancy" crap and just have me aborted? I would never have met any of my friends, or met any of the people I have ever come in contact with. Now, I've had a pretty good life, and it's just so sad to think that all those babies, who could have had a great life like me, are now deprived of that because these women didn't wanna go through with it and didn't want to face the consequences of doin what they did to get pregnant in the first place.  Plus  these women got a lotta nerve getting rid of someone so cruely, someone who's apart of them, when great women like Sheila are tryin despritly, spending a lot of money just to have a baby. These poor kids would have been so much better off being adopted off to people like Sheila who are going through tedious Invitro prcedures when there are great kids just waiting to be appreciated and loved ya know? It was just a really sad thing to watch and to put us through. Not too many of the boys were too effected but a lotta the girls were cryin. I just had a look of disgust on my face, at some point or another my mouth dropped and it just stayed that way for a while. Then came confessions and that was uneventful, I don't think the priest even listened to me at all. Then this lady told us that its all of societies fault that abortion still happens and that if we don't do anything to stop it God is going to punish us. That was.... weird. Then the mass and then we all went to John's house where a lot of pizza-eating, pool-playing, and hanging-out went on and that was my day. It was alrite I guess. Hanging out with everyone was fun. Lot's of prom talk. I'm kinda phyced for it to tell the truth. Well thats it. x0x
