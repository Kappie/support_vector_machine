All I know is that every crowd was alive, every performer was kicking and every rhythm was beating.  Argghh, they do rock ! 	 Most of the concerts I’ve seen were held in an open field. And people like it that way, except probably those who tire easily from having to stand and having to stretch their necks just to get a glimpse of the artist on-stage. I also think that being in an open field is better, even when it rains. Actually, I like it when it rains. It’s when the power of youth, despite the hassles of getting wet, elevates for the music. 	 May it be RNB, hip-hop, reggae, alternative rock, loud rock, punk, punk rock, pop, slow, jazz or acoustics, being in the concert crowd could never feel any better. Everyone deserves a little break and a chance to break free.    Rock on!
