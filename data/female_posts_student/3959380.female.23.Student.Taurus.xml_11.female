Tried to watch Stage 14 of Le Tour de France last night, but feel asleep because I stayed too late at Alex's on Saturday night.  Which reminds me... at 2:40 on Sunday morning, John received an SMS and Jac said that she wished that she had friends at twenty to three in the morning, and I said that she did, they were just all in the room with her.  However, John's friend that messaged him at twenty to three in the morning was apparently me!  Or John or cath thinking they were funny since they were pissed.  I just think it was John trying to boost his ego :)
