We find out later today what exactly our rank is!! It's so exciting!! Whelp, school starts in a week and a half...i'm excited, yet not. But it's my senior year, so it'll be fun!! Things with Austin are going well...actually, we are hanging out later today, so I should probly go get gussied up!! :D Other than that, life is sweet, although I have no voice, but I can survive without that! Okay, I'm out! Oh, by the way, Chelsi...i heard ya'll were in town!! Email me, or talk to me...I wanna know how things went and I have a few other ??'s!!
