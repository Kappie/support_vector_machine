       
      I just went grocery shopping, something I've needed to do for a long time.  It's nice to have a little food in the house.    But, of course, I'm still going to Wendy's for lunch.  I'll be attacking the food I bought for snacking and desserting purposes soon enough, though.  I'm just having one of those too-lazy-to-cook days.  Of course, that's just about every day for me.  And it's not like anything I bought requires that much "cooking" anyway.    I could go on with this inanity, as I'm sure you'd all wish I would.  But my stomach is growling and Wendy's is beckoning me over to Third Avenue.
