I'm going o Florida tomorrow and I had to pack, but I didn't feel like it, so Delia was trying to get some outfits together so my mom wouldn't blow up @ me. (She's the sensible one.) It was so funny cuz whenever she would pull out an outfit, I would say, "it doesn't fit!" because, like I said, I didn't feel like packing. It took like an hour to pick out 4 shirts and 4 shorts!      Then when it was time for bed, I wasn't tired, so I hid under the bed and wouldn't come out. Delia was trying to get me out, but every time I saw her hand I woud bite it. Eventually, she lured me out with a story about Scrumpliumpus. (Scrumpliumpus is an animal she made up for me. It is a wird fluff ball thing that annoys everyone in sight.) It finally put me to sleep.     And now it's time for the image of the day! Todays image of the day is:        That's a cute little cat thing that I thought was funny.     And lastly, today's saying of the day is:  Person 1: Yes!  Person 2: No!  Person 1: Yes!  Person 2: No!  Both: Hey! That's a patterin!  I won't be posting anymore blogs till at least next Sun. cuz I'm going to Disney world. (That is, if I survive the plane ride.) Wish me luck!
