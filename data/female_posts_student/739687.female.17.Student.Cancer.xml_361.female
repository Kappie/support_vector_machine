Not that any of this is negative. Certainly not. Sometimes I like being torn in several directions...it gives me choices and choices are what make life interesting.  I think the worst of these directions...is the one that I've been holding on to for far too long.  But now...I fear, I'm going to lose someone forever.  What do you do when someone who has meant so much to you...just isn't there anymore? Do I say good-bye? What kind of goodbye is that?  It's the kind of goodbye I've been trying to say for months...but haven't been able I guess. Maybe I'm not as strong as I like to pretend.  All in all...everything is good. It's confusing and spontaneous and outrageous and a little odd...and that's just how I like it.     (I'm going to miss you.)  Coughcraziescough
