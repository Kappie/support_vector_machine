Anyway i met someone famous too! Ok...he's not THAT famous......ok...he's not famous at all...i saw Mr Allum shopping....*gasps*...*chokes*...hehe...he was wearing the funny caps he always wears at the carnivals....oh...i'm not sure if he wore the long socks too, it was hard to tell considering the fact that he was wearing long pants - and i hav no intentions of pulling his pants down to find out (i would say pulling his pants up but i think they were high enough already LOL)! And guess who else he was hanging around???...No it wasn't Mrs Hodge or Mrs Sharp or Mrs Field - it was a different lady! I'm pretty sure it wasn't his mum...i think...unless his mum conceived him when she was pretty young....ok...i do not want to think about how Mr Allum was conceived...ARGH...  i better go before i say something that i will regret..  potato pie  ARGH!
