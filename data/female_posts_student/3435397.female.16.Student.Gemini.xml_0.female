It was awesome I loved it so much I had a blast playing and taking people out but today I am so freaking sore! Jackie and I were streching today while we were waiting for drivers on our breaks and whatever.  My neck is super sore but hey I should have streched after! Today we had our drivers test I am pretty sure I past but if I didn't have the review I swear I would have failed all because of Jackie! lol jk Hun I wouldn't have! But it was pretty easy. I fell asleep last night studying but meh it was okay today. I didn't want to get up though but I survived!  Shocking today I actually kind of talked to the person who I am not really liking to be around most(he knows who he is) and I didn't hate him as much today as I have been I think the grudge is slowly going away! Now I must eat I am starving but I think I might watch   Love actually   but I am not to sure it didn't look to good last night but I could try to watch it today! Write more in a bit though! Later Gator
