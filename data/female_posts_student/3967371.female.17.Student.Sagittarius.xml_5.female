I just wanted to say something about the finality of my stand against falling into dangerous situations... an insight given to me by LP.  There are things in life I chose to do not because I wanted to do it for the sake of me but because I wanted to do it for the sake of certain OTHERS. This acts for others thing is not your usual MAN FOR OTHERS atenean deed... no. I try to find my own satisfaction by seeing other people being satisfied with the things I do or do not do... In short, I had lived to please others... I had lived for others neglecting the ME part of my life.  I had lived the life of a bitch who I swore that I will never become. I had ceased to become me...  Anlabo  Kase ganito... mahal ko sya... Dahil mahal ko sya... sinusubukan kong ibahin ang buhay ko... dahil sa kagustuhin kong ibahin ang buhay ko... hindi ko alam na kung ano ang dapat kong buhay. Don't satrt with "Ask help from the Lord!" We had made a pact that we'll just let everything take its course so he would not interfere with my life... My achievements and failures will be my doing... We'll just settle scores later... ha?  Sorry ha... gabi na kase... I have to be in full study mode tom and i was in full study mode kagabi until 3 ng hapon kanina... So technically, wala pang ayos ang utak ko.  Let me go back to the mahal ko sya part... Dati yun... aftermath na yung hindi ko na maintindihan yung sarili ko. Ngayon, I'm in the state of pagsasawa. Pano ko nasabi yun? nawawala na PATI yung frustration ko... Dati nawala yung hapiness ko... ngayon... peti frustration na... In short, he starts to be just a regular guy walking around the campusjust for the sake of existing... He has ceased to be my life...  Pathetic noh?  Basta yun... Yun na... tulog na ako... pramis bukas ulit... pero kelangan kong magprogram at magaral!!! Sa tuesday nalang after ng psych test ko... sob
