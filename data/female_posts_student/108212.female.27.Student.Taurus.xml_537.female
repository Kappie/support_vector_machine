The BIG Hit The Fifth Element  Pearl Harbor  (all are available at walmart)    I got to talking to my friend Eric about the new fashions in men's formal wear. and  urlLink THIS  is what he came up with.   Speaking of the 70's, Have you guys checked out urlLink Dr. Chan and the amazing Chan Clan   cartoon on the Boomerang network?  What a cheezy spoof on chinese characters.  Its a takeoff from Josie and the Pussycats and Scooby Doo.  I am confused which of these cartoons came first?    more to come...  (_)_) ~~Net
