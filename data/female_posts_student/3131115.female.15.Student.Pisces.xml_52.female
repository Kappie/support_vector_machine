It was black, but you could hardly see the lettering so I decided to change it. i dont really like the name of it, but it will have to do. This one is set up a little different than my other ones, but I like it. I like having the Archives.    I'm having a little personal problem..I can't really say what it is because it's insanely sick. Although, it's getting better..gradually. I'm really missing William at this point, I kind of got off te phone with him in a hurry and I hate more than anything doing that. Grr..Oh well. I think I want to go to bed now so that I can wake up tomorrow and talk to him. I love him with all my heart. HEEE -William-..:-P.   I'm in a good mood, that's surprising. This Blog makes me so happy:) aww..I love you Bloggie. :)  Leaving now...
