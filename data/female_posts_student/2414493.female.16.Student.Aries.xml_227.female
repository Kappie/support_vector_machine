This girl walked in today seriously thinking that this summer program was going to improve chances for Harvard admission. Another swore that between Wesleyan and Wellesley, Wesleyan was for all girls (it isn't).  You know, I'm at Harvard and for that much, I should be thrilled. But the chief thing that annoys me here is the people, I guess. Or at least the random sampling I've seen. Maybe that's not the way to put it. I just wish I were surrounded by geniuses and had to work my butt off, relatively speaking, but it doesn't seem as vibrant or competitive as YSP.   Sylvia and Ellis (wherever you guys are) are trying to convince me to go out and socialize and all, but frankly, I'm happy being the antisocial little weirdo I am. It's not like I don't have friends here, and it's not like I'm socially uncomfortable, so why bother? Thanks for the excellent advice, Wendy.  More Freud. He's really boring, for the record.
