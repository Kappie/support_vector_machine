I don't know why he thought we should have questions from before the last test but apparently we are supposed to remember that stuff. All in all, every grad student I have talked to said they would be luckey to get a 60 on it. I think that is a reasonable expectation. I hate when tests ruin a perfectly good day. I am totally useless for the rest of the day. On the bright side I have a whole week before the next one. Well other than that I am playing softball tomorrow. I don't know if what I do is considered playing but I stand out there and once in a while I swing a bat so I will take it.
