Frequently I wonder why I've put myself through this.....why I feel the need to hold a doctrate.  Is it greed?  Insecurity?  A little bit of both?  It's all possible.  I've always been a bit power hungry.      I'm currently wrapped up in a nightmare called research.  They say that without research, society would remain stagnant.  I really don't see a problem with that.....we've got water, power, the internet and cable television.  Maybe society is greedy.  Actually I see the point of research just the project which I'm involved in.  Dreadful.  Fat kids, pedometers.....they just don't mix.  It really isn't earth shattering either.  America's children are obese, so be it.  Perhaps had someone not done research into the taste trends of America, they wouldn't be......see, research really is evil.
