I could do more of the review assignment because it was stuff was early on in the unit but the stuff near the end of the unit is really confusing me.  I am trying to understand it and I want to do good, but it is very hard to be optimistic about the math test since I don't seem to understand the stuff.  My dad can't help me cause he isn't coming to visit until next weekend and my mom knows nothing about math.  Basically I have to figure it out all of my own, and it certainly is not easy.  You know if I had one wish right now it would be to just understand my math.  That is the only thing that I really want at the moment right now.  It is stressing me out.  The more I try to understand the more I realize I don't understand.  The more I practice the more I worry about the math test being hard.  The more I don't understand the more I think that I won't do good on the math test.  I don't want to think negative right now, but it is hard not to.  I need a break right now though just to think about things and all this not understanding math is making me fell bad about myself.  Tonight after supper I will do more math cause during the night it is easier to focus and remember things.  And well yeah I can't wait til' Friday cause my dad comes in from Vancouver on Thursday and that Friday we get to go out for Chinese.  Then Lenny is turning 16 so I will probably go over and visit with him and some other people later that night.  Travis is suppose to call me tonight to make arrangements for tommorow but I will see if he actually calls.  I don't know whether to believe him or not.  He told me he was working until three o'clock today and like I logged on to my msn before 3 to check my email and he was online.  It kind of bothers me that I can't seem to trust him, although I want to trust him.  I feel that something is not right and he is not telling me something.  I don't know if I sould wait to find out what it is or come on to him with a strightforward question asking him what he is not telling me at the moment.   I got this in an email a while ago and saved it because it had meaning to me:     Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, they serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson or help figure out who you are or who you want to become.   You never know who these people may be; your roommate, your neighbor, professor, long lost friend, lover or even a complete stranger who, when you lock eyes with them, you know that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way.   And sometimes things happen to you and at the time they seem horrible, painful and unfair, but in reflection you realize that without overcoming those obstacles you would never have realized your potential, strength, will power of heart.   Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good or bad luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments or true greatness and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of the soul.   Without these small tests, if they be events, illnesses or relationships, life would be like a smooth paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. Safe and comfortable but dull and utterly pointless.   The people you meet who affect your life and successes and downfalls you experience, they are the ones who create who you are. Even the bad experience can be learned from... Those lessons are the hardest and probably the most important ones.   If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart... forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious to whom you open your heart.   If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because they are teaching you to love and opening your heart and eyes to things you would have never seen or felt without them.   Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from it everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people you have never talked to before, and actually listen, let yourself fall in love, break free and set your sights high. You can make of your life anything you wish. Create your own life and then go out and live it.   I wish you all the best in your endeavors as well as struggles in life. Have a fighting spirit and never hesitate to get back in the struggle!
