       
      I'm sitting here in the library, bored, and as I think that, I ponder what exactly I mean by it for a second.  For there are varieties of boredom, two of which my brain has the capacity to comprehend at the moment.  At the moment I am bored not because of lack of things to do.  In fact, I have a rather large pile of things sitting here to occupy myself with, and even more at home (well, at my apartment - lately, I am having much trouble referring to it as home, but that is a subject for another day, perhaps).  Perhaps it is because all of it is so overwhelming that I am bored with it, bored with the monotony of constantly shifting from one thing to another, with no break, with no variation in the type of work presented to me.  One begins to come up with variations, however slight, in order to make the task less objectionable.  I begin to, for example, decide which one of my fascinating law school subjects that I prefer to the others, even though in the end the work is the same, reading and outlining, reading and outlining.  But most of all I am just bored with the experience of it all.  Never in my life have I been a particularly hard worker.  I just sort of meandered through school, making fairly respectable grades (though nothing stellar) and that has been OK for me.  I wanted law school to be different, and I knew that I would have to work hard, and at first, that was certainly not boring.  It gave me a sense of purpose, fear drove me to expand my powers of preparation for class and for exams.    But now things are different.  I have not failed.  I have flourished, for the most part, with a few bumps along the way, again in the same way I always have, not stellar, but nothing to sneeze at.  And I started to get a little complacent, and a little lazy too.  So now I am just bored with the experience of it all.  Bored of the reading, bored with going to class - and this is even in the classes that interest me.  And as this is only my second year, I suspect this feeling will only get worse next year.  Every semester I say that the one coming up is going to be different, and that I am really going to apply myself and make out a strict schedule and stick to it.  And every semester I end up spending lots of time watching cable and surfing the net.  And while this gives me occasional pause and makes me feel like a lazy bum, I usually quickly get over it, at least enough so that it doesn't prevent me from continuing on what some might call a self-destructive track.  I get bored with feeling that way, too, so I throw it off and think of something else.
