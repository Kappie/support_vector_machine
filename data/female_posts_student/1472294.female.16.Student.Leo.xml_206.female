Ok, those civilians who were attending in the Swissotel Merchant Court, listen very carefully here. Coz there was only 1 wedding held there, they should know which couple I am referring to.... The dumb wedding was held from 7.00 to 10.30pm and that dinner only started at 8 something. The wedding sux. All those who attended weddings should know. The standing and watching the couple sssttrrrooollll and waiting for trainees waiter to serve the uuurrrgghhh food and standing up again for photos and the yyyuuummm- ssseeennnnggg...... >_ BELOVED  children to  everybody . His son was abled to study overseas through to UK and his daughter is in the U right now. Seeing them made my nerves go cold and hard. In the past, the 2 cousins of 'mine' were like dolls, mute. Now, they are immature dolls, their hair was like maggi mee and a yellow durian. I mean it may look good on others but not on these 2 ''dolls''.... So what they are graduates, hell to them!  P.S. The above mentioned people and place is real and out of my fustrations and anger, I typed here. Maybe tomorrow I will regret it and apologise. But right now, let me steam and burn.....
