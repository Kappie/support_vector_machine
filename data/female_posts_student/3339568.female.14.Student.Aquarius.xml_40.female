Although I felt sick the whole time, and the fact that Pete Hayes felt compelled to throw a Bible at my head  did not help . I mean just because he's obviously upset about sumthing, doesn't mean he should take it out on another people. I mean, it wasn't very nice. But I'll 4 give him, even tho it hurt, because he looks very depressed. Poor Pete.  Steve gave a very interactive sermon 2nite, which involved us splitting into groups and discussing questions about a passage, but our group (Ashley Baker, Claire, Gemma and I) were pretty shotty and tended to not hear the question! oops - steve had 2 help us a few times.  And Mel and I were "brave" people that Rach L was looking 4 to give an impromptue speech about EBN last nite. So we got up there, and spent a while laughing, till I had 2 start because Mel wouldn't. I embarressed miself by using horrible grammar, "there were foots on the wall" Mi god, at least i corrected miself through the fits of laughter. And I got $2 from Gem, because she dared me to tell everyone that she didn't come and she'd give me money, so i did, i said "lots of people came, but some didn't, like gemma, because she stayed home and was a BLUDGER, so i suggest everyone comes next time!" It fit in well, and now I'm $2 richer. Yay :D  Luke's long john's are keeping me company at home until they arrive at Hannah's on Tuesday all ready for their Speedo Joel transformation. :D hehe. Yay. And one question, Y did Speedo Joel not turn up to church? Grrr him. And T2 didn't come either, I wanted 2 talk 2 him. I told T1 about Thrush Anonymous meetings and how Mel is obsessed with Thrush and he was severley freaked out! Don't blame him...hehe, it was funni tho.  Oh, and Dance was soo cool. We all came and we ALL had blue T-shirts and black pants. It was realli funni. And we thought that Ash would turn up and ruin it all, 'cept she didn't come! :'( We missed Ash. And after we finished dancing we were gonna pray 4 Kwame, and then we decided 2 do a prayer dance. So we split up into 4 groups of 2, and 1 person had to be God and 1 had to be Kwame, and you had 2 express what you wanted to say and pray 4 through your dance. It was so cool. I was with Megan and she was Kwame and I was God. Mel thought it was gonna be hard to do, but once you started dancing, it all just came out and it was so easy. And fun too.  I like Church and Ernie and Dance. It's such a cool part of mi life :D
