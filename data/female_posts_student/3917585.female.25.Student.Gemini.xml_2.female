No strikes or spares for me, but that's ok...my boyfriend was the star!  Shopping in Bellingham on Saturday. Not overly successful for me, but Steph did well. And that was the important part. And I found the cutest bracelet!  Finally saw  Troy  Saturday night with Sean It was very good. Although a couple of cheesey moments made me laugh out loud at perhaps inappropriate moments. Good thing I'm a quiet laugher.  Beach on Sunday with Steph. Then watched Sean play soccer. Most important accomplishment from yesterday: Avoiding sunburn!
