I hate that place I will NEVEREVER go back and be humiliated like that again. We stood out side for about 30 minutes the friend we were meeting came outside to try and get us in and could not. I would never recommend anyone to go there to stand in line and feel crappy the way I did tonight. So we went up the street another bar and called the people that we were going to be meeting. They said we'll be down there in a little bit well an hour passed and there was no sign. I called him to find out where he was and got no answer on the cell so I text messaged him got no response.After about another hour or sowe decided it wastime to leave. So I call my friend that's still at the party to let him know that we are going, I get no answer. As the night goes on I called 30 minutes after the bars close and get no answer. I'm hating life right about now. Rejected because I don't look the part to get into the club and rejected by the boy that we were suppose to meeting. I know it wasn't his fault that we couldn't get in and it was his friend's party, so I could never really ask him to leave. I just wish that life wouldn't be so hard.
