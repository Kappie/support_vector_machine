It is some pretty depressing stuff... well, see for yourself.  "Ready to Die" sitting here alone away from all things real looking for a way trying to deal fuck it all all odds are against me why the fuck can't you all see can't get these thoughts out of my head why can't I  just be dead why delay the enivitable is here only to wish to completely disappear alone in the world no one seems to care to walk right past you they wouldn't even dare an invisible image clear to the eye to already be invisible ready to die  (Samantha Embry 5/7/04)   This one isn't as emo....  "Only to Dance" looking at your eyes an image to unclear needing you, wanting you to only be so dear an invisible image you cannot portray a feeling so deep only to say why can't you see whats right in front of you a thing so special for you to only throw away to hateful world so full of strife what all we get is just one life why can't you  just take a change just get over yourself one only to dance  (Samantha Embry 5/9/04)
