Used to be that I was one kind of person earlier. Sure, circumstances and time change a person but lately it seems like I have just had a personality transplant. This whole week since Monday, I have been doing nothing. Nothing that I would consider useful. No contribution to the world and certainly, no contribution to the success of my own life and future.  First my tooth; with the onset of wisdom there is pain and I think that's a fact. With learning there is always pain. No pain, no gain. That's what they say and that's what life is all about; paining and gaining. And so on a philosophical note, it seems that with my wisdom tooth making its appearance its making itself felt as well. Love is not easy. Sure at first, its all roses and enthusiasm and all those hormones running amok. But, I think you shouldn't forget that hormones too have a shelf life just like all medication. Hormones dry up and roses die. Love has its day too. It can die and it can dry up. I think what you have to is try and prevent that. What can you do to prevent that? I think you could deal with it with a large dose of patience and think maybe of the reasons that took you down this particular path in the first place.  What took me down this particular street with K was first that comfort zone that I achieved with him. Leading a life that isn't always peaceful, you tend to appreciate the comfort and peace of mind that you can manage to snatch, much more than when you are younger and more stupid. Sure my hormones surged, bells went off in my head and my heart told me to turn tail and run at first. Or even just ignore the bells. But then I sat and thought about the regret. regret that if I didn't try what promised to be an entirely new experience, I would look back and think on what might have been. But now I think about it the other way. What if I hadn't gone down that road and just had in my imagination all the lovely things that might have been abed that could be. Then I wouldn't see the pain at all. That's what you have to wonder whether your imagination is what makes possibilities more attractive and whether in reality some things are best left to one's imagination. previously I saw that love just wasn't enough. Sometimes two people in circumstances wrong for them just cant make it work. On the other hand maybe sometimes two people in the right circumstances might not be able to make it work either. Wait and see... That's all I can do right now.
