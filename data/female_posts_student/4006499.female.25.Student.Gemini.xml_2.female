For the original: http://www.alternet.org/waronirq/2004/08/002253.html  37,000 Civilians Dead? 08/02/04 According to an Iraqi activist group, more thatn 37,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed since the U.S. Invasion in March, 2003. The People's Kifah told Al Jazeera that it is "100 percent sure" of the estimate, which it claims is based on extensive research by Iraqi academics who visited remote villages to collect their data. While neither the Pentagon nor the new interim government keeps any statistics on civilian casualties, the number is significantly higher than that put forward by Iraqi Body count Project, a non-profit organization created by British and American professors, which puts the toll at anywhere between 11,000 and 15,000.
