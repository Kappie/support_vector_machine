I suppose you middle-aged readers with you had your youthful exuberance and health to spend hours on a pathetic open journal. But this is the Hollywood of the diary! Who knows what young starlet will be discovered? Perhaps a talent agent, after hours spent shuffling through the millions of dull blogs that pollute the internet, to happen upon (not this one, I only post to spread the love)one sassy, sprite of as blog that has him on the very edge of his swivel seat. He must know who is the possessor on such a swift, witty tongue! You are discovered, and it's only a matter of time until you've got a sitcom and a book deal in the oven. Life is sweet!
