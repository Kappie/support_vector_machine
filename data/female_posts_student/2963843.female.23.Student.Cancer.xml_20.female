I left the hall half an hour early. What is the point of staying when I have written down everything that I knew?Feeling very edgy, I called M.. It was comforting to hear her voice, even if we didn't get to say much... After the phonecall, I felt better.. Bless... Eveyone needs a friend.. =)  Janet called me on my mobile and said she couldn't answer the calculation questions.. She was panicking and kept asking me what will happen if she fails her major? Well, my opinion is that she's not the only one who finds the paper hard.. Even LCW; the 'super smart, bao ka liao in project' guy had a gloomy look on his face after the paper. So I pray that the lecturer will be more lenient..  One more thing, I just found out that the 'joker' in our lecture has a nick name for me. Miss fidgetey! I heard him calling me that when I sat down! well I can't help fidgeting on my chair during exams when I'm nervous! I thought it wasn't that noticable, but seems like he noticed! Damn that guy, I hope he fails! Curse his paper, may he forget everything he learnt haha...  2 more papers and a major project deadline to go May 13 is the day to my freedom,  Exams, check, Projects, check.. all done! May 13, My own christmas! =)  Then its Bintan! Here I come! Beware!
