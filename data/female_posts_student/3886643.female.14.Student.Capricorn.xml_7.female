It wasn't too bad in the morning class tho.  Specially with my dork-o friend Tori (luv ya haha) flashing the cell phone light thingie at the top of the phone...that was fun on Friday haha.....and watchin Dejaunette try to call somebody durin class (haha) and me n Tree watchin Kyle look stuplified (lmfao).  O then theres Jarrett...i dont know exactly what he was doin...lol..but i think he has a thing for Tuttle (j/p jarrett! haha)...he was lookin @ her kinda funny today....haha.  After that class was over, i went to the grocery store, got stuff, then went home n my momma fixed me a sammitch.  It was GuD.  Then i hopped in the car and went back to the highschool for my 2nd helping of Drivers Ed (make-up)...it was perdy boring...Then i saw some extremely colorful material creeping out of court's pants....but it was her bathin suit! haha....Then me n jay talked for like 15 minutes cus we didn't have nothin to do.  Then we had break, and stupid courtney would come with me to get a drink! gah! haha So my new best bud Amber came instead. Then i got a Drink!  That was GuD too!...Then class was over and i went home.  Then i had to cut icky tomatoes (i HATE tomatoes, and i EXTREMELY HATE cutting them!)...Their guts went everywhere when i tried to cut them! Y-U-C-K!!!....Then i got done...and that's about it...
