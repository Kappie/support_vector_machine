The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.” ~Thomas Paine (1737-1809) American political theorist, writer    Expectation.  What can be expected of one man?  Is it fair for the world to look at a man, one single, solitary man to carry the weight of the world with out err?  Is it fair for sports fans to look to one player to carry his team?  Could it truly be the power of one?  Is there such a thing as the “power of one?”  When do expectations become overwhelming brutality?    Several days ago I was sitting, waiting for my Introduction to Law class to start when a discussion arose about the patriotism of Johnny Depp.  It would appear that Johnny Depp moved to France when George W. Bush was elected president of the United States.  He likened the United States to a puppy with big teeth and a bad bark.  From this conversation came the topic of war in the middle east, war against Iraq.  A woman in my class made the ignorant comment that there were no weapons of mass destruction, claiming that it was more like “Weapons of Mass Delusion.”  I have been thinking about it ever since.    It was brought to light by a rather wise 18 year old that not only did we find the weapons of mass destruction, but their tyrannical ruler was using the weapons against his own people, so they obviously exist!  A point that I found very hard to dispute –not that I was trying to dispute them, I was on his side.  To which she commented that our president could have handled the situation more delicately, through the United Nations.  HA!  The UN did nothing but procrastinate.  The young man said he believed we should withdraw from the UN –a bit drastic if you ask me!  Still, it begs the question: How much can be expected of one man?  How much can we blame on George W. Bush who is only doing what he can to keep our nation safe?  When foreign terrorism landed on our shores, for the first time ever really –as opposed to domestic terrorism- our nation was shocked by the terror and death that surrounded us all and affected each and every American.  If it didn’t touch us personally, we felt for those that were devastated by the pain, we felt violated.  How could this happen in America?  Yet it did.    How could any one person who lived through the utter horror of 9/11 be anything but supportive of the war on terrorism?  How could any American who calls him or herself patriots not raise the flag and support our troops and president in his actions?  Those who do not should be ashamed of themselves!  Every other day we hear about a “superstar” publicly opposing President Bush, fools!  It gives me great heart to see how those so-called “superstars” are treated in the face of such un-called for comments.  Sean Penn, Dustin Hoffman, Dixie Chicks, Johnny Depp –pampered, sorry excuses for Americans!  Yet there are those who would boycott these stars, myself among them, good Americans, good people!  So if you ask me, I believe that if you choose to look at one man to carry the world, you should realize that his decision are not to please you but rather to keep you safe –against your will if need be.  If one man is to carry the world on his shoulders, if one man is to be our modern day Atlas, let him carry the world to protection weather we want it or not.  Yet it has not happened yet, George W. Bush is not entirely responsible, we have this waste of time and space we call Congress who would fight him today and praise him tomorrow, let them share the responsibility.  Let them take some of the flak for our situations that they helped create, rather than running for cover when trouble or the more and more unpatriotic rear their ugly heads!  ~ Kristyn
