Not that i really study or do my homework at home anyways.  I like school only because i get to see all of my friends and we get to do stupid things in front of everyone and we don't care.  Meh, i have a Bible test tomorrow in English......French sounds like the perfect time to study for that.  Coppell Hockey starts back up again this Thursday where we play Duncanville at 6:30 in Valley Ranch.  Bound to be fun, at least they can win games and not tie at the last second like the DALLAS STARS can.  Dallas plays Atlanta on Thursday at 7:30 or something.  Meh, who really cares because i'm sure we'll have the win until the last 30 seconds of the game and then we'll tie.  So no point in watching until the last minute of the game.    Monday was boring, Today was boring.  As long as school is going on, everyday is boring.  Except the afternoon/early evening when i talked to Brittany on the phone.  We had this huge debate over whether Clay Aiken was gay or not and all the proof we both had of our opinions.  Then that turned into this huge "Would you pick this guy over Mike Modano" debate in which Brittany would give me Mike and another choice and expect me not to pick Mike.  Well i picked Mike against Clay, Ashton and some other guys.  And the she tried matching up Prince William, Andy Roddick and some other really hot guys up to Mike.  At some points, it was really quite unfair to Mike, especially when the Prince William vs. Mike thing came up.  Everyone knows that any girl would pick Prince William over Mike because A) He's the hottest guy ever much less the fact that he's a ROYAL hot guy, B) He's rich, C) he's blonde, D) he had the coolest mom ever and E) He's Prince William for gosh sakes! and he's internationally loved.  If Prince William died tomorrow, the world would literally stop and every girl would cry her eyes out.  You thought the world stopped when Princess Diana died?  It only stopped for a few hours.  If Prince William died, the world would stop for a few days (LOL Brittany, that was a great debate).  That's my opinion anyways.  So that was the fun thing of the evening.  Also, Brittany revealed something that made me freak out, but its ok now.  I would also like to say to Taylor Kubic that i am now mad at him for more than what he said to me today and the game thing, so if he values his life he will apologize fairly quickly.  Ok and now i'm going to go.  bye!  Best of luck to your first week back at school,  ~~~Taylor~~~
