Someone is blasting music out their window, and even though mine is closed, I can't keep it out.  At first it was rather novel, and kind of even fun; I was dancing along to the music as I worked on my outline.  Now it is just annoying, about five songs into the program.  I can't exactly tell where it is coming from, or I might complain - though I probably wouldn't, since it is much more my style to toil and fester and seethe in anger rather than to actually do anything constructive about it.  This, coupled with my lack of appreciation for the fine art of confrontation - someone remind me why I want to be a lawyer again - leaves me at something of a loss when it comes to situations like this.  Guess I'll just have to deal with it, ignore it, or continue to dance along.
