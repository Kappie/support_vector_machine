I saw it once on Friday, a second time today at 7:15, and a third today at 9:45. "My, you wasted no time between the last two times," one may be thinking. Yes, you are correct, for immediately following me second screening I ran into Talley and Rachel (Lucas' younger sister) at the movie theater. As I was driving away with my mother and 12 year old sister Elizabeth, I saw Talley's car driving into the parking lot. So, I told my mother and she followed the car and the passengers after their exit of said car. She was honking and flashing her brights on and off, but they were completely ignoring her. Finally Talley turned around and realized that we weren't some crazy stalker people like she had firstly presumed. She walked over to the car and told me to get out. Of course, I asked why, though I had a pretty good idea. She said that I was to go to the movie with them. Then, I asked which movie they were intent on viewing, and Talley replied that the movie in question was none other than Harry Potter. So, naturally I replied that I had just finished watching it, but she said something along the lines of "I don't care" and told me I was going to watch it anyway. So I did, thus upping my total viewings of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban to three.
