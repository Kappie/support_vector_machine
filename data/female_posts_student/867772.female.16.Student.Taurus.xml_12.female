What's this mean?  when i see her eyes look into my eyes then i realize that she could see inside my head so i close my eyes thinking that i could hide disassociate so i don't have to lose my head this situation leads to agitation will she cut me off? will this be amputation?  i don't know if i care i'm the jerk life's not fair  fighting all the time this is out of line she loves me not do you realize I won't compromise she loves me not
