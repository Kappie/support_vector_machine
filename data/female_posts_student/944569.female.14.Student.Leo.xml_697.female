She has purple hair which matches my other test results.  "  You tend to dye your hair in all colours of the rainbow".  But then again it might be her "natural" hair color. When you see a lot of animes, people have strange natural hair colours.  Purple for one ( Shampoo from Ranma).  White too for young people ( Kakashi from Naruto and a kid from Hunter X Hunter).  Some have green like that alien from Mars in Urusei Yatsura ( I never liked that series too much.  Ranma is soo much better)
