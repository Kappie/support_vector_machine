Adam drags himself through the front door. "You haven't spoken to us all day!" "So how was it?" "How was what?" Adam says, hanging up his jacket. "If you're referring to work, some kid managed to break the new drum kit the school bought." "No, you moron, the date!" says Mickey. "Oh, that." "Trying to sound casual now, are we?" "What?" "Did you pull?" wonders Jesse. "On a first date? Adam? No way..." "Yes actually, I did." "Seriously?" exclaims Ryan. Adam is rather offended. "Good thing you wore a shirt, man," decides Jesse. "That was the key. Touche," he adds, kissing his fingers like a french guy. "Err.. OK." "What was it like? What's her name? Who is this new and mysterious woman who has entered thine life?" says Mickey. Everybody turns around and stares at Mickey. "I've erm, been reading .. stuff." Everybody turns back around to Adam and STARES. "What?" "Well answer the man's question then!" says Jesse. "What? Why?" "Come on man! We gotta know!" "No! That is between me and Jane." "OOooOOhhHH, so her name's Jane now, is it?" "Oh God." "What have you got to hide, eh?" "Yeh dude. We're friends - we're a  band . We have this infinite web of ever-bonding erm, bondness. Does that mean nothing to you?" Everyone stares at Mickey again. "Sorry." "No, it's not that.. it's just that I like to keep things private." "Look man, there are some things we just ain't meant to know. But this ain't one of them." "Will you just let me through so I can get a beer?" "Only if you tell us." "I'll get the beer for you," suggests Mickey. "No, we don't have any left," reminds Ryan. "What? But I bought like a whole crate on Saturday!" exclaims Adam. "I know, but we had this party this.." "You had a party?" "Well... it was more of a..." "..Of a gathering.. kinda thing." Jesse scratches his neck. "You had a party and you didn't even tell me?"  That is bloody out of order. I'm the only one who works, making me the sole provider of this damn "family" and all they do is partay? and without ME?  "Well.. we didn't know we were having a party. It was kinda.. what's that word?" "Spontaneous?" suggets Ryan. "Yeh, that's the one." "What?" "Wait a minute, haven't we told him yet?" "Told me what?" "Oh my god. You are going to fry in happiness when you hear this!" Everyone turns around to stare at Mickey again. "Burst, i meant burst, not fry." "Shut up Mickey," says Ryan. "Adam," he says, looking him in the eye, seriously, "We got a record deal." Silence. "You could have made up something more believeable, you know," says Adam. "What? You don't believe us?!" exclaims Jesse. "Look! Here's the papers!!" says Mickey, shoving it into Adam's face. "Dude, that's a porn magazine." "Oh, sorry. here they are, look!!" Mickey tucks the mag into his pocket and resumes shoving papers into Adam's face. Silence. "Seriously? We got a record deal?" "Yeh dude!! WE GOT A RECORD DEAL!!" "OH MY F*CKING GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!!!" "I knew he would fry with happiness. Burst, burst, not fry."
