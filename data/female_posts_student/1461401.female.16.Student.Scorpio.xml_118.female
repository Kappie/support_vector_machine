For anyone who is not familliar with Oasis, I strongly recommend you become familliar with it. And then there's the pillows. Man, gotta love them pillows. You can't really understand what they're singing unless you can speak japanese, but even if you can't understand then they're still worth listening to. You would have already heard some of their songs if you ever watch FLCL (fooly cooly) on adult swim at 12. Now I'm sleepy. All this talk of pillows and such. And then there's the fact that I woke up really early today to go get my picture taken for school and all that jazz. I still stand by my statement that I made yesterday. I. Hate. Bandcamp.  Although, the rides home can be pretty nice.
