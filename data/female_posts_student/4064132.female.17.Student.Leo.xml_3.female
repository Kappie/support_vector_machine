I don't know where I would be if I didn't know you. I am so glad you came into my life. I know we don't always get along and no one wants us together. But oh well. I love you and you love me. I know we can't get back right now but I just need you to be more with me you know? I don't know where I would be with out you and I don't know where I will go with out you either.          E, I am here for you girl! You need anything I am going to help you get it! Nothing is going to happen. You will pull past this I know it!!          Sorry I haven't posted been a little busy taking care of business!!
