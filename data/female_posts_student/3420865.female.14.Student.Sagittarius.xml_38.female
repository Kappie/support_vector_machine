(according to sofija.) cuz she kept laughing like every 5 seconds, even when i didn't say anything funny... ahaha she makes me feel so awesome aha. i love sofija... so part of my blog will be dedicated to her, and only her. (the other part, sadly, won't.)  10 things i love about sofija vrbaski.  10. she is amazingly pretty. times 2. 9. she makes me laugh. 8. she laughs about just about everything. 7. she is one of the nicest people i know. 6. everyone loves her. (and everyone who doesn't must  die .) 5. she has a nice laugh. 4. she makes amazing nicknames for people. 3. she has an amazing personality. 2. she doesn't put people down. 1. she invented "woor." enough said.  k so that was my list... p.s. i didn't spell her last name wrong. woor.

(note the  not !"-nikole.  ahaha i laughed.  ok so no quotes from today... minus the ones that happened avec sofija. but there are just  way  too many. so you don't get to see them. nananabooboo. k i'm done now.  normally, i would write my poem thing that i wrote in here... but since i'm too lazy/it's upstairs, i'm not going to. that shall be for another time, kids.  so my plans for this weekend=going to vanessa's house tomorrow night to watch europtrip, prolly with lana and erblina, if everything goes as planned. and theeeeen on saturday i want to go shopping (still waiting for someone to come with me... any takers?), and then i'll prolly go to vanessa's house  yet again  on saturday. me+vanessa=lovers... times 2.  k well i'm outtie now.  paice.  kayte.
