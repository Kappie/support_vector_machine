"dont take life too seriously, youll never get out alive"-bugs bunny. sorry, giving oscar wilde a little too much credit i guess.  i dont know if i agree with that quote or not... i prefer something like "life is what you make of it. live each moment fully. breathe deeply. sing loudly. write in italics. love with all your heart. " or something. just made that up. i dunno  gotta go finish india reading and evnetually sleep...  i mean:  gotta go finish india reading and evetually sleep...   living life fully and writing in italics, amanda.
