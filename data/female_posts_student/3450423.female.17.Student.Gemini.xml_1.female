He must have known we’d need to share The joy of “little things” In order to appreciate The happiness life brings.  I think he knew our troubled hearts  Would sometimes throb with pain, At trials and misfourtunes, Or goals we can’t attain.  He knew we’d need the comfort Of an understanding heart To give us strength and courage To make a fresh, new start.  He knew we’d need companionship, Unselfish…lasting…true, And so god answered  The heart’s great need With Cherished Friends… like you!
