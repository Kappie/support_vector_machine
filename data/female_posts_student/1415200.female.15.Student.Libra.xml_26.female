But when your givin an oppertunity to "escape" from them for a while, people eat it right up!  Finchaholic. Atariholic. Incuaholic. I'm a very "holic" person. I absoultly love the song "What it's like to burn," by Finch. It's amazing. The construction, Lyrics, Emotion, it's all amazing. I think I've been listing to it for 2 days straight. I've also been consumed by "Megalomanic" from Incubus. It's off of their new CD thats not out yet. Also, its like there old stuff, like a mix of Science, and Make Yourself.   I hope theres no snow on the ground for xmas. That way everyone is upset and it creates major chaos. Haha. What I wouldnt give to be able to make something go wrong.   I feel bad for the Fall From Betweeners. They didnt win battle of the bands last night at peabodys. I think their egos are damaged a little. Im still planning on seeing them for New Years Eve. I want to get a picture with the group and with the almighty Jon. He's a gorgeous man. It's one of the situations, where you can look but you cant touch, not only because he's taken, but because he wouldnt spend a second of his time with the likes of me.  Belive me, I do look.  Oh well. Im on my search for something, even though the lack for motivation, isnt any help. I guess eventually someone will show up for me. Eventually isnt soon enough.  I wish I had the power to take everything back, the right and the wrong decisions that Ive made, and make it all diffrent. I dunno. I want to move and become unknown. Im gonna go. Gotta go wrapup the fucking holidae shopping.
