The only thing left was a who-knows-who-they-are rock ban, which was singing so hard. On the side of street, there were so many bars and cute shops. Toshi and I went to buy some food and stopped by a really cute shop. Because we were eating, we didn't went in. After we finished the food, that shop was already closed!! It wasn't so much fun over there, but it is always good to take a night walk during the summer night.  urlLink     urlLink
