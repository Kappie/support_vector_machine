I did not get to sleep last night till after 6am. I slept in too late because of it. I jumped out of bed at 3:57pm and realized my mom would soon be at my house to pick me up and take me to rehearsal at 4. I ran downstairs and told my roommate to let my mom in, then ran back upstairs to jump in the shower.  Anyway I got to rehearsal and all was well. It was great because it worked out that after rehearsal I got to spend some time hanging out with my friend Steve. The great amount of sleep, a good rehearsal, and good times with Steve made it a great day.  I woke up hoping to buy some tickets to a Counting Crows concert. My beautiful friend Clare enlightened me that they will be playing a couple of shows in the LA area in a few months. I know there will be some of you that think or even yell out loud �Why in the hell would she want to see those whining men?� Well to answer those cries�I don�t feel I have to tell you, just know that they touch me and are my favorite band. My music tastes run in so many different directions, I feel it would be pointless to try and explain.  I looked into the concert and low and behold�the concert is in Irvine on MY BIRTHDAY! For those of you that are unaware, my birthday is July 18th and I will be 23 years of age. And for those of you who were unaware, this would be the perfect time to write it down and make plans to get me something great. So yes, I looked into getting the tickets, and both shows I could have bought tickets for were �sold out�. But my plans haven�t changed�I will see one of the shows and I will love it. I will do my best to make it happen.  I am also excited that my friend Sevag will fly into LA tomorrow. Hopefully I will see him sometime before the weekend. He is coming home from Air Force school in Texas. He will be in LA for 15 days then he is going to Florida for his first assignment. We will see how things pan out.  To keep all informed�I am still looking for a job, looking for a car, working on �Machinal� at the college, and trying to regain my life. I will keep you informed of any updates.
