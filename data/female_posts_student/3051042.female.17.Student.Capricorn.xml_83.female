We went to Jimmy John's, Pinball Pete's, and the Diag while we were in Ann Arbor. Fun stuff. I DDRed my ass off. "It's the solution to anyone's problems... Just dance until you pass out." I told Mike about my subtle ways of making myself completely fucked up without people noticing. I think he's worried... ah, oh well.  We visited Josh at McDonalds after we got back to Ypsi. We were headed toward Penisular Park and saw his car so we went through the drive-thru for milkshakes and said 'hi.'   Both Mike and I hadn't seen the second Kill Bill so we called for showtimes and headed to the 6:15 showing. "My loins are quivering in anticipation." lol. Great movie, and that's a lot coming from the girl that hates sequels.  Q gave me a call afterward so we ended up smoking out at his place. Good times. But Q was being really weird, well in my opinion. The random feeling up of foot behind a pillow and sitting on lap was really ... um... interesting? B was there and we chilled for awhile. Played some Soul Caliber, watched some funny shit. Both guys gave me hugs on the way out. Q has plans to hang with me tomorrow. I'm excited.  Speaking of tomorrow. Apparently... Henk and Nick are heading down tomorrow. Riiiight... Mike knows where I'm coming from here. Hmm...  I do have 3 hours of work tomorrow. That'll be hell. If I go in I'll just finish the filing and call it a day. I don't even care about getting my salary this week. I'm a lazy bitch.  DAMN! Kill Bill Vol 2 was sweet. Q and B were crazy about it too so it was great to discuss with people.   Anyway... I'm off to bed. G'night all.
