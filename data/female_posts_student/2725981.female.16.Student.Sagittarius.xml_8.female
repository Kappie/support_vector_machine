Before that, I lazed about for a month, and before that was swim team. I haven't played waterpolo since February. So we were all out of shape.  Our first tournement was today. I played 18 and unders, and it was my first time with a varsity team. The cool thing about it all was I learned a few things, and finally got to see Davis play.  The first two games were bad, 0-9 in both cases. It was hard, because we were all over the place, and were slower than the other teams. I guess everyone else at the whole freaking tournement had been practising for at least a month. So our coach wasn't too mad...but we did make a few mistakes, stupid mistakes.  I didn't get to play that much which is understandable with me being the only JV player and not really knowing the ropes yet. I was the only sub, and I feel bad because our team was exhausted.  The last game was awesome. We won, 5-4 and I made a clean beautiful shot. It was lucky though, I have to be honest. At least the refs were clean, and everything went by pretty smoothly. I got pretrty sunbured tho....I'll hurt tonight.  Dinner's calling...ciao
