She does a great job but besides the good I always notice the flaws in other women. Who knows why I just always have I consider that to be normal for me. This woman spends too much time in a tanning bed, you know people do when they are an abnormal color for a white person. Then she can tell she cakes on the foundation, this I don't understand... I think people look better without all the crap on their face rather than trying to cover up their flaws that are only made more noticeable by the make-up. Then she has a noticeably large ass. It doesn't necessarily look bad on HER but I wouldn't want it. My husband has many times commented on her ass being large yet I glanced up at him today when she walked by and he was looking at it. I had to giggle to myself but he noticed and demanded to know my amusement. Don't get me wrong I am not one of those jealous wives, there is nothing wrong with looking or even flirting a little as long as a person doesn't cross the line. I guess I have no point to all that I have said I just find it amusing. I think it is just a man thing. I guess if I don't think that something looks good I don't pay attention to it, I just look past it. Look for something better to look at. I just thought that someone besides me may get some humor out of this.
