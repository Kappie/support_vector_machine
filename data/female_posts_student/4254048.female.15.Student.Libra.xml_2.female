Eh, they don’t seem to recognize us? Odd, I dressed myself well for this too! It’s great here! Hello!! I am Shinhwa! Hmm, seems like no one knew us.  Narrator: They started singing, but people on the street still had no reaction. So they began playing with the Barbie. Hyesung was playing till the end, when all the members left, JunJin came back and wrapped his arm around the model.  JunJin: This is my girlfriend, say a greeting.  Minwoo: Hey! Hurry!!  Narrator: Japanese fans suddenly recognized them. Seeing the fans, JunJin and Minwoo began dancing.  Dongwan: I bought The Dog and LuckMan…lok, lok, lok. Inside is my heart for everyone. It’s for the people I love. (kiss from The Dog)  Hyesung: Let’s Go!  Narrator: What did you buy?  Hyesung: I bought 2 dolls… yes… dolls… for my girlfriend…I’m with Lee JiHoon…  Dongwan: What? What with JiHoon? What the heck?  Hyesung: You might not think that I am pitiful…but without a girlfriend… sigh… I’ll leave it for my future girlfriend…  Eric: I bought 2 cellphones  Hyesung: Tell us why you bought 2!  Eric: One for me, one for my girlfriend!  Hyesung: …bleh…  Minwoo bought hat, so did JunJin. Junjin is wearing the one he just bought and is using the camera to fix it. Junjin…the always energetic one.  JunJin: Japanese and Korean fans are similar but Jap fans are very mature, when they see us, they won’t scream or yell. They also dress differently.  Jin noticed something.  JunJin: the girl in front has cool hair.   -vifz
