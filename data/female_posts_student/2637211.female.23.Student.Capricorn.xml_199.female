I spent yesterday morning cutting class and freaking out that DVC hadn't received my request for my IGETC, I tried to call, and couldn't get through, so I finally sent an email asking what to do... but the response took long enough that I decided to leave for Pleasant Hill anyway. So I spent the drive freaking out and being nervous about what I needed to do, and the fact that I didn't know what the records people had to say about what I wanted. I drove into the DVC parking lot, felt a lot of deja vu from my 1.5 semesters there, and I couldn't get out of the car. I literally had a panic attack about being so unprepared and having to deal with people. I'd forgotten the address I needed to IGETC sent to, and I didn't even know what I really wanted, so it was an entirely bad scene. So I drove on to Oakland, berating myself for being such a spineless wimp.  But the day got better. Holly called, and the first thing she said was, "Are you sitting down?" I'm picturing something terrible, like Holly has VD or she's pregnant or something similarly full of personal crisis. But no, Holly isn't pregnant, it's her brother Ben's girlfriend, Monnie Rose, aka "the beast." I, in all of my sensitivity, burst out laughing when she tells me this. Oh, the ironic twists of fate, that both of us now have impending nieces or nephews from each of our siblings that are with the worst person on the planet for them. Why to all the people who shouldn't have kids get pregnant? It's called birth control, people. I've been having sex for years, and yet somehow, I've never been pregnant, I don't have a kid, so I feel like I can be self-righteous about judging people who are not as responsible as me.   I checked my email in Oakland, and got a response that they'd never received my letter of request, so I decided I'd just go in the morning on my way. Jerm had to get up early to take BART in a complicated series of rides so he can go to the airport tonight to see Jason, so I dropped him off down at Fruitvale, came home and got together my junk and headed back out to DVC. This time I got out of the car, armed with all of the information that I needed, and went straight to the admissions and records office, where they were very helpful, and I got my IGETC sent. Hooray! I might just graduate!   I raced to Davis, and barely made it to class on time, then I came home. I still have to go the pharmacy to get my pills (see, responsible about *not* getting pregnant!), which will probably set me back a bit, because I want to get the rest of my packs until November, because I probably won't have health insurance for a while next year. But after that, I'm thinking about getting off the pill and reexperiencing my own hormone levels again. After 5 years, I think it might be a novel experience. Back to good old condoms.
