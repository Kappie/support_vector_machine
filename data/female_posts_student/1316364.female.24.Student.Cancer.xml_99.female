The thing that bothers me though is that some of my friends aren’t there for me and what is even worse is the fact that it took getting me drunk for them to realize that I wasn’t as ok as I make everyone believe. I do have to say that the Lexapro that my doctor put me on has helped me deal with the depression and anxiety that comes along with this whole situation, and although I am usually against using medication to solve my problems, sometimes it’s the best route to a resolution. No one outside of my immediate family knows that I am on anti-depressants and if it ever came up in a conversation I would proudly say I am taking them. I am not ashamed that this is what I have resulted in doing to take care of myself during these hard times because some times talking it out doesn’t help. It’s just a quick fix and not more than 2 hours later you are wondering why you told this person everything you did. I know when I attended therapy sessions I opened myself up to my doctor and then afterwards would mentally beat myself up once I realized what I said to her about my family and friends. I guess looking back on it I felt that those things needed to come out because they were things that were eating at me but I couldn’t ever understand why I would confide my thoughts and feelings in a complete stranger, a doctor that all I knew about her was her name.  I guess with things happening the way they have these last few days, I feel like the medication isn’t working and that I would give anything to confide my deepest darkest secrets to that mystery doctor, for just a half an hour just to be able to talk to someone who wouldn’t judge me by my words, just to have a sense that someone was actually listening to me and my concerns.  I know if any of my friends happen to read this entry that will probably feel that I am using this as an opportunity to personally attack them, but that is not my point. I am just trying to use this as a way to compensate for the lack of communication/dialogue between live persons. I love my friends more then they probably realize but they have their own lives they have to take care of and I don’t expect them to be there for me 100%, I would never expect that, I just want to have an ear to listen to me when I need it, just like I have done for them in the past, several times.   Right now they can’t be here for me because they have their own things and I understand that, I guess I just wish that they didn’t.   I am wondering if I am being selfish about this whole thing.
