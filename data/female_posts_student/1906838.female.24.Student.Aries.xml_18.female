Henry dude, you have some really good shite in there!! now ive got me hooked on the likes of the cardigans, tori amos, fiona apple and the rest ... oh and this one from TLC ..  I Miss You So Much"  I never asked for this feeling  I never thought I would fall  I never knew how I felt  Till the day you were gone  I was lost  I never asked for red roses  I wasn't looking for love  Somehow I let my emotions take hold  And guess what all at once I'm in love  [Chorus:] Oh I miss you so much  I long for your love  It's scares me  Cuz my heart gets so weak  That I can't even breathe  How can you take things so easily  Baby why aren't you missing me?  Why did I act like you mattered It was silly of me to believe  That if I just opened my heart  Things would come naturally Jokes on me (yeah) I did not ask for love letters So why did you give them to me How could I let your intentions Get hold over me So in love So naive (oh baby)  [Chorus]  And oh how I hate what you have done  Made me fall so deep in love  Got no cure  You're the only one I want  That I love oh baby  [Chorus]  Baby why aren't you missing me?  Baby why aren't you missing me?
