You sound like Carter when she see's some new peice of tech.  Explain to me exactly how dying relatively quickly by noose is better than dying the long, slow, painful way of liver failure? From my experience...a bullet in the chest is the best way to go.  Gotta say the only God i believe in is "the Great God Oz."  Has Teal'c been sneaking Star Wars DVD's into the alpha site shipments again? He seems to think that all of his Jaffa buddies should see it at least four times.  I allways thought Grammar was spelt with an a..., not an e.  Simple pleasures please simple minds... (Hey, K, d'you know your name sounds like a martial arts? Karate, Judo, Kuronue...)
