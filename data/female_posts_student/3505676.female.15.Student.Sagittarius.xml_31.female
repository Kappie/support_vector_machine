However, driving in pouring rain is not fun!  I could hardly see in front of me.  Then at 2 i headed over to optimist, woohoo for being a cashier! There was like no one there cuz of the weather, then we hadta close for like an hour due to thunder, but hey, its all good! I wasnt TOO bored and im now great at saying 'Optimist pool, this is alison speaking' alison..ahh my full name freaks me out sometimes, makes me feel old n shit, but theres another "ally" so w/e! S'posed to work til 9, but like 5 pple were in the pool so most of us headed home.  So Brad left for the beach tonight along with a bunch of my other buds [but he'll be back by monday] and mccall's leaving for costa rica tmrw morning [how dare u leave for 3 weeks mccall] *boo on the lucky pple that get to escape raleigh* [altho i hafta admit this summer has rocked so far] Tmrw i hafta drive again, then work again! *haha* oh well as of monday..or prolly tuesday since my mom gets the afternoon off, i will have my PERMIT!! FINALLY! one advantage to working, i call home and ask for yummy food and they bring it! i got the panera that i missed out on yesterday! = D  Now i just hafta convince them that a i need a cell fone!!!
