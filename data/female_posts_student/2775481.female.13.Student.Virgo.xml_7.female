I got to sleep late today cause it was snowing and they didn't cancel school but my mom didn't want me to go on the bus with the roads like they were so I got to sleep late. ummm I pretty much spent the whole day on the phone and laying with my dog Noah. Yup this about it so I'll write back later bye
