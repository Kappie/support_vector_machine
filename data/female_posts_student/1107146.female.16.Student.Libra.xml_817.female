The other one is a visual thing, it involves finding a pattern and it's very pissy: everyone's laughing at you as you struggle to figure it out. Well, at least at me. Heh. We're having a war in Stout's class to find riddles or riddle like things to stump each other...and so far I haven't been beaten, har har har....ok, the vanity is over for now.  Have fun in...um, wherever you be going Linds. And peace to evruh'body.
