Went to see Troy with McCall! I thought it was pretty good, though i couldn't exactly hope for a happy ending and my "celeb soulmate" was a bit of a wimp! Now they can make the odyssey movie! Saw florian, eric, marie, and josh after the movie [[no, not all together!]] And now im home and being lazy while watching scream 2, for although it might be a horrible horror movie, it's perfect to pig out during! *thats ME!*  [mccall, my partner fatty]  troy=fight scene, choir music, fight scene, almost sex scene, fight, almost sex scene, enya-like music, repeated!
