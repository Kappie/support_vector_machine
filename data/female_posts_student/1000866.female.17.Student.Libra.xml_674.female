We flatter those we scarcely know, We please the fleeting guest, And deal full many a thoughtless blow To those who love us best.  So, I read this somewhere. I find it interesting and true for the most part, but how can one not hurt the ones he/she loves most when he/she is around them the most? And anyway, flattering those you don't know as well can work to your advantage. You pretty much know what you can get away with with your close friends. You know how far you can stretch the limits but with people you don't know as well, the possibilities are endless. I mean, I'm not saying take everyone you don't know for advantage. Just...explaining the little poem as I see it I suppose.
