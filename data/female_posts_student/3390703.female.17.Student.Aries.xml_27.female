I mean yes, they did go out for 3 to 4 months, but they never really talked and they weren't intimate!  They were just friends that happend to call each other boyfriend and girlfriend!    I finally have enough CapriSun packets to make my purse!  I'm excited!  I've been drinking and drinking and drinking and now I finally don't have to drink anymore because I have enough!  Tomorrow I have a chorus concert at 7 30 and everyone should be there because it is going to be ... interesting!  We're singing and dancing along to a Chicago medly, and it is going to suck!  We're also singing 3 Beatles songs, and we don't know the words to half of them!  SALLY GOT THE SOLO AND I'M SO PROUD OF HER!  She really deserved it!   Oh, Story ... So Sally tells Meghan that she got the solo and Meghan says "Well, I can't really be happy for you because I wanted to solo too!"  Wow, what a bitch!  She could have alteast pretended to be happy for Sally!  Words of Jackie, "Meghan acts like she is God's gift to music, and she isn't!"  It is so true!  Meghan doesn't want a future in music, she wants to be a doctor or something, so why does she care so much about being in Chorale and getting the solos?!  Grr, stupid people piss me off much!
