OH YEAH. last night i had a dream that i dyed my hair at this place... and they guy did my hair green. but the dye wasn't green enough so he added listerine.  GREEN listerine. -_-. really sometimes i wonder about me.  haha now i want to dye my hair though, not necessarily green but stiiill.  has anyone seen matt? i miss him.    this is a pointless entry i apologize for my retardedness
