I've been pretty darn good, spare a few goings about from last night. It's nice to know that the school year is winding down. It's nice to know that  high school  is winding down. This summer is going to be crazy--in the sense that I won't be preparing for and awaiting another shitty grade. I'll instead be awaiting my college life, my adult life, my life all together. Scary, huh? I think I'll like the change of atmosphere. I think I'll love it, in fact.  Here's to a non-crappy summer.
