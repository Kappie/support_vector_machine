I used a brush from  urlLink 1greeneye.net  for the background, and I used a pic of Orlando Bloom that I cut myself. I been learning to cut stuff in ps, and so far I got like 6 pics of orlando cut... obsessive? I don't think so. He's hot :-P.   Other than that  I'm still sick. I didn't sleep at all last night. My mom was cool and let me have the day off school since I was feeling so crappy. That means double work tomorrow... argh. O well, at least this gave me time to work on some graphic stuff.    This was short  But it got the job done. I could probably make up some story about how oranges plan to take over the earth, but as I said, I'm tired and feel like crap so thats not gonna happen. Today. Anyways.    The oranges are coming!
