Huebby then askes Sarah the answer to whatever question he just asked, and she said that she didn't hear the question, and if he'd repeat it. He just looks at her and says "I don't repeat questions."  Yet, just a few minutes before that, Cody falls asleep on his desk, and Huebby askes him a question, he doesn't answer of course, duh, he's catching ZZZ's, so Huebby wakes him up, and what do you know, he's a nice guy...AND REPEATS THE QUESTION.  One of the many mysteries about Mr. Huebner and his freaky-deaky Geometry class.  We started Sex Ed in Healthy Lifestyles yesterday. Quite interesting. Especially when you are put in a group of perverted guys, and have to come up with a list of physical things someone does to express their sexuality. Answers ranged from "tap that all night long" to "wet fingers."  Sometimes I really think that I was put in the wrong grade or something. I honestly can't stand half of the sophomore class, and next year it's going to be murder having my grade in Varsity choir with me. I just might go on a rage and smack some people around in there. *Not a threat, just a joke*   TB didn't wear a bra today. Wow. At lunch we were all saying, "Brrr, it's cold in here.  What color of bra are you wearing?  Wouldn't it feel weird not to wear one? "  She's either deaf, or blind, or as smart as a brick wall.  I'm leaning towards the last one though.
