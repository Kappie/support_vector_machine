Israelis listen to an odd assortment of American music- one station plays everything from Usher's Yeah, Yeah to various Elvis hits to Travis' cover of Hit Me Baby One More Time.  And for some odd reason, Israeli music sounds a lot like Serbian music.    I slept a crazy amount yesterday.  From like 6:45-10, and then from 2:45am-11.  Ah well.  Guess I'm still catching up.  I only have a few more Bos from the UP layers to code, then I'm going to print some articles and go outside and read.  But I forgot my sunscreen.... hmm.  Guess I'll be freckly.  I was thinking about going downtown with Herve (the French version of Harvey), but I either missed him or he didn't bother coming in before he went out.  Okay, need to focus- just a few more bones to go!
