And Josh, what have I told you about the yankee stuff...Not on MY blog, boy.  You've got your own.  Well, now yall have met Michael, and yes, I know he's the greatest guy in the world...You don't have to tell me.  Josh, guess what this means??? You are being dumped by your pretend "girlfriend" so now you can get back to the beloved Leigh ( gay guy and all of the rest of your fan club.)  I better go get the rest of the group to come on here so Michael doesn't think that we're all like Josh.  Hee hee...Naw, I luv ya, Joah. (*Note to Michael, this is not a typo but an endearing term to refer to Josh.  Used frequently.)  Elizabeth, I haven't read the Gladiator thing yet, but I'm getting to it.  Rosie, yes, be assured Curran wants you there, but if you can't come, I guess I'll just go with Lumley I guess.  That could be interesting...  Anyway, I better be going.  I'll see yall later.  I love you, Michael.
