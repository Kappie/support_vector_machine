Of course I could do this by hand, but it would take several hours to re-calculate my entire GPA to weigh each different possibility.    The verdict: despite being royaly screwed by my freshman guidance couselor (she forced me to take a non-required unweighted course that I wasn't interested in at all while allowing my competitors to go ahead and take their required courses) I can still come out as first in my class of 450 by   0.00043   of a point. Seriously. I accomplish this by taking my required foreign language classes at the local community college at night for an additional 0.5 weight (not offered at the high school) and then taking on an AP course (for another 1 point weight) in the day schedule slots freed up by this. More work? Yes, but I get to triumph over injustice while setting a new record GPA for my school,  4.602941176 .

Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.  --Theodore Roosevelt
