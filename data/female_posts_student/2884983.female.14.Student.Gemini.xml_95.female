I cannot stand it...lol I love it :) I have wank running through my head at 100 mph! lol...I am going to put up a joke from funny.com only..they are all realy bad jokes...  Sometimes, teachers hear students say the funniest and most embarassing things.... I had an eighth grade class of rowdies one semester not long ago.  One boy in particular, named James Bate was very rough and big and tall for his age. He could be very intimidating to fellow classmates. He had a habit of threatening fellow students in an unusual way. For example, if a student would say something to harass him like, "James, you are so stupid." James would reply with "I'll stupid you!" in his most threatening loud voice.  One day, another boy named Josh decided to upset James by using his last name in an offensive manner. Josh taunted, "Master Bate...Master Bate." And true to his style James replied in his most boisterous loud voice for all of the room to hear, "I'll Master Bate you!"  Not only did James turn red as he realized what he had yelled, but, the boy who decided to taunt him turned equally red. After that, I didn't hear anymore wisecracks out of either boy.  he he he...I like it. and it isnt even that rude! wow! thats a very very mild joke compared to the other ones...lol like the one I just read, a revision of a whole bunch of childrens rhymes. - Despite the many rat infested slums in New York City, only 311 people are bitten by rats in an average year. But 1,519 residents are bitten annually by other New Yorkers.... - The liver, not the heart, is the sign of romance in northern Morocco.... When a Moroccan girl falls in love she says, "Darling, you have stolen my liver." - The world's greatest lover was King Mongut of Siam. He had 9,000 wives.... Before dying of syphilis he was quoted as saying he only loved the first 700.... :)
