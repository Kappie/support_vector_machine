I understand that the song wouldn’t have been as big of a hit if it had been titled “Doesn’t It Suck?” and the rhyme scheme would have to be altered, but at least it wouldn’t be misinforming millions of young people about the definition of irony.  Now  urlLink this  is real irony:  Dallas City Councilwoman Elba Garcia was one of several council members to vocally support switching many of the police and fire departments' vehicles to electric/gas hybrids.  Ideally, this switch would save the city hundreds of thousands of dollars in gasoline costs as well as reduce emissions from the older vehicles.  The city was quite eager to integrate the hybrids into the departments' fleets, and did so despite some valid concerns about the performance of the new vehicles.  Many police officers voiced complaints about the acceleration abilities of the hybrids, as well as a lack of reputable and/or accessible maintenance providers.  The council agreed that these concerns were not more important than saving a few bucks and appearing environmentally friendly, and the DPD and DFD now drive hybrid cars and trucks.  And Elba Garcia, Dallas's environmentally-concerned, fiscally responsible public servant, has a gigantic Humvee parked in her driveway.    That, my friends, doesn't just suck. It is ironic.
