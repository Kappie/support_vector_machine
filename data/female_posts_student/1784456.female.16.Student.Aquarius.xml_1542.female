Wohooo! *Stupid globalisation* Hmm... but is it better than anarchy though? In Russia one of my friends was trying to convinse me that anarchism is good... we have a big argument, fun! Anarchy is based on the idea that people don't go out and kill, rape, steal. Let's face it, if that didn't work for the Vikings, Stone age people etc. why's it gonna work now? And how come we've evolved to be like this, a non-anarchy society. I don't wanna devolise! From human to fish... nasty.
