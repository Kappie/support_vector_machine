Pray that I use my brain, guys...  Oh, if I have time, I may go CD shopping sometime before Wednesday so I'll have something fresh and new to listen to on the trip...  Even though you guys have no idea what's in my CD collection now, I want suggestions :-) Who knows, maybe I'll unearth some CDs I have already (just not listened to in a while) and give them a spin...
