Exams: 2 days.  mmm, immunities.   ---------- I got off work early which is awesome and I've been studying on and off outside and its such a beautiful day.. Im still not sure if I know enough to pass ancient history but honestly as long as I get above 50% on the exam I will be happy.  I went running last night for the first time in a long time, and it felt great. I know I wont do it, but I really should start running more. Like every 2nd day would be good. I may just do that! [I lie.]  Im wearing arics shorts again, they have gotta be the best shorts in the world. Well almost.. so yes they are now mine. ...Man I have to pee.  Jess and Alyson visited me at work today which was wonderful, and I convinced them to buy me a iced cappuchino from Tims. And Byron gave me candy.. what a funny old man.  I have to restring my acoustic and play it would be good, since I havent picked up a guitar for about a week. Its killing me, not so softly.  Well Im going swinging with Lauren so I must study till then! Later dudes.  PS- Lydia on Wednesday you are  MINE .
