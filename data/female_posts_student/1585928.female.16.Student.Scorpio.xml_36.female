Cause with you I can let my hair down  I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you  With you Now that I'm with you  You speak and it's like a song And just like that all my walls come down It's like a private joke just meant for us to know I relate to you naturally Everybody else just fades away Sometimes it's hard to breathe Just knowing you found me Cuz I'm still thinking about it almost forgot what it was like Do you know what it feels like? Cause with you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you With you  Come and take me Love you save me Like nobody else Now I can be myself With you  With you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now (Baby as I do now) Now that I'm with you     Artist : J-Kwon Title : Tipsy    	Intro: Teen drinking is very bad. Yo I got a fake ID though. Yeeah, yeeah, yeeah, 2 step with me, 2 step with me.  Verse 1: 1, here comes the 2 to the 3 to the 4, Everybody drunk out on the dance floor, Babygirl ass jiggle like she want more, Like she a groupie and I aint even on tour, Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore, Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores, Bottom of the 9th and a nigga gotta score, If not i gotta move on to the next floor, Here comes the 3 to the 2 to the 1, Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun, When it come to pop man we do shit for fun, You aint got one nigga you betta run, Now i'm in the back gettin head from my hunz, While she goin down i'm breakin down what i done, She smokin my stuff sayin she aint havin fun, Bitch give it back now you don't get none.  Chorus: Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Now everybody in the club gettin tipsy, Everybody in the club gettin tipsy.  Verse 2: 2, here comes the 3 to the 4 to the 5, Now i'm lookin at shorty right in the eyes, Couple seconds passed now i'm lookin at her thighs, While she tellin me how much she hate her guy, Said she got a kid but she got her tubes tied, If you 21 girl that's alright, I wonder if a shake comin with them fries, If so baby can i get em super sized, Here comes the 4 to the 3 to the 2, She started feelin on my johnson right out the blue, Girl you super thick so i'm thinkin that's kool, But instead of 1 lifefab i need 2 Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels, Expression on her face like she aint got a clue, And she told me she don't run with a crew, You know how i do but i guess one gotta do.  --Chorus--  Verse 3: 3, here comes the 4 to the 5 to the 6, Self explanatory I ain't gotta say i'm rich, This single man aint tryna get hitched, Nigga waste it on me man son of a bitch, Brushed it all off now i'm back to gettin lit, Grisa orange juice man this some good ish, Homeboy trippin cause i'm starin at his chick, Now he on the sideline starin at my clique, Here comes the 5 to the 4 to the 3, Hands in the air if you thugs drunk as me, Club on the set kwon cut out them ......., Dude i don't care i'm a p.i.m.p.  --Chorus--
