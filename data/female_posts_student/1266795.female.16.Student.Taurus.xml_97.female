I hid my eyes during the battle scenes in Troy (yeah, I'm a wuss), but I thought the characters were very interesting, and of course there was the only reason I agreed to go see it in the first place: Orlando Bloom (and Brad Pitt, but I am partial to Orlando). hehehe Wow, they WORKED OUT for that movie. It sure beat trying to read The Iliad! Did anyone else notice that they just happened to take that off the summer reading list the year AFTER we (Lyceum people) read it? Hmph.  Harry Potter was great! I liked it the best out of the three movies so far. As all the reviews have been saying, it's darker, but then again, the third book is darker than the first two, so it's not like that was an element that was only added to the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, when you do, watch for the singing frogs! :o)  I got my hair cut yesterday -- my annual "summer chop," as I call it. The hairdresser cut it about to my shoulders, but since it's so curly it looks shorter. I like it, though it's at its cutest after it's been washed, and I'll never have time to shower in the morning. Oh well.  Tomorrow I start the Performing Arts Institute at LC. I'm taking three classes: Broadway, solo voice, and vocal jazz a cappella. I'm excited!! Hopefully the other kids will be just as into music as I am, so we won't feel awkward about performing around each other. Oh, in case you're wondering, those classes are only an hour each, so I'll be at the PA Institute from 10-1 on weekday mornings until early July. Don't worry, I'm not leaving now!  Hope this is interesting enough for you, Sarah! ;-)  "I never tire of being useful."
