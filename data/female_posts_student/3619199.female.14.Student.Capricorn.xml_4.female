I mean, who was the first person to say "I'm going to squeeze these thing-y's on this here cow, and drink what comes out", they must have been really bored, but they discovered MILK! That reminds me, i hate milk.  Anyway something is really bothering me. I've been getting a lot of pop-ups lately and they have all been about the following: Viagra Dating Advertisments The Atkins Diet Polls on how long J.lo's marriage will last and links to get porn I'm starting to think the internet revolves around sex. Maybe it's the  world  that revolves around it, but why? Everywhere you look there are online dating services and websites on how to get laid. And god only knows how many porn sites there are! I really don't understand the whole "porn" thing. I've never been on xxx site before, but i get the occasional online ad. I don't see the point really. What, do you just jack-off to the sight of naked woman and men touching each other? Well I guess everyone needs a sexlife, even if it is with themselves. But why does it seem like so many people are addicted to sex? Maybe it's me, but I can't help but think that sex is a drug. It actually seems like everyone is doing it except me. I'll probably be the worlds last virgin (next to Carrot top on the 1-800-ATT commercials). But that the least of my worries. Anyway, it seems like nowadays everyone is counting carbs or starting fad diets. Everyone is so obsessed with what they look like (it seems like it's always been that way). Every soda now comes in "diet", and there are more "makeover" shows than ever. Now, that's not a bad thing, but it's not a totally good thing either. It seems like the people (mostly women) who get on these "diets", don't wanna be healthy, but want to be a carbon copy of a victoria secret model.  What I'm saying isn't anything new, but it's not getting old anytime soon.  Whoa, this is turning out to be longer than I expected it to be. I'll stop preachin' now, I must be really bored.  To bad I don't live on a farm, I feel like milkin' something. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
