Something had to be wrong for her to call.  And in spite of the pep-talks and three pages of writing I'd just done on the subject, I desperately wanted it to be her.  It was my brother.  He needed my plunger. After he left, I couldn't escape that feeling.  The feeling that this is going to take longer than a few weeks.  The feeling that this is going to be harder than just fighting off the urge to call to check in.  Then that damn "Only Freshmen" song came on and I had no choice but to turn it up.   Got to school nice and early on account of not having Property class this morning.  Double checked my citations in the infamous paper and discovered two were wrong.  Not to fear, I'd brought a back-up disk.  Funny thing:  12 pages in Word Perfect equals 12 pages and 3 lines in Word. It should be mentioned that I got perhaps 6 hours of interrupted sleep last night and am feeling a bit jittery from the combination of coffee and cough syrup.   After trimming and fighting with the Insert Page Number feature of that wonderful word processing program, I finally turned in the paper I've had done since goddamned Saturday.  Thought I could collect myself at my computer, read a blog or two, get geared up for the big week before the big break before the big finals.  Starting to feel the pressure/stress/nerves of those exams.  Feeling like I've got 3 weeks to pull 4 months' worth of material together into a congizable form.  It's probably just the usual cold-induced emotional wax/wane thing.   And then I felt like a self-indulgent shit when I read Dave's blog.  Dave, I'm sorry.  There's really nothing else I can think of to say, except that I'm sending you thoughts of strength, comfort and love.  ...And it's not even 10 a.m.
