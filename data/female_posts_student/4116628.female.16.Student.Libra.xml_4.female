I really love this song! :) hmm... today's the 8th of August... This is my friend Em's birthday... well... I still consider her my friend, but we've lost contact. It's funny though cause we both live in the same state, Rhode Island (the smallest state in the country at that) yet, we haven't talked or anything. I think times had been really hard on the both of us, cause we both had to do some moving. I wonder what she's up to. *shrugs* I bet I'll cross her path one day or she in mine.       What happened today... not much really. I spent every other hour reading the book "My Antonia" I'm on page 132 and there's 27oish pages. So yeah I have a ways to go. I'm planning on reading a lot more tonight and maybe finishing the book tomorrow because I want to stop by the library to get the book I have on hold. Um... no, this isn't all pleasure reading, I have to do it for school. I did do some pleasure reading this summer though. I read this book called "Demon In My View" good book, I liked it. I liked it so much I read it under 2 hours. Woo hoo for me! :)      Let's see... anything else? I talked to my mom. She's visiting some time near the end of the month so that's cool. School starting soon... like 23ish more days... I CAN'T WAIT! well... actually a part of me can't but another part is dreading it. *shrugs* New school... new people... It's funny because I'm not worried about the teachers, work, students... just... god I hope I find a good place to sit for lunch. Last year I did the mistake of sitting at an empty table and allowing a girl to sit across from me. *shakes off building frustrations from remembering the past* to make the long story short, that girl ended up being the girl noone liked and she stuck on to me like a leech. I'm not the type of person to push people away so I never told her to bug off! I've learned my lesson though. I'm not being mean I swear! She was annoying!!! Always wanting sympathy or people feeling sorry for her, she always looked down on me too like I was less than her while everyone else is keeping their distance from her. grr... *shakes off frustration once again* ok, I'm good. :)
