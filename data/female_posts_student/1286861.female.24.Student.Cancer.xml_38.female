With the security on these computers and the restrictions on what internet sites I can access, I am lucky when it actually loads the Blogger site. Sometimes it won't let me.  Everything is doing good. Working myself to the bone. I am very happy with Pete and the way the work enviornment is changing around here. There actually may be light at the end of this tunnel.   I am in love. And it is wonderful. I am really excited about this weekend. I am getting time off of work and  urlLink Brenden  and I are going to a party at one of his friends houses. I am very much needing some time off and some fun. Not to mention how happy seeing  urlLink Brenden   makes me. It makes me happy.  Happy happy happy.  And I am nervous too! Not only about meeting more of his friends, but meeting his family on Thanksgiving. We are going to Nevada where I will meet his parents. I wont meet his older brother Tom (his only sibling) untill December at another party.   Nervous nervous nervous.  Thats about it for now. I should probably get back to work. Probably. Even if I get off the computer, I may not work anyway. I will leave that to be decided at the proper time.
