No one bites back as hard On their anger None of my pain woe Can show through  But my dreams they aren't as empty As my conscious seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free  No one knows what its like To be mistreated, to be defeated Behind blue eyes No one knows how to say That they're sorry and don't worry I'm not telling lies  But my dreams they aren't as empty As my conscious seems to be I have hours, only lonely My love is vengeance That's never free  No one knows what its like To be the bad man to be the sad man Behind blue eyes. - Behind Blue Eyes   Don't know who wrote the song but its awesome.  I was driving home tonight, in the darkness of back roads and the silence of my tears when it came on the radio.  The sound filled my car, filled my mind and just won't let go.  Its so easy to fall into the trap of believing that you are alone, that no one has ever been through it.  Its a lie that I like to believe, that part of me has to believe.  Theres too much there for one person to handle, certainly too much for it too be a common occurance.  If it is, what does that say about this world and the realms beyond?
