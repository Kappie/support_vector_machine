I never really knew Eraser very well but he seemed like a good, trustworthy and honest fellow.  I knew his cousin, who now resides in my blue pencil case.  Eraser was a dependent fellow.  You could always count on him to erase mistakes for you.  He always left a clean mark on the page, not streaks of black.  He always cleaned up his shavings by himself too.  He was a good man.  He washed every day and made friends with all his other buddies who shared a pencil case with him.  Sadly, he was ripped to pieces by Dana and his remains are now buried and kept in her compass bag.  Poor Eraser.  We shall remember him forever.  His purpose, his salute, his shavings...
