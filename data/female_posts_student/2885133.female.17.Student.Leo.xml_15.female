It might be problematic since I depend on the university tran to take me to class from my internship . . . public transportation ruling how much my teacher will like me. Not too comforting, especially since I got lost three days trying to get to the fine arts section of uni and getting back to the lab. Walking in swirlies is not fun when the temperature is over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  In the afternoon, I had to sit through 3 hours of lab safety lecture. Grr, it's was all common sense. I almost fell asleep. Speaking of which, that's what I am doing right now.
