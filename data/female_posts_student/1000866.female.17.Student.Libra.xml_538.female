My other New Year's resolutions are really difficult as well, but those...I expected to be tough. I have a, "focus" now. Hah. So, we shall see, we shall see.  I'm kind of...excited to go back to school Monday. Just slightly though. No classes except for bowling. I just want to see people.   Wheee. I think I shall go further my edumucation...edumication? Ah, who knows and furthermore, who cares?
