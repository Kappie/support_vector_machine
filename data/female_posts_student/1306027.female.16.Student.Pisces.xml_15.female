Do they know how much the tuition for Harvard summer school is!? O ya... and there's the car insurance and I need a kick-bootay camera for photography class. GrRrRrRrRrRrRr. But I'm not dissin the state- I mean they have to make rules... that's their job right? Whatever.   All this is not why work sucks though, work sucks because well, people suck. Not all people, just some people. More specifically: Fresh Lady. I know people like things to be fresh, but this goes beyond being a pain in the buttox. First Offence: asks to taste the chicken and tuna salad.. tells me that they both are horribly disgusting and demands I get a "fresh spoon". Second Offence: Gets nasty with Amy after asking which bread (white or wheat) was fresher. Third Offence: Yells at ash for not making the sandwich to her exact standards. Is Ashley frikin clairvoyant?? NO.. that lady needs to make her own sandwiches. Next time she'll prolly say the ham isn't sliced thin enough. Jeeze.  Apart from work sucking.. I have a dance recital tonight (enter the blue sparkly spandex costume). I just hope I don't trip or do something incredibly stupid or embarrassing. Ha.. to late. Eminent Doom Looms... I may write after the recital to recall events.   Exact countdown: 2 hours 49 minz. O gee can't wait.
