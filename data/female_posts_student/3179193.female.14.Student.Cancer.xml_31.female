Whatever. But Martin's computer's internet connected was screwed so I switched to another computer.  Stuffed animal day! :D Hee hee~ I took Nemo (the doggy I got from Nima at Christmas) to school and Nima gave me the doberman I had wanted at Wonderland. I named it Nima. Hee hee~ It's sooo cute and fuzzy! :) I still like the actual Nima better though (aka Best Guitarist In The World/Perfect One)!   So Nima, if you're reading this... THANKS! Love ya~!  Martin got Sonia stuffed animals too. A polar bear and a silver dolphin, if I remember correctly. He told me when he came home from PCW~ I bet she likes 'em a lot. Hee hee! I miss him. :( Even though he's just a few seats away. *sniff sniffzZ*  Julie and I talked to Rodway and she said that she had good news for one and bad news for the other. Good news was that Julie was coming to Coach B with Rach and the others and bad news was that I can't go to Coach A with Nima and that Gula was going instead. I'll miss him! I mean, a boring bus ride for almost 5 hours without Nima?! That's like telling me to commit suicide! Nooo! Haha... Well, at least he'll have fun with his friends over there on Coach A. His best friends Mark and Alice are there too so yeah. My best friends are all on Coach A. *sniff sniffzZ* Moca, Erica, Nima... and all those cool dudees.   *sighzZ* This succckkkksss~ Blah... I wanna bring Nima (the doberman) on the trip too on the bus with me but I don't know if my mommy will let me. I don't like leaving him on the bus but I wanna have him in my arms while we go, so yeah.   Phew... Still at least 20 minutes until lunch time! I'm hungry! Mommy said that she'll make potatoes for lunch today! Hee hee! Yummy! But I'm siiiicccckkkk! :( I have a cooouuuuugh! NooooOOOOooooOOOOOooo~!   I miss him. Nima, I mean. Boohoo~~~! He's over theerrreee ----> but he's like... busy. He had his headphones on the last time I looked. Hee hee~ He looks cute with headphones on! Muahahaha!  Obsessing on my blog. Haha! I'm such a freak!  So yeah... well my fingers are tired from typing... weird keyboards aren't helping. I like the one I have at home better. Oh wellzZ~! Love y'all! Peace! XOXO~
