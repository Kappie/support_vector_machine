Only Charlotte and Eileen turned up.  Charlotte didn't develop the photos.  She felt it was a waste.  I agree.  But I don't blame her.  She took a picture of us, Leonard and his baby girl at the old St. Clare Hall where we had our buffet.  Guess her name!  Natalie!  I'm not joking.  At first, when he said it, Charlotte and I thought he was joking, considering the way he conducts his classes.    Charlotte brought her camera today.  I wanted to bring mine last night but thought otherwise.  What a waste!  But I totally forgot about her camera as I was rushing to the piety shop.  Anyway, Charlotte had to see Vera to correct her name on her cert.  It was spelt as "Charlette".  I only know it was on the 3rd level and asked a lady who approached me for directions.  She pointed to a dark corner but I couldn't see anything.  I was so blur.  She said, “Aiyah, you won’t get lost one”.  I finally found it. When I closed the wooden doors behind me and took in the surroundings, I felt unusually peaceful.  There was a soothing scent.  I really like the place and look forward to going there again.         The 3 photos of my confirmation showed me, the archbishop and Vera, my new godmum aka one of my 3 cathechism teachers.  2 of them.  Anne Chong, my original godmother had moved out many years ago and we lost contact with her.  The other one was my class photo.  I was not looking in the camera's direction because there were 2 photographers.  But most of my classmates were looking at the  correct  photographer.  Now, how did they  know ?
