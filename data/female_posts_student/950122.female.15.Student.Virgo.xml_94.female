Anyway, the flight back from Honolulu was horribly tiring. We were delayed an hour, because the plane wouldn't fly. O_o After 7 hours, we arrived in Narita Airport. We saw former president Ramos there. =P I wanted to stay longer there, but nay, we had to go home. I missed it much.  On to spy-ware... I hate the horrid things. Trojans, key-loggers, hackers. Gah. I'd chop their hands off at the chance. *chop chop chop* XD
