Diane, where are you, oh guru of the blogskin?  2. Last night I watched American Idol and was extremely disappointed in America's voting choices.  Why in the hell was LaToya in the bottom 3?!  Is it because everyone assumes everyone else is going to vote for her so you give your vote to someone like John Stevens or Camille?  I think John is so sweet, but he's not very versatile.  Neither is Camille.  She has a weak voice, but then again that never stopped Janet Jackson from being a star...    Now, ok so I didnt vote for anyone.  Sue me.  I just hate having to vote for all these different people.  Why cant we just vote for who we DONT want.  Is that so difficult, people?!  How much more money would they lose?  The only thing they charge for is the text-messaging thingy, but really, how many people vote using text messaging?  It takes too long!  SIIIGGGH.  So anyway, Amy is gone.  I think it was the hair that did it.  She can sing, so it must be the hair!  But it seems that everyone with pink hair has never gone past a few weeks on A.I.  Yup Yup.  But I digress.  From what, I dont know...  3. Who saw 24?! Questions:    3a. Please tell me why President Palmer is annoyed with Sherry when he KNEW she was a crazy beeyotch?  Isn't that why he called her in the first place?  To 'take care of things'?      3b. Is not giving someone their pills while watching them have a fatal heart attack... is that murder?  I dont think so...    3c. Am I the only one who can help but not take Gael seriously because Jesse Borrego was        i.) on Fame        ii.) a transvestite in I Like It Like That and        iii.) has a funny hairstyle?  4. Saw "Something's Got to Give" last night.  Steve kept going "EWW, OLD PEOPLE KISSING!  EWWW OLD PEOPLE HAVING SEX! EWW JACK NICHOLSON'S ASS!"  but overall it was a cute movie.  I think it could have ended better, like Jack ends up with no one but this is a big Hollywood movie so of course Jack gets the girl.  5. No school for a week and a half!  YAAAY!  I was so proud of myself yesterday in class, I kept shouting out the CORRECT answer to things (a feat for me in this class)!  I think Profesora likes me.  Schweet...   - For those who dont know me, I'm taking Spanish 321 - Spanish Grammar and Usage...or what I lovingly refer to as THE SPANISH CLASS FROM HELL.  It's a more advanced Spanish class than what I'm really supposed to be taking because its the ONLY thing I need to graduate and the class I'm really supposed to take was only offered during the day.  So I begged and pleaded for the Dean to put me in the CLASS FROM HELL so that I may graduate this year.  Ok, sure I'm Dominican, but I really dont speak Spanish very well and never learned it as a kid.  Now I'm working on problems with Spanish grammar and usage.  I'm learning shit that I dont even know in ENGLISH!  Oh, and did I mention the class is taught entirely in Spanish.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  Riiiiight.  I'm actually surprised at how much I actually understand the teacher.  Maybe I'm getting used to her.  3 or 4 people have dropped the class so far, but I'm still there.  Hey, that's commendable!  [patting myself on the back]  6. Called my mother last night and she was mad shady to me.  Maybe its because she's tired, but what the heck did  I  do? Sheesh.  My brother took the phone from her and was like, 'Mommy's actin' up, yo.  Dont listen to her.' So I hung up.  Lets see how long it takes for her to call me and act like it never happened.  Seriously, she's frickin' weird.    7. Saw my granny.  She doesnt look well, but she's still going, which is cool.  Hopefully she'll go home today. She likes being home.  I think I take after her.  8. I debated sharing this but its too cute/sweet not to.  This morning when I got to the car there was a card taped to the steering wheel.  It was a little lovey dovey card from my cutie patootie saying (paraphrasing) 'chin up, I love you and always will' What-what?!  Pffft.  That's right, I have the best hubby on the planet.  YAY, ME!
