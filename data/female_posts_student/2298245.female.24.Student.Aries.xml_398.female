Particularly at the end of the third movie and I was curious if that was deliberate, or like how the fourth movie will be, especially because there's going to be a new director.  AC: Well, yeah, what happened is that you have to discriminate a lot when you are doing an adaptation. And we decided to just adapt everything that was relevant to the theme of a kid growing into a teenager. And pretty much we had to leave everything else, whatever didn't stick to that theme, we had to let it go. And that was one of those things. And yes, I know, it's setting up for the fourth one, but in the fourth one they are taking elements of the third to do the set up for the fourth.   I find the question to be odd, because I thought that of the many things left out of the movie, this was not one of the problem areas.  I mean, the most important bit of foreshadowing from the book, i.e. Professor Trelawney's prediction, actually remains in the book.  Now, those of you who have a clue what I'm talking about will note that this is actually a prediction of the end of the third book, but it is directly relevant to the fourth and is referenced therein.    I also find it odd that some things left out of the third one will be added to the fourth one, since it is a much longer book and as such there is going to be even more trouble fitting everything in.  Though, honestly, as the fourth is my least favorite, I say snip away at the story.  There are parts of it that I want to skip when reading it.  I guess my only qualm here is that, again (not to beat a dead horse) the movie went way too fast and things were unnecessarily left out.  Ultimately, I guess I disagree with the theme that Cuaron chose to focus on for the film, that of Harry's turning into a teenager.  I think that this is indeed an important theme in the book, but I do not think that it is the most important one.  If anything, this is a more important part of the later books, and I hope that those films do not end up going the same route.    But then again, what do I know about it?  I'm a law student, not a film director.
