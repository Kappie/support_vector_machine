Today..well to really know me you would have to know this boy named diante...whom i am unforteantly utterly in love with...for about two years. There has been an unbelievable amount of drama, crying, broken hearts and so on between the two years of us. Well so we had evrything going great and then all the sudden thign hit a brick wall..like a million mile brick wall, for nothing in this world can blow down that wall...I cried to him last night telling him how much i cared for him and wanted things to work out....his responce...I am tired! WTF!!!! I was so pissed so i hung up..talked to him today on the internet and he says he needs time..i am nto the girl to sit around and wait...hey it has been two years..don't you think he would know by now if he cares about me and wants to be with me....i think ashlee simpson put it best " these are times when i realise i am 19 and a girl" well i am not 19 but i feel that way! Hey i am just a dumb girl what do i know! Well i have a million urges to call this boy but i am not going to..i will be strong! My best friend is helping me out and we are not going to get down..cause we are wonderful girls and no need for boys right.....Hey there is always the option of being a nun!!Well i have high hopes for tommorow....cheer and working out...everythign should be great
