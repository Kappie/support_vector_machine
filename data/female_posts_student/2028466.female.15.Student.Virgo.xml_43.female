Hands so stead,  he so willing ever ready, love so filling. It's all just a memory. Full of knowledge so much to know he went to college I knew he would go. He spoke to me, words worth a lot words kind and loving full of thought, always sriving, It's all just a memory. "Live well," he first said "Laugh often," were one of the best "Love much - " I wish he wern't dead but he passed Heaven's test It's all just a memory. Every day I heed hsi words, every day I miss him, every day I watch the birds, oh how I miss him... It's all just a memory.   okay, no one has died in my family (Cept my great grandma, hehe) so dont worry. i jus wrote this poem cuz i read a book that had a boy who's brother died, and yea, so i thought that would be a good poem, lol, and i like the saying, "Live well, Laugh often, Love much." ehe
