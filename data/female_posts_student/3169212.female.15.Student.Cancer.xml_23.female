Well, first, I figured that maybe a demon year was shorter than a human year. That was immediately shunned due to the fact that I don't know how Yoshihiro Togashi thinks.      Then I figured that maybe she came into the human world just recently, but I didn't think that would leave much room for a plot.      Finally, I thought, "Hey, I don't need to change Dais! I can change her mother."      So, I decided that her mother had died centuries before Dais came to the human world and was reincarnated in the human world.      Then, it kind of takes on a Suichi Minamino story.      *winks*      Kurama: That's a creative way of fixing the problem.      Were you really dreaming of giant, space spiders?      Baka: Ha... *scratches back of head*
