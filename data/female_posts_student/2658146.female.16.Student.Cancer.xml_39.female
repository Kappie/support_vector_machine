And, on a side note, Sev is better. He's nicer. Well, in general he's a better person. And modest. Modesty is good. And he's more open to his feelings. No angsty "I don't love anyone" crap.  I really want to rant about that, but I don't have any words for it right now. Stupid lack of ability to blog...   Current Mood:  Flirty
