As usual I built myself up to become bubbling over with excitement before I went, so as it would usually be the experience would not be as good as the idea of it. However this time, my usual experience with times I look forward to wasn't the same. I had a better time than I had imagined I would.  Usually the experience I have at festivals goes somewhat like this. Get there, set up tent, get completely plastered on anything available, come home with no real memories of what happened; only a vague idea that at some point during the weekend I managed to get a little sleep, and was possibly stood in a crowd watching a band.  This time was different. Although not without intoxicants ( including a very special Dutch beer called Oranjeboom, try it, if the name doesn't suggest enough to you the after-taste certainly should), I was actually in the right mind to be able to really enjoy the bands I saw. Especially David Bowie, who is still looking foxy at his age and who was completely amaxing!  So now I'm sat at home, very tired, wishing that i was somewhere else and that the fun would never end!!
