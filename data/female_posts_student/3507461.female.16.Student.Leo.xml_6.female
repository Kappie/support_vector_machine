He picked me up around 3:30 and brought me back to his house and when I first got there he was being obnoxious, haha JK but then ordered a pizza, and ate, then went outside and played soccer.  He tried to get the ball past me but i'm just too good of a goalie!  Haha then we came back inside and played 3 games of pool and i won 2 and then we were too tired to play the 3rd so we just went upstairs and he fell asleep and then I cleaned his room!  Awww aren't I so nice! :) haha well yeah that was pretty much the best part of my dayyy.  I'll write more later.  Cubs better win.  Byeee!
