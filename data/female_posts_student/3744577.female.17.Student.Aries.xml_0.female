Last weekend all my friends and me went to Westport to celebrate my friend Ross's birthday. Well, we scored three handles of alchol (THANKS JENN)and we just started to drink and drink like all night long.  I know that sounds stupid to some people, but we are young stupid kids and we like to drink a lot and see what happens. We were safe about no one could get in their cars, get to loud, their were two people their that didn't drink ect.  Back to the story... I got really drunk realy fast, because I'm a light weight, even though I think I drink more than most of my friends. Well, we are a very horney group and that is just heightened when we are drinking. The only problem with that was that there were only three guys there and two of them were with their girlfriends. So, that left Ross and I have a huge crush on him and I've had it for a very long time. I wasn't the only girl there was also Dina, Lore (hot french exchange student) and Jenn. Well, Lore and Dina got a little to close for comfort and I freaked out. Things get a little fuzzy, but I remember talking to Ross and I don't know if I told him about all of my feelings, but also remember stuff about his penis. I want to talk to my friend, but I'm afraid of what I said and I have no idea what he is thinking, but I do remember one big thing. He told me, "I really value are friendship." What the hell? I don't know what I did to get that said to me, but it only hurt my feelings because only say that to ugly girls. Wellm hopefully we will chill on Friday and he will tell me what exactly I said.   Oh yeah, this is my first post. I hope you enjoy reading about my boring little life. This is as interesting as it is going to get.
