He is my perfect mate...SAPPY  But I have known him for almost 15 years...and been together for 9 years...and married for 7.  So it means a lot.  Maybe that is why the person is bitter...maybe the person was madly in love with her gf.  I don't know, but dang...let go...live a healthy ADULT life and maybe you will be able to move on and find your perfect match...No one said it would be easy, but this wasn't her first love and it won't be her last.  First loves are hard to forget.  Thank goodness I didn't have to forget my first love...LOL  Okay enough procrastinating for me, must do my homework now.
