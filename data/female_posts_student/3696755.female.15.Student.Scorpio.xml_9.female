Im fallin really hard for him, like im fixin to land face first on the ground. And i dont no what to do. I wanna tell him but im scared of gettin shoot down like usual, and like i said i tell everyone else cause u no if threy dont like me they dont like me, whatever, move on. but i really really like this guy. so i figure if he doesnt like me im ganna be upset, and i dont wanna be upset. but what if he does, then id be happy, but if he doesnt, ill be upset. SEE! it sucks casue i dont no what to do. do i risk it? or do i just skrew it and go on how it is?  We hung out last thursday, sunday, and talked on the phone for 3 hours sunday night, and im fallin fast. And like i accidently told his best frined, and im sure hell tell him and then i dunno, im just confussed and scared and all of those crappy emotions. If anyone who reads this, has any advise for me, id appreaciate it. Cause i feel like a little lost puppy. :-(  hehe
