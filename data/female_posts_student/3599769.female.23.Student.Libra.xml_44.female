I get into my mom's car and my dream was still so fresh in my mind, I keep thinking about how I had dreamt about feeding human legs (detached from their bodies) to a hungry shark. Like it was an attraction at SeaWorld or something. Weird. But then my sis looks at me and says "I had a dream about a shark yesterday." I completely freaked out! I hadn't even told a soul about my dream, I had just woken up about an hour before she came. She just looks at me and then tells me to put my seatbelt on. Now she's the most petite 7 yr old I know and such a ham!  Last night I dreamt about a shark and a whale. And a fire that destroyed the tank that they lived in, leaving them only in shallow pools of water. I'm standing there freaking out thinking one of these massive creatures is going to swallow me whole.   My derangement has followed me into my sub-conscious world. Now, the sleep Gods cant't cut me a break. What next?
