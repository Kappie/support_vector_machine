Someday ur gona kick yourself in the ass for not getting out of this when you cud.  I gave you my all. My soul, my trust, my love, my energy, my time.  But what has resulted from it?You've abused it.  Am I selfish to think of having something in return? I am.  So messed up. The chapter is not closing. But it has to be closed. It has to be.  In my quest of searching for God's presence, I've neglected a crucial point.  A pointthat gave me such revelation.  Yes perhaps I started it all. And now I'm blaming him.  But I would most definitely say that it's been mutual.  But now's the time to stop. If not now, then when?   -nose pierce-  What can I do about us? You are so nice. So stable. Such a great pal you have been.  But there is a heart that does not perceive. It hurts me to hurt you. I never want to.  Never intended to but if I went ahead, it definitely isn't God's will.  And then the vicious cycle wud repeat itself.  I've told you my priorities. But you don't seem to get them in.  Things won't change because I'm serious with God.  Loving me wud hurt you. And I can't let this go on. Love yourself. Be kind to yourself.  This is so beautiful.  God withholds what we desire in order to give us what we need.  You desire a partner; he gives you himself.  You seek a larger church; he prefers a stronger church. You want to be healed so you can serve. He wants you to be confined so you can pray.  Love...does not boast, it is not proud. 1Cor 13:4 That's what love does. It puts the beloved before itself.  Your soul was more important than His blood.  Your eternal life was more important than His earthly life. Your place in heaven was more important to Him than His place in heaven, So He gave up His so you could have yours.
