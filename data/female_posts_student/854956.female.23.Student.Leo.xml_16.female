I have to register for Spring classes... and soon... :-("  I just want all my schooling to be done... and soon.  And I still have about 4 semesters left... :-(  2 more years?!  Maybe less if I kill myself in summer school.  But... at least I'll be done with school before a certain someone I know... hahahaha  sorry... it's funny...  wait... sad... SAD!  Damn it!  Sad is the word I should use..!  Anyhow... it'll be just my luck that within the next year I get shotdown by some sniper hiding in the wooded areas around the UTSA campus... and be killed... :-(  But on a happier note, I'm finally getting my film developed that has pics of the kids from my classroom at Crestview... good 'ol C-8!  I miss my classroom of kids.  They loved me so much.  One little boy Zachary, he was always getting into some kind of trouble, but he loved me.  His mom told me how he had to pray for me everynight, and he'd tell God to take care of me cause he loved me.  When I came back after my vacation, he was one of the first kids to go crazy and come running at me.  Sweet little Zachary.  I bet he's doing really good on the potty now.  Boys are so difficult... that's why they take longer to potty train.  I miss working with kids.  I really hope I can get a job with NEISD next semester!!!        urlLink  postCount('talkaboutpoopykids');       urlLink
