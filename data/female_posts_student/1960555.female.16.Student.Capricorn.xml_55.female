I'm so obsessed with this song right now, I just downloaded it for Amy to hear.... and she she likes it too.  I gotta thank Gamer for this one.  So, I don't remember if I mentioned this earlier, but I got my learners licence last Monday (Jan. 5th) and I'm quite excited.  I'm going out driving with my Dad tonight, so that should be interesting.  I hope I don't scare him to badly.  I'm honestly not that bad of a driver.  Anyhoo, I should go... Fairly Odd Parents is on, and I'm not to good at following cartoons these days, so I gotta concentrate.
