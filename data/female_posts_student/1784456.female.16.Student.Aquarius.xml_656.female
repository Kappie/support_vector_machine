Sorry, but I've got every thing planned out in my head. :P It's a crazy little world in their! Hey! I got the Road to Eldorado!!! Which I'm obsessed with! What have I seen it about 5 times already? But it's still soooo good! How old am I? 3... err yeah... 3. Hehe but I had a reaaaaly great birthday! Yeay! We gotta go shopping on Saturday though so I can expand my weirdness. Don't ask. It just sounded cool at the time... like most things.
