From the small, backstreet sweatshop to some of the biggest corporations in the world - child labour, forced overtime, poverty wages, unsafe conditions, harassment of women workers and intimidation of trade unionists are commonplace.   No Sweat stands for workers' solidarity. We are for:  A living wage  Safe working conditions  Independent trade unions  All workers, in every country, deserve and need these rights. In order to enforce these rights, they need to be free to organise - the stronger the union, the safer the workplace!  We aim to:  Make solidarity with sweatshop workers and their organisations  Help unionise sweatshops in Britain  Publicise, expose and help stamp out sweatshop employment.
