It's just that  every time  I eat, I get feel so terribly sick. I get  horribly, intense stomach cramps  that make me feel like I'm gonna throw up. I have them for 10-15 minutes and then they just go away. So that's strange and doesn't make much sense. Any who. I went to bed around 4 and got up at around noon. Once again, woke up with no voice and a sore throat. Chest pains continued throughout the day.  It makes it hard to breath. Even if I'm just sitting around. So I ate breakfast (which makes me feel so awful that I've only been eating one bowl compared to the usual two or three), read my soccer mag,  I'm in search for pink soccer cleats!  Adidas doesn't have any and I prefer Adidas cleats (or anything really for that matter) so I'm kinda in a sticky situation. Fila and Hummel have some though. But I've never heard of Hummel so I'm weary on whether they'll be good. I've heard of Fila but I want pink  Adidas  cleats not pink  Fila  cleats. Then I watched some TV, went online, and decided to go get dressed and eat. I ate lunch with Eddie.  It was nice.  We were talking and somehow the conversation changed to Jessica and Ashlee Simpson. I think it was because I had my radio on really loud (in my room) which we could hear in the kitchen and Jessica's "Angels" was playing. So I asked him if he thought I looked like Jessica because Margaret always says I do. He said no. So I asked, "Am I prettier?" And he said, " Yes, a lot prettier."   It was so cute.    I went and watched TV and painted my toe nails. I watched a lot of TV the rest of the afternoon. Tonight basically did nothing. Crunches and more TV. Ate some ice cream and chocolate chips. It's not my fault, I had cravings. Oh, funny story. Anyone that was on track with me this year (the girls especially) remember that one event where I ran out of tampons and Annie had to give me a Pearl one? And how I was complaining the whole way to the high school about  how it was falling out?  It's not my fault, I've used the same kind of tampons my whole life and the Pearl ones and Tampax Compact were the only ones I'd ever tried other than my usual kind. And I screamed at all the boys,  "THESE DAMN TAMPONS SUCK!"  Well, today I decided to use a few of those Pearl ones and they're not too bad. So I take back all the hurtful things I said about them. But I still prefer my  "slender"  tampons.  Yes, I'm the girl with the tiny tampons.  LoL, Gabby was making fun of my tampons on our Columbus trip. Just because she needs four of mine to equal her one. Anyways, I'll change the subject just in case any guys are reading this. So today I was sitting in my living room. With the way my computer is, if you walk down the street and the door is open and I'm on the computer, you can see me. So today I heard some kids walking by my house and I was on the computer. So I turned to look to see if I knew them and sorry for saying this but it was  three punk kids.  Like all black, dyed hair, that kinda thing. I don't have a problem with that though so don't think I do. So I looked and realized I didn't know them but the one kid saw me looking and yelled,  "BITCH!"  I mean, come on.  That was totally uncalled for.  That little asshole. So today we didn't have soccer because we worked hard yesterday. I was happy about it. But I still like conditioning because it's getting me in shape. Sunday is the next day I have soccer. It's just practice scrimmaging so I'll see if I got any better with my ball skills. Then I have conditioning Monday-Friday again. So yay. Alrite. New story. See my brothers and his friends started this whole joke TPing their other friends houses. That led to displays of furniture in their front lawns and more TPing but all of this was a joke. Until, they found out the people who supposedly they were cool with, weren't so cool after all. So now it's this  big  war going on.  And our house is the one that's suppose to be the next to get trashed.  Little do those guys know we have our little plan of our own and plus someone is always up at all hours of the day. I'm in the living room til usually 4 where I have a clear view of the street, Eddie goes to bed at 5 or 6 and has super sonic hearing, and then my step dad is always up around 5. So they better watch out!  No one screws with McGrath's ...(wink, wink!)  And if they do, they get their asses kicked so keep that in mind.
