The coach told me so casually that they didn't have my physical(which sucked ass because they didn't even call my name the night before with the list of other swimmers who didn't have theirs either), and that I had to sit for 4 hours watching everyone else sweat. Whats worse, is I can't practice at all, and I HAVE to go to each practice. They don't even count as practices either, so I have to miss the first few meets.  Luideagach Athar is gone. I dunno why I made a site with my drawings when I am such a bad artist. I eman, I have DeviantArt for that. So I made one for my dolls. Though right now I have alot of my old and crappy ones one there. The name of it is In Your Head. Audrey Hepburn is the star of my layout. Only one of my friends knew who she was. And for those retards reading this who also don't know who she is, she's a famous actress from a long time ago.  Tonight I'm sleeping over at Sarah's new apartment. They're picking me up at 7. It's awesome cause now she's gonna live alot closer to where I live. And she lives near Woods Valley.  I finally got up to the next level today at The Underground. I officially have 400 posts and I rank onto the second rank thingy-ma-jigger. My dream is to be a Watcher, the highest rank of them all, besides Administrator.  Alright, I'm gonna clean my room and do my chores so I have time to pack for Sarah's.
