Really, the reason I haven't written much is probably because absolutely NOTHING is going on. Not much happened this past weekend. The only fun thing I did was go to Brett's. It was nice. I also got a chance to talk to his mom about OT, so, that's good. I've been wanting to do that for a while.   My house is so quiet right now. I have it allll to myself. It's nice! :)  Today was pretty good for a Monday. I actually somehow managed to get into bowling for gym. I've been realllly lucky with gym this semester. I somehow managed to get in social dance, and now bowling. This rocks. I'm going to suck so much at it, but it's ok. If the teacher decides to count team totals, I'll just make Brandon or Peter play for me. :)   I'm in a really weird happy mood right now. I don't know what it is...  Oh well, I think I'm going to go eat some dinner now or something. Fun times.   Oh, it was hilarious. Kelly drove me home from school today, and we go outside to her car and there's bird crap ALLLLL over it. Hahaha. I was like..."Kelly, some bird barraged your car!!!" I'm really not quite sure why it was so funny. It just was. Jamal rode home with Kelly, John, and me today too. That was cool. He's a really funny kid.  OK, I'm out like the fat kid in dodge ball. Poor fat kid...
