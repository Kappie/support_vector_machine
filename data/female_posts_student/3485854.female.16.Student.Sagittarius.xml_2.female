You are to expect no particular pattern, you are to expect the most random, off-the-wall B.S. that I feel I wish to write that day, you are not to expect me to post every day, and you are to expect postings displaying whatever mood I happen to be in that day. Somedays I may bitch and complain, which you are welcome to do in comment boxes, Somedays I may ask for advice or opinions which I hope will be answered in comment boxes, or by e-mailing me at Blades2442@yahoo.com (but please put blog reply or something in the subject), or I may give advice that is asked through e-mail or comment boxes. if you wish to remain annonymous or only reply through e0mail, I will respect your wishes and do only as such. I may tell jokes, say what's up and ask everyone how they are, or write what is on my mind whether it be through poetry, usual script, or whatever feels right. In my next post I will give a small intro to who I am, about my friends, and maybe more. For now I depart and wish you all goodnights. Goodnight, T.Y.
