Haha...think of all the things i think but never write down... all the crazy things. anyway. i think im gonna take that away. at least the soul part. maybe keep the picture...i dunno. dont want to creep out emily if she actually reads this. i need to go get some sleep now... as always.   night.     (look a sleeping picture! im having way too much fun with this picture business...)
