If tree species can survive and thrive in southern latitudes do to this global warming, can agricultural crops survive in these lower latitudes as well? The reduced risk of frost and enhanced climate conditions may well provide a greater diversity of crops in cultivated areas, allowing for even higher production of agriculture. Unlike the genetically refined vegetables and fruits that we find in the supermarket today, these newly developing species may have even higher benefits.  These new crops may help fight diseased crops or increase the growing season. The potential for greater medical exploration would be increased greatly as well.    If CO2 gives rise to an enhanced riched of earth's forests, couldn't CO2 be considered a good pollutant?
