She said her piece and yall said yalls now can we go back to one happy blogger team!?!? Please! I respect what everyone said considering the circumstances but still It is just way to touchy of a subject to be goin on about... it can ruin friendships... believe me i know! But yeah.. thats all im gonna say about that subject! Oh and does anyone know what day orientation is? Id appretiate (sp?!) it if yall told me.... cuz i dont ever go by the school to see... love yall! -Me
