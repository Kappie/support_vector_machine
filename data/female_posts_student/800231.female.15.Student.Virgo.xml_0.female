Apparently my instinct to blink when something goes for my eye is a bit stronger then most peoples. Everytime I got that bloody contact close, my eye was like "Dear God! She's finally gone mad!" and snaped closed for a good minute... Jeeze, in the course of two weeks I've discovered I can't make an omelet or put a contact in, I'm barely human.  Dad, mum and I went to REI tonight in the absolute pouring rain. Why? Because my dad decided he had a random need for thermal underwear...
