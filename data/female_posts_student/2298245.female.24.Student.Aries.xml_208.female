I think that, as a political idea, quotas are bad but I do favor the use of race as one factor among many that can lead to a person being a qualified candidate for admission to any school or job or whatever the case may be.  That said, I think that it may well be unconstitutional in many contexts, though I honestly have not investigated the issue enough to form an opinion on this.    Having said this, I was impressed with the diversity of the views expressed by the debaters themselves, as well as the audience.  This is an issue that tends to get people riled up, because race is a very sensitive subject in this country.  For once, it was nice to avoid the "blame the South" mentality, and to even hear a recognition that racism does indeed exist outside the South, as well as a recognition that the "problem" of affirmative action arises partially from the problem of "white flight," which is, if not wholly a Northern occurrence, is at least an urban occurrence, from which the South is at least more immune than the North, because there are not as many large cities.  That, and the more open and more governmental forms of discrimination employed against black people in the South have ironically I think led to a situation know where racism still exists, but is largely going to be overcome because of desegregation.  This, coupled with the poorer socio-economic status of the average Southern person (thus preventing "white flight" as much because it is not economically feasible for as many people), will, I think in time, as the generations pass, lead to a more harmonious relationship between the races in the South because the racism that is taught in so many homes will be counteracted by the reality of being exposed to people of different races and seeing them for who they truly are.  Or perhaps this is overly optimistic of me.  To me, the problems that affirmative action is seeking to fix are not problems that are going to be fixed by affirmative action.  In a perfect world, I think that race would not matter at all.  But of course it does, not so much because of racism (or at least not because of individual racism, though there may be an institutional component), but because the socio-economic conditions that many minorities find themselves in that prevent the situation from being corrected.  A better corrective would be to fix the educational system in this country, so that everyone who receives a "public" education receives a decent education.  But this costs too much money, so affirmative action sort of exists as a band-aid - it covers the wound but does not prevent the scar.  That said, I think diversity is a good goal.  I think that I benefited from growing up in Southern Mississippi, and going to a public high school, that was probably 60/40 white/black ratio.  I think it has made me more comfortable around persons of different races, especially because race is such a big deal in this country, that I think many people who grew up in mostly white areas as a result of fleeing the cities for the suburbs have not been exposed to.  And if race is one of the factors considered as a corrective, then I have no problem with it, although a better route might be to focus on socio-economic factors instead of race to avoid the issue of "race" altogether.  But since race is the whole issue, and a very volatile one at that, I think that it is a debate that will not end any time soon.  There was a girl behind me at the debate who seemed to have a problem with both sides at various times.  Mainly she annoyed me because she was talking through the whole thing, very loudly at that, and seemed to think that everything that was said was stupid or wrong, yet offered no comments of her own to contribute to the elevation of the discussion, aside from those she muttered under her breath.  And one of the debaters was this white kid, and he was against affirmative action, and as he was making some of his arguments, she dismissed them as coming from a "white Jew" and wondered what such a person could possibly know about the difficult of discrimination or the hardship in getting a job.  I do not profess to know the debaters religious or ethnic background - but this seems to be patently unfair, as it suggests that no one who is not black or not an "approved" minority has no right to have an opinion on the issue.  The whole point of a debate is to bring people together from different perspectives in order to get those different perspectives addressed.  And everyone should be able to have a say.  And if you aren't willing to stand up and say what you think, you really shouldn't throw sneaky comments around in the background.  If you aren't willing to publicly engage, then perhaps you should just sit idly by and listen, and respect those with whom you disagree.    All in all, while it was informative, I'm not sure it was all that productive.  It was too heated - which leads to people not really listening to what each other has to say and no true debate can function this way.  Unfortunately, with human passions the way they are, I think that there is no other way to have such a debate.  That said, all the people on the panel were very well-spoken and very respectful of one another.  And I think that was really good.  I could say a lot more on this, but I think I'll spare all of you.  It's two and a half more hours until the beginning of my super long weekend, so I should be of a more cheerful stock.  And I must prepare for class...
