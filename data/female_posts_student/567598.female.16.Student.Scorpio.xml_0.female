So how is everyone, what are you up to.  Shout out to those at LMC this week, Brady I hope you did well.  Congrats Stefi!  I think that guys should share the remote, coughBriancough instead of making their girlfriends fight them for it!  If someone calls shot gun, they sit in the front.  Poor Gracie had a panic attack at Six Flags today riding the Boomerang.  When I came home she was nearly drying because she couldn't ride the Superman because they were worried it would happen again  I talked to her like half an hour ago and she seems sort of out of it... but it is kind of late for her anyway.
