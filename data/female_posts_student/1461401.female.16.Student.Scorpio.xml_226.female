I just don't know how to make it go any faster! I don't think there is a way. Mom told me I ought to go take a break, so here I am. Homework is going to consume my entire being this weekend just you watch. I procrastinated, and now I have to pay for it by missing any kind of social event, no matter how much I would rather be there. Maybe tomorrow I'll work on my painting and leave my papers for sunday. I don't know. Something has to be done. Well anyway while I was working on my tome for Spring Moon, I found that quote and was rather taken by it so I thought I'd copy it down. I'm glad I did, but I'm yet to discover why. Just something about it. I don't know. I'm going to go now. Maybe mom will take me on a brief shopping expedition. Maybe.   GAH!
