There was one infant, a 3 year old, a 5 year old and a 10 year old. I only got 13 dollars. When the parents came home, she handed me a wad of dollar bills and said she paid me 15 dollars, 3 dollars per hour. Well, the usual charge for them is 8 dollars and hour(2 dollars per kid per hour), but since they got a new house and they have 4 kids, I let them go by 4 dollars an hour. I was supposed to get 20 tonight. So at first I thought, 5 dollars less, whatever. Then I counted it when I logged on 5 minutes ago and they paid me 2 dollars short! God, 13 dollars.  My parents got a few dvds to watch, and since my AIM name got cancelled (another reason why I had a bad day), I'm just gonna go watch them. But on the bright side, I'm 13 dollars richer.
