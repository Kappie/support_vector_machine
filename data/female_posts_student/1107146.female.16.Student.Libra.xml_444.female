Don't think for a minute that your mom (in your case, dad) doesn't know exactly what it's like; nor should you think that she [he] wasn't exactly the same at your age, because I'd bet nine of my own legs (and somehow I'd make that possible, but I'd win the bet anyway...keep reading) that she [he] was."  That advice really helped me out a couple months ago.  Thought I'd pass it back.  Otherwise, *hug* cause that's about all I can do right now.  I also have a slight bit of empathy for this situation, as all teenagers do, I must add.  Anybody that ever comes across this blog will be able to relate, because it's something we all feel, or have felt, perhaps not the same situation, but similiar feelings are derived, I have no doubt.  I got really depressed about that whole "giving your parents so much trouble" topic back in June.    As for the whole thing with Glen...there is not one thing I can possibly say to make that better, which is really odd for me, cause I'm usually good at that stuff.  I've never had to go through anything like, nor do I want to, but talk to your mom, I guess would be the best thing I could tell you.  Plan to take her out to dinner one night or something so that you have some time with her if that's what you think you're upset about.  Don't sacrifice your mother's happiness for your own, but at the same time, don't sacrifice your happiness for your mother's.  Get your feelings out there, or one of you will end up resenting the other if things do get more serious.  *Hug*
