Sleeping on 2 couches wit 4 ppl, not a good idea.  A word of advice, don't put ur cell # in ur away messages, hahaha... some random guy called me last night... Kinda funny though, paula was there, strange... But the magic 8 ball said he was hott... HAHA  This weekend is gonna be.... gross. I guess, math final on monday, have to learn drama lines, andddddddddddddddddd french test. total blast if u ask me! (BTW, It's a joke)  My throat hurts. I'm have to go get in the car now. I'm not sure why though, they haven't told me yet.  Happy Easter!
