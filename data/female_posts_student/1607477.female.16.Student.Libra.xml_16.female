Billy was showing his mom and dad the video from World Changers and the part came on where iwas singing to him haha!! his parents are cool. Ryan's girlfriend was at the church when they pulled up and he was excited( just thought id throw that in there) . Nothing else too exciting happened today. this little blog dispute is ending i dont feel like responding to childish games. but anyways we are going to play some cards so good night fellow readers and have sweet dreams this little chica is out!
