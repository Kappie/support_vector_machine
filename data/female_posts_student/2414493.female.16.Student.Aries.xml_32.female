It's one of those things that you don't really care about or think about either. But then K IMs me randomly with the PM assignments and I don't even need them since I already have them. I think they're really close now. Good, maybe that's better for the both of them. I don't care. And after a good month of sitting here and brewing hatred from all the silly bad things that have happened to me, I'm way past that stage. (involuntary shudder). I'm glad it's enough stupid stuff to make me forget about the journal and all the signs that I was too ignorant to see.  I need to start reading again. K keeps on bugging me about the Shipping News and now Arranged Marriage. I've been dying to read the Da Vinci Code, and what I wouldn't give to spend another afternoon just browsing at B, but remember the questionable stuff they put at the beginning of fiction last time I checked with N?  SEVENTH PLACE. I don't know what to say. And the most terrible thing was that they jsut started arranging the end-of-MT party at meeting's end. How stupid is that? Nobody's going to sit there and think about how we screwed up or how we could change. Maybe it's not necessary, but I don't know--that was the way I intended to cope. SEVENTH PLACE. How freaking lame is that?  But I've been too pessimistic lately. Funny thing is that I can read it in the people around me. It's justified, yes, since reactions from people don't seem to hurt me, but perhaps it's time I've just felt better about things? I mean, I can see that there's so many things to be happy about right now, but MT steals the spotlight.  And then I have the theory that such happiness cannot last, for how do we define happiness without sadness? Is it time to return to normalcy to better appreciate happiness when it comes around again?  I miss sitting up in bed and writing.  Happy birthday, E!
