After all, it's just as tall as I am. aa...I love it already, and it hasn't even gotten here yet. I wish they'd had overnight shipping, but then, I always was impatient when I was excited.     I'm reading  Violin  by Anne Rice, and I love it. Chapter seven only, but I adore her writing style. aa...and I should not say Friday alone, as that is misleading. It is 2300 now, 11pm civilian time. It is Friday night. Just another summer's Friday night. Sitting at home at the computer; on any other night, the letters would be blurring by now, as I have not yet learned to look away, take a break from sitting here and typing, ever so often.     The touch lamp with the lighthouse painting on every glass shade, the frothy foaming waves crashing upon the unforgiving rocks of the shore, and the cottage nestled behind the lighthouse, if only from the ship's eyes. This lamp, sitting high above me, gives a soft yellow-golden glow to my little world, this small space of an office. An entire room, really, and larger than my own bedroom, but the desk is large and I am facing the wall. It seems small until I look away from this bright and uncaring screen. My two hampsters, Kozi and Lelio, all sound asleep in their little aquarium where they reside. The mice, Willard and Socrates, cuddled in their little cage, also dreaming.     Would that Sir Sandman brought me dreams as well, rather then the blank and visionless sleep that so often is my night's occupation. Not to say I do not dream. On the contrary, I dream too much for my own good. And perhaps Sir Sandman does bring me dreams, and it is only that my mind keeps them from me until the light of day reaches my eyes. For I daydream more often than anything else. Drifting, drifing, my thoughts as waves in a vast and endless ocean of thoughts. And this shoreless ocean that is my mind is scarcely a drop in the ocean that is everyone's minds together. Just a little drop that, to me, is an ocean. A grain of sand on an eternal beach, that grain the entire beach to myperspective.     Would that I had something better to do than to sit here and ramble and listen to my music. The soft melody and the angel's voice. The haunting Celtic whistle and the lingering notes of the harp. Like a dream, yet I am not asleep and not dreaming at all. But then, what is a dreamer doing, if not dreaming? And so I am always dreaming, never waking, lost in the glittering sands of time within the Sandman's hour glass.  2316 (11:16pm) It is finished.
