A very nice drive I've gotta say, despite the longness...I don't think I did TOO terribly on the thing...  Anyway I took a few pictures on the way to and from Newberry. This was one of the more...umm...interesting ones. This will be the only one I put up for now, 'cause I don't feel like resizing the others (yes I HAVE to resize them. I dunno why). I'm extremely tired...more next post, that's a promise.     So tell me, what is that thing? I know it's something spraypainted on a rock? Is it a poison potato? Or something that I don't know of because i'm very sheltered? Hehe...Hmm...It's weird. And quite stupid.  Anyway...yeeeeah. So we ate at the Cracker Barrel and they had the most amusing Hangman game there. You actually hang the body parts onto the noose. Very disturbing, and suprising that it was a replica of a '50s game. I almost bought it for show since it was only five bucks.  Went to softball games w/ Ciji...just basically getting home. So tired. Gonna wind down now.
