It is a big deviation from the things I usually write about, but eh, you guys can read it. Its why I started writing the story I am working on too... FYI.  For the Miners  I am writing this for those who cannot. I am hoping those who read it can and will help.  Tonight, I cried for the people who are alone.  The people who do not know what it's like to live.  They seem not this way, but are forlorn. They give all the have to give.  But are taken for all they have. I feel pain for those who have so little and seem so content,  but deserve so much more.  I hurt knowing what could have been for them,  and what waits ahead.   They work tirelessly and give up the essentials of life, because they are told, this is how it must be. They have strong features and worn skin. Torn clothes and stories to tell. Their fingers were worked to the bone long ago. And have no where to go but down. The mines are the work,  The streets their home. They do all they need to do,  but the purpose is none.   We watch these scenes, as horrific as it seems, and just pray to god, "Thank God, that's not me!" They die younger and younger,  and no one knows why. But what they live and die for,  is always unexplored.  Why must these acts go on being committed? In a world where things seem not be left to chance, Why are people being slaughtered like lambs? If financial gain is all that is at stake,  What will they do when there is no more to excavate?  The youth do not know what it is like,  how beautiful it is to be alive. But soon they too will join there ancestors in the skies. Looking back on all they could have done, but it is far too late for the setting sun.  Even the bare essentials are too much to get. How are they to begat the rest? Why are we still sitting here watching? The day is now, the time is still a blessing. There is no much to do, so few to do them.
