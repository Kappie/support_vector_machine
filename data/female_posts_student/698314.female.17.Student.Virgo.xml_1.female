Seems everything was due because senior trip is tomorrow and they wanted to fit everything in before then! Wednesday was pretty boring.  School, training (hung with Miss C cause softball actually had a day off!!), came home.  The usual... Yesterday was a long day though.  School, training for softball's practice then right to the basketball banquet.  BLAH! can you say long day? it's ok.  I love training and wouldn't want to be anywhere else anyway.  The banquet was alright too.  I guess I just feel a little out of place since I don't play.  We get invited as all but... I dunno I don't really want to go into much more detail about it in here.... anyway. Today was alright.  School, then training all day/night.  Softball had another night game! wahoo 10-0 against Burlington Twp! this is really exciting because this is the team we beat in 19 innings 2  years ago and lost to in states last year.  It started to rain which wasn't fun, but it's ok. Again good times with Miss C.  We leave for senior trip tomorrow am at 4! yay! 4 days in Florida! It couldn't have come at a better time either! I feel like I should be opening up more in here, using it as a way to vent my inner feelings because that's why I started this, however, quite frankly, I don't know that I can trust everyone who reads this. I have a hard time trusting a lot of people.  I used to trust some people and lost it... oh well... we'll see. Im off to bed so I can wake up tomorrow morning! I'll update next time on both florida trips!!
