It is almost a struggle to be writing this letter and although I don’t know how you are right now I do hope everything is ok. I am staying at the tip top lodge at the moment with an old man Elroy Berdahl. He is good to me and I am fed, clothed and well.  	Before I begin I need to apologise the wrath my cowardess actions may be causing you. But I had to go. If not to run from the war to run from my life and the confined space I felt like I was trapped in. Being drafted from the war frightened me. I know it seems kind of obvious but please acknowledge the fact that this is difficult to admit to myself let alone admitting it to a few of the only people in this world that I admire. Because of this I am sorry if I have disappointed you.  	I do not understand the war at all. Infact I consider it to be rather useless. I laugh at the fact these people think they are fighting for freedom. It is all political lies and a huge cover up, for what I do not know but my beliefs lie firmly against the war. When I sleep at night I do think of those men. Fighting for their lives with no clue what they are fighting for. It saddens me and knowing that I may soon be one of these men leaves me paralysed.  	I do not know what I will do. Please do not try to contact me. I wrote this letter to you to assure you of my safety I hope you can respect me to give me my space for I need some more time. I again apologise to you for my actions and any actions that I may take in advance. I wish I could reassure you but I do not know what I will do. I may or may not write you soon. Goodbye   			Kind regards 			You son Tim O’Brien
