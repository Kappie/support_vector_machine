It was hyped up and full of big names (Christopher Walken,Glenn Close,Matthew Broderick,Nicole Kidman, to name a few) but the plotline was overall, boring. The movie looked like it was just thrown together and not really thought through. But, even a bad movie can have some good stuff, there were some funny moments but its a wait til it comes out on video kinda movie.
