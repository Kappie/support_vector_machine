I screamed and fell down the escalator in a mall once.  Who came to help?  no one!  I was bleeding!  I bet if i fell down and was choking because of an allergic reaction, no one would care.  They would just walk away.  That's why i think owning things that tell emergency number and etc. are USELESS!!!  2)  Hey, I agree that humans are the most stupid things to inhabit this world.  Sooo annoying!!!!!!!!!    " Why?  Why?  Why?" blablabla Do you ****ing need to know the reason for EVERYTHING?!   3) We're inconsiderate fools.  Ever seen those ads in the paper?  " Help the Children"  " Help the environment, be good"  blablabla     Oh, right.  People say we're "helping" the children.  But which children?  The ones that are ours at the present.  Oooh!  Suuure!  We give them education, food and shelter.  What about your children's children then?  How are they supposed to get clean air and clean society?  Phhht!!!  No one gives a damn about them!!!  Pollute now, who cares?  The world's gonna blow up in a few more billion years." Worry when the time comes" blablabla....  4)  We have gone against our nature.  Sure, you hear about people talking about God and how He created us.  But, has anyone given the thought that He did not create us like this?  Whooptidoo!  It's not like He popped in some computers and factories into our lives in order for us to completely ruin the box of treasures He made?  Has anyone given the thought that He might not want us to be this way?  I'm not talking against religion or anything but...if we respect God, we should respect the treasure He made for us, shouldn't we?  Why do we keep on polluting, polluting, polluting....?  The animals are important as well.  They came to this world before us, taught us many things.  In fact, you could say that they gave birth to us.  They own this world.  How do we thank them?  Kill them, slaughter them, breed them, enslave them, capture them, and burn down their homes.  All of this because of OUR inventions.  Damn poachers are so greedy that they wouldnt be able to see the truth if it was winking at them in the face!  You know what the biggest most important and most evil invention made by us?  Money.  That's what started anything, wouldn't you say?  Say ppl never invented it, we would be more generous, caring.  No bombs, no missiles.  No wars.  Ha.  Never say that something small is useless.  Look at what a small green paper did to our society.
