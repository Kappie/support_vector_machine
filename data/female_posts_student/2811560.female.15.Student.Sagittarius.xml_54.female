I was officially accepted into the ISYM Musical Theatre camp, so yay for that. So I get to go down to Champaign for a week this summer. And musical theatre is one of my favorite things in the whole wide world, so it should be awesome. The only 2 things that I really have to worry about right now are my algebra written final (on Thursday, AH!!!) and my jury, which I can practice tomorrow and Thursday. I'll be fine I guess. Paul wrote me a note and gave me a sucker and his lucky guitar pick! I walked into English after he gave it to me with the biggest smile on my face and Kelly goes "What did Paul do this time?". Lol, it was so funny. But yeah, that was really sweet of him :-).
