Keep the 15th May free, though.)  Hi all.  In English right now.  I finished all the other work so I can do what I want :D not because I should be doing work and I'm just a rebel.  I'm not a rebel *looks at feet* I'm square.  I got the coooooolest tops on Monday.  One has an axe on it, and says 'HACK' (Katherine has a matching one with a knife on it that says 'SLASH') and another one that's plain black with 'Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo?' on it.  My name's Juliet ... geddit?? Anyway.  And a reeeeeeeeeeeeeeally purdy skirt with shoes and bags on it.  Oh yeah, and socks with cherries on them and really sweet earrings, one with a little boy on it and the other one with a little girl.  Elliott is so buff.  Hee.  He's somewhere in the school, right now ... I wonder where.  I don't care that much, to be perfectly honest.  (Although, I do care what starsign he is.  I'm a Cancer, so if he's a Taurus then that's 95% compatibility, which is very very good ;) but if he's a Virgo, then that's 50%, so that would suck.)  I was looking at him today, when he walked past, and he is  so  gorgeous now with his tan I went, "Oh GOD, he's gorgeous," and Andrew, this guy in his class (5B), was right there and I was like, "Oh crap ... hi, Andrew ..."  That was funny.  Of course, not as embarrassing as when I was pointing at Elliott, with a pen, and I was saying, "That guy there is SO fit," (I didn't know his name then, so he was just 'that guy') and he turned around!!  And, drumroll please, cuz I have super-slow reactions I was still pointing at him for about ten seconds after he turned round.  So he was still staring at me.  And every single time I see him, I'm always gawping at him, so he must think I'm such a psychopath.  Oh well.  Mel keeps saying, to try to get to me, that he'd never go out with me (I was having a spaz yesterday because he got a new bag that doesn't look as gay as his old one, so I was going on about how straight I thought he was) and I don't care because everyone would think that he was a paedophile if he went out with me.  And I figured out that the 2nd thing I look for in a guy is how out-of-reach he is (1st being looks, 3rd being dress sense, 4th being music taste, 5th being personality and 6th being money), so I don't want to ever go out with him!! Gawd, reading that makes me feel so shallow!  Personality is  fifth !  Oh dear.  Anyway, I'd better go.  The lesson is running out and although we've got I.C.T. next, you just can't doss in that.  See ya later.  *~Jools~*
