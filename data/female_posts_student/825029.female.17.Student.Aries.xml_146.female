I can go to band camp.  haha  Collin requested another blog update with memories of my childhood, so now that I have time to write it... here it is!  This is for you, Collin!  Lets see... here’s a few that I just recently remembered.  When my sister and I were really little, we got in fights all the time... and they usually ended with me biting her.  Well, my sister realized that the only way I wouldn’t bite her, was if she could somehow get me to apologize to her, instead of the other way around.  So one time, during one of our fights, she stormed in her closet and came out with her suitcase and started throwing clothes in it.  I started freaking out (I think I was about 5 years old...) and asked her what she was doing.  She told me she was running away because I hated her, and she was never going to come back, and I started sobbing and she ran out the front door.  So I start running down the street, screaming after her, crying like a maniac until she can’t contain her laughter anymore.  When I realized she was kidding the whole time, I still bit her.  (so ha!)  The sad part to this story is that she was able to do this 4 times before I caught on and stopped believing her.  Boy, I’m a moron.  After another one of the “Bogeyman Camp” episodes (see entry from May 11), my mom promised me ice cream from Dairy Queen.  So she goes to Albertsons real quick and I waited for her outside in the driveway (playing with my sidewalk chalk, as usual).  As she’s pulling up into the driveway, I run to the car to get in the front seat, but before I can open the door, she thinks it would be funny to back up and drive away from me!  So she does, and I get confused because she like... drives down the street, leaving me in the dust.  So I chase after her, crying (boy, I seemed to cry a lot as a child...), but I can’t keep up with her anymore, since she’s going like 30, so I give up and go back home.  10 seconds later, she had circled around and, hysterically laughing, picked me up.  Boy was I mad at her.  Why was it that my family consistently found it funny to make me cry?!  Oh, oh.. and then there was the time when I was at Albertson’s with my mom (back then, it was called Skagg’s Alpha Beta- anybody here remember that??... it was like 13 or 14 years ago) and I was sitting in the shopping cart, and there was a fly, and.. for those of you who don’t know, I have a problem with bugs, and it was really severe when I was little, so I start screaming and thrashing around because I can’t get away from this fly, and the lady at the check-out counter said to my mom “Lady, your daughter needs psychiatric help.”  Was my mom pissed or what.  On a similar note, another time at the grocery store, I was in the shopping cart and my sister decided it would be a good idea to ride it (it was empty, btw), so she runs with it and then jumps on it, and it flips over because there’s no weight in it to balance her out, and the shopping cart comes crashing down on top of her and I land on my head on the tile and am stuck underneath the shopping cart.  At the tender age of 10 months.  My mom freaked out majorly... it’s a good thing my skull didn’t crack!  Needless to say, my sister wasn’t exactly on good terms with my mom for a while.  After all, how could anybody hurt me and get away with it?!?! jk ; )  Alright, I can’t think of any more.  This wasn’t as good as my first memory entry, Collin, and I apologize.  I’ll try to think of some better ones next time.  Cool song alert!!!!  Bob Schneider – “Big Blue Sea”  Adios mis amigos!
