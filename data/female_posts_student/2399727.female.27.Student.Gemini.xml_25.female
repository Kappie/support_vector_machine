I got a new cell phone last night to replace my old Motorola 120c.  Finally settled on an Audiovox 8600.  I'm having fun using this cute little thing so far.  The user's manual is embarrassing for the company, though.  Horrible typos everywhere, no information that I can find on how to voicedial.  I had to use a Samsung manual to figure that feature out.  Audiovox, if you're listening, get it together and at the very least, spell check your manuals!  I won't even get into the ill-fitting leather phone protector right now...  Other than that, it's a sweet little phone.  I got red, which just seems so much cooler than silver.  I like the stopwatch and calendar features as well as the world clock.  More to come...
