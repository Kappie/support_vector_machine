I mean everyone has to have atleast one friend right? Well I was sitting up last night and was wanting to talk to someone... anyone... So i started talking to katie... Pretty funny convo. We had a good time. But how many friends have a lost along the way. Planty. i can count alot of them. And the thing is i can't get them back. There are three main people that i'm thinking of. And its kind of sad. Cause they are all my fault. I stopped talking to them. I was upset at them. Something like that. Its pretty sad huh? So can i work on the relationships... i dont think so. Well i dont know what to do  for the prayer minstiy. I have been praying two of the same prayers. One for someone who wants to us to pray for them, and then for his will to be done. I dont think i should be doing ministiry. its not that i dont love doing. I love doing that kind of stuff. but everything i do, God doesn't seem to belss through me, but through others... Which i love watching. But still its upseting, to want to do something for God. Yet i dont know what to do. And there is so much other stuff going on with this youth ministiry, i dont know how to ask for help... O what to do...
