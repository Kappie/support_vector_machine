When I was little, I begged and begged until my parents bought me a little plastic toy that used the Minox subminiature film that I could never find. Now that I'm an adult, and haven't learned a thing, I had almost convinced myself that I didn't want the  urlLink Philips Keychain Camcorder , but now  urlLink Gizmodo  just discovered something I want much much more, a 3.5 ounce digital camera by Rollei that looks just the classic  urlLink twin lens reflex  model.   It looks to be available only in Japan right now, but I may be booking a trip soon to go pick one up.  I want, I want !  Read and covet at  urlLink Rollei Japan .
