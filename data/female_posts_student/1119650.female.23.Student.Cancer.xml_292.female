I harassed him, mocked him and basically belittled him to no end.  I asked him if he was itchy, or if he had any new rashes.  He didn't like that too much.  Finally at like 12:30a.m. he calls back and the following conversation ensues: J: "So, uh are you seeing anyone?" Me: "Maybe...are YOU seeing anyone?" J: "Yeah I'm talking to someone" (for anyone outside of the North East area not hip to the lingo "talking to" means making out and hooking up, but no official commitment as of yet, but generally you don't "talk" to more than one person at a time).  "So, I was wondering if maybe we could hang out this weekend...you know, I could come up to CT or something" Me: "Well I'm busy Friday and Saturday" J: "What about sunday?" Me: "I dunno, I usually sleep then, maybe another time." J: "Well I really miss you, Gwen.  I can't stop thinking of you and I REALLY want to see you." Me: "Well what would this chick you're talking to think of that?" J: "I'm not talking to anyone...its no big deal we're not together.  God, why do you have to be so angry and standoffish all the time" Me: "Thats another lie right there!  Its too late for this.  I'm sick of being lied to and clowned.  Bye." (click)  A little while later I get a text message that reads as follows "GWEN I MISS YOU DON'T BE ANGRY".  He's such a fucking bo-tard scumbag.  I think I might change my cell number so I don't have to listen to his lies anymore.  Oooh maybe for my birthday someone will buy me a pitchfork  shovel to get rid of some of the bullshit in my life.  That would be swell.  I'm not angry though, I'm still happy, cheery, shiny Gwen.  Yay yay yay!
