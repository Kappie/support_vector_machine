Hopefully when I do, these annoying adware bars disappeer from my IE. They prevent me from having any fun, because they have to load...> When I re-configure everything on this new account, and have somethings straightened out, facts sorted out, information obtained, and backpack returned, expect some sort of lengthy update.  Much to my absolute dread, I've unbaned everyone who was once banned. Just to see what will happen. Don't make me regret it.   Wait...Isn't there a setting around here for public/private blog.....?
