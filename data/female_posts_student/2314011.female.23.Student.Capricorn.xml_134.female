Oh sure, she's "licensed" and "apprenticed" with a master, but really, what kind of standards do these people use to gauge these things?  Not very high ones, I'd surmise, from their stature.  Stay away from coffee and cold food.  They'll only bring you bad things.  Whatever.  I refuse to believe every morning of my life has been detrimental to my overall health because of my ritual bowl of cereal.  Hot oatmeal is too much damn work and tea is great for evening relaxing time, but I may as well be drinking warm air for morning purposes.  Gimmie my overpriced, capitalist-pig supporting Starbucks brew, baby!  I'm avoiding typing up my Contracts notes.  Nothing too difficult, but I'm just not in the mood.  The Women's Center didn't provide the quiet haven I was hoping for.  Tried to read over there yesterday, but ended up using the same noise-avoidance tactics I use here.  I forgot how chatty women can be.  Add a few Asians-at-heart and you're totally screwed!  But I did get to show off how deliriously happy I am with law school to ex-professor Debbie, which is always good for self-empowerment.    "So you think this is what you want to do, huh?" she asked, not trying to mask her skepticism.  "Oh definitely; that took about a week to decide."    "Well, it'll be nice to have a lawyer on our side."   "That's precisely the idea."   And I know how hard that was for you to admit, my poor Debbie.     "Just don't follow Darth Vader," John, her husband, piped in quietly.  "Don't go over to the dark side."  "Never; I'm Luke Skywalker, all the way.  Or maybe Princess Leia, only without the earmuffs."     And am forever in search of my Yoda!  Tear!
