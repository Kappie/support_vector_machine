More often than not, we forsaked God's purpose for us and pursue our own purpose in life. at the end of the day, we had what we wanted -- excellent grades, lotsa money, blah blah. BUT. remove the material achievements and we'll be left with nothing. scary eh? well den. we'll have to live our life to fulfill God's purpose in our lives: to be more like Him. of cos, it is impossible to be LIKE HIM. i mean, we are NOT GOD. but. we can live our life like him. we cant be perfect, but we can try to. obviously, we cannot achieve this alone. we'll have to get help from the Holy Spirt. invit Him to remind us what to do when we haf to make a choice, and do it in a way that is most pleasing to God.hmm. so from now on, i'm gonna live to fulfill God's purpose in moi life. i'll learn to be more Christ-like. so help me along, everyone, to become a better person. =) Jesus rocks.      with lotsa love, krissy
