Just lying there with the ceiling fan whirring away, reading the collection of books that we leave behind there. That house will always remain special to me. renuka came home from the hospital from there, I knew each and every person that lived there, ran around the building, played silly games and bonded with parts of my family there. It's part of family folklore.  But like everything else in my life, it no longer is what it was. The house belongs to someone else, my grandparents live elsewhere. I could go back to India but life just wont be the same. And I just miss it so much. It sometimes just feels like there is nothing that I could just hold on to. My home is going to be empty. I live in a country that is not mine and I go back 'home' to a country that will never be mine. And I just think and feel like crying when it all is so clear to me in my mind and yet not real anymore. The way it used to be. The way things I hold dear are no longer the same.  K cant begin to understand what I talk about. Rune does. But points out that home is now the place which I hold in me. Its where I feel at home. And for the most part that's true and that's what I hold on to. But sometimes, just sometimes I wish I could hold on to something tangible that is going to be permanent.  Perhaps then I could feel that my life is not just a blurry set of images whizzing by. Maybe then it will all come into focus and I could move with it. For now though I just feel that it is me that stands still while everything whirls, too fast for me to hold on to it. I wait for when I will be able to grab on to it.
