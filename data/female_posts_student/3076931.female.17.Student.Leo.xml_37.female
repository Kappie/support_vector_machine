I really think that sometimes I say things and think that if I keep saying them, then I will eventually start to believe them myself. I don't know. I feel bad for guys. Girls are so damn confusing! I confuse myself!!  Actually, I think I don't want a relationship. I don't think I'd make a good girlfriend. I'm just so used to doing whatever the hell I want with whoever the hell I want, that having a boyfriend would be such a drastic change for me and I wouldn't know how to deal with it. I'm young, right? I need to live life. GAHHHh I hate it when I start thinking about these things. I shouldn't analayze every little thing. The thing is, I like this guy..a guy who I've been talking to for awhile...and he doesn't want a relationship because he works so much and what not. And it doesn't bother me...at least I don't think it does. Should it bother me? WHY AM I BEING LIKE THIS?! But I mean I guess if i liked him A LOT I wouldn't be wanting to do stuff with other guys...but I still do..So I guess I don't like him enough. SO it's a good thing for me and him both that he doesn't want a relationship. WHEW.
