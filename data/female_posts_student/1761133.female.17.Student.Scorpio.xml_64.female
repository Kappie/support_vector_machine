I still want someone to love...  I've been alone, since the day that you left me 'cause i never told, just what you mean to me I guess im afraid, of those kind of feelings Didn't mean to push you away, i realize i made a big mistake  'cause you know i know, and i know you know That every time you do, i get so lonely I know you know, and you know i know That every time you go, i get so lonely  Never fely this way, 'til you came into my life And you made me feel, something that i thought i'd never like Deep down you know, that you're everything i need So why pretend, that you dont know its hurting me, 'cause  Tell me what it takes to make you come back home Tell me what i have to say, 'cause i dont like being alone Yes, you're everything i want, you're the better part of me And, in case you didn't know, i love you more than anything  "Lonely" By Maria
