WHATEVER!! but john stayed with me, which i really appreciated, cuz i needed him. but after we got inside, it was too much, and i ran out into the grass and just sat there. john came out and talked to me for a few minutes. then he made me go back inside. so i curled up in the corner and wrote this poem. the dead person is my mother and the friend  is a constellation that i talked to in my yard late at night. caseopea. she was always there when i needed her. haven't talked to her since mom died, though. so, ya. here it is.   yellow rose   "i'm already there" is how it goes but little they know, i gave the rose that begged her please to stay away i couldn't take it another day but now the way i feel has changed the path i've chosen is crooked, deranged i often wish i could go back to times when it was dark, all black and i could see my long lost friend that we could our friendship mend i used to tell her all my fears she would dry up every tear without her ever speaking a word she held my foothold, kept it firm but every aspect of life has gone wrong i often have trouble with finding my song in this world that's full of bitterness, pain it feels there's nothing for me to gain and as i place this yellow rose down my world goes silent, there's not a sound no one exists but her and me i on earth, she by the sea of shining diamonds and forgotten sins she's gone for good, will never breath again she's better off, i tell myself as i look around at the snow that melts and as it melts, my tears, they fall the earth and i, we bear all as my emotions are running wild i can no longer be a child i shall no more think for myself but always for others and how they need help and whatever may come with any situation i must always remember i'm God's own creation no matter what she did, it can't bother me that yellow rose has set me free   so, there you go. umm...ok, well, i'm going to john's tomorrow. carol said she's gonna pick me up and let me spend some time over there with the family and such. i love her so much..she's really been a mother figure to me the last while. well, i'm gonna go ahead and get this posted then go to bed soon. it's been an interesting roller coaster of a day. lataz. ~kate
