I know it will be hard waiting for my next posting of my "oh so exciting" life. What's going on now?-->Nothing really. It's almost noon. This weekend I didn't go to the BIG GAME! Oh no. I enjoyed staying home and talking on the phone while watching movies. Football bores me and after awhile, when you've seen one game..it's like you've seen them all. Saturday, I went to the beach with mi familia. We went to Drake's beach by Point Reyes. We just hiked and watched these morons try to free some sea lions. Mi madre said they were trained professionals with degrees. It looked like trained monkies to me. Hiking..what can I say? Who doesn't love to get all sweaty and hot? No, no. It really is fun when you finally reach your destination and look down upon the land you just conquered. :) Then we went home. On the drive there and back there was this really cool surf shop we passed. It's called HIPKAT SURF SHOP..I think. It had some Roxy and Paul Frank stuff. I'm starting to obsess over Paul Frank. He has a cool website. www.paulfrank.com. Sat night, I was watching Sixth Sense on ABC. Then, I got too scared to watch the rest so I walked to my room. In the dark. ALL ALONE. Today, I don't think we have anything planned. Oh yeah, Amanda called me last night too. Talked to her on the phone for a little. Her dad just moved to American Canyon, which is a lot closer than Concord(LOVE THAT MALL). So this week, she's staying at her dad's house. Normally, on Wednesdays, I go home with her b/c her mom's house is so close to my guitar teacher's house. (I have guitar on Wed @ 4:30.) So @ 4:30, I walk over to Peter's house. Then after, mi madre picks me up or I go back to Amanda's. This week since she's going to be at her dad's, I go 2 her house by  myself . Manda said it's okay and her mom "won't mind". I still feel weird about it...even though I've been there countless times. (We go back to very beginning of 8th grade.) She's always there for me. Like when "dogs" go out with people. "Dog" is lame. Seriously. No more talk of him though! Ahh. I can't wait to g2 Bakersfield. I love it sometimes. I get to see Terry and Bri. Also, shopping. I love it. I miss them all. We go there weekend of December 3. So be READY if you're reading this-->Sophia. She's the one that had this blog thingy. I decided to try it. Interesting..quite. ToodLes for now. I'm going to find something *FUN* to DooOoO. Yaaah. x0x0x0x.
