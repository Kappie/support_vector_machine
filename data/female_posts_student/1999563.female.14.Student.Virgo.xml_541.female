Ok...so at 5:00 people came and we just kinda hung around..then we took a walk to the creek and then we laid in the hamock. Then at 6 we had a picnic dinner! It was sooo goood!! We had tereaki chicken, rice, potstickers, and water mellon! woot woot!!  Then we started our first movie which was kinda stupid..it had Audrey Hepburn (i have nooo clue how to spell that!) and gregory peck. Then we went up to my muyms rooms and watched the funnest/weirdest movie EVER. It was called "Atack of the Killer Tomatoes" It was SOOOOOOO funny. Oh my goodness. We decied our new tradition was to watch that movie and every party. It was great! During all this we were eating cream puffs, jelly bellys, and "fat boy" ice cream sandwhiches. Hahhahaha. Affter the movies were over we went in the tent and laid and talked until about 11. Then we were like "Lets go look at the stars!!!" So we laid in the grass for about 45 minutes just staring at the stars and talking.   All of the sudden Heather was like "LETS GO ROLL DOWN HILLS!!" so we were like "OKKK!!!" So we got into our sleeping bags and went to my back yard. We had the best and biggest hill for rolling down!!! It was like pitch dark so we couldn't see anythign and we kept running into eachother! It was SOOOOo awesome!! Thge hill just kept going and going and going!!!   Then my laid back down on the grass and looked at the stars! I saw a shooting star!! It  was SO pretty! We like found pictures and sutff in the stars! woot woot!  Then we are really tired and to lazy to go back in the tent so we just slept on the ground. It was kinda uncomfortable... :)  I woke up at about 5 and there were bugs all over me! It was SOO sick!! So I was like, I HATE BUGS! So I ran inside and slept on the couch, leaving my wonderful friends to fend for themselves. (I am a super hostess!!)  Then after a bit they all woke up and we ate breakfast.   At 10:00 Johanna had to leave, which was sad :(  At 10:30 we went to my grandpas house thing and played tennis on their super nice tennis court! it was AWESOME! haha. Heather and I  beat Emily and Sara twice! Mwa haha! One time I hit a ball really high and it landed in the pool! Haha. It was sooo funny! It made a big splash, I laughed.  Then we decided to go swimming. But, Emily forgot her swim suit!! :( So Heather, Sara, and I swam while poor Emily had to stick her feet it. It was a nice pool!! At first it was kinda cold but then it got warmer after I was used to it. We played marco polo and I just sat on the top stair so no one would catch me. Mwa haha!  After a bit we went in the hot tub which was SUPER nice! It was  like the perfect temperature!!!!  Then we got hungry so we ate and went home.  That my friends is the story of my fabulous day! :)
