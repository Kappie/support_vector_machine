I chilled at her house for a bit, then we called Nicole up to ask if she wanted to come with us to Target, but plans didn't work out. At around 4 I came home because I had to finish some stuff and then go over to my uncle's house for dinner. After dinner I went to Hacienda with  my mom and aunt, we sat and talked at Starbucks.   Saterday-I woke up at 12:40,lol. ANd at 1 PM Ashley called and we went to the mall, she had to leave early because she had to go to a Wedding Shower. SO I caught up with my mom and walked around with her for like 2 hrs. I got Ralph Lauren perfume at Sephora it smells good and 2 pairs of jeans...damn has anyone else noticed that lately the jeans have been lose fitted? They arent like tight anymore! I hate lose jeans! They make me look fat. My mom thinks that its because more girls these days are fat and they can't fit into hip huggers. well i say...SCREW THEM! I HATE FAT PEOPLE THEY'RE A DISGRACE TO THIS SOCIETY,lol. They should just keep making hip huggers and make PLUS sizes for all the fat people. I hate when fat bitches try on size 3 pants...they stretch them out and then they dont end up getting them because they're too damn small!...Well duh...I coulda told them that before they tried them on!Its liek they need to feel skinny or something. whatever. sorry i had to vent.  I went out to dinner with my mom and thats about it.
