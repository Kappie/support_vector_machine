It is because today is having QS examination, we needed to do 4 questions within 3 hours, not plenty of time. Luckily, I can finished all of them.  And today, I had posted the birthday present to my lovely sister and my dad. I hope they will like that!  今天終於考完第二科考試。雖然這個考試係可以用書，但也很疲倦呀，而且不是好夠時間做。這份卷係考測量，要係三個小時裡做四條問題，真的唔夠好足夠時間。但幸好，我可以叫做做得完。  還有，今天去了郵局寄了家姐及爸爸的生日禮物返香港。希望佢地會鍾意啦﹗
