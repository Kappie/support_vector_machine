I duno how many tms ive heard dat line ( proberly countless) but wat i cant figure out is  which of those tyms r true ?? i know wen sum ppl say it, dey just say it naturally, wifout any meaning, lyk its just part of dem. But wen sum oda ppl say it, dey actuali mean it. The problem now is,how do i noe which 1s r telling lies n which 1s r sayin wat dey reali mean?  By their expression? Their Tone of Voice? Or Just da way how dey deliver the msg??  I duno where or wen im going 2 find da answer, i hope i can seek 4 it... somehow ...  comments any 1??  jenny
