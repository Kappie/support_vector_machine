Anyway, he had a skateboard and was riding it back and forth and kinda did some funny falling type things.  Very cute.  I wanted to go attack him in the parking lot.  That would have made his coworkers wonder, Im sure.  I should just ask him out, but damn Im shy.  I was disappointed he only came over once for coffee today...  Oh, on a high note, I got my loans in today.  Finally.  That means I can buy the rest of my books before class begins monday.  Ugh.  Class.  I'm taking 18 hours and talking to Dr. McG about sitting in on a class (Learning).  He's funny, hes the prof I do research with, and babysit for.  I was wearing my oscar the grouch t-shirt today, which has a big picture of oscars head right over my chest.  He told me he liked my shirt, and then I told him how whenever Sarahs baby sees me in this she just stares at my chest.  Sort fixated-like.  He said, "Maybe you shouldn't wear that around me..."  He's also one of the nicest profs I know.  Dr. A, my advisor and the one who wants to work on publishing my paper with me, tried to talk me yesterday into doing work for her comparative class, which Im taking this semester.  She wanted me to organize the extra readings and junk, add to the folders and whatnot, and make copies.  I decided to tell her I was too busy, as opposed to actually doing it.  Wasn't much in the working mood today.  Speaking of, I have to work again tomorrow morning, and then Im thinking of heading to the farmers market for some fresh veggi's.  Yum.  I need to sleep.
