Thing is, for a few days there, I was wondering if I was going to have to worry about this for the next 9 months or so.  2 negative pregnancy tests and 4 days late, I came to the conclusion that I was dying.  There could be no other reason for it.  I was already bequeathing my lawn ornaments to my neighbor and saying my goodbyes at work...  Okay, so I didn't REALLY think I was dying but since I want to get pregnant and we're ready for it, and then I was late, I got all excited.  So imagine having the nurse tell you it's not a baby but maybe AGE that was making me late.  Hormonal changes after the age of 30.  Oh you don't say... well DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!!    Another thing that sucks is that many signs of pregnancy are also signs of getting your period.  So you can't even use that to help you figure this shit out.  Basically, I'm a little disappointed, annoyed and crampy.  Why is it that some women can sneeze and they get knocked up but I have to actually WORK on having one?  Why can't I just be able to order one on the internet and... oh, wait.  I'm sure they have that already, but I want one with OUR genes, so that I can revel at the masterpiece I've made.  It shouldn't be this emotionally difficult, y'know?!  So another month goes by, no such luck.  Ummm...Anyone got any Midol?
