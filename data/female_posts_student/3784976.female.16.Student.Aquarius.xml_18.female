Anyway, Shadow kept taking the stuff out of her ear that was holding it up, so we had to take her to the vet and see what we should do about it. Well when I came home from Krystal's house today my mom called me on the cell phone and asked me what I thought of the dog's ears. I hadn't seen them yet, so I didn't know what she was talking about. Shadow was in her cage, so I couldn't look very closely. Well I went and looked at them andI thought they had stuck straws in her ear and then put tape all the way around that. I laughed a little about it. But then when I got home from work,my mom told me that there weren't any straws in her ears, it was actually tampons. I was like "What?!?!" Why did they have to do that? She laughed. I have no clue why they did that, and personally I don't really want to.   And now I am beginning to think that this whole Cedar Point thing might not turn out so good after all. Thanks to   some people   (or person!) who think they know everything and if no one believes them, then that person thinks that everyone else is wrong. I give UP!   Well I think it is nice enough to go for a litlle stroll outside today, don't you Kayla?!? Muahaha   !Adios chicas!   Kate-
