I hate that girl so much and then to find out my best friend hangs out with her? I was like, O.O I guess it does sound selfish and stuff, but I don't want my best friend hanging out with her! I guess I'm afraid that if she spends too much time around her, then she'll change to be more like my enemy -.- I guess that's an irrational fear, but it's true. I guess I should just let it go, but I can't >.
