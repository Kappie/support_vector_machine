They have this same discussion every year. It always takes like twenty minutes and in the end they just end up bagless and thrown on top. Ashley, my love, I made the cover of your calander. It's amazing. I couldn't find a real calander good enough so I'm making it out of a little photo album with otters on the front. It's god. AH! We're leaving right now. MERRY CHRISTMAS! and a happy boxing day!
