And yes, it's real ;)  Thanks Danielle!!!    On a sour note,  urlLink this would deeply disturb me .  Frankly, I'm a Garner/Vartan fan on and off the set--though that must be weird for them.  Or fun.  Maybe not.  But another Ben and Jen?  C'mon people!  I'm losing my respect for Garner if she's really such a floater.
