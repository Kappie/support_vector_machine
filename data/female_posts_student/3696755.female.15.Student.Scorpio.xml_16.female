There was a break threw in our relationship. He held my hand while we watched a movie and we kinda cuddled. Then we talked for a long time and then he left, as usual he huged me but this time, he leaned in and kissed me. Wholy shit. He held me all close, and it was sooo good. I swear i think i could have fallen down if he hadnt of been holding me. It came outta no where, i didnt think in a million years hed kiss me. I duno it just, wow. I cant even think straight, im so twitterpated (thanks cassie, stole that one from you). I honestly think hes the first guy whose kissed me, like made the first move. Im usually the one whose like im ganna kiss you and goes for it. It was so much better this way, it was, wow. Ok i need to go to bed now casue im to jumbled to write anything really i just had to get this out and share my extreme joy, lol. Well good night, and remember - "all you need is love."
