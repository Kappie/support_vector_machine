Two people did their camp projects on it the year before last. I thought it was gross but never really thought anything of it. Now it hits home, though. I live right across from a church that is bordered by fields (and a cemetery, of course). It's like acres and acres of fields. Fields that have a nice new spread of sludge.  It smells. Bad. It's so gross. It freaks me out to think of what it is. HUMAN  WASTE  right across from  my   HOUSE . I can't help but always think of...ugh. It's too nasty. I jog that road in the mornings man. It's going to smell so bad. Why would people   use   that stuff??? I know it's like free or whatever but HONESTLY. That's so  revolting . That's human POO man. Makes me shudder.  My dad called some place (I can't remember what exactly) and asked if just anybody can put that stuff down and the lady was hestitant or whatever and said yeah. Apparently they've been getting more than one complaint.  Whatever...hopefully the smell with go away.   So, so far summer has been going alright. Not great but could be a whole lot worse.   Note to Abigail (he he) If you read this I just wanted to tell you that nobody I know reads my blog. It's easy to get things out if I know nobody I know personally will read what I say. Thanks for commenting, your comment made me feel good :]   Oh yes. In music news. I can't wait for  urlLink Tiger Army's  new CD. Also for  urlLink We're All Broken's  CD to come out. They are going to be in Virginia like three times this summer, I'd like to see them perform live if I can get a chance to. The venues are TBA so I'll have to see. Hopefully it'll be someplace close. The furthest I'd go would probably be the Patriot Center, if that. I could stay with my aunt though I think. I've heard two songs from their CD so far and I like them alot. For some reason it, to me, has a little bit of a Cure feel to it. Oh geez. The Cure. I'd like to get their new CD as well. Too many good CDs coming out. Anyway, We're All Broken, that's indie for you. Gotta love it.    Music: Brain Damage - Pink Floyd
