Like so hot that I don't know what to do with myself :)  So sense I wrote you all yesterday, and apparently lots of you read it I thought I would write again. Oh, and sorry about doing the SAME post 2X, I am techniqually challenged. Oh and another appology, I can't spell. If this bothers you, stop reading my post.  After I wrote I did this on Monday: did the dishes, got in a fight with my parents, cleaned off my desk, recorded music, played a family game called Sequence, talked tell 2am with Meri, Alex and Nathan. Meri and I talked about what we always talk about: boys. Alex and I talked about books...I think. And Nate and I talked about God, which was really good. I want all who are reading this to know I am stuggling with my relationship with God right now. I hate that everyone pretends that they are better Christians then they are, that we all pretend that everything we do is great. That our relationship with Him couldn't be better. And so I tell you, I need help. Ask me about it, keep me accountable. Please.   Another request, what should I do about a older guy who seems to be stalking me but we are friends. (If  your middle name is Humble it isn't you) We've been rocky friends for 6ish years, but randomly he started calling me. I am not really sure what to, suggestions tell me.  So I woke up early 'cause mom decided to take david and me to school b/c it was raining. But that I meant I had to leave the house at 7. YUK.   I then had to do a lab in physics, the sr.'s are gone but MR. Luli still wants us to do stuff. What kind of crap is that?? Then I went to World History where we watched people's movies, actually I studied for my math test--umm quiz. Next hour I went to pre-cal and took a math test that I refused to call a test. I do better on quizzes and actually I think I did pretty well. Then I went to lunch and then art. I found out Christy can't spend the weekend with me, but what is new? She has been so busy, but I miss her. Or I miss the carefree non-snappy Christy. I painted a picture in the style of VanGoe, with all the ribbin like brush strokes. It was of two white people sitting on a green hill looking at the water and the sky with tons of stars in the sky. I liked it.   Then I put all my paintings together and had my mom pick me up 'cause they are SO heavy. I also got my yearbook. Whoot whoot. Then I came home and dropped off my crap and then went and picked up our car which has been dead for the last 2 weeks. A huge pain in the butt. And now I am talking w/ Meri about you guessed it--GUYS :)
