Well, I was reading this poem for english today, and one of the lines was like "I grow old...I grow old/ I shall wear the bottom of my pants rolled."  I thought that was funny and I wondered if it was true.  We also read a really random one about plums in the fridge.  It was cool.  Yup...anyway...fun stuff.  By the way, how could you not know there are drugs at Brentwood?  Also, speaking of books, do you still have Where the Heart is?  I don't need it, but I was just wondering.  And Julius Caesar...I think thats it.  Peace out!
