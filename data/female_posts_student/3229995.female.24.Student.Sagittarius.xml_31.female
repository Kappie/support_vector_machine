The only reason this is of note is becuase they list the Beckhams as reportedly being the most stalked couple in the world. When you think about it this is a fairly accurate and terribly frightening statistic. There have been at least three kidnap attempts on the lives of Victoria, Brooklyn and Romeo and a number of death threats for the couple.  Why? What is the reason for all these threats on their lives? Personally, I think it has something to do with David's constant acknowledgement that he would do anything to protect his wife and children. I draw this conclusion from the fact that it is never David that they want to kidnap, but rather it is to him that they address any demands (I read somewhere - can't remember where - that one of the kidnappers were going to ask for millions of pounds to let them go). It is a money making scheme which unfortunately puts the people he loves most in the world in danger - what man wouldn't pay?
