Walking from the bus stop today, I heard the most beautiful sound: millions of drops hitting the leaves overhead, then my raincoat and the ground, in this kind of wave of gentle, familiar noise.  I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't had Matt's CD player and a library book in my (non-waterproofed) bag... at that moment I just wanted to get out of the rain to save my possessions from the wet.    I know there's a thought in here somewhere but can't locate it yet.
