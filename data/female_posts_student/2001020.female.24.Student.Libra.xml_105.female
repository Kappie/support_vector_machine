I have come so far since my last academic hurrah as a high school senior here.  I have left, I have come back, only to realize I shouldn't have left, and then I went again.  So many people come back, so many people never leave.  Why do they try to rekindle a dead past?  Things are the way they are, we have changed, things can't be like they once were.  But then I think: wow, our friendships have really grown since then.  As I was wiping away tears after looking at the last picture from our last VDP dinners (although two members had broken the official rules at that point) and remembering how empty I felt when RM said her last goodbye before I went to college...I start to wonder, "Why can't it be that way again?"  When EL and I were still great friends, when RM cared enough about me to call me a million times a day (and she always had something new to say)...why isn't it like that anymore?  Is that what people are looking for when they come back here, that past sense of security and friendship?  Can we go back to that or am I the only one who believes that it's lost?  Why do I always just feel sad about these old times?  Is it the "end of the innocence" for me, in a sense?  Am I subconsciously longing for what used to be?  I know I don't long for it when I'm not here.  What is it about this place?  I'm not sorry I reached for more.  I guess I just miss my relationships.  I miss the sweetness of the way things used to be...although then, I would completely argue with you about them being sweet, that's for sure.  I dunno.  I look into the eyes of those 17-year olds at AfterProm and think to myself, "I'll bet they never imagined who they'd be in 7 years."  I look at myself and wish for that innocence and optimism again.  I mean, I'm a pessimist by no means, but I guess I'm more of a realist than I ever dreamed I'd be, and I'm not so sure I'm proud of that.  That's the law school effect, I suppose.  I guess I'm gonna do some online newsgrouping now.  Just finished Lolita and wondering if I should start The DaVinci Code or Nobody's Fool.  I'll probably start with whatever one I'm in the mood for.  All I know is that I need more action after that listless Lolita.  Well-written, dragged on.  Props to Nabakov for his mastery of the English language, but ack!  Readers, hope you can tolerate long-windedness!
