Throughout the past month or so we've been so busy with jobs, friends and other potentially hectic things, that I havent really gotten to participate in my favorite past time in a while- staring at him.. he's beautiful.. and I love looking at him.. some dont really tend to look past the facades he's put up.. but he really is.. I never really noticed untill now how perfectly he's built.. strong, but not too strong.. he's lean, but under all of that there's a startling strength.. like a panther almost.. and has beautiful skin.. its startling once you look past the slightly geeky facade he likes to keep up at all times to ward off people.. I also noticed his eyes.. I've noticed them before, but I havent gotten the chance to just sit there and stare into them in a while.. they really are beautifull.. a wonderful, ever-changing brownish green.. or is it greenish brown?.. I can never tell.. they're just beautiful.. more striking is the look in his eyes when he looks at me... (I never really noticed it untill now, though, to be honest..I suppose I just wasnt looking..) its so incredibly loving.. and happy... he gets the same look in his eyes when he makes me laugh.. or when I amuse him.. they just light up.. he says he enjoys making me laugh.. and thats all he wants to do- be with me and make me laugh.. for as long as he possibly can... despite the fact that I can be an uber scary biotch from the black lagoon and have an odd combination of fears: abandonment and commitment at the same time.. although, I suppose the commitment shtick didnt come about untill I fully felt the grasp of the abandonment thing.. most people dont tend to stick around and I've learned to harden myself against it.. I mean, c'mon, there has to be something wrong with me for boyfriends and friends alike to leave so frequently.. then again, that could also be me pushing them away anymore.. ((Sighs)) I can be such an ass to him... when I look into his eyes, and even just looking at his mannerisms, I can tell that he truly loves me.. and he wants to make me happy.. and, despite my fears, I want to do the same for him.. but I dont know how.. sometimes my moods get so out of wack that I snap at him.. and I, sometimes intentionally, make him feel like less than he is.. and he  doesnt  diserve that.. at all.. I love him.. and I really need to learn how to show it... ((sighs)).. he's so incredible.. more so than I could have ever hoped for.. it's strange.. I never thought I'd want to stick around for anyone because no one will stick around for me (leave before being left theory).. and here I am wanting nothing more than to be with him.. today, tomorrow, and perhaps even further on down the road- who knows?... all I know is that, when I'm with him, nothing matters.. at all.. I love laying with my head on his chest and listening to his heart beat.. it's a simple pleasure.. but it's so incredibly amazing none the less..
