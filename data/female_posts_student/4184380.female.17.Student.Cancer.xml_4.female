So, this morning Jamie calls me and tells me he's  coming to pick me up to take me stud shopping. So, we get in his car, and I  bring the gun, and we go to Linds to shop for studs. Because the studs have to  fit the gun you see. ;) haha, so we found some, and we go back to my house  to leave again to go to the beach. On our way we pick up Andy (aka xcandyx DA  member) , and then I almost get lost getting to the beach. *bangs head on  keyboard* that's alright though. Ok, so then we get there, and we walk along  and find various smelly objects as most people do when they visit the beach....  and then we discuss everything from hitting a seagull with coins to me in a  coconut bra, dressed up to beg my tribal council for college money. {Its ok if  this doesnt make sense to you} And so we continue home, and we get to my  place where my mom promptly pierces holes into Jamie's ears. They really look  quite good on him. So then Jamie leaves, and I go with Andy to the bank and  to put gas in my car. And, when I get to the pump, realize that I didnt bring my  cash card, and so, I make an ass out of myself for perhaps the 16th time that  day. So... I take Andy home{yet another opportunity for me to make an ass out of  myself--- and yet I managed to. You think that the chances of me doing things  like that would SOMETIMES weigh in my favor} , and worry about draining my car  of gas and being stuck on the side of the road, and yah. But I make it home.  So I head out again, and this time I take my cash card, and I fill my  tank... and head out to rent movies. One was Super Troopers, another Scary Movie  2, and the last was one I'm not EVEN willing to mention on here. All I can say  in my defense, is that I had to find a movie that my brother and sister could  watch with me. And so, I return home. Where, I am about to bake a cake.  Literally. But first, I must add some people to my Cast List which I have  disgracfully left out of my previous entry. Please forgive me *half bows*   Scott: Scott is one of my very best friends. We talk quite often- but  almost always on the phone. He comes over quite reguarly but I have only been to  his house once, and so, I am a bitch. Currently, he has also left me, and is on  the east coast. But that's ok because I know how much he loves it out there. He  really does. He's a east coaster sadly and painfully stuck on the west coast.  But we love him here, and I, never want to see him leave. But, the time will  come {aka college} that he will.  Matt: Matt is Andy's friends. The best  way to describe discussions is this. In his own words: "you know how when you're  talking to someone there is a line? That shouldnt be crossed?" Me: "yes... you  dont see that- I know" Matt: "yah... I dont..." But thats ok. He's a good guy.   Phillip: My ex. Well, my LAST ex. I have quite a few- but dont think  that I'm proud. However- it is kind of nice because I think that I have a better  idea in my mind of what kind of guy I really want to date now. Not that there is  anything wrong with Phillip. But there is something wrong with Phillip and I. I  dont know if he will come into this story very often, but if he does, you now  know who he is.  Daniel/Landon/Brian: They are almost always together as  a threesome, and so, in my listing, they are a threesome. They are all intensely  brilliant, and will be the future's Bill Gates. Plural. Anywho- currently,  Landon has long hair-- even longer after returning home early from his year  abroad in Austria- which was more like 5 months, and Brian.. um... has a pink  mohawk. Hm... Unlike him if you know him. Daniel is fairly normal, but with this  streak going through the threesome, I doubt he will be for much longer.   Aaron: Good guy. I think I may get on his nerves sometimes, but that's  alright. He's going to be going to college this year at Skagit Valley which  means he'll remain on the island, which is a good thing.  Somer: Somer is  a great girl, but never tell her she looks cute. She is very pretty though. She  has a twin, Aliza, whom I havent gotten to know too well yet, but perhaps in the  future I will. After all, I already met her boyfriend. :P Somer took my senior  pictures for me, which are absolutely wonderful, and she is my photo friend. :D  She's an awesome photographer- and I'll never be able to even touch her talent  I'm sure.  Jamie, John, Ely, Jerry: All guys from Ohio that I talk to  pretty darn reguarly- about once a day- however, I have never seen any of them  in person. But I've known Jamie (who's last name is ALSO Barker- and his older  brother, John, has the same birthday as myself --- talk about weird!!) for about  four years. So--- I love all of them and hopefully we'll all meet up in person  some day. :D  Setting for Story: Whidbey Island. The longest island in  the continental US. Stupid fact to memorize, really. About 70,000 people live  here, and we have a naval base up north.. blah blah blah. Its VERY Hippified  here, and I love that about it. More about the island as I continue. Well, more  later but I'm posting this now.
