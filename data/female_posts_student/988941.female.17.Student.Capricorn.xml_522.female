In the afternoon I am going to the garden centre with father because I need to get a proper cactus house for my cactuses because after 3 years of neglect they are alive! So now I intend to keep them all nice and healthy. Tuseday I am going to Croydon with Jackie to get Jo's pressies. I am also intending to but myself a few CD's and some matrix posters....hehe. Wednesday we should have the park. Loads of people haven't emailed me back on whether they are coming or not yet. Grrr. So spread the word people. Thursday I am not sure what I am doing. Friday is the day of reckoning with the Information Communications Technology test. Sorry, I think it sounds so much better athn ICT or IT. LOL. Today I have been reading on of my books. Did you do in WHSmith you can get any 2 books for ust £10? That is a good deal, and they have some good books on the shelves too!  So my dilemea. I have the sixth form letter. And guess what. I have subjects that clash. Wopee. But then guess what. The 2 subjects which clash are the 2 subjects I reeeeally need to do for my future career. Grrr. I wouldn't care so much if I had to drop Geology or English lit but I have to choose between HISTORY and ART/TEXTILES. HOW THE HELL DOES THE FLIPPING SIXTH FORM EXPECT ME TO DO THAT? I MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE COURSES!!!!!!!!!! I will be on a rampage tomorrow as I must go and complain to Miss H then to Mr V. Anyone care to join me? Grrr.
