I honestly had no idea what I was getting myself into. I am usually a very shy person but for some strange reason HOBY "brainwashed" me in a very good way and now after returning I am no longer shy. I walk up to people I don't know and introduce myself with no worries or second thoughts about what they'll think of me, like I used to do before HOBY was introduced into my life. HOBY has not only changed me physically or mentally but emotionally as well. Before arriving at the WLC something happened to me, I thought it was the end of the world and I thought everybody was an enemy. I made myself stay very close to home and not trust people. But when I got to HOBY I let all of those barriers down. I realized what happened to me back at home was left at home and this was a place for me to start over and re-introduce myself to people who hopefully would become my lifelong friends. Although I was a little nervous about meeting all of you and putting myself on the line, I am so glad I did. HOBY has changed my life in a way this I can't evenm explain in words (I am sure many of you know how this is) My friends asked me how my week was and where I had been and all I could tell them was that I was with HOBY and words can't even explain how AMAZING the past 10 days had been. They gave me strange looks then looked at my pictures and said  "wow you really can't explain this, over 475 people wearing the same colored T-Shirt, doing the exact same thing, and all because of one man's 'impossible dream', this really is something that can't be explained" I told them they were right and I tried my hardest to explain the jokes that went with the pictures but that was no good, they just didn't understand. When I called my friend she told me that this was the happiest she has heard me in the longest time and she is so glad that I am happy again. HOBY made me laugh and smile for the first time in literally 3 weeks. HOBY made me cry, smile and laugh so hard that my stomach hurt, HOBY is the greatest thing that has happend to me in the longest time. I want everybody to remember one thing :"Laugh when you can, apologize when you should, and  let go of what you can't change. Kiss slowly, play hard, forgive quickly, take chances, give everything and have no regrets. Life's too short to be anything but happy." I want everybody to be happy all the time and when things jsut don't seems to be going your way jsut think back to the 10days you spent at the WLC and think about the great times we had and the amazing friendships we made and everything else will seem so much better.I Love and miss each and everyone of you. Please keep in touch.    As you can see my HOBY WLC expierence was amazing. I hope that sometime in your lives you can have an expierence like that. It is one that will never be forgotten. I am glad I went to the WLC and I am looking forward to voulnteering there next year as well as my local seminar.       ~~ M e l ~~
