It has been ages since I have seen my friend..... well actually only two weeks.... hmm. Have I gotten too dependent on that person? I mean I don't seek his approval on everything (sorta) and I am not completely, crazy obsessed. It's just good to be in his company.   But it is getting better. My other great friend came back. So now we are in a state of missing him together. 'Tis a shame that he left us to our own devices..... hehe.... actually more funny that we are on our own. We (when I say we I actually mean I) am kinda weird when left to our (my) own devices. Oh well....  But don't get me wrong. I am not complaining. I know that I have a great life, and it keeps on improving. Who knows how great it could be in the next ten years?  But how many times have I said "I" in this passage? Fifiteen times! Wow.... there has to be something better to talk about than that....  Perhaps later.... I have work for my college prep academy... Karen Dillards.
