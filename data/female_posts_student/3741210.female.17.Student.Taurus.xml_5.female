Just thinking about it makes me sick.  My brother and I job sharing so he's working today, and then I work Tuesday.  My cousin gets paid more than we do for doing the same job.    I think I might be going shopping today with Catie and Emily so that's good.  I really want a pair of black converse and a pair of nice   flat   dress shoes I can wear to work.  Lets look forward to that and maybe a movie.  I hope the work situation gets better.
