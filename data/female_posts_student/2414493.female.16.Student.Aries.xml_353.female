I'm exchanging emails with Mrs. Novak in addition to writing to Mrs. B. Her cuteness even shines through in her emails and I'm just so happy to know these people back home. It'll make for some excellent discussion when I get back, for I'm excited to know what other people think about these books. Certainly, the ones we're reading are lesser-known works of the authors, but it's still an interesting outlook, and if I'm baited, I'll be sure to read the other books.  Am on the second page of the lit paper, though I just don't know how it's going to turn out. I'm almost afraid to email it to Beth now for fear that this, too, won't work. I just have to get something going, though what's scaring me is the fact that I haven't gotten a grip, so to speak, quite yet. I needed a break, so I went to ABP with Jenn. I read  Jacob's Room , Jenn mapped out her lit paper. It was certainly a nice change of pace, and it's always more appealing to read at ABP instead of in the room. It's something about the foreign elevator music and random stranger encounters and the funny chairs that really gets me reading. Back in the dorm I just get carried away with Death Cab and obsessively checking email and going online.  Tomorrow just means more lit papering and reading. And Wendy! Shopping on Sunday, interview on Monday...
