Secondly, While she's bent over getting something from her knapsack that can reach it, silently grab the green tea while she's not looking. Thirdly, run off with it, and listen carefully for her moans and groans, yelling for you. BEWARE: While running away from her, watch out for her allies, who will pursue you(ie: Dana, Jenny,Olivia)  TIP: it annoys her when u trip her when shes unsuspecting
