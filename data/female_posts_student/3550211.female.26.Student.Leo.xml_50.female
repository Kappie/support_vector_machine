Here's what  urlLink lileks  has to say about it:    He coined a new term for the Internet critics of his positions: digital brownshirts. Yes, yes, it’s over the top. But it’s not the sentiment that raises eyebrows, it’s the position of the person who’s saying it. We don’t expect presidential candidates past or present to indulge in Usenet flame-war lingo. We don’t expect serious party elders to call the other side Nazis, and for good reason:  it’s obscene . The brownshirts were evil. The brownshirts kicked the Jews in the streets and made the little kids put their hands on their heads as they stumbled off to the trains. The brownshirts were not interested in refuting arguments. They were interested in killing the people who dared argue at all.   I absolutely HATE comparisons to Hitler. It's not only over-played, but there is never any fact to back it up. These politicians have to stop resorting to "name calling" in their never-ending battle of seeing who has bigger balls.
