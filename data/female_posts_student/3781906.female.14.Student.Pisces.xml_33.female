I have two HUGE fans blowing on my now, but they don't seem to be very helpful.  I have just been spending time with God. I need to rejoin my church. I have HARDLY been going, and it's really effecting me. After yesterday, I realised that. Now, I just need to talk to my pastor about it. I help to get myself to church. I need prayor.  Hopefully, in a few mintues, I will be leaving to go see a movie with Jessi. What exactly we will be seeing is still in debate, but we know we want to see a movie. Why not? It's free!  I better split!  amber
