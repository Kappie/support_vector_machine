I liked the pushy button... ahhh... * I wouldn't have been that bummed about it except for that I missed yet another Halloween. I got home yesterday (Halloween) and I had no where to go. So I had door duty while everyone else was out having fun. No one visited me. That was the worst Halloween ever. And now I have soo much homework to make up. WHY THE END OF THE QUARTER!!! Least Ms. Germane is gone now.
