Normally those routine tasks that one has to do every day - getting up, washing your face, brushing your teeth - are more of a hinderance and an annoyance to me than anything else.  Now, I am relying on them, every small task I complete is reason to celebrate, reason to know that - despite all of my recent doubts - that I am going to make it, and more importantly, that I  can  make it.  Then this morning, despite my lack of sleep, I was able to get up when I was supposed to, able to force myself from the comfort of my bed to get out and face the day.  I was not able to do this last week, and that was on much more sleep.  So making myself do these menial things, relying on my routine, has helped me out greatly.  Even despite my awful commute this morning (sidenote to the rude guy on the bus:  you suck), I am in a good mood.  So there, icky depression, you have been driven away.
