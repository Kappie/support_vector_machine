Sorry for all of you virtual addictees who were drooling for my next words, having to go a good 4 days without my sheer (yet quite unconventioal) wisdom. I was not there for you. But, alas, I am now here.   Tonight was my first night at Colucci's and it was, interesting. That place is the closest thing I've ever stumbled across in my life, as secluded as it is, that has closely resembled a true life soap opera. Quite amusing the place is, I must admit. Humorous as well; who cannot help but to chuckle when dealing with salivating teenage girls and quite promiscuous teenage boys cavorting as if there were no tomorrow? I surely cannot. :-)   My birthday was yesterday, and I had a nice day actually. My family made the day special for me, as my friends did not. I guess I know who really cares, now don't I? I did get my hair colored, but not blonde, as disappointing as that was. Instead, I went black and red. A little Kelly Osborne, but hey, it totally matches my personality.   I think I found a car that has actually passed my Dad's inspection, and is something that I can afford. The bad thing is that it is a huge '89 Cadillac. HUGE. But, indeed, it is a car. I think I should pimp it out, get a fuzzy pink wheel cover and some looovveee beads.
