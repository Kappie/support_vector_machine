I lauged a lot. I'd have to say my favorite part is when the guy keeps blowing the foghorn. Funny stuff I tell ya, funny stuff. :)    I'm glad Diane wasn't alone on her 18th birthday either. That would have been a bummer! Plus...she got to laugh a little. YaY laughing! And now I get to go do the homework I've been avoiding doing. Heh. Fun times.
