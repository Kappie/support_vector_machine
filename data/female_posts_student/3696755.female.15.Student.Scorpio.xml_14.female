Im not talking about #3 anymore, (his friend told him and told me he "wasnt sure yet" but he "likes the way things are") Im talkin about #2 now. It was a family get together, the 4th, so of course they came over and his little brother didnt come, so it was just us hangin around. He and i watched a movie, went to the fireworks and then played a game. Durring the fireworks i laughed more than i had in a long time and really got along really well with someone for once. We really hit it off, usually we dont really talk to much but we really got along really well. And then when they were leaving, in my head i was like, talk to him, get his #, ask him to hang out sometime, get his e-mail, DO SOMETHING!, but of course i coudlnt even do that. And why still boggles my mind, why there are those few people that i just cant do that with. I dont no why, i could probably meet like, Adam Brody and be like hey can i call u sometime, but no, theres those few guys who really to anyone else arnt that great or special, but to me there amazing. And now im sitting here, upset casue i did nothing and the next holiday that ill probably see him is Christmas witch is in 6 moths, and just being mad at my self and wanting to cry and just im really confussed...I hate this feeling its one of the worst feelings, wanting to do something but holding back and then wishing u had and u dont no why u didnt (did that make sence). Anyway that feeling i just tried to explain, its the worst. And i hate crying, but now i am and it sucks. But oh well, i skrewed up once again and i guess i got at least 6 moths to try to get some balls and do somthing, but ive been sayin that for years, and all its gotten is worse. I see him, it gets worse. I think about him, it gets worse. Someone mentions the family, it gets worse. Its the snowball effect, and i guess one day that snowball will hit a tree. Witch could be good or it could be bad. But untill i decide to be a big girl and do somthing i guess ill just be doin like im doin now, being upset for somthing i didnt do that i should of. And like i said thats the worst feeling...
