Cish and Fips and Ginager, and then Eva chimed in with Woffer pop! Why our doors are not being beaten down by record companies I don't know! So then yesterday, being Saturday Eva and I had to drop off the bikes Taryn brought to the cottage so we stopped for coffee, and had a gay old time.(I mean gay in the ha ha way, not in the well you get the picture!) Eva, Taryn and I just sat by the pool for a while talking about Taryns first real love. Brent. All I have to say is... WHO GETS STABBED IN THE LUNG!  Seriously, though he is a catch. If he has something in common with Johnny Depp in the movie that features the song "Black Betty", he is a catch and I mean that with utmost sincerity, really I do! Later on we went to "East Side Marios" with Nat, and that was fun. My food was crap, but I filled up on bread so that was ok. I babysat after that, and when the kids were sleeping I watched "Grease" twice. Today was a barrel of laughs. Sarrah, Eva and I went to the park, and talked about everything and nothing! It was so funny! A certain friend of ours who I will name 008 gave us our refreshments for $0.00!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so excited!! That is all to report from this camp. My little critique for today is Frank Sinatra. He is his own person and I can not compare him to anything, he is a legend and I love him. HE IS NATHAN DETROIT!!! I mean geeze louise I love that movie. That movie being "Guys and Dolls." I have to go now though. Hoccha  Author: Eve
