I broke up with my bf, buttttt we are still talking, I just don't want to be with someone who is still into drugs, I myself got out of that a long time ago, and it just isn't emotionally stable at this time. He is a great guy and I am helping him with finding a meeting he can go to AA and NA.  Oh good gawd, I am also clumsy, I frickin broke a toe, possible 2, the other day : Long story short my pullout keyboard thingee to my desk broke, so i sit it on my lap and type (yes i know ghettofied), and it dropped right on my foot, i sat there for a couple minutes, didn't make a sound because of the pain I was in, needless to say here I am again typing and hoping it wont fall again lol ok now that is one toe down, now about the other one....I was moving a rocker/recliner, it was heavier than I thought and it dropped right on my big toe, my toes are all brusied up, looks nastee as fawk! lol  I dunno what else to say, I am starting school again next week *sigh* I am going to be 24 years old and I am still in school, oh the wonders of nursing :p hehe I am really not this negative, I know in the long run school and making people around me happy is why I can say everything is going to be alright. I think I get on some peoples nerves because when they come to me with their problems, I try to look on the brighter side of things, that isn't what people want all the time, yes encouragment is fine, but at the same time they want someone to listen, which I do, it's just I comment a bit too much after I listen :p hehe OK I am outtie for now, maybe later on Ill phone in another recording :p
