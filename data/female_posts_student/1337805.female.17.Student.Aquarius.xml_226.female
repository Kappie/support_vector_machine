Or I could just give her what I got her, its more than enough...but..just not for me. Also bought some new pants and junk, they are all too small, so now I have to go BACk to Walmart and return then. Hurray..*rolls eyes* But I also got some yummy new hand cream  I was supposed to go to Laura's at 12 yesterday so I could wake her up and we could call and remind everyone about going to the park. My dad had to picket at 1, so I asked if I could be dropped off after they finished shopping. They all agreed, so I woke up at 9 with them and wennnt shopping and made sure we got out of each store quickly, and we finished at 11.30, more than enough time for me to be dropped off and Dad to eat lunch before he had to go. Well, they then decided there wasn't going to be enough time, blah blah, and Dad would drop me off on his way to picket. I was pissed cause they ruined all my plans, so I walked to Laura's, and Dad then decided he was never going to drive me anywhere again. Whatever.  Went to the park, had a righteous water fight. Soaked Misha, Kim, Laura, Steve and Karissa. Sean, Nana and Tom were too chicken to get wet :P I didn't dry out until like, 6 though. Laura Kim and Steve left at about 3.30, and then Karissa and Misha left around 4.30, and Tom, Sean and Nana left about 5 ish. I dropped off Laura's container, and went over to Nick's place, and waited for him to come home from work. A pleasent surprise. We made out for a while and said hi to his sister and brother in law, and then made out more, and then I went home cause I was feeling sick :( Stupid heatstroke. Totally made my mom freak out though, cause I didn't call her until like, 8.30 :)   I'm going shopping today, I think. Find some more stuff for Laura. Return the damn pants. Better get running on that. Have a great day, y'all.
