I was supposed to work the concessions at brother's tournament, but it turned out that my mom got the time wrong so we were like 2 hours early. I wasn't about to wait two hours for it, so I said screw that and went home. You know you're a loser when the highlight of your day is working concessions at your brother's basketball tournament, on Valentine's Day no less. I want someone to buy me flowers and take me out. Lol, can you say pathetic?! Meh, there's like 4 episodes of Law and Order on tonight so its all good. There I go again...LOSER!!!
