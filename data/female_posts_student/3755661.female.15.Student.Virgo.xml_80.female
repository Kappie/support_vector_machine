I was getting dressed on Tuesday morning and I had all my clean clothes in a heap on my top bunk (stupid bunk beds, I figured that I would have outgrown them by now, but I can't say I don't love them).  My normal school clothes are as follows: blue jeans and a t-shirt My normal summer clothes are as follows: blue jeans rolled up to the knee and a t-shirt with the sleeves and neck cut out. I have soooo much variety.  I love it. I find myself entirely and utterly amusing.  If that makes me egotistical then so be it, I could use a little self esteem.  I don't know what I would do if I didn't have myself to amuse me all of the time.  Don't get your knickers in a twist now, for fear not, I am not off my rocker.  It just gets lonely being an extrovert in a family of introverts.  They all like their 'alone time' (as do I at times) but I need at least some human contact during the day. I had another good laugh at myself this morning.  I dreamed that my mom was yelling "Brielan (what a cumbersome name, tis my full name though, pronounced bree-linn) get your butt out of bed!!"  What made it so funny was that she had left for work a couple hours before and I was sleeping.  It was at the exact moment that my mother at work said to herself "brie's dad is going to be pounding on the door and she's going to be sound asleep, I hope she wakes up."  I certainly thought it was my mom yelling at me (that is how she wakes me up in the mornings for school, I don't believe in alarm clocks. Though the case is really that I have yet to find one that will wake me up.) I was up and out of bed in an instant.  then I laughed because it was just a dream.  I wonder if they have Jones Soda all over the world.  It would be a shame if they didn't.  Fufu berry is my favourite flavor. I have a soft spot for the creme soda though, tis wonderful.  How could a person not love Jones Soda?  In the mornings when my dad comes in with my newspaper I just sit and drink my soda and read my politics.   Amazingly I have no political knowledge on the subject of politics even though I read dutifully about them everyday.  Maybe I've picked something up without even realizing it. All I know is that Bush is the first president since 1911 to actually visit the UP.  And he makes good jokes about Kerry and Edwards.  But then I'm always reading in my democratic newspaper about how wonderful Kerry is, then I pick up my republican newspaper and read about Bush's wonderfullness.  One of my favourite things in the world to do is to find the bias in the writing of others.   When I write essays for school I always trash humans, I don't do it intentionally, its just that you can use the faults of the human race to your advantage in just about anyway imaginable.  speaking of writing for school, I just finished my summer essay this afternoon.  I love the last sentence even though it makes no sense really. "A love forbidden is a love that shakes with its strength, tears with its pain, and escapes the world with lives in its grasp."  Isn't it lovely.  It always stinks writing essays in the summer though, because I haven't met the teacher properly and can't write directly to the teacher.  Thats a benefit of being in school.  You get to know your english teacher and can write exactly what they want to hear. I never mastered that with my honors 2 teacher though.  She just hated everything I wrote, even if it was good and she (albeit, grudgingly) had to give me an A.  I think she disliked me because I didn't respond the way she wanted to a question when I first met her.  She asked me: "If you could be anywhere right now instead of being here, where would you be?"  my response was "A deserted island." She scowled at me and said "Why?" so I said "Because I wouldn't have to deal with the ignorance of my classmates and teachers."  yeah I know it was rude, but I was a rude froshmen at the time.  She had just rueamed me for having a name that wasn't spelled phonetically and I was a little peeved at her. So I was rather quiet, actally silent, when we were introduced to the Honors 3 teacher. I don't want him to hate me. I was in his book club for a couple of weeks in the begining of my soph year, but had to quit because it was too much. I still have one of his books.  Okay, you know how when a car drives by the headlights make funny marks on the walls as they pass. Well theres one thats not moving on the porch.  so my brain says: Theres a car in your driveway that has its lights on. They're gonna come and try to rape you!! So I'm gonna go hide upstairs in my room.  I shouldn't be awake right now anyway.  Rent a foreign film.  Brie
