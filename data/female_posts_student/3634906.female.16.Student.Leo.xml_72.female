Anyways I got up and showered and all and then I went to Britts and I just got home. It was a good time... We basically just sat around her house and talked for awhile. A long long while. And then Mandy and James came over too. We all just hung out for a few hours. It was fun though.     Epp ... we went by Boz's today!!! But he wasnt home... I just wanted to cry... I miss that kid!!! He's my buddy and he never seems to be around when I want him to. Oh well... So I sent him an email telling him that we missed him again!!!   I talked to Veronica tonight... She told me that I really need to get Amanda to be able to go to the bonfire on friday... and guess who else... dun dun dun... Kait and Ellen want me to invite Chad... So I need to get ahold of him and see if he wants to come... He probably wont but I still think that I should ask... I mean it would be fun if he came... I havent seen him in an ubber long time... ubber, what a funny funny word. haha... So I need to either talk to him tomorrow online or call him... and I need to find out asap about what time we are done sailing...  eep ... I dont want to make anyone feel pressured but I really want to make it out to Veronica's at an okay time... Chadd really wants Amanda there... haha... cute!!! I dont know if she wants to come... We'll see...   I dont think that my braces are going to come off for school!!! :( I am so bummed... I've had them way too long... and I want them off now!!!!  NOW !!!  GRRR ...
