It's not weird being a senior, tho i thought it would be. What's weird is looking at Jeffrey and Jessica and AJ and thinking about them being juniors. That makes me feel old. And none of them are taking AS. I'm dissapointed, but I can't really blame them. band and AS and a job plus their very active families would be a lot to swallow. Still, they're old. Only they're babies. I wonder if they'd be offended that I thought like that.  I love our teachers this year. Dave. Heather. Lee. I wish we never had to spend time with the rest of the band, or espescially other instructors. I wish it could just be us all day.  I'm learning to march. The drum doesn't even hurt my back anymore. Of course I have like the smallest one, heh. My legs cramp a lot tho - not that that's new, it's just a pain when marching.   It's still raining. That makes me so happy. So relaxed, and still very delierious. Ignore the bad spelling. Ignore this whole entry - it's full of senseless rambling and poor grammar too.   my friends laugh at me cuz when they say something bad about the pit and i get defensive, or when i'm excited over something like my car, my eyes get really big.  yup.  there's this freshman named Rickey, he's a doll. his brother graduated my first year, and then last year his sister came and we were friends, and now he's here, and so excited about everything. it's so easy to work with kids like him.   Billy is playing the timpani in the ballad. he's a brave kid. I'll miss him when I graduate.   I want something, but I danno what. Besides sleep- that's obvious. I danno why I'm this tired, but it's kinda fun. Anyway, happy unbirthday.
