Well last friday i spent packing and relaxing... it was a lot of fun... not really i got so bored i begged my parents to take me to walmart, and that was the hilight of my day.  Saturday the band left for San Diego, California is GORGEOUS.  I loved it there, after we got to the hotel, we walked to this cute little outdoor mall a few blocks away, it was quite fun.  They had an Old Navy, so of course, I have a new pair of jeans now.  The entire evening i walked around trying to form the word "Berkely California."  I could NOT think of it, and consequently drove Jenna Lilyquist and Ricky INSANE.  Sorry guys.  Oh, that reminds me... what movie was Ben Affleck in before he did Bounce with Gwenith Paltrow????  Sunday we hit the beach.  Oooh the Pacific, soo pretty.  We went strolling on the beach, got to check out some cute Cali surfers.  The beach dudes were so nice.  Then Ricky and I went searching for food.. Laura and Merky didn't eat, they were too busy buying new outfits to remedy their wet ones... serves them right for going waist deep in the ocean.  We called MK, and made her sad... I"M SORRY MK I WISH YOU HAD BEEN THERE.  Anyway, i had yummy greek food for lunch, then we went back to the hotel to practice for the concert.  The drive back was basically just me smacking Sean Sutton for playing that stupid video game... goodness gracious.. be social kid!  We rehersed and changed into concert blacks and we were off to Belboa Park... possibly the most beautiful park I have seen.  The buildings and museams in that place were awesome!  To bad we were all to cold to move much, and we were shipped out of there as soon as the concert was over so we didn't get to see much.  After our wonderful (not so) concerts, it was off to Old Town for some Mexican food.  The food was great, though it was really cold and we ate outside.  Then we did some shopping and i scared myself w/ pictures from a whale book... oo those things are huge.. which brings me to Monday.  We went Whale watching.. it was awesome and the ocean was perfect and the dolphins and the the the... cold!!!  Then, just when we thought we would never see a whale.. ta daa.. two gray whales.. right there at your service.  They were really really big.. i was nervous.... yes i admit it... I'M AFRAID OF WHALES!!!!  So, with that said, where did we go next? yep, Sea World... dang Shamu is huge!... no living creature should be bigger than an elephant... it's just not right.  But Sea world was fun.. for a while.. then i got really tired of it... it was cold and i was getting really sick of dolphins... understandably.  We went to shamu's house of douse and DIDN'T EVEN GET WET! i don't know how that was possible... but oh well.. it was prefectly FINE with me.    Next day we went to... ooo so exciting... DISNSEYLAND... THE happiest place on earth.  and it was supposed to rain but DIDN'T yay.  Well i can't say enough about Disneyland.. except that Disney World is still better... however.. disney is awesome.. aahh i loved it there... On a side note.. i love this year's freshmen.. they're just awesome.   Well thanks to Seth and Kyle i got to go on Splash Mountain and Indiana Jones both within 30 min w/ ZERO wait.. that was special.  The Marching Band didn't do too badly i thought, it was pretty good considering about 75% didn't know their music.  But ahh well.  Well Sean Sutton is an impressive kid... he started with $380 and spent every last dollar... on who? his family!.. only $16 of that 380 he spent on himself.. everything else were gifts for family.. i was very impressed.  Well.. the flight home was uneventful... if you call the stomach flu uneventful.. yeah right.. needless to say, my new years sucked.  and i'm still woozy.. oh well.. i will recover.  Well now.. i do homework.. till i DIE  Sorry to bore you with my super fun trip to California... wish you had been there!!  aawww that's precious.. aww i love my freshmen!
