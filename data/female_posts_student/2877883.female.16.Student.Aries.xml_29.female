I am actually so excited because I really want to have a Eiffel Tower shaped birthday cake too.  And have everybody dressed French-like.  Off the shoulder shirts, berets, spiky little shoes, the works.  Oh and crepes.  My loves.  How does this sound?  Good I hope.  Oh man I'll have to make some French looking invites too.  Exciting.
