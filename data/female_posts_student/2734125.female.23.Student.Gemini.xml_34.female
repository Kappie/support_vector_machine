There are angle cards in Spanish sitting and waiting to tell the future.  There is a chess set made of stained glass, and there is me, tired and listening to the sound of my computer fan.  Why am I writing here?   I am so much more aware of it then I was before.  There is a dream of chaotic sex and violence waiting for me behind my eye lids, there is a moment of utter calm in the face of unknowable dark flashes of thought.  There is a place that my mind will curve in, like I am making the final lap, and then I will be gone.  There is a place waiting in the quiet of my bed, naked and warm, flannel and cotton laying me in a cocoon of possibly friendship, and it is waiting to hear my under thoughts.  The ones that are making their way into the cave of my memory, lost cats wandering the hallways of my palace of mind.  What I want, I long for, right now in this place of sleepy layered light, I want someone to lay beside me and listen to my rambling thoughts pour out as I drift into oblivion.  I will be telling them a story and suddenly be aware that I am not following my self made plot but another line altogether, and suddenly I am skipping words and making sentences with no ending or beginning.  I want to be held like that, in the dying sentences listened to by hearing that is fading into a self made noise, but has enough strength to reach around me and tell me good night, sweet dreams, travel far and wide, and make love to me in exotic places on the plain of your dream world.
