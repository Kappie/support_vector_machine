I invited a friend over to my place and she brought someone else who I don't get along with at all, this girl picked a fight with my friend about what "Home should feel like" and when she lost that argument she decided to argue with me this girl was clearly wrong and refused to admit it so I refused to fight, I told her "there is no point in arguing we weren't going to agree and the currency exchange rate from Canada to the u.s. is of no concern to me at this point in time" so she pouted and forced my friend to drive her home I didn't even have a chance to talk and visit with my friend who I don't often see because of this other girl. After they left I looked up the exchange rates online and she was wrong, $100 American is not worth $166 Canadian... And the rudest thing of all, I bought dinner for everyone tonight and not so much as a "thank you" from this girl who thinks she knows it all.
