Chelsea coming over was a bit of a mistake... holy shit her friends are gay!! she made me spend like 2 hrs on the computer while she talked to her gay friends that think they're so cool just because they took a shot of light beer, yeah kids you'll get drunk off that!! Dumb ass.... so I go on line for a little cheer up this mornin, well right now, and www.addictedtosimpleplan.com is ending!!! What a fuckin lousy start to the new year!!! I lived off that sight!! I got all of my info there I mean what the hell!!! But I said I wanted big changes so there ya go..... I'm really upset though I hate the ending of anything it gets me really sad no matter what it is... Is it wronge that I actually kinda teared a bit at the fact that it's over?? oh well. On a bit of a better note... Simple Plan last night on mtv, fuckin awesome!!!! I loved it! David is so hot!!! oh wait...... if you watched did you notice a tatoo on him??? Well I did and it's hot!! I wonder if it's real??... I hope so, so yeah there cover song, awesome! I hate hip hop rap w/e the fuck that shit is but when the drums and guitar hit those noted it's awesome. For once I actually enjoyed "Where's the love" I mean they are good lyrics and everything and I respect them it's just the background music is not my style ya know? Ohhh so awesome though. An the pierre on guitar, don't get me started! oh anyway it's the new year so rock on! I stayed up til' like 6 am watch Viva La Bam, the one with the bee's I laughed my ass off mfg, my tummy was hurting this morning from it! so Happy New Year bye.... PS: ohh what really bugged me about Chelsea's friends is how cool they all think them selves to be, they are all "peace out man" and "l8ter" ya okay spelling it like this "l8ter" doesn't make you any cooler than you and your dog getting it on you fags!! They are so gay!!! bye!
