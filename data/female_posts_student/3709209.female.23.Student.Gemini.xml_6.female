"ummm yeah, of course" was my reply.  hey, my mama always said i could do A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G, so i trusted that she was right.  one small catch, i'd be workin' the graveyard shift forkliftin' all of those daaaaaaaaamn OC papers.  not exactly my dream job.  sadly, i turned the job down.  who knows, i coulda woulda shoulda been o-town's first female forklifter.  now that's an accomplishment.
