Gotta make this short and sweet, because I'm about to pass out with tiredness and excitement - DETROIT PISTONS BEAT THE LAKERS by 10 points tonight to go up 2 games with one game still left at the Palace! Can't wait till Tuesday to see the Lakers go down! Hahahahahaha, *does evil dance*  Although I do still feel bad for Karl Malone...poor guy...atleast he's got his daughter's WNBA title to stare at for another year...he could so scratch of that "W"...no one would know the difference...
