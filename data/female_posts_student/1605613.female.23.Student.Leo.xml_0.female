At first, I thought they were talking about an acting position, considering Hernandez's shitty job with the Atlanta ball club last y ear. Neither side could be reached, but rumors with us high ranking connected guys tell me that the Devil Rays are pussy hurt the Yankees nabbed Flash Gordon, and they responded but getting their own dark skinned pitcher. Last year with Atlanta, Roberto went 5-3 with a 4.35 ERA. He posted a horrible 1.73 WHIP, walking 43 people in 60 IP.     Roberto after blowing another save.
