Don’t expect things to neatly fall into place – and forget about sticking to a sensible schedule or routine. Last minute changes, including cancellations, may occur. Just brace yourself and remain philosophical. Keep in mind that any upcoming change is probably a good thing. Saturday begins with a set of expectations that may be tough to live up to. Don’t box yourself or others into an impossible corner. If you’re counting on others to behave a certain way or do a certain thing, you may be disappointed. It’s best to just clear your mind and let things happen as they will. Give up pointless control fantasies and try to live in harmony with your surroundings. Minimize stress and noise every chance you get because your nerves are already pretty raw. Saturday night is your reward – pleasing and very enjoyable. Sunday has even more to offer, especially if you’re creative. Inspired and imaginative, you rediscover your muse and move forward with an important project.    yea i no lol its fuckin gay i hope tomorro is good... well i was looking up compatiblity on line between signs and it says that i would get bored witha scorpio and his hermit life style but i would be transfixed with him for ever ... and im compatible with an aquarius ... so if you are an aquarius fuckin ... call me lol yea ok bye
