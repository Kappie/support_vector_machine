She eats so much that she can't take down what she eats; consequently, the food takes a joy ride back up and out of her throat and onto my stuff-- namely, my shower and other various types of floors.  I was going to be on time for rehearsal this time, but given that I had to clean and disinfect the bathtub before I could take a shower in it, that didn't happen.  When I walked in, B wanted an explanation for my tardiness. When I explained that, if she really wanted to know, Asia had vomited everywhere, she didn't seem to believe me.   Honestly-- I always have valid unbelievable excuses. I really don't make any of them up, but they're all so strange that I'm pretty sure that she never believes me and simply always thinks I overslept. *Sigh*  The day dragged on all right, I suppose, until a minor meeting with a sordid, lanky senior shrew witch whose name I don't even know but who seems to hate me for no apparent reason, as every time I run into her, she's very mean to me. Maybe because I'm white. Maybe because I'm white and foreign (she's African American). What's up with the supposedly dissolved grudges still lingering? I mean, really. Some people just need to grow up. It isn't my fault that whites used to treat blacks like crap-- much less is it my fault since my ancestors  weren't even here.            Grr.  A seemingly depressed mood has fallen over the house today-- mostly because of my grandmother. I really do think she is ill, this time, though. She doesn't appear fine at all, and she's not. Besides, my getting the "you know I don't really hate you and I'm actually really proud of you" speech from her, an intonation that I've never experienced with my grandmother before, scares me. I'm pretty scared, indeed. I think she's really going this time, and I know it will be hard on my mom. Heck, though I never thought it'd be that hard on me, it'll be hard on me, too. But she's still here now.    I have to do piles of work tonight-- roughly 3/4 of the chemistry problems plus the homework for tonight, all because of that stupid honor choir rehearsal tomorrow. I sort of wish I hadn't committed now.    God loves me, on the other hand. I had discovered that B accidentally told me to learn Alto I for All State when it turns out that I was really assigned to Alto Ia (which is totally different), and I talked to B about it today. She said that I should be able to simply tell the judges of her mistake as well as how the part is more in my range anyway, and they shouldn't mind. What a relief-- I was about to worry there.   Okay, well, I think it's time for a conclusion. I think I've decided that I'm going to try to scoowample to remember to post an honorary quote or two daily, for some of the stuff that people tell me is simply too hilarious, and I wind up writing it down most of the time anyway. And the winners are...   "Life is a sad, sad place." --Ryan (in History, expressing his feelings in an inadvertently non coherent fashion)  "Tears, Francesca, tears! Salty, tear-shaped tears!" --Kayla (if you really want to know, you ask her. I'm not even going to bother.)   I'm so hungry. Mmmm... coffee...   "Coffee and TV" by Blur   Do you feel like a chain store Practically floored One of many zeros Kicked around bored  Your ears are full but you're empty Holding out your heart To people who never really Care who you are   So give me coffee and tv easily I've seen so much, I'm going blind and braindead virtually Social ability is hard enough for me Take me away from this big bad world and agree to marry me So we can start over again  Do you go to the country It isn't very far There's people there who will hurt you 'Cause of who you are  Your ears are full of their language there's wisdom there you're sure Till the words start slurring And you can't find the door   So give me coffee and tv easily I've seen so much, I'm going blind and braindead virtually Social ability is hard enough for me Take me away from this big bad world and agree to marry me So we can start over again  So we can start over again   P.S.: Regardless of whether you know or know her not, please keep my friend Heather in your thoughts/prayers. Her husband is in the army and will soon be sent off to Iraq. This is particularly hard for her because they have only been wed since November 2003. Thanks.
