Some say love, it is a razor  that leaves your soul to bleed.  Some say love, it is a hunger.  an endless aching need.  I say love, it is a flower,  and you its only a seed.   It's the heart afraid of breaking  that never learns to dance.  It's the dream afraid of waking  that never takes the chance.  It's the one who won't be taken,  who cannot seem to give,  and the soul afraid of dyin'  that never learns to live.   When the night has been too lonely  and the road has been too long,  and you think that love is only  for the lucky and the strong,  just remember in the winter  far beneath the bitter snows  lies the seed that with the sun's love  in the spring becomes the rose.   ______..___8"=,,88,_.__________________   _______8""=""8'__"88a88'_______________   __.._.;88m_a8___,8""_"8________________   ___"8"'__"88"__A"_____8;_______________   _____"8,__"8___8_______"8,_____________   ______"8___8,__8,_______"8_____________   _______8,__"8,_"8,_______8,____________   _______"8,__"8,_"8mm""""""8m.__________   ________"8,am888i"'___I3,mm"___________   ________,8"___8"__I3.m888"_____________   _______,88P"""""I3I888888______________   _______"'_________"I888________________   ____________________"I8________________   _____________________"I8_______________   ______________________"I8_____________-    Meaningful lyrics... a lovely song~   Basically... I think I'm quite an approachable person but it takes time to understand me better. Hmn... quite emotional and sentimental too. I love the people around me. I'm a perfectionist, so I guess I have lots of expectations. At times I may feel a little lost and confused, but thanks to those who have been guiding me on the way.  A hopeless romantic here too... hmn, enjoy star gazing on a starry starry night, loves the beach, loves roses, loves beautiful music, loves purple, pink, rainbow... , loves every single bit of the natural beauty on this Earth...  Thank God and the dear ones around me for what I am today.   " Friends like you don't grow on tress. I know that this is true, but if friends were flowers, there is no doubt how qickly I'd pick you"   "Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly. There is no beginning or end. Yesterday is history. Tomorrow is mystery. Today is a gift. Dream what you want to dream, Go where you want to go, Be what you want to be. Because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do..."    A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had.  It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.  It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone-but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.   Hmn... just a few reflections here. It may ring a bell because these sayings are rather common. However, I do agree with it totally. Read it again... and you will be able to understand how I feel...   That's all then... wow~ long entry! anyway... there will be more coming up! Special thanks to Denise aka Da Jie and meow meow for helping me to set up this blog... tata =)
