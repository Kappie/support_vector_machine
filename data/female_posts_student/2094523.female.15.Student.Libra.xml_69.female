Do u ever wonder what everyone is gonna be like 30 years from now? well i do and i dont. coz thinking ahead of time is really pretty pathetic. coz u dont know whether ure gonna be alive 30 years from now..hell u dont know if ure gonna be living the next day. and once u dont acheive ure dreams it brings u down ..so live life as it comes live each day as it flies.
