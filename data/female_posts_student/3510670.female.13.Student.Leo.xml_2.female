They bought wanna win.. cause Chris wanna retain the hevy weight campion belt.. but Shawn want the title so badly, muntik na nga siya manalo eh.. all he had to the is cover chris for the count, kaya lang Triple H showed up  did something to shawn (dunno what move was that eh) if it wasn't for Triple H, maybe shawn is already our new WWE Heavy weight champion.. di ko nga lam kung sino kakampihan kon eh..oo nga pala, hehe.. something showed up from shawn michaels (kita nyo ba un?! hehe). Anyway, can anybody tell me when the judgement day is?! im so exited to see John Cena kick Rene Dupree's ass..!!!
