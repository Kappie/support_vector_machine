April doesnt know this but when i was asigned to polish the weapons and thingys, i kinda...used them..i sneaked out and went on my own patrol. i dusted my first vamp!!!was cool...you know... it turning to dust and all...it was awesome...and the energy i felt was fantastic...power.... i felt ultimate power...
