(in other words, it hurts when i walk but im not sure why) and my face is burrrrned. it'll be gone by tonight though. so i had a good time! rodney damn near killed me and holly on the tube. he was ruthless. i only fell off once, and that was because i let go and leaned out. lol. holly fell out the first time we rode, and i didnt. i dont see how. it was insane. but the time i "fell out", that was the worst. it was so rough and he was doing all kinds of crazy stuff. we were airborne most of the time. not to mention it was a long ride because we were going to the middleof the lake to swim. oh wait, i got that confused. but it doesnt matter, so im not gunna fix it.  today...   another wasted day. maybe i'll get to spend some time with someone though.  i love the people that i love. they make me happy.
