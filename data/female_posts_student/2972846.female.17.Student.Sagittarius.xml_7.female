THAT was the best dying-scene ever created - EVER, ever! actually this is the only scene that reveals the black humour for those un-chosen un-few...well, except for that fighting master, what´s-his-name - that was the total "demaskage" :p of the seriousness and it was so obvious that i didnt really like him sooo much. still...still the movie is brilliant overall. :) :) :)  just heard a cool song on the radio- it was muse i found out! i decided to like muse. so now i´ll say: i like muse. but i cant say i listen to muse, cos i dont own any records yet. i´ll get them from somewhere...like a record shop :P  i wonder how many people in the world know that antananarivo is the capital of madagaskar AND know that ouagadougou is the capital of burkina faso AND know that funafuti is the capital of tuvalu. well i do. I DO know that. and i WILL also know the exact place of these countries in the world till monday! hah!  ebony and ivory - i love that combination in a describtion. "...her ebony curls framed her heart-shaped face, and although they made a stark contrast with the ivory teint they matched perfectly and made her stick out of the crowd and look very royal..."  "...her name was Redd Brue and he was Blake Wyte..." "...his longish, tocotronic-like hairdo was of the deepeset, most intensive red she´d ever come across. it exposed the rough facial features and made the slightly tanned skin shine golden. the freckles that were spread all over his face made him look even more wild and tough. but the real cause of the slight shiver which ran down her spine was the eyes. she´d never-ever thought that this color was possible, it seemed to her that all the blue pigments ever created were intensified and cummulated in them. now that she was gaping into these eyes she remembered a hero in a book she recently read about. which book was it? she saw the indigo-turquis eyes of that hero in Blake´s - she hardly could believe her "dream eyes" which she had thought were not possible to exist were in her focus now. what book was it? which one? then she remembered: it was pope joan."   hey and i thought i was aus der übung gekommen! cool :) i love that one. redd brue and blake wyte. gonna start a new book...a new book. a new book. incl. my thoughts. about redd and blake. but i dont really like the surnames of them, especially "brue". what if it´s not redd but wyte? blake and wyte.  "..."blake, i love you. i always have." wyte was staring down, not daring to to meet his eyes, her mouth slightly trembling. he grabbed her shoulders violently and shook her very hard. "wyte!" he shouted at her, "wyte, why are you playing with me? how can you be so cruel? just tell me: why are you doing this to me?" he pushed her away from him and stared at her, true agony on his face.   "blake. i am sorry if i...i, oh blake, just believe me, believe me that i really love you," she said with a trembling voice, tears streaming down her face. "i am telling you the truth now." she looked up to meet his eyes. the pain on his face was gone - but that expression of his eyes - she couldn´t bear looking at him. she wanted him to change this look, she wanted to see the bluish sparks when he was laughing, she wanted him to be happy. he is the one i love, wyte thought.  i haven´t been mistaken. but why is it so hard to make him believe that this time i am serious?  (...) "wyte," he said calmly.  "yes?" she turned around and faced him. "i love you," he whispered and kissed her. "why, blake?" she asked when this statement had sunk in and the wave of joy had gone through her whole body.  "i don´t know...let me think...i love you because you are yourself. and not somebody else. does this answer satisfy you?" "oh yes. it´s the best answer to this question." she smiled lovingly at him and started counting his freckles once again. "i love you," she added when she got to the 46th freckle..."  *lol* this is so cute !!! i like the idea with the freckles.
