Anyways, I found this thing that said the CD was written after he had this terrible breakup or some shit... Me:  Starts to cry  Liz: "What's wrong?"  Reads the quote  "Well, they're not together anymore!" Me:  Continues to cry  Liz: "Are you upset, because of the fact that he's had a girlfriend?" Me: "YES, how did you know?!"  Liz, you know me too well.
