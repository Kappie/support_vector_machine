We’ll just keep denying that August is around the corner and just keep telling ourselves that maybe this year it won’t come. Maybe if we’re quiet enough and we all get out ALL of our sweaters (in Texas that's like THREE), Summer will forget about us in all of our deserts and cows and nothingness, and just pass us up, leaving us in modest double-digit temperatures with regular precipitation patterns.   Hey, I can dream.  The thunder is rollllling across the sky like bowling balls right now. Then there is that occasional  BANG!  that makes my heart skip a beat. And now it’s pouring. Hammers falling from the sky.   I could so use a piece of apple pie and an episode of Full House right now. There is nothing like Uncle Jesse, a loud scary thunderstorm, and a 1200 calorie dessert to make a girl feel all warm and cozy inside.
