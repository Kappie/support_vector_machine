I could swear he really despises me.... So what's the point of having a relationship with him... I love hi... but... We get into way too many fights.... So if he doesn't talk to me anymore... Imma ahve to cancel the Plane tickets over there.... :( I really wanna work this out but he keeps thinking I don't.... -_- Well I got nottin else to say....   Ashley
