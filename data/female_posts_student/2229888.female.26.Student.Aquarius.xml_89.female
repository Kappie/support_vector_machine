Look Muse! I'm begging for scraps here!  Haven't I been good to you? Haven't I fed you classic poetry and good art?"  Muse takes a drink of chocolate milk and responds.  "What about that Mad magazine and those episodes of Jerry Springer? I spoke to Conscience. I know he warned you about them, gave nice little dollops of advice and warnings against brain rot.  Now I've gotten used to easy entertainment, and I'm not into working up a sweat. Go away. Leave me alone.   Wait a sec. I have an idea.   Why don't you pop a couple of hot-pockets in the microwave and move from in front of the tube. You're a pain, not a window!   Oh great! Now I missed what Montel was saying! Thanks alot..."
