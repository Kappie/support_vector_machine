If it was a list of the greatest performances in the last 25 years, than yes, Anthony Hopkins would make that list, but not this one. Maybe you have been corrupted by movies like  Eternal Sunshine  into believing what all those spoiled critics out there believe.  Eternal Sunshine  was a creative movie, but because it was written by Charlie Kaufman, critics(and you) have to say that it is "an amazing piece of film making" or "one of the best films in the last twenty years". But they don't want to see that there are glaring holes in the movie, the same goes for Hannibal Lector as a great villain. It's the "Hollywood" answer to a difficult question. Choosing the AFI's choice for greatest villain lacks imagination and originality. We our here to dive into the deep end of pop culture, not hang out in the kiddy pool.   The Empire Strikes Back  is the best movie within the first  Star Wars Trilogy . The main reason behind that is the fact that the Emipre triumphs. Luke gets his hand chopped off, Han is frozen in carbonite, and what is still the greatest cliffhanger in the history of cinema, Luke finds out that Darth Vader is his father.  Return of the Jedi  is the weakest film in the first trilogy, and the main reason behind that(other than the Ewoks) is that Darth Vader saved Luke and killed the Emperor. But Darth Vader, in The Empire Strikes Back, at the peak of his vileness is the greatest villain in the history of the universe.  For now I will move on to my next villain. Alonzo Harris( Training Day ), played by Denzel Washington, is a great villain for a number of reasons. Going into this movie I remember wondering if the man that starred in  Remember the Titans ,  Crimson Tide , and  The Pelican Brief  could play a villain. But, within minutes, those hesitations are dispelled by my fascination with the complexities of his character in  Training Day . It's a testament to Washington's talent that we are convinced of his evil nature and still seduced by him. From the first moments of this film Harris taunts, inspires and even drugs the rookie he is training. The thing that makes Alonzo so intriguing(and disturbing) is that he is supposed to be a protector, someone we trust, someone we depend on. He is evil on a level that most movies don't dare go. And the most amazing thing about this character is that he does all this with a clear conscience. It is tempting to attribute the film's potency to Denzel's riveting performance as Det. Alonzo Harris. So with that, my third entry to this list has been given.  Only two left, and my last villain of this post is Agent Smith from  The Matrix . Like Darth Vader I am going to focus on one of the three movies he was in, and in this case, the first movie. Agent Smith embodied everything we love in a great villain, infinite knowledge, god-like strength, and a undeniable hatred for the hero, and with Agent Smith a hatred for the human race. Now anyone that hates a whole race has to be classified as a uber-villain. Anyone who refer's to the human race as cancer is a diabolical baddie. Smith is an excellent intimidator, complemented nicely by his spooky devotion to perfect annunciation. Consumed by his superiority over humans, he never believed in the prophecy that a savior would come to rescue humanity, and ultimately destroy him. Cool, calculating, and an unrelenting resolve make him a easy choice for my list.  In closing I suppose I will give one last guess at your #1 movie villain. I have to say I am somewhat stumped but for the sake of the website I will go with John Doe, Kevin Spacey from Se7en. I don't think that is it, but I think that is good guess because John Doe is another underrated villain. I look foward to hearing what you have to say on Alonzo Harris and Agent Smith, and I also look foward to you unveiling your #1.
