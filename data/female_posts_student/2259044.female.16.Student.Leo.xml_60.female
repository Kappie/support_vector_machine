"he only thinks he's better than you because you do" that's the way it is.  if  u  think he's the greatest thing on earth, if u don't think ur worthy of him, then that's the way the relationship is going to be! if u don't act his equal, if u don't take the upper hand, then u might as well be submissive, cuz u've given him permission to be cocky! i think it's often hard for those of us who weren't the beautiful, popular ones early on, to have a load of confidence.  it's the ugly-duckling syndrome, u just never feel that ur not ugly anymore...i don't know how to describe it to those of you that were born amazing and everyone always liked you, i'm not saying u didn't have ur own entire set of troubles, i think that's equally difficult, but at least now, ur willing to take the upper hand on things, and u dont take peoples crap just cuz u think u deserve it. another disadvantage to not having confidence, is paranoia. i no that sounds weird, so maybe it's just me, but i always feel like people r making fun of me, or that i'm the stupid one, that i'm the lame one, or the fat one, or the ugly one, and everyone around me is just watching me screw up. i don't know why all of a sudden i'm writting about my low self-esteem so often, cuz i think i used to have a lot of confidence....it's just...don't worry about it, i'm done....changedfish
