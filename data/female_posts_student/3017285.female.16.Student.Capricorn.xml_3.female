Except for the fact that, you know, Paris should die, and Menelaeus shouldn't, and that CASSANDRA WAS NOT EVEN IN THERE!!!  But damn, wasn't Achilles cool? Very cool. Extremely cool. So was Hector. Paris was just a little wimp who couldn't even get killed properly. It's weird, though, how they just sort of cut out 10 years and had the seige last about..oh 4 days, maybe? 5?  I've added Greek war Helmet to my list of cool hats I want. XD
