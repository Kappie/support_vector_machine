I dont want what happened to megan beasly to happen to her. she is my best friend and i could not stand by and let people hold meetings about her i would have to say something. I think one of the problems is that chris, col, and kayla all have the same personalities are too similiar. they all know what they want and will do anything to get it, and you cant change any one of their minds for anything! but dont get me wrong i love them all, but if you put them all in a room they would kill each other!!! I just think that kayla works hard and she might not be the easyist person to work with but neither is chris or col. Chris if you read this you know how rotc is, you hear things i just dont want people to think that kayla did something wrong by not going to SLS. Her little sister was being born for christs sake. and i heard her tell MSgt and col that she didnt want to go because sarah was being born then.  so i dont think they or anybody else should be mad at her for not going. so if later in the year something comes up with her i think that so far she has done an outstanding job and should not have to deal with little meeting that people have to talk about her i think it is wrong and i stand by every choice she has made, it may not have been the best sometimes, but this is JROTC we are here where we can afford to make mistakes, and we learn from them, so i hope that people will realize that we all make mistakes.
