We'll duke it out over chord changes for a while - I'm right  , but I'll give in if I gotta.  Won't ever get me much money, but it's kinda cool to know that people I never met will be singing my stuff (sorta true already - British music director used a song of mine last year, but I only wrote the lyrics).
