[ Wed Apr 30, 12:16:57 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] My nightly conversation with Alan:   crabbie3: yo baby, you there?'  crabbie3: yo, baby, are you there?  FireDancyr7: i am  crabbie3: excellent.  crabbie3: steven is my name.  FireDancyr7: really....  crabbie3: no, not really.  FireDancyr7: well this conversation is just going places  crabbie3: great, i write you 5 seconds ago and you're already criticizing my conversationsal skills.  crabbie3: i suck.  FireDancyr7: I know, but see this is why we're friends... I bring down that ultra high ego of yours to a level where people will like you  FireDancyr7: It's a balancing act  crabbie3: so basically, without you, everyone would hate me.  FireDancyr7: see now you understand the inner workings and benefits of my friendship
