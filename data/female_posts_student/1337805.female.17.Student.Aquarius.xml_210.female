Everyone here was on their tails, for the legendary Samaya was supposed to make an appearance at our house (but never did.) I answered, and it was some lady asking for "Mrs Dyer". I figured, due to the static I heard, that it was some solicitor, and I decided to get Mom's hopes up and tell her it was for her. I listened for a few minutes, only hearing, "Hi, it's Hilary...". Figuring it was someone from church, I soon forgot about it.  A few minutes later, Mom came to the computer and told me to get off. I didn't hear her, so I said, what? and she just repeated what she had said, and walked off. She never told me why, so I thought, screw it, and kept talking. A few minutes after that, Mom opened the door, and Kim barrels into the hallway, followed by Laura and everyone else. I just kept repeating, "What? What?" and went out to the hall to see who was all there. There was Kim and Laura, and Nana and Karissa, and Steve, and on the porch were Matt, Nick and Sean.. I grabbed my shoes and went out with them all, and hopped in the van with Mrs Planden, Laura, Kim, Karissa, Nana, and Matt. The others went in Sean's car, and went to get gas.   Soon after driving off, we realized that Sean didn't know where he was going (and neither did I!) so we set off to find his car at a gas station. We saw them in Petrol Canada by Elk Lake, and waited for them, and said hi to Arthur who was working. then we all took off, me still in complete mystery, as their order. We talked and laughed, and finally ended up at Romeo's, in Broadmead. we ordered our food, and while it took a long time to arrive, we had Kim for our entertainment. She was just like a little child while eating, except I almost think the kids are better behaved than she is. Even Nick was behaving himself better...  After a delicious dinner, we waited outside for our ride. We entertained the diners by goofing off, and chasing each other. Nick was picking some of us up and running around. Finally Mrs Planden showed up to take us home. Laura ran inside to get me a coat, cause I was too rushed to get one when we left home, and we set out for the video store and Spelts, to get movies and candy. We rented Shallow Hal, and Laura bought Ghost and the Darkness for herself, and Artificial Intelligence (my favorite movie) for me. Then we went to Spelts, where we all got lots of candy. We walked back to the house with laughter, and it was awesome.  When we went inside, Kim and Laura covered my eyes, and led me downstairs. There I saw a bunch of presents for me, and a huuuge giant card. I got a bag of jumbo beads, sea animal beads, star beads, regular AND FAT hemp (Which I was trying to buy earlier that day :p) all three Lord of the Rings soundtracks, a Beauty and the Beast Lollipop thing, and Birthday Bear Care bear.  :) After that, we went upstairs for strawberry mousse birthday cake (which was really yummy) and Nick entertained us all with his water drinking talents...I couldn't blow out the candles on my cake cause I was laughing so hard, but it didn't matter, Kim blew one out for me , because she was getting impatient :) (Everyone was still singing!!)   After all that, we all went downstairs to watch Shallow Hal. I ended up sitting beside Nick, and was so extremely comfortable. We were kinda snuggling together and watching the movie, but  whatever :). I think everyone who was there now has some sort of idea planted in their head, but...hey, you never know. It was a lot of fun. After the movie was done, we took a whole bunch of pictures with Steve's camera, and made a few videos with it too. It was soo funny. Around midnight, I called my dad and he picked me up, where I promptly fell asleep.  So obviously, Laura, and Kim, and Steve, and Karissa and Nana, and Nick and Sean and Matt are the best friends ever, and I love them forever for this :) :)
