It's a constant cycle of raspy cough, sneeze, rustle for tissue, snort, gaggy cough, sniffle, sniffle, sneeze. I'm sure it's a lovely symphonic melody for my fellow library cublicle drones. I actually feel a little bad about disturbing the utter silence and peaceful quiet, but *blah* I have to work to get paid. Fortunatly, I'm off at 5:15. Then I'll go meet mom and drag her to the salon. After, they're through cutting it; I get to dye it this evening. Muahahaha. My mother is actually letting me dye her head. My stylist aunt is too busy to do her hair these days. Actually, I'm good at the whole hair dying thing. I've been doing mine on and off since I was sixteen and we're not going to even discuss the point in time when the girls in my dorm realized I wouldn't make them look like a 5 year old's experiment with their first barbie. I swear, I should've been charging with the amount of hair I was dyeing in any given week. But I stil get to tease mom about the possibility of her ending up with pink hair. Muahahahaha...*eg*
