Because I've been undergoing some changes.  Maybe no one can notice, and that's fine. It's something within myself.  I have been given so many experiences since my absence from posting. I've dealt with the good in the bad in all aspects; from life to love to education, I've suddenly found myself in a different position than from when I began.  But I'm back at a crossroad.  And instead of being intent on taking the straight path like everyone else...I'm taking a little detour.  No. No, I wouldn't call it that. I wouldn't call it anything. I'm simply living my life the way it should, and that is for one purpose and one purpose solely: to live it.  There are alot of things to say, and for probably the first time in months, I have time to say them.  So I'm taking grasp of today as an opportunity to do as much as possible.  Lets start off with stating the obvious: I'm a busy person. My schedule just doesn't seem to let up or slow down right now. And honestly,  I'm loving every fast-paced second of it.  I love being busy and just getting caught up in the rush of life. It's taking me places. There's a bit of irony for all the people who seem to think my life is going nowhere. There's another thing; sometimes people try to make me seem like I'm less of a person, and maybe that could have affected me in the past, but it means nothing to me now. I know that I'm successful, and that's all that matters.  I'm going places. You could use that statement metaphorically or literally. Either way. I'm anticipating my little Europe-Africa trip in March. It's exciting. (FYI: My family is going to France, Spain and Morocco over spring break) And education-wise I feel like I'm really sitting down and saying 'okay...time to get into gear.' I'm working hard, and my grades and personal satisfaction are rewarding me.  So all in all life is good, I can't complain, I'm living and I'm loving it.  And I'm loving. That's sort of where this post takes a more solemn approach. My life is like a novel. It's like a dramatic epic. Well...maybe more of a story I suppose...my life hasn't taken on any sort of epic proportions...yet. It just puzzles me...love. To simply find satisfaction in someone; a pure, loving satisfaction that makes me feel like a complete person. To find someone who has that much undying faith in me...is incredible. And so this is my sole complaint in my life: how two people can find themselves in each other...find completion in one another, and have something stand between them. To have  life  come between two people like that. And to drive the misery out of both of them. I see it in his eyes the same way I'm sure he can see it in mine. And when he tells me how important I am to him, it kills me. It's like I want to move on, but I'm still clinging to that little bit of hope for life to work out. And I see him doing the same thing. And for that fact, I can't see how life has to be so unfair.  Otherwise, life is great. Even with that fact, life is great.  All in all...this is the beginning. Or the end. Or the climax. Or some insignificant detail inbetween.  Who cares!  Glad to be back,   crazies
