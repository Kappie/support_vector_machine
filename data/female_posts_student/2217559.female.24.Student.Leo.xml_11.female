Is he really serious when he says that people are trying to sabotage his new album?  Did anyone even know he had one coming out?  FREAK!  Okay on to better topics....  I had the best dinner last night. I ate so much I could hardly move. My grandmother cooked turkey and dressing, potato casserole, green bean casserole, cranberry sauce, venison, ham and my favorite - cherry cheese cake. Oh gosh, I should have thrown up last night because I feel like a giant cow today. Hehehe. It was wonderful and very touchable of her to cook for me.   I also got to hang out with my little cousin for awhile. I say my little cousin but she's 19 now.  We drove to the Target (30 miles away) and went shopping. I bought the In The Zone by Britney Spears - YES, I DID. I couldn't resist it - she was just sitting on the shelf looking so hot and it was 9.98.  I bought it and it might possibly be the worst album I have ever heard. Hahaha.  I guess I will listen to it a little bit more- or for as long as I can stand it. Well, after shopping my cousin stopped by this beer place and picked up some tall-boy coors lights. we drove to her school (K-12 are housed here) and sat in the parking drinking beer and smoking cigarettes and catching up. (We couldn't come back to my grandparents! Drinking is forbidden. Hahah). So we A beer and I came back to my grandparents and jumped into my favorite bed - huge cotton mattress.  I sunk in and slept until 7:00 this morning. It was a great day yesterday. I have really had an awesome time spending time with my family.   Okay, more so. Bye Paddy.
