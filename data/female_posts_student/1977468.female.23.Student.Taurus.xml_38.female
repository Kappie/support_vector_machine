Speaking of having bad converation skills, here's a tip for you all.  Never start a conversation with the words "Women are like cattle". I'm not speaking from experience. I'm not. But I've observed from other people that it seems to provoke conflict. "Women are like" is better, but be careful with what you put after that. A cunning "women are like  so cool " could be a good idea, but take heed that you do not sound incincere... hmm... you know what? I think it'd be best if we didn't even try a "women are"... don't even claim to know how to generalize women. Don't even claim to know anything about women. In fact, don't talk about women at all. Don't even try a "Women...". Thats the only way to play it safe.
