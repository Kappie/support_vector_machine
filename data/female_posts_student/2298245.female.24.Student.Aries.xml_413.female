I might meet up with some people later to go check out some fireworks.  But other than that, I'm just sitting around, doing some work, listening to the Yankees/Mets game on the radio - GO METS!  The game yesterday was awesome, by the way, back and forth, never boring, won by the Mets in the bottom of the 9th.    Take care all, and if you have a long weekend, like I do, then by all means enjoy it.  I'll leave you with my thoughts on the anneversary of the birth of our nation.  Well, it's my nation anyway, though it dawns on me that anyone from around the world might be reading this, many of you not American.  I've been in school so long that you'd think all the optimism I feel about this country would have been drilled and beaten and drained from me by skeptical and cynical professors, but my love of this country has grown even more, if for no other reason than in resistance and defiance of those self-same cynics.  This country is far from perfect.  It has things in its past - most notably slavery, though that is hardly our only transgression - that are particularly shameworthy, things that no one but a cold and heartless and evil soul could look back upon with any pride.  But this nation has survived so much, and has done so largely in tact, in the same form in which it began.  This nation may not be as old as most in the world, but it has endured in a stable form.  The Constitution of the United States has been in effect since 1789, and it has only been amended 27 times (really, you could make that 17, since the first ten came so quickly that they have almost always been a part of the Constitution itself, and they were things that many people advocated making part of the Constitution proper) in that time.  Moreover, its authority as the supreme law of the land has never been seriously challenged.  Even that most defiant of former Presidents, Richard Nixon, bended before its will when the Constitution was interpreted by the Supreme Court as not protecting under executive privilege tapes related to a criminal investigation.  All of this is to say that there is something to admire about American, and Americans, who are able to adapt to changes and circumstance, and were even able to survive the Civil War.  There's a line in the film Amistad (a wonderful movie that everyone should see) when Anthony Hopkins, playing former President John Quincy Adams, comments that the inevitable Civil War (the events take place roughly 20 years before the Civil War started) will be the "last battle of the American Revolution."  I think that the sentiment is partially correct - the Civil War was indeed fought, in part, to correct one of the glaring oversights and mistakes of the Revolution, namely that the fight should have been for the freedom of all Americans.    At the same time, though, this sentiment is wrong.  I think it is more wrong that right.  For we are still engaged in this battle, on many fronts.  And we will be as long as the nation is in existence.  But this is not a reason for pessimism.  The struggle for perfection, of constantly reaching for it, even if you never quite make it, even if you know it is impossible to acheive, is a noble endeavor.  And it is one that Americans have been engaged in since the beginning.  And it is one, I think, that will never end.
