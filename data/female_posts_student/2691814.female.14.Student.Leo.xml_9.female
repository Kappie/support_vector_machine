It looks so...there isn't a word for it. yesterday he came to school and showed the back of the bus but almost everyone including the sixth graders in the front saw! lol...right when we got into school, he went into the GIRLS bathroom and showed Tia and probably Crystal his hair...well he got caught. He also got ISS for the whole day. He didn't go to 1st period so I thought he had skipped class or something. So I asked around and I heard that he got ISS. lol..so funny. I'm sorry but I can't stand anything about jeremy he's just so....annoying in every possible way. He talks alot of *u know what* and talks bad about everyone except Cindy. Cindy's like a really good friend of mine and she's also very pretty.(I envy her and I'm not afraid to admit it lol) But like...he drools over her every time we're on the bus and of course I'm the seat between them and have no Francesca to talk to. She's in California by the way. Atleast I can talk to cindy and gabby. But I always notice jeremy talking about her and like...looking at her...in the wrong way. He's just alittle pervert I swear cuz he has no chance with Cindy. First of all she can't have a bf till she's 15 but she kinda wen't out with this really hot guy for like a few days then felt guilty and dumped hun lol. Anyway...cindy's sane. I think I might have been on drugs or something when I went out with Jeremy. I think I went crazy or something. Anyway...lets see what happens at school and I'll post later.
