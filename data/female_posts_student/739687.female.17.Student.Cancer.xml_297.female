But I'm not alone in that aspect, I'm simply alone in that I've trudged off in another direction. I think everyone has their own direction. But quite honestly, it's the mistakes that people make that truly mark how they move forward.  It amazes me how foolish I can be sometimes. It's amazing that I've made so many mistakes  already , not even considering what I have ahead of me. But the mistakes I feel the most, aren't the ones most people would expect me to feel for. I don't feel regret as much for the things I've done, as I do for the times that I missed out on. I feel for opportunities I lost, and that I screwed up. God, I've screwed up some beautiful things. I've missed out on alot of times that could have been some of the biggest opportunities in my life. Everything I backed out of....God, why do I always do that? Why do I always back out of wonderful things?  All I really know is that things will eventually have a way of working out. Maybe not to fit my picture of perfection, but maybe to fit what perfect really is.  But I suppose I should update on life. Hmm...it's good. I'm doing what I said I would...I'm making change. I'm trying to find a new life. Who knows, maybe I'm screwing everything up again.    My life is like sitting next to a bomb, waiting to see if it explodes. In other words, it's stupid, foolish, and the odds probably aren't in your favor.   But that's all I have right now.   No regrets, crazies. No regrets.
