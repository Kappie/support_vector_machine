Do I know my goals? do I have the power to achieve these goals? Or are they out of my reach. Will I forever fail to meet the high expectations I and others set for myself? I hope not.  I am one confusing chick.  Today I went to PIANO! Yeah. It was piano.  Hahha. Interesting.  She had smarties in her candy bowl! YUM  At school I just tried to get someone to take me to the Five Iron Frenzy concert. I wanna go SO stinkin' bad. So I told Sara to ask her mom if she could take us. I would seriously pay for her ticket.    Then my mom forced me to go to SPANKIES (kidna like goodwill...) to find a dress for WINTER FORMAL! HAH! I am sooo not getting a 10 dollar dress..I want a 300 dolllar one! So I went with an open mind, "Maybe I will find THE dress here..." But I didn't. Everything smelled and looked like crap. end of story.   Then we went home and I cooked dinner. It was tasty I made this basil garlic sauce and I put it on nooodles. Then I went to hip hop. Now I am home  Ohh!! My mom, brother,  and sister will be gone ALL day EVERYDAY for like a week and a half! Yipppppeee!they have dress rehersals for that play! Te heehehe! I am so sitnkin' glad I am not in it!!! :D  I better be leaving...  Adious luverly amigos!   *The Critic*   P.S. anyone want to take hip-hop? ;)
