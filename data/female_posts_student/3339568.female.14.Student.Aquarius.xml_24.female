And I thought, hey, maybe that can be my big word? Because, ok well I haven't really told ne1 this ('cept Mel) but I'll just say it anyway, I kinda have been feeling latley that God has been sending me to talk to people who don't believe in him, and tell them about Him, and Jesus and the Bible. Even people I don't like.   Like this girl called Jordan from Hamilton Island. I didn't really know her very well, but I didn't really like her much, but we got into conversation about God at mi Aunty Joey's wedding. And I was kinda scared of talking to this person, who I didn't even know, about God and I didn't know how she'd react, and I was scared because I didn't know what to say, but I felt God was telling me that I had to talk 2 her, so I did, and he gave me the words to say. After I got back from the island, i was led to speak to my good friend Danielle, who was very confused about Christianity, i explained it to her and about Jesus and what his death meant for us and everything. Feeling overwhelmed I set off to camp, where I was once again put into a situation where these things came up. I had a 3-hour canoe trip with someone who i didn't know on a personal level very well. Caitlin and I had a very in-depth conversation about religion. She used 2 be a Christian but had stopped because it was forced on her when she was little. Once again, I felt like it wasn't me talking, but God through me, if that makes sense? All these things came out of me that I had never even thought of myself, and i actually got through to her, when no-one else could. It was amazing. Exhilirating. And just the other week, I was was talking to my friend Jess as well. So many people has this come up with and it was like it wasn't me talking. I don't feel important enough for God to use me for anything, but yeh, I don't know how else to explain it, it felt like He was. So that's why I'm thinking maybe I'm on my way to evangalism and my own big word. That's why its so important to me to learn how to read the Bible and understand it, so I can inform other people about it.  So, yeh, well that was my little evangelism story, and I don't know why I even have the guts to blog this because it is kinda personal, but yeh, i just felt the need. I just pray that God can help me with this, and with reading the Bible, and that he will keep on sending people 4 me to talk 2, because I love making a difference and doing his work! :D
