Blessed with the gift of love,  yet cursed with two lovers  Why me?   He hugs me and kisses me softly  The warmth of his body envelops mine  He loves me and tells me often  openly, Unashamedly   But again why me?  Old words of truth come to mind as I ponder...  "My only love sprung from my only hate  Too early seen unknown  known too late  Prodigious birth of love it is to me  That I must love a loathed enemy"
