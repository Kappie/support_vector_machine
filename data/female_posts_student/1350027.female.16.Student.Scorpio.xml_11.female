I think Malaysia has crappy things. That or I've really lost the will to splash my money and I've become insanely stingy with my money.  I think I'll save money and go get my Bjork's Livebox CD collection. Seems like the only thing worth getting. Should I get the big black box or should I get them individual CDs? Hmm. Same price at the end of the day. Then again, I should just save the money and get her new album with the whole limited edition poster thingamajig. I wonder if it'll come out. :/  Paul's birthday was great. Loads of laughs and minimalistic food and free flow of bread and very very expensive mineral water.   Alot of people *cough* UNDERPAID *cough* but it was nice to see everyone around. Just remember people, SERVICE TAX and GOVERMENT TAX.
