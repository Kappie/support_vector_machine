Hungry for drama be it truth or tale, they eagerly echo the lawyer's words and jerk to every tweak of his wrist in perfect synchronization. beautifully sung and choreographed...now that's entertainment.  in recent weeks, i doubt that many ppl are in the mood for a little song-and-dance when the words "operation iraqi freedom" are scrolling across the bottom of america's tv screens. the same audience that couldn't be peeled away from high speed car chases and subjected itself to the stranglehold of reality shows has finally decided to take a breather, to tune in to the realest of reality.  the other night, i was flipping through the channels in the hopes of coming across one that WASN'T showing war footage. in the process, i caught a snippet of a CNN report saying something like the residents in Iraq were smiling and waving to the US planes as they flew past. interesting how the correspondents of the next channel over, canadian i believe, were reporting how the terror-stricken nation was crying out in anguish, "why are they [the US] doing this?"  can you blame me for being a little confused? one moment, i'm seeing images of our country's leaders smiling or joking on the golf greens, coming out of sunday service with their families, speaking of God and love, freedom and democracy, justice, human rights, even baseball for goodness' sakes. before i can utter God bless america, huge explosives are dropped on the heads of defenseless ppl, while the approval rating for our country's leaders keeps going up. well with names like bill and george, who would believe that they're a/immoral?   for the past few months, we've been watching a song-and-dance show debating the rightfulness of an attack on a nation that has not attacked us and knows that doing so would mean instant mass suicide. according to our gov't and media, we are targetted because of our wealth, belief in freedom and democracy, and our gosh darn simple goodness.   I read this quote somewhere by someone that goes something like this: if you want to stop anti-american terrorism, then stop giving them a reason to attack america.  what i don't understand is why it's okay to let leaders force their way around as long as the death and suffering aren't happening to americans or ppl close to them. there's no need to debate support and respect for the courage of our frontline soldiers and the value of their loyalty and lives. the real issue is a) who sent them out there in the first place, b) the intentions of the ppl who sent them out there (liberation or imperialism), and c) the destabilization of world order as a ramification of sending them out there.   of course saddam hussein is bad and evil. but isn't it a little hypocritical for the US government, one whose own judicial system is based on the principle of innocent until proven guilty, to take a proactive position of this calibur? i don't know. honestly, despite how anti-war and anti-bush i sound, i'm confused. this is just a forum for me to voice what i know are not my permanent views and opinions, but only what i'm thinking right now, so that maybe one day when i read this to myself, i'll be able to compare how much i've learned and grown. sometimes, i feel like the more you know, the harder it is to take a side, the more the red and blue start to confuse you amid the ugly grey. maybe that's why ppl just go with what's already done, or, maybe they know a heck of a lot more than i do, which is probably the case. but either way, let's make sure that we carry out our patriotic duties by not letting anyone tie a string around our fingers and feeding words into our mouths.
