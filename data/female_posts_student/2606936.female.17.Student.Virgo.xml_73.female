I may update sometime, but for now we'll just say progress is being made, and I think it's going to end up okay with Jules.    Jules just spent five days at the beach with my family and I, and I am tan as two short tan things. We spoke vaguely, without me having to directly confront her, but I think for now all I can do is listen, because she seems to know that it needs to stop, and I'm probably the only friend who wasn't thrown into a complete shaking panic by it. This may be because I know her well, or because I'm in denial, but I still refuse to shove "help" down her throat, for now. As long as she keeps talking to me instead of cutting, we can both pretend I don't know what's happened.   So, despite something that most definitely could have screwed up a vacation, the beach was fantabulous. We had some interesting encounters there, beginning on the day we arrived, Saturday.   The place we stay is a condominium thingy, which is basically shaped like an L with a pool in the crook, facing the ocean. So we'd be swimming and see these guy watching us from the balcony. If they weren't old, it was nothing to be alarmed about, and if they were cute, it was quite the ego boost.   There were three in particular that were together that kept catching our eyes and waving to us. Two of them appeared to be identical twins, somewhat fair, and then their friend was really really tan. We called him the Dark One. Doesn't it sound nerdy?   Anyway, after two days of waving and smiling and saying "hi" to these people when we passed them, Jules was ready to "take the relationship to the next level," as they say, and actually met them. She has a boyfriend, but harmless flirting means nothing to them. However, she doesn't exactly know that B and i have something of an understanding. [This one is of the "I love you, but my parents will castrate you if they find out we're dating again" variety, so essentially everyone is wondering why I don't hit on people any more.] So rather than reveal to her information which could cause my dear B bodily harm, I sucked it up and initiated a conversation.   I think it was something like, "Uh, we can't decide if you're identical or fraternal, uh, hi?" and then we spoke for a while. It was pretty nice, I guess, even though their "I can't run good"'s made me clench my teeth.   So these three guys (aged sixteen.... Jules and I are cradle-robbers, we are) had this other little kid running around witht hem that they had just met on vacation. He was short and looked like he was, oh, thirteen, but he claimed he was sixteen. (Hint - he's from Georgia and claims he failed his driver's test... of course, he doesn't seem to remember that whole learner's permit law we have. But yeah, he was sixteen like i was looking to date those guys.)   The kid was odd. He was always hitting on people, including the looks-to-be-twelve-but-says-she's-fourteen-and-wears-the-same-bikini-every-day-because-it's-the-only-skimpy-one-she-has chick, and was generally just kind of annoying. But then last night the twins both went down to walk on the beach with this blond girl and her little siblings. (Yes, they thought they were Big Pimpin.')   The Dark One was telling us about how Twin A is about to hook up with Blondie, but Twin B won't take the hint and leave. "Whenever someone's about to have a good time, [Twin B] is just taggin' along," he stated. He actually said "have a good time," but he had great abs, so we'll ignore that for just a little longer.   So then the twins and Blondie and the two little kids came walking up the boardwalk just as the Dark One is proclaming Twin B to be an annoying "bitch." Jules and I hushed them, because generally speaking, people don't usually like their friends to overhear them when they're talking about them. That, however, seems to be a Georgian trait, because they were all macho and "I don't care!" and crap.   So the Dark One, who we know is his best friend, jokes loudly that twin B is a bitch or something. Then the little dude started in, following along, and he called out "Tagalong!"   I don't know. This just pissed me off. This kid lies about his age and acts all "suave," trying to get in with the older guys, but he's basically just been a pig. Every time I was there, he'd be talking about some girl's face or hair or body. And now, he's pulling the classic dis-people-to-look-cool trick? That old trick of climbing the social ladder, right? You have to kick others out of the way.   Dear God. I know it was just some stupid pubescent male, and it was people who will never care again. But the principle of it! Where do you get off?   Jules looked at me, and I paused and said to him, "Wow. That was.... just... biting." I was being so obviously facetious that sarcasm was dripping from my fangs. Jules giggled.   The little guy: "Well, I don't care. I'm never gonna see him again after this week. You think I'm ever gonna see him again after this week?"   I looked at him. "I mean... well.... that was just so witty. And so cruel."   Little Dude: "I don't care. He's a tagalong bitch." Or some shit like that.   So I kind of looked at him for a minute, trying to see if he was serious. Like, he honestly thought that I found his attempted insult to be funny, clever and oh-so-not-repetitive.   He made a big show then, getting Twin B away from Twin A and the girl, and, like, dragging him off, and so then it was just me and Jules and Dark One in the pool. I think Dark One had some inkling of suspicion that there was something mildly ironic occuring, so he started doing cannonballs into the pool.   Jules and I just treaded water for a minute, looking back at where the little asshole had disappeared.   "He's the bitch," she told me.
