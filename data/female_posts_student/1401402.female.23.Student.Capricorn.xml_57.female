Certain songs put me in very deep thoughts of sadness. This leads me into sorrows dangerously depressing.  In addition, curtain songs put me in this lubby dubby thinking happy thoughts.   Come Away With Me by Nora Jones   Every time I hear this song on the radio, it makes me rock my body from side to side. In such a romantic rhythms, I want a dance partner in an instance. I want to do the cha say. I want to be spin and twirl from one corner to another. I want to look into his eyes and seduced him. I want to sing the lyrics softly into his ears and smile in a very happy sexy appeal. Come away with me and we’ll kiss. I wanna wake up with the rains outside while I’m safe there in your arms. The feeling of overwhelming joy and peace. Okay okay enough imagination.   She aint right for you by Macy Gray  Now this song gets me all depressed. I would sing along with a frown on my face. Some how it makes me think of being alone. I hate to be alone. I am always alone. I feel so lonely and I know I’m not the only one. It just makes me want to cry damnit.   You can fine 50 cents in the club  Now this song gets me pumpin. I just feel like moving through out the whole song. Makes me wanna dance to the beat. Bob my head side to side, up and down. Makes me feel like I’m so tough.    I want you back in my life by Alice DJ  This song may be a dancing techno type but I breakdown. The lyric says, I want you back in my life. Want you back by my side. Once you were before. Look at me standing in the rain crying out your name again.   Man, amazingly mind blowing huh? Questions I came up with when ever I hear this song.   Who’s the one that makes you happy? Who’s the one always on your mind? Who is the reason your living for? Who’s the reason for your smiles?   Mars  mystery – trance  I feel like a hard core. Yeah baby.   Shesh, now I am pretty well freaked out by my emotions. If songs can make me feel what I felt, then it really means that I’m too sensitive. Isn’t that ashamed? Don’t know why I feel so sad so sad.    Man I love this song. Shawn Paul like glue. Yep I am rocking to the beat. My headphones are blast and enjoying myself.  Co-workers is laughing at me rite at this vicious moment. Okay I’m not sad anymore. I’m so hyper right now. Let me just bounce like a disco ball.
