Anyways....I didn't hit anything, and I didn't even come CLOSE to hitting anything! YAY! And the people rejoice. :-) Happy mother's day to all the mothers, although I don't know of any who read this...I come close, but I am not technically. lol Boy, I am tired though! Before we went on errands, I helped shovel rocks outside! Arhg.  And now to specific people: Jane- TITLE SCHEME. Use one!!!! (A gentle reminder) YouNa- I am in French, and I LOVE it! This is my 3rd year of French, and I am so going to major in it in college! (No laughing other people!) I am also in Latin, but I don't love it as much as I love French. Le francais est la langue la plus chouette!!!  Sarah-Oh! I got something for Jonah and Nathan. Remind me to show you! They're fun! They feel funny! (notice how I am not responing to your couch joke. It's not funny. :-) ) Oh and by the way people- Please post in your next post your title scheme so that we all know. And please end with our ending. We'll end up changing it periodically, so after a while, go ahead, and we'll all use a new one. Currently it's: Your mother is an aardvark!
