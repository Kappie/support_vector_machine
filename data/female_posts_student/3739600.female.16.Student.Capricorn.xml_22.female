GRRRRRR! oh and that they have 8th off and I left my bookbag in clayton's truck.....MY MAKE UP IS IN MY BOOKBAG!  urlLink    I got to see my big bro. during lunch! I can't believe I am saying this but it was good to see him. Ok well I have to get ready for D.E. So I'll drop in later!  Much love, Brandi         My inner child is sixteen years old!   Life's not fair! It's never been fair, but while adults might just accept that, I know something's gotta change. And it's gonna change, just as soon as I become an adult and get some power of my own.   urlLink  How Old is Your Inner Child?    brought to you by  urlLink
