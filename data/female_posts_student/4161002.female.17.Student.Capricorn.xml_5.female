Surprisingly, i don't really miss BNSS. I won't think abt our classroom, the toiltes tt we frequent, the canteen, the music room, the ava room or any other rooms. Because it is just a place. It is the ppl, the feeling tt we have which makes those places meaningful. Right? However so sad, "Time is God's way to keep everything from happening at once" so let's keep this happy memory forever.      A Friend That's Always There   If I could catch a rainbow I would do it just for you And share with you it's beauty on the days you're feeling blue If I could build a mountain you could call your very own A place to find serenity A place to be alone........... If I could take your troubles I would toss them in the sea But all these things I'm finding are impossible for me I cannot build a mountain or catch a rainbow fair But let me be what I know best A friend that's always there.
