Isn't florida supposed to be sunny and bright? Guess not lol...None of the lights are on in my house. Its always like this on rainy days and i hate it. I hate looking out the window then looking back inside just to see the same colors,Grey. My room is the only room in the house with the lights on. And I mean..its so boring...i have to wait for Thursday.....is that alright with your mom and dad franny? Cuz josh is stayin over on Thursday as well lol. That'll be fun j/k lol.... I need to check the moon calendar to see if Thursday has a full moon.    Weekends in wv either rain or shine would be fun i guess. I remember going to the movies alot during the weekends. I even remember this one time we played a trick on steven at the movies. That was fun lol.  Francesca-if i show you how to change the colors are you gonna turn it all black?...that would be cool j/k lol. Oh and if you get to stay over on Thursday we're not having any type of finger foods lmao.   Nothing has really been goin on....Keith is over at Josh's house..he stayed the night....UH OH! lol....ew..i hope my brother isn't that way lol j/k.  So how is everyone?...c'mon i need something to talk about. How bout......Yellowcard was on the Sharon Osborn show on the 1th but the show wont air till the 22nd...so I gotta watch that! yay... I talked to Brittney last night!! i was so happy to talk to her...i havn't talked to her in forever! but i wasn't aloud to talk till nine cuz it was long distance(i had to call her back)...well i guess i'll post later.
