But somehow, even with all that has happened, our friendship hasn't changed, except to grow stronger.   Feeling close to another is such a special feeling and adds so much to life... no wonder your friendship means so much to me!   When I stop to think about it, the closeness we share is right up there with the things I value most in life. Just being together always means the start of good times... thought-provoking times... and even provoking times! (But isn't that the way it should be?)   If we couldn't talk things over and make things right, we never would have made it through these changing times, remaining the good friends we are.   There aren't many people I could say this to, but I can say to you--if there's ever anything I can do to boost you up or help you out or get you through, I'll be there. And if you simply want me to be with you to share a joyful moment... nothing could make me happier.   We've been through so many changes... some of them for the good. Others have been difficult. But through it all we've known we could always count on each other!   That's why I feel so good about the times we'll share in days to come...positive about life and all the happiness it can hold. And I truly know in my heart, through all of life's changes...  We'll always be friends no matter what. I value this friendship as much as I value you, cause you're so special to me and I love just the way you are. ...we'll always be friends.Ã¼
