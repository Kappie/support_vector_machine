Then my mom's father, who is my grandpa phoned to told us he will visit to our house later. That's a big surprise actually.   Grandpa just came back from his vacation to China, then he just drop by our house to chat with mom and ask my aunts to come here too. I can't tell you how  kecoh   they were.   And my annoying cousin was here. My mom cook a bowl of delicious mee for her because she was hungry, er, so jealous, hey, that's my mom. Then my mom washed the dishes for her, such a lazy fella (annoying)! Then she came in to my room while I was busy doing my homeworks. Then she sat on my bed, her mom came in, looked at my room and began to criticise about my small little room. "My daughter's room is much bigger than yours, you know?", then my annoying cousin said, "yaloh, my room is much bigger than this." Then her mom said, "You have everything bigger and better than her", oh, she said that in front of me. Then annoying bitch said, "ya, agree. But my body is much smaller than her, so there's the only thing I have which smaller than her". Then both of them laugh and laugh non stop, they thought that's a good joke. Ok, now you shut up, you idiot. I stayed as cool as possible and I was ignoring them. That's still not over yet, her mom went in to the kitchen and told my mom about this not-funny-joke.   Then she sat on my bed again, looking at me, I ignored her till the end. Realising that I didn't talk to her, so she started to stand up and I thought she will left. But no, she began to touch my things. She touched my doll, my comics, my books and other things. Then she took one of my Crayon Sinchan comic out of my room, arg.   Now, I want to tell you, I LOVE MY ROOM VERY MUCH AND I DON'T CARE HOW FAT I AM, THAT'S ME!  When I first moved to my new house, I choose this small room because I love it. I feel unsafe in a big room and a small room makes me feel very warm. I have my own space in this small room. I hide in a small space between my bed and the wall when I was sad and I feel really really safe. That's my room, my privacy.
