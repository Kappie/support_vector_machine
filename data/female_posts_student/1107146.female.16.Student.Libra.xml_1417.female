Lucy in the Sky, not a prob. The only prob is....learning these songs in the next few months, and actually getting to playing them all, bcuz we tend to flow a bit heavier with the majority of the songs...even with the joke songs like DIE and Cpt. Coodukx...so we won't know where to put them and not screw up the karma of the show...and believe me, there is a karma.  DID ABBY TELL YOU WHERE WE MIGHT BE HAVING IT? OH, SO EXCITING.  Have to go download  Still Fighting It  right now. Sorto scared. Hope it's not too hard.  Ok, big problem: where the f is everyone? Even on the other BLogs that I'm on, which used to get about a thousand posts a day...no one's there. The reaper of summer hath took his toll.  Now Will, we shouldn't make fun of Abby while she's go-abbyisincrediblyshort-ne, that wouldn't b-likealittlefreakingthreeyearold-e nice.  WOOT Auburn, BONUS. Hope it was every bit as amazing as it sounds to have been.  Abby said 50 some odd, but it might be up to 60, I dunno. But bonus.   Haha Rosie, HAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Suddenly, all the people that never get sunburned...ARE getting sunburned. Alex, for instance, that Jew never gets any UV penetration, AND HE COMES TO THE Y THE OTHER DAY AND THE FIRST THING I SAID WAS, "NICE CHERRY VARNISH THERE BLUSH." CUZ HE HAD A MASSIVE SUNBURN! WARHARHARHAHARHARHARHARHARHAR.  I love it,  I love it .
