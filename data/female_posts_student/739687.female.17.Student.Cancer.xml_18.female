Right now I want Starbucks, and I wanna go rollerblading later tonight. So yea...today will be kinda fun I suppose. Haha...right. Well, I don't have much else to say...the four hours of Marco Pollo today have tired me out...plus the fact I got 4 hours of sleep last night. Oh, but we played a new rendition of Marco Pollo today...called QMP(Quiet Marco Pollo)...very interesting...haha...
