Gosh, I am going to miss this fast connection, though.  I am not looking forward to going back to telephone modem speeds.  Huh.  It only just hit me, seeing the date.  Tomorrow it will be five years since mom died.  Five years.  I miss her.  It is amazing to me that time could go by so quickly.  I wish she could see me graduate.  I have to admit, that is not as big a deal as I thought it was going to be.  But maybe it is just that I have already done my weeping about mom not being there for graduation.  She would have been really proud of me.    I guess this is the fastest five years I have had.  I suppose I will always be able to say that, since life just seems to accelerate.  I hope nobody says anything about how mom is with me in spirit.  I might have a hard time being polite.
