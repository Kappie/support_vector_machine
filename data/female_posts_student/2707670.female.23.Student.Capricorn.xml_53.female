So tonight I will be attending the Liquidity Preference Function at Brothers Bar. Its is being sponsored by one of my professors and the associate department head. They will be buying the first few rounds to find out what the average graduate student's liquidity preference is.  This is going to be a difficult task for me, but I will be attending to do my scientific duty. If all of my duties were this difficult I don't know what I would do. Maybe stay in school forever! Wish me luck!
