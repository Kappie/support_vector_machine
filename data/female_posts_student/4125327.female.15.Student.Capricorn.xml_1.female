No biggie though. My older sis called, she's doing fine. She's in the army... learning Arabic (sp?). It's also my older brother's birthday. 26 today. He's planning on coming down in early September, the third, and she is planning on coming the same time. She's 23. Saw Katie today, at church. The reason she hasn't been answering the phone or e-mails, is because she's grounded because of that thing I semi-menchened yesterday. I know that all sin is equal in the eyes of God, but you know, not in earthy eyes. And some have bigger conquences than others. Sure, she didnt get any of the conquences (besides a major grounding) but... still. rAy was great today at church. We only got through three verses, but the message was awsome. I'm going to miss him when he leaves. He talked about Galations 6:1-3. How we all are overcomed by sin at one point or another, no matter who we are. But, we tend to (symboticaly) smack them with bats instead of going to them gently and humbly to try and help them. Anyway, your sister in Christ, ~U.D.b.a.F.o.G.
