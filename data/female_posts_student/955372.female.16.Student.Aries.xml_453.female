And we're like laughing hysterically of course, because well, you read it you know it was funny. And Paul walks by and looks back at us and has this like terrified/shocked look on his face, it was priceless. Then madeline's like "pull it together guys, that dave kid is gonna think we're crazy" and i'm like "who's dave" and she's like "he's right there, DAVE" and i turn around and i'm like "his name is DAN, madeline.. dan" it was amazing.
