Love is such an amazing thing.  I am surprised, impressed, softened, exhilarated, and weakened in the knees by it every day.  I wondered today what keeps two people in love.  Obviously, physical attraction may spark a relationship, but cannot sustain it.  Maybe it is the note he writes you every day and slips in your pocket in passing.  Perhaps it is the gentleness he only displays when he hugs you tightly each morning.  I have come to think it undefinable, yet so easily recognized.  Even now, I smile as I write this, knowing that I, Katie Rose Fritz, get to experience love tomorrow.  Goodnight, world.
