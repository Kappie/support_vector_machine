I am currently trying to look at colleges, and assessing the way things will be when I go back to Ohio. I am actually kind of scared. I'm not trying to go all Dirty Dancing here but I am scared of leaving New York and not feeling the way I do when I am here. That is the huge thing I hate about Ohio. I wish that I could say I am strong enough to do what I want, say what I want, wear what I want, but I can't. Not down there. Nobody is really. So why should I break the chain. Why should I step out and test the waters before everyone else. I am sick of that. I remember a trip that I went on with my school. We went to Germany and stayed in this really nice lodge, out in nature, which we all hated of course. The first day there it was sweltering hot so we decided to go to the pool. Of course no one would jump in, afraid that it was to cold, and not willing to take the first initial shock. So I did. I just ran and it was the best feeling. But of course that feeling lasted for about two seconds, when my head came above the water and the look of admiration from my young peers faces disappeared and they all forgot. Forgot that I had tested the waters for them. Now it may not seem like a big deal, but it was to me. I am sick of testing the waters for others, I want to start testing my own waters. My private beach, not the public one. If that doesn't make sense to anyone reading this I don't care. It's not supposed to make sense to you. Just like those poems you read of mine. And then laughed at, and proceeded to quote like they were a joke. It wasn't to me. What you didn't realize, and apparently didn't even think to realize, is that those poems were written in really hard times. And not just hard times, but times when I had to question what makes my life worth living. So I wrote those things down, the things so important to me that they made me want to live. Like New York, and Art, and Time. But you laughed, because they mend nothing to you, and in a way I ment nothing in that time. So thank you...To those who laughed, I forgive you, but think next time. And thanks most to the one person who didn't laugh, a sincere thanks, to Nicole. I guess admist this rant of utter randomness I am paying homage to her, BC she is awesomely nice, and in something that was supposed to explain her realizing herself, with a little help from me, I actually realized myself. So its kind of like a you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours, we both get a lot out of our friendship and that's awesome, I love her. I don't think I have ever had a friendship were I actually feel like more then a friend. Not in a sexual sense of course but in a sense where I am also like a mentor, and she is to me. We help each other realize things we hadn't before. I think that is a lot from us both having extremely different backgrounds...We help each other see the things we missed BC our pasts were different..If you catch my drift. But if you don't that's ok, BC the one person who is supposed to, Nicole, she will...She even knows what I am saying with my mouth full....LOL that's when you have a keeper. Ha so rant away again....I wasn't finished...I tend to get distracted by words that sounds great and just start on another path. So I am also scared about college...argh it is a year away. Well this is the basics...I know I want to be well known for something...Art or acting. Or Fashion Design. They all are great prospects and things I know I could do good in. But I don't know why I want to be well known. It's just something I want. It's certainly not BC I sit watching "The Fabulous life of....." On VH1 or BC I regularly read all the gossip celebrity magazines. I am guessing that it is BC I want to change things. Now I am not naive and I now there is no way I can change the world, But I want to get my voice out there, and I love acting by far, and I love being able to transform into a different person. But I think really the real reason I want to be known, is so I can help. Yes that sounds extremely "Miss pageant" material, but I really do. I love helping people, and I figure, hey kill two birds with one stone, do something I love and get my voice out there. I would love to be a role model, all though I fear I won't be too successful at it..But it's just such a respectable thing, I really respect those who are seen as role models. I don't know, I think this blog just shows so much is on my mind, and it really sucks, BC I want to enjoy the rest of my time here, and then go back to Ohio and just get into school..And do good so I can make these colleges..And not have to worry anymore..And be back here..My real home..New York My hands are growing tired and so is my head..So I think it's time to sleep..Before I think to more and begin another 12 page rant...So goodnight to whoever...God I guess..Or anything watching over me..All though I have full belief it is God..He really is my homeboy...Gods cool..Not as strict as you would think, and he has a bloody awesome sense of humor.
