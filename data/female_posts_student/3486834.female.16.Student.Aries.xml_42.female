I think it's another mission camp. I don't know what today is.. I think it is Wednesday or Thursday.. My mom said that it's the 1st, but you can never trust her. So that means that 4th of July is comming up.. I don't know what I am gunna do, my family probably has something big planned for everyone.  Gah it's only like 2. I'm going to get out of the house today.. even if it kills me. If only the weather was nice.. It is still really stormy and icky.  Paxton doesn't like the Longhorns.. psh. (He hates them).. Well I guess we are even, cause I hate Texas Tech. hehe. Take that!
