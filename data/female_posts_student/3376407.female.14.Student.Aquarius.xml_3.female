There was even one life guard who got in and tried to catch them. Finally we caught all the babies and put them in this crate and let them go outside of the pool area. Then the mom flew out of the pool and they were reunited. :) It was quite cute.  I now have to go babysit my neighbors from 1 - 2:30 then swim from 3 - 4:30 then work from 5-8. On Friday we are having a ECHO get-together at the Blackwood's house and I am really excited.  Later,  Ellie
