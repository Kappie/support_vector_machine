I left the flat at 8:00 this morning, started work at 8:30 - worked until 2:30, drove to see CPN for an hour, drove to Jo's and looked after the kids from 4:30-7:30, then got back home at 8pm. Phew.  Work went well though, didn't get bored and even got through half of an entire box of notes!  The GP said I was good value for money (not sure if thats a compliment or not!)  Just hope I, like Mel, don't work myself out of a job!!  Started watching the last ever episode of ER last night and FELL ASLEEP! It's NOT that I'm not a true fan, I was just real tired. And it was good because it meant I got a good nights sleep, before getting up at 7am.  Yes Jonathon no more moaning on my guestbook!! Tut tut.  I am Frodo according to the LOTR personality test. hmmmm... what does that say? I drag my friends into danger?  I'm determined though.
