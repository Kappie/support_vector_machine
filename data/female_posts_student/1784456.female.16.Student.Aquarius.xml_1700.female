BWAAAHHH face my wrath George Bush. When I'm older I will change the world. I will demonstrate. I will sit on the street and revise every human right so that I know that I am in the right. I will change the world! It's my only aim in life. Who cares what your job is, if you haven't engraved yourself into a bit of the world then what's the point? Maybe that's where my passion is.
