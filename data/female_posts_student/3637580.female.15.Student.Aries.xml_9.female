But you know what it dosen't bother me, I mean the points everyone is making are true..like I guess compared to Nick and Justin's blog's mine does seem like some stupid diary, their writing actually means something,and I know mine dosen't...but once again..I'm still not going to stop writing. Just like I'm not going to stop listening to "their" music, cause I like it , end-of-story. Dis-like me for that if you want to, but I like the music and I'm going to listen to it. I'm listening when you say that I can't understand what the music means to you..and your right I don't , but if you really don't wanna like me because of the music I play in my stereo, then I'm sorry for you...cause there is more to me then just the music I listen to.   I found out that Alice was the one posting comment after comment about me being funny..and a liar and stuff like that. Man I would have never guessed it was her. I guess she dosen't like me, Nick said it's cause of the music thing, I guess I just really don't get it. And I think that sucks because I really always thought Alice was cool..I mean i still don't have a problem with her I just feel like I wasn't even given a chance to be liked. That sucks man, it really does.I really hope she'll eventually change her opinion of me..maybe..or maybe not, we'll see.  I kinda feel like I'm getting attacked with the issues involving punk music and my decision to listen to it. Nick told me he thinks I'm a poser, beacuse I listen to Yellowcard (who are sell-outs), and I was planning on going to Warped not knowing many of the bands there, and also because I would be hated there not only for not being ignorant of the bands that are playing, but because the tag on my clothing reads hollister or abercrombie and fitch. Wow. That hits me hard, that people seriously care that much. I'm not supposed to be allowed to listen to a certain type of music enless my clothing is appropriate, and because I didn't discover Punk as my first source of music, and because I've just now begun to like it, I have people changing and forming opinions about me. That actually hurts.   And you know what else hurts..theres this guy I like. I think all the above applies to him. I think he's changing his opinion of me because of the music situation. I wish he could actually get to know who I am before doing that.We are two really diffrent people but I liked him alot, his being totally oppiste of me taking part in that. He's not like other guys, cause he's not predictable, that's something I love about him. He always has good stories to tell and he can always make me laugh, two more qualities I love in that kid. He has the reputation of being an asshole, and fucking things up repeatedly, but I always thought that he didn't mean it, It wasn't like he wanted it to happen it just did. I never really tried to worry about all the shit people told me about him, if he was a mistake I'd figure it out on my own. I really don't know about any of this or where him and I stand, but I do know that my head kinda hurts analyzing all of this.  All this really sucks...yes I'm complaining about my fucking life, and all my stupid little fucking problems. I'm such a fuckng cry baby.It's 1:25 in the fucking morning and I'm tired so I'm going to bed so I can cry about this shit to myself some more..later...
