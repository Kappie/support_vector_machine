I was supposed to go to Noodle's birthday party yesterday. I went, but I also said I'd stay the night there, which wasn't quite what happened. Frankly, I'm bored by talks of God and Jesus and church from people I don't know. I'm not comfortable around Christians or strangers, let alone Christian strangers. So anyway, Monica said she was going and probably dragging Ryan with her. When I show up, there was no sign of either of them. When I finally get ahold of them, Monica said she'd stay the night with me so I wouldn't be on my own.  When her and Ryan get there, we decided to ditch the party. We wound up hanging out in my backyard since there was no way for me to sneak into my house without risking waking up my dad. After an hour of getting eaten by bugs, we concoct a better plan: sleep in Ryan's car in front of his house so I'm technically not home and no one else can track me or Monica down. And, we came up of plenty of excuses for various situations during one of our discussions.  We (me and Ryan) wound up talking until 3:30-ish in the morning (Monica fell asleep an hour earlier) about a lot of different stuff. I can't remember the details of any topic in particular. But anywho, I found out his car isn't very comfortable, but I wasn't complaining since he slept with us out there, despite his house being across the street. I think I only got 30 minutes of solid sleep, the rest of the time drifting in and out whilst tossing and turning every once in a while. Ryan and I got up around 5:15 (and neither of us knew how that happened), while Monica got up around 5:35. We sat in his car until 6, then drove to my house since my dad had left for work by then.  And, well, that concludes the sleepover part. The rest of the day was me entertaining (or at least attempting to entertain) Mon and Ryan until about 4 p.m. since Ryan had to go to work.  Man, I wish I could have interesting sleepovers like that more often...   Current Mood  FWEE!
