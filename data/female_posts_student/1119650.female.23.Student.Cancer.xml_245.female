Leave it to those geniuses over at Fox to come up with  urlLink The Miss Dog Beauty Pageant .  Thats right, a beauty pageant for doggies.  It had a talent portion, and evening gowns.  Let me tell you, these were some SEXY bitches!    My personal favorite, Miss New York, a Jack Russell Terrier named Anastasia was eliminated from the K-9 and didn't make it to the final 5, but her talent was popping balloons so thats understandable.  Her emerald green gown was astonishing though.  Then of the final five I was torn between Disco, the golden retriever and Daisy the beagle and neither of them won (they placed in the bottom 2 of the final 5).  Of the top 2 choices there was a border collie (bleh) and a jack russell mix.  The JR mix climbed a ladder and walked a tightrope to rescue a cookiemonster baby!  All the border collie did was walk downstairs.  Alas the fickle judges made their decision and Sweet Pea, Miss Illinois was the first ever crowned "Miss Dog".    I will never watch anything else on tv as this was just literally untoppable, but I have gained new respect for Fox, and you bet your ass I will watch this next year.
