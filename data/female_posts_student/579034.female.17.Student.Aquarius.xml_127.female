Last night (Thursday, for those not paying attention) Mick and I kind of touched on the subject of takin a little break but didn't really discuss it. The mere fact we brought it up was enough to make me sick. So, all day I was on the verge of tears, I bet I failed my Chem test, but hey what else is new. So, the rest of the day went through in a haze of reading something that always used to make me happy and wanting to jump out a window, or infront of a bus. Then, 2:45 came and my one break of the day came for a miraculous 5 minutes. I thought my mom would be able to come pick me up from school but no, she couldn't, so I was like "Well this is great. Now I have to walk home in the misty foggy gross weather. Awesome." And then, my saviours, Lauren and Steve saw me walkin and they gave me a ride home. But, like I said this lasted about 5 minutes. When I got home, I reailized I didn't have my keys. So, I was stuck outside my house in the cold and the mist and the fog for about 45 minutes. I must have cried the like whole time I was out there. Just all the stress from the day and then from my mom not being there was just too much and I just bawled.  Then, my mom got home and let me in and I decided to take a hot bath to warm up. I put some Dashboard on and I just like, I couldn't even take it. I got out and just sat there for like another 45 minutes listening to Dashboard and just sobbing. Then, my mom came home and I fell asleep for a while which was nice. I love not having to think. Just being able to sleep and shut down everything. It was lovely. Then, I started to talk to Mick when he got home from goin out to one of his games and about 3 hours later, the decision was made to go on a break. I'm sobbing now wiriting this. I mean, I know it's not a complete and final thing but... I dunno. Maybe when I go out there things will be different. I've decided I'm going out there wether he likes it or not. I begged a lot for my parents to get those non-refundable tickets to Indianapolis and I am going. I've come up with 2 game plans just in case I am not wanted at the Paskiewicz residence. 1) Sleep in the airport for 2 nights. Hey, I mean it's like free accomodations, got a roof ova my head, bathrooms, and food courts. 2) Get a cheap ass airport motel and attempt to get into the "Indy Action Area" for something to do and then just leave Sunday. It would deffinitly be an adventure and I'm all for one of those. Just me and my duffle bag... exploring America. Maybe, if I don't want to go to Indy, I can trade it in for a trip to Canada. Dave made me smile tonite when I was in my I-am-so-sick-of-this-mentaly-I-am-now-sick-of-it-physicly state. It's just I'm rarely so stressed and since I hardly get this stressed when I get too pent up with emotion I just make myself sick. I think what happened was I got too emotionaly involved which is another rareity with me. I am usually very detatched. It's not in my nature to cling. Maybe, if Mick and I are one of the lucky couples who benefit from a break I'll fix that. Yeah... sounds good to me.  And now for a Harry Potter quote that can be put to this situation:  "You all righ'?" he said gruffly. "Yeah," said Harry. "No, yeh're not," said Hagrid. "'Course yeh're not. But yeh will be." "No good sittin; worryin' abou' it," he said. "What's comin' will come, an' we'll meet it when it does."
