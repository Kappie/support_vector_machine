I have my flight details, my hotel confirmation and my ticket to join the ship. It's a weird feeling to know that I am not going back. A good feeling but a weird feeling. Especially sinceI have talked to my friends Tineke  Fotis. They are on that ship. Hmm, I am positive that I have made the right decision though. I have taken the road less traveled I suppose. I don't think anyone has taken as many detours as I have along my life's path.            Cest Le Vie.            Meanwhile, I got an 80 on my first government exam. I was pretty siked about it. A lot of people bombed and I felt like one of the smart ones in the class. that was a good feeling. Anyway, tomorrow is my aerobics mid term but it's open book and not very formal so I am sure I will ace it.            I finally got to see the first pilot episode of "The L Word" tonight. I was so siked! It was a great show, although I may have completely scarred my mother for life. Bless her heart, in all her wonder, she tries to be supportive of me and lesbo life. She did have to leave the room a few times just because I know she was dying of embarrassment. Hahaha, it was funny. I did appreciate her support. I think the character of "Shane" is so smoking hot. Wow, I odn't know if it's just the confidence she exudes or her lanky little rockstar body. She's smoking though. If you haven't caught this show (whether you're gay or straight) check it out. It will definitely give you some insite into some of our lives.            Also, since I am on the television topic - check out Trading Spouses tomorrow night. It's hysterical. OMG. Lord, please don't ever let me relate to either one of those women. And if I have to choose a life of one of theirs, let it be Amele's - as little as she has, wow, at your happiness level.            Alright, I should finish this glass of Cabernet and head my happy azz to sleep. Sweetest of lovely dreams to everyone.            Shell
