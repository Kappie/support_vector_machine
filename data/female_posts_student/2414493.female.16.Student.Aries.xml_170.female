A perfect day would just be going to Third Street and Santa Monica, etc. with friends but I really don't know how possible that will be. And if I can move on in Bach, will regionals be that weekend?  But self-anger aside, today's a perfect fit day. One thing after another, and little boredom time in between, which is probably healthy since I don't wish to lounge around for hours waiting for a phone call tonight. I have a driving lesson in 15 minutes. New instructor. I wonder if he'll be as strict as Sarah ("You're 3 mi over the speed limit!") or if he'll be less stringent. At any rate, it's a practice driving test today. I'm kind of mad that I haven't gone on the freeway since my last lesson, but Dad, apparently, is too busy to take me. And then at 8 my house is going to be overrun by the six members of our English class group. Fun fun. I have to clean up this desk before they come, though. It's strewn with a whole bunch of college mail that I really don't need, and I've been meaning to clean it up anyways. And maybe I should put better pictures up...maybe.   It's going to be a good weekend, says Lydia. Bach was just the beginning. Well, it was a big beginning--and here I start sounding like Pegleg's Jersey Girl review.  Postal Service: Brand New Colony.
