Damn kids pushing each other around. Well, it was kinda fun a little, but only becuase we knew them, otherwise I would have thought it completely obnoxious... I thought the night was pretty entertaining the whole way through excpet for the very end which put me in a piss-ass mood.   Nevermind, I don't want to talk about anything now. I am reminded of being pissy. Dammit.
