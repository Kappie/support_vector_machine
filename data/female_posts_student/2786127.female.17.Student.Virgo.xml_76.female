I'm swimming with dolphins while i'm there, which has been my dream since i was like 3. Genie and I talked to her parents last night and we're going to disneyland! most likely...but that would be beyond fun if Genie and I got to roam around disneyland together (and possibly with peanut, if we play our cards right). And then later this summer Ash and I are going on a  crazy back to school shopping spree in Seattle. I *might* be going to warm lake again (which i must say, was the funnest thing ever last year)I guess it all just depends on how much lindsay and I can repair our friendship by then. I talked to her yesterday and everythings alright with us...so I'm feeling optimistic.   yay! I get to play actual volleyball today, which is excellent. I feel really good right now.
