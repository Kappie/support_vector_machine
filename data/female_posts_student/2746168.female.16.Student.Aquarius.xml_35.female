Lida and Laura cooked a great dinner of grilled beef tender, scalloped potatoes, fresh snap green beans, and a salad.  Our appetizer was cream cheese with raspberry jelly loaded with pecans and a jalapeño pepper on a ritz cracker.  We also had French bread and a to die for cheese cake with strawberries.  Yum Yum.  Katie read a bible verse before we exchanged gifts and the gift exchange was very sentimental, everyone took a lot of time figuring out what their person would like and buying that.  Lida cried when Lizzie gave her the gift she had purchased for her, it was a really neat moment.  Meagan drew my name and bought me a set of hand carved wood dominoes (destined for the hunting camp), a Limon cello glass, a SMdA shot glass and atop you spin for some type of Mexican drinking game (I’ll probably give that to one of the college kids).   Everyone was in agreement that they received great gifts; I’ll try to post some pictures when the internet is fixed.   Alafair is still under the weather so Lida called and had a Doctor come visit, a house call pretty cool huh.  Also yesterday Lida scraped her suburban on a beer truck turning the corner too tight on these narrow roads. We took Lizzie to the airport at noon and she made it home just fine, we also picked up Taylor White Ben’s friend who is visiting for a week.  I played golf yesterday and met some nice retirees at the course.  Ollie is 88 and has a live in girlfriend; he doesn’t act or look 88.  It’s raining and hailing outside right now.  It will be gone in an hour and the sun will return.  The internet has been down for 24 hours and we don’t know when it will be fixed, I’ll post this as soon as I’m able.    Bruce and I may play golf tomorrow.  Friday we are going to visit the glass factory that should be a lot of fun.  Friday we also have lunch at the Walkers house and are going out to dinner with Tommy Kimball.  Bruce is trying to wrap up one last case so he can stay the entire month without going home.  He had one case settle already so maybe it will work out.  Alafair came downstairs 30 minutes after the Doctor left feeling good, a miracle drug has been applied, the whole house rejoices, it’s so great to have Alafair back amongst the living.    We went out to dinner last night at Tio Lucas and had a wonderful time.  The Caesar salad prepared tableside was to die for.  The guacamole was also out of this world.  Ben and Taylor escorted Katie after dinner as they went dancing.
