Me 'n Cassie are gonna go ghost huntin' tomorrow. :) It will be fun, and we are visiting the First Bride's Grave, along with two other cemetaries in Sioux City. xD It's gonna ROCK!You see, we found this cool website with cool ghost pics! It just may prove something to you non-believers. You can click  urlLink here  to view the site, there are some stranges pictures on it, particularly these two, which seem a bit unnerving:   urlLink Hampton Court Ghost    urlLink Willard's Children's Library   You may agree that these photographs could seem... oh... I don't know...  BELIEVABLE!  So, if, even after seeing this proof, you do not think that there are spirits dwelling even in our very homes, then I have nothing to say to you. But, if we develop some awesome ghostly pics, I'm gonna post 'em here, on my websites, and try to on castleofspirits.com as well.   Hehe... Just keep in mind! Non-believers go first! MUAHAHA!
