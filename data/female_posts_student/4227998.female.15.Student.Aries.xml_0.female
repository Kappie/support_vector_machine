Billy came over (drools profusely.) Just as we were about to play truth or date. Of course, I wasn't dumb, I knew not to choose dare while Billy was in the room. They would have dared me to hump him or something. Trish was about to ask me if I liked Billy, but I interrupted her before she could finish by telling Billy that I liked him. Then somehow, Kasey ended up asking me if I would ever make out with him or have 'sexual intercourse' with him. I wouldn't do the dirty with him, I wouldn't, but I would make out with him. God knows it.  Alcoholic beverages were drank last night, and things began to get crazy after awhile. Kasey and Ronnie got into it and Kasey ran out the front door and down the street with Ice 101 in her hands...Smart, isn't it? Luckily, the cop that was sitting with that old guy was off duty or he would of taken her in, like he said he would of. After Kasey calmed down, we went back to the house, only to find Ronnie gone. He had left minutes after we did, he too had alcohol in his hands. He came back a little after we did. Everything was peachy after I talked with Ronnie outside and made him not want to hang himself. Then, in the middle of bringing his confidence up, Trish comes outside and tells me Kasey is puking her intestines out. So after putting Kasey in her bed, Trish began to drink more, making herself even more drunk than she already was on vodka and orange juice. After trying to keep Ronnie and Trish from pulling Kasey out of her bed, and forbearing them from pouring sprite all over her hair. I failed. Things were pretty screwed up last night.  I go back to work tomorrow. I've had a freakin' rash on the left side of my face that insanely itched. So mom took me to the hospital and they gave me a shot in the butt with cortisone. It's all good now, the redness is gone, the itching has faded, and I'm back to normal again. I've been typing for awhile. So, I'm out like a lamp.
