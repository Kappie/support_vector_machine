I had sent them an email asking about an import/export contacts feature on 4/24 and they replied on 4/27 so that's pretty fast response time.  Here is their reply:   Hello Cherrie,  Thank you for your message.  We are currently working on many new features to improve the Gmail service. Some upcoming features we are excited to announce are the following:  - Automatic forwarding of your email to another account - Plain HTML version of Gmail - Import/export Contacts  We hope you enjoy Google's approach to email.  Sincerely,  The Gmail Team
