Just that I had emailed them to myself and my dad doesn't want me re-downloading them onto his laptop. :( Hafta wait till I get to my grandma's in Arizona, love, sorry.  James: I am reaching the limit on my time online while in and out of hotels. agh. Sorry, I think I'm going to have to cut it out for a day or two so as not to get myself into trouble. I'm getting blamed for not spending enough time with my family as it is. I'll try posting whenever i can...it is shorter and doesn't take as long, AKA less chance of being caught in the act. heh. I feel naughty. ;) Definitely will post tonight...  Nick:I'm so proud of you! I know you hate hearing that. But I am excited. I'll be waiting for you at the LSU track. haha. And here's my site, in all its glory! lol. Have fun, I suppose. And I will call you whenI get to AZ too. Promise. (Just like I have to everyone else. So much love to give, and so little time! heh.)  Ben:I tried getting a hold of you...Your poem..well it left me speechless. Thank you so much...really, more than words could ever express. Please write me back. I love and miss you.  I miss all you and any of those I know that may stumble across my site. Call me if you desperately need to, long distance charges need not apply in such situations. I'll keep you updated... -Kaleigh Jo-
