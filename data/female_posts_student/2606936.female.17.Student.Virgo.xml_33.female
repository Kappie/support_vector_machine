First of all, I can guarantee that 50% or more of people who use the word "abstinence" all the time not only believe it to meaan "not having sex," but would also be clueless if you asked them to abstain from something.   And "platonic." God, how annoying is it when teens use that on TV or movies? Most people think it means "non-romantic." Many fewer understand the "non-sexual" part of it, and very few make the connection with Plato. A pencil-eraser's worth knows what Platonic forms are.  And.... "perverted." "Eeeeew, he's perverted."  I don't think that was ever supposed to be an adjective. "Perverted" means "sexually gross" to today's kinders. "To pervert" would be "to turn away from its natural state." But if you use any form of the stem around a middle-school-aged-or-younger crowd, you'd get giggles and junk...... The correct adjective is "perverse." But it just doesn't have the same sickening ring when squealed, now does it?........  And for a non-sexual example, "president." Everyone who's been to kindergarten, and many more, know who the President is. Yet, they cannot define the word "preside".......   Fifty-cent words for everyone!   "What, were you, like, raised by wolves?" "Yes, I was. Hmm."
