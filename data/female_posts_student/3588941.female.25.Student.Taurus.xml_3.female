Unless the content of the dream rightly understood is inspired by alien spirits, it is part of my own being."  ~ Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) Austrian founder of psychoanalysis  As I half-awoke from a dream a few mornings ago I had a strange thought, "How was I so surprised by my own dream?". It was a curious thought, which wouldn't be as strange if someone else were dreaming for me... but they don't! My mind creates the dream, so I shouldn't be surprised, or frighten, or any of those emotions that occur because of a lack of prior knowledge of an event. Maybe you don't understand, maybe you do... dreams are such curious things!
