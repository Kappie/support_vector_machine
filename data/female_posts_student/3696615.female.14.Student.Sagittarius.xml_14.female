We went to the bookstore in central square, the blockbuster there too, as well as the harvest co-op where I got a soy shake and a really cool cute hippy talked to me (although he was in his 20s or so. but he was still cool. ive come to the conclusion that i'll marry someone like him when im older. ive decided i wont capitalize anything or use a lot of punctuation because this keyboard is in a plastic bag...) anyway.  My legs have fallen asleep. The computers on the floor. Sam (my sisters boyfriend)'s computer cant access chatrooms or messengers, or knock-off messengers, so I cant have contact with pedophiles or 50 year old men pretending to be 13 year old girls.   Well, today as I was walking with my parents some old farts sitting on a bench started making kissing noises at me and saying stuff like "hey girl." LMFAO  I still like boston though. Im going to go to college here when im older. i love crazy people, and hippies, and snobs, and democrats. so this is the perfect place for me. ill work at a health food store and meet my future husband there. :-D  Anyway  Tomorrow we're going to plimoth plantation. I get to harass the people/actors dressed as pilgrims and ask questions such as  "how much do you get paid" "what time do you start work"  Etc... its so funny they always go  "i have no idea what youre talking about"  lmfao. anyway. hope i dont get shot (georges dream, and my sisters. lmao. oh goody. maybe ill hide in the building until its time to go.)  anyway. my legs are asleep. ill crawl to the tv and ruin my eyes.
