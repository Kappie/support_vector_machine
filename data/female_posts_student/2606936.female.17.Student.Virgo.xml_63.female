He is over six feet and his girlfriend, one of my best friends, is under five feet. He is sweet as can be and despite often claiming to be a reject, he gives great advice. A hug from T can make my day go from shitty to great, because he just has a good sense of people.   T is the one who .... well, this one time the Schnig and I had a huge fight (post-breakup) and then he showed up at Chili's after a football game, where my friends and I had made plans. The fight had been about how I said to someone "I don't want the Schnig to come with us. He makes me sad," but he got la pissed and made a huge deal out of it. I then sucked it up and asked him to come sit with us, and he acted as though nothign had happened, declining because he was "going out."  So I sat on my car trunk and cried and was too embarrassed to go back into the restaraunt. So T came out, picked me up like a baby, and carried me inside.  One of the top ten best moments of my life.  So anyway, though T is awesome, he has one flaw - he's a teenage boy. Which means he's got sex on the brain. And tho he has stated that he won't do NOTHIN' before he's married(damn, he makes ME look like a slut!), he makes sex jokes ALL the time. Pervy stuff. Like, I'll say "Oh, Jenny's coming to the movies with us!" and he snickers.  So he had come up with this "great" joke where he held his hand about two feet away from my butt and acted like he was an old-man pervert, or something. It was actually quite funny, but it got old fast.  But then I made some joke and he was like, "Audrey, don't be such a perv!" I reply, "Well, you're the one who's been grabbing my ass all day!"  The Schnig: "Well, it is a NICE ass."  We're in the fucking BAND ROOM, for crying out loud. In front of PEOPLE. And TEACHERS. And to look at his face, I have no idea if he was even kidding!  Embarrassing. Oh god. It was awful. I don't even know who heard it!  And also, there's that whole thing about how I don't like guys to make comments like that to me. Especially not my "friends." Easpecially not the ones I've dated.  T's eyes got kinda big and he left after a minute. I rememeber this vaguely - I think i playfully smacked the Schnig in the stomach as he said it,t hen realized what he had said, gave him a nice eyeroll, and walked away.  I vowed not to speak to him till he apologized. And we hadn't spoken in almost a month.  But then tonight I really needed to call my friend and I had lost her new phone number. So I had to call him to get it. And in talking to him, I kind of forgot I was angry. And then we talked for two hours and made a date to have breakfast tomorrow. Oops.  No, not THAT kind of a date.... I hope. But then, I'm still gonna shave my legs.
