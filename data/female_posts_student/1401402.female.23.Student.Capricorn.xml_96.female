I was just in the restroom at work doing the number one of course, when a person walked out of her stall and walked rite out the restroom door without washing the fucken hands. That’s disgusting dammit. I try to peek under the stall to see who it was but I was too slow. It just grosses me out!!!  Can someone tell me WHO, who nowadays uses their hand to flush the toilet in public? Have I ever? Heck no!!! I use my foot. Do you know how dirty your hands get after using the toilet? Germs germs germs germs.   Its amazing what people do these days. Not me tho… I love to wash my hands. I wash my hands at least ten times a day or even more. I love warm water running through my fingers. I love to squeeze the right amount of soup on my hands and just rub them together, in betweens fingers, clean out my finger nails, gosh I just love the rubbing part.  I realized that I also use a paper towel to open the damn door. You’ll never know where people’s hands been.   For those who doesn’t wash your hands after using the potty THAT’S DISGUSTING!!!!
