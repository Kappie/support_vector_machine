The real story today is Nate Robertson winning his 9th game brining his ERA down to 3.98. Robertson may be the future ace the Tigers have so desperately needed showing very good signs for the future of the Tigers. Robertson going eight innings striking out three all on Gary Sheffield who was hitless in todays game. Robertson did have a great start, but the most impressive thing is the depth the Tigers lineup is showing with Pudge hitless the bottom three hitters in the lineup all getting rbi's. Most of the damage was done just leaving it to Ugueth Urbina to close it out getting his 15th save of the season.
