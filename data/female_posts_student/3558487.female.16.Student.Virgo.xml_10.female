I was holding out for a while because i didn't want to "follow the crowd" but, now that its summer and now that i have much more free time, i've decided that I'll make one. I dunno tho, i kinda prefer talking to actual people sometimes. Well, we'll just see how i like it.   Today I have a flute lesson, and maybe memorzing the steps to marching so i won't fail that quiz on Monday and won't be able to teach... haha... what a bunch of crap... Welp, i should start getting ready now...   bye kids-  Lisa
