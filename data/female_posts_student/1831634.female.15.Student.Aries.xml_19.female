I think I'm the first in neopia to get it!  am selling in shop for 99,999.  hope someone will buy.  *crosses fingers*  too bad restocks are few and far inbetween in the morning.  *sigh*  I NEED TO GET NP TO BUY GIIIIFTS.  I must first reach 5mill, though.  then I can splurge.  I'm tired.  I should sleep.  but only half an hour to deadly dice!!  must stay up.  now, what can I talk about for thirty minutes?  let's talk about my favorite subject.  *dun dun dun*  meng and jack!!  =)   now who didn't expect that one?  oh, and btw, changed my userlookup on neopets.  the old one was getting boring.  I did the new one ALL by myself!  no help from ANYONE!  go me.  now.  back to meng and jack. (I sound like some pompous TV announcer dude... "and now back to the show!")  I think they're perfect.  they're cute.  they're opposites.  they'd bring out the best in each other.  I hope.  =)  it would be so utterly cuuuuuuuuuuute.  now.  if only they'd stop being stubborn fools and see things the way I see them.  that would be lovely.  pah.  jack has good grades.  stupid git beat me in english!!  I'm mad.  >_  but I beat him in everything else.  =)  yes.  call me obsessed.  I know his grades.  (but he was the one that told me his ID.)  (and he was the one that wanted me to walk around with him to see his grades.)  (so it's really not my fault.)  (PLUS... he knows all my grades, too.)  (b/c we just walked around the school looking at our grades.)  (...which means he prob. knows my ID number, too.)  (DARN HIM.)  anyhow.  yes.   didn't knit at all today because of cut.  must knit extra hard tomorrow!!  I want kailing to come over tomorrow.  so we can neopet together!  hehe.  alrighty.  I think I shall sleep now.  *COFF*  still hacking my lungs out.  now... only 20 minutes to deadly dice!  w0ot.  this shall henceforth be known as the entry with choppy paragraphs.  "paragraphs".  yeah.  ++sunny
