The title was "Rise of the Mushroom Kingdom"  It's at the end of the site.  It's starts of with Mario dying after being blasted with these huge bombs.  Then Luigi and Yoshi plot and take revenge.  Very bloody, and very funny.  If that doesn't spark your curiosity, I don't know what will. it's at   urlLink http://www.videogamedc.com/Pixeled_Parodies
