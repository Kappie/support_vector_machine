And now, my internet connection has failed. Again. -_-;; So as I'm typing this, I have no internet connection. My mom says that I'm relying too much on technology, which is true, but we're paying to get internet service. And so, we're paying for a service that isn't even working! That's not right! If she has to send an important e-mail and the internet fails her, what would she do? She gets pissed off just as I do, doesn't she? To put it bluntly, I live on the internet. n_n;; I know it's not good, but it's true. I don't watch TV because of this bad habit I have (I tend to faze out when I'm watching TV... and when someone talks to me, I don't notice... it's completely rude, and completely embarrassing) and I don't talk on the phone. Well, we don't have a phone. -_-;; I have a cell phone, but calling on a cell phone is impractical because it's expensive. Text on the other hand isn't very reliable, and as most of my friends text a lot, they're usually out of load. As for me, I don't know why I don't text. n_n;; Technology is supposed to be reliable! That's why a lot of people say that technology is the future! Sure, we shouldn't go as far as 'The Matrix', but I probably won't be alive then! 0_o  ...  You know, I can't believe that I'm getting this worked up about a stupid internet connection... I just hate it when things don't work, even if I'm good at compromising.  Phew. Haven't ranted in a while.. -_-;;
