I WANT HIM TO HATE ME I WANT HIM TO THINK "FUCK HER, SHES A BITCH" WHENEVER HE HEARS MY NAME EVEN IF SOMEONE MEANS JULIA ROBERTS OR JULIA STILES I WANT "JULIA" TO MAKE HIM THINK HATE. I got what i wanted...i didnt want him to care. i wanted him to hate me and not give me that second chance i really wanted a week ago, even a few days ago. I told myself after seeing what he said about me, "hell no not now", i made myself believe -- no gonna like him and im gonna end it right this second, no more feelings for him. and once i decieded that i havent gone back to feeling the same way. i know joe says i need to put myself in lornes shoes, and yeah...i know what he means, but hey- if i like someone i wouldnt say "hell no not now" after them trying to make things work, fuck him. lol and joe is makin me feel bad cuz i just have a conversation with some dude. i dont care if lorne gets mad cuz i talk to some other guy, get over urself lorne. damn bitch. lol ok now i sound like lauren. hahaha I'm lonely again, but i dont want lorne...make sense? no? didnt think so.   ok the good thing about today was....MY SOCCER CLEATS CAME IN YAY!! I LOVE THE UPS DUDE! They're sooo fuckin awesome!! :D :D :D :D I showed ashley a picture of them online and she said "arent u suppose to get blue and white ones?" everyone i asked told me it didnt matter. and i overheard some girl had gotten hot pink ones or something over the summer. god...it better not matter. it was $85 for tie dyed cleats...haha but i love 'em!!   oh and i made a 59.9 on my progress report in alg. 2...yay...lol
