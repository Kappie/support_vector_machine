Matt and I have resolved to write every day for four hours, even if we’re doing research or outlining, we’re working for 4 hours a day, as of now that is.  In the future it will probably grow to be more time per day, but neither of us have held a job in years so we’re trying to get back into the swing of things.  I figure that someday I will be a professional writer –as soon as I get something published, that is- and a professional writer has to be devoted to his/her job, as a job.   Professional writers, generally writing from a home office, have to be devoted enough to sit down at their computer every single day and write, weather they want to or not.  So we are trying to treat writing like a job and I have a good feeling about our approach, I have the feeling like It’s going to work out for the best, for both of us.  I am even going so far as to keep a “Writing Schedule” of the time per day/week/month that we “work” at our writing.  I figure that in a “real” job everyone keeps time cards and such, so we are too.   I created a form on Excel that allows me to write the month, day, and time in/out that was worked.    I even have a great idea for a book, now I am just onto the writing process, which for me is a huge step.  I am one of those people who need structure in this process.  I need to outline and research, and outline some more.  When all the outlining is done, and the research is as complete as it can be, then the book gets written, and only then!  Though I have to say that there was a time when I believed in just sitting in front of the computer and writing.  I know people whom employ this technique and it works great, but I am definitely not one of them.  I require more organization.  I think it’s a matter of insecurity with the whole process, seeing is that I have never done it before.  Perhaps in the future I will become more comfortable with just sitting and writing first, plotting and organization later, but I doubt it.  The further into the process I get, the more I am going to come to rely on this preparation before I can write.  I honestly believe there is nothing wrong with that.  Everyone needs something; organization and preparation are what I need.    So wish me luck as I embark on new ground.  Sadly I cannot tell you what I’m writing about, but when it’s done I hope y’all will read it!  Chalk it up to paranoia…   ~Kristyn
