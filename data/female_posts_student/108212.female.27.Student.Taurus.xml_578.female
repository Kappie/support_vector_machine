Only 51 more to go! Anyhow, I've been keeping a serious blog, too:  urlLink St. Cecilia Was Here .  I've mostly been writing about church music stuff, not sure y'all care much about that, but it's probably better than my dieting blog. So Ching, if you can add the link to our Golden Sushi page, I'd appreciate it.  And, all y'all, stop by and leave a note (comments by  urlLink   )! Daf/Jay
