FireDancyr7: Why is that weird and what brought this on?  crabbie3: well, i'm watching "Down to You" so that's what brought it on.  crabbie3: and it might be weird because she's never seen or heard of me, and i've never really met her. so it seems too soon in our relationship for love.    FireDancyr7: Aparently on June 1, 2002 I LOVED all of my friends... I wonder if I was drunk  crabbie3: what happened then?  FireDancyr7: I don't know, didn't write about that part, just that I loved my friends  crabbie3: in that case, i think that entry was mostly aimed at me.  FireDancyr7: Ah I see     [ Mon Apr 28, 11:11:18 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] I am watching one of the greatest shows of our time... "I'm REEEAAAADDDDYYYY!!!!!"
