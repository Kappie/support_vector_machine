I have been incredibly tired, and unable to think, but that is no excuse, and I will return to writing normally, well as normal as it can be from me!   What has brought about this sudden realization,I hear myself ask, and well to be honest I literally think it was the sun! The feeling of the warm summer sun on myeyelids asI laidon my swing,the feeling of the sun of my skin, thesounds, the smells, everything!!   x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x     So yes, um.....Ooohhhh yes.......Sue has said that she will try and find the TaeBo video for me, to save me from purchasing it, so as soon as that is found and my parents go back to work, I WILL be losing weight, yay, hooray, yippeeeeee, a new  weighing less , but personality wise, the same old Natalie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        Sorry if you dont like my personality, but I am not gonna change that for  ANYONE!!!!!!!      Ok so not a lot else to say today (that rhymes if you say it in a certain way.....well it does in my head anyway......ooh so does that,FREAKY!!)    Oh yes my quest (there I go again rhyming away)..I am not sure what day it will be but Shelley has said she will join me (theres another one look)...I will be off on asunny day, for a walk, a walk from Littlehamptn into Worthing, all the way along the beach!!       mwhahahahahaahahahhaahahahhhahaahaahaahahahahahaaa (my very poor attempt at an evil laugh-sorry)     Hmmmm I think I may take a wander down the beach.....hmmm....maybe just maybe!!!      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
