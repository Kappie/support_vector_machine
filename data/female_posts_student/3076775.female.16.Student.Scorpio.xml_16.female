I felt a little left out, considering that I usually don't associate much with the people that were on the trip. They were really rather nice though, and fun to be around. Laura Clines got State Secretary!!!! Woohoo!!!!! *ish happy* Well, I'm going to go. Gotta dry my hair and get ready to go to the Renaissance Fair.  Love, Shannon (no quote today) [will post more later]
