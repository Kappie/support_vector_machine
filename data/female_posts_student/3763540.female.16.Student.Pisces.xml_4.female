I am an odd ball like the grinch in a way I am far from a conformist if you think that the sandwich is peanut butter I will think its jelly so anyway...  Now you probably all are wondering what in the world is the realism plane, well it is simple this, imagine you are in the air high above it all in a plane you can see everything that is normally covered by clouds or walls on the ground and up here its clear you can see where roads end that you thought didn't end and you can see where drifting rivers meet beautiful gullies. So now I'm quite sure you are all thinking what the crap is she saying she must be on chocolate, but alas no I will explain.  That is how life is, my dad used to tell me that if you can climb to the top of a problem your having and sit on the wall then you will see how to fix it, in other words look at it from afar. And you know that really works. So here I am I am stuck in that plane that never runs out of gas and is always on the realism highway in the sky. I'm like the procedures who is scared to let go of the door because down there things are so cluttered. Instead I choose to live up here away from the bother and hurt of the world. But I'm afraid that not everything will always roll off your back and sometimes things are still too high or too far to see even in the plane. And of course I have another wonderful analogy for that too... I have no idea these just come to me bear with me its late...... So ok if your mom goes shopping everyweek she probably buys Campbells soup in a can you can use that stuff for anything, well if for awhile you stop using it and you suddenly go all natural you forget about them and so they get jumbled up and when you go to get one to finally eat when your moms out of town and will never know you realize that everything is a mess they are in no order. So you must then take them out and look at them all later and fix them correctly.    that's how I see to fix problems except that that analogy really stinks but whatever I hope you get a good laugh out of it still...  And so now that it is nearing 1 I must bid farewell and you can have fun deciphering this mess. Tomorrow I will get down to the real juicy issues I just know your waiting to read really these things are quite nosy but whatever. Good night!
