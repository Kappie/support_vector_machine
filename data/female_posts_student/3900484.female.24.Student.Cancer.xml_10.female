You have to be nice for as long as you are at work. I find it difficult to be so cheery and generally happy for such a long time. Plus it's such a drawn-out day since Im working mornings and evenings (split-shifts). I feel only sorta alive. Plus I have no time to run. That is making me a not so happy person. I think Im getting up extra early tomorrow to get a little "road-time" in. I hate that women have to put up with some crap that men never really have to. The whole double-standard thing. It's hard to be a girl in todays world.
