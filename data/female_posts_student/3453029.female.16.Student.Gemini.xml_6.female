It was a BIG deal for me, but I didn't invite a lot of people.  At first, I wasn't going to be able to have a party at all b/c of financial problems we're having, but my parents finally decided I could, but it couldn't be big.  I didn't care.  I just wanted to make it memorable!  I invited eleven people and seven showed up!  It ended up being me, Stevie, Heather, Kim, Laura, Emily, DAnny, Riggins, and my cousin Jen. We had a cook out at my house from 7:00-8:00, then we all just sat around the table and talked. It was so much fun!  Around 8:30, we decided to have the cake b/c Stevie kept saying she was starving, even though she had just finished eating a burger and chips, and then I opened my gifts.  I got a bracelet from Kim, a card and $20 from DAnny, a secret message pen and a necklace and a bracelet from Laura, a writing journal from Emily (since I love to write!), and a set of toe rings and an anklet and a bracelet w/ my initial on it from my aunt Judy.  Thank you all by the way for the gifts!  I loved them all!  After that we all went outside in the dark to my tire swing I have out back.  We took turns pushing each other!  It was so much fun! Then I come back inside and found Heather and Stevie chowing down on the rest of my cake!  LOL!  Finally, around 10:15, we all left for the bowling alley to go glow bowling.  When we got there, I couldn't decide who's team I wanted to be on b/c we had two different lanes and I didn't want to choose!  I hate that b/c they are all my friends and I love them all the same!  So, I decided to be on both teams!  LOL!  I went first on the team w/ Stevie, Heather, and Jen and then I went third on Laura,Emily,DAnny, and Riggin's team. But, sometimes my turn would end up being at the same time on both teams, so I'd have to run out and back to bowl!  It was so funny!  At least I got my excercise for the day! LOL!  We bowled two games, each team, and then we called it quits.  DAnny's dad came and picked him up and then Pam came to pick up Laura and Emily.  When Heather, Stevie, Jen, and I got back to my house, we all changed into out pj's, turned out all the lights, and watched Halloween 6: The Curse of Michael Myers.  We love horror movies! Jen and Stevie were the first ones to go to sleep.  Then Heather decided she was really sleepy.  So, then it was just me! I didn't go to sleep until about 3:30, but even then, I wasn't completely asleep.  Next thing I knew, my mom was waking up me and Stevie @ 4:30 in the morning b/c her mom was coming to pick her up @ 5:00 to drive back to Pawley's Island, where they live, for church!  LOL!  We were so out of it.  When her mom showed up, we said our goodbyes and then I crashed into bed!  I was exhausted. I still didn't get much sleep tho for some reason.  Today, June 13, was my actual birthday!  It was good, but not as fun as last night was!  I have to say that my sweet sixteen birthday ended up being the best b-day I've ever had and it didn't even have to be BIG!  It was small, but it was full of fun, laughs, and best of all, friendship!  So, I want to thank all of my friends that came to my sweet sixteen b-day bash b/c you are the ones who made it all worth while!  Love ya!
