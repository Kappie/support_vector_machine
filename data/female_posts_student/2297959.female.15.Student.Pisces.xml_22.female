Oohh and i may be getting my pictures developed today! and cheryl said she is going to try and have a picture party and i think it would be cool if you all came and checked it out because it was so great. so i will be calling you all in the near future because aside from just having a shindig, i believe that PAPRIKA NACHO DAY IS A-COMING! (note-paprika nacho day was invented by none other than kate kirkish and myself, meghan keyes, and doesn't yet have a set date) But anyways, this holiday will be celebrated by EVERYONE and i mean   everyone   so expect either me or kate to call you with a date. betsy's and miles's birthdays are coming too and i need to try and get/make them something. i like making presents because it is way more fun and thoughtful but it's hard to think of a good thing. so! i am going to do other things now.   adios amigos!
