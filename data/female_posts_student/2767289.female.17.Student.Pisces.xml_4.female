I don't know what it is... actually there is ALOT of things about him, but I really admire and respect him... more than any other professor I have/had.  So, eventually, when I gradute, maybe during my graduation speech, or after, I am planning on saying a great-big-huge THANK YOU to him.  And so this new blog that I am contemplating on, I guess I'll just gather my thoughts and then put it all together into a beautiful speech/letter, heh, heh, heh.   *** So it seems like things have been getting a   little bit   better between Serge and I.  We're getting to that point where we're starting to talk... small conversations, but still... Oh God!  This seems sooo immature of us!  I know!  But I can't go on without someone to hang out with... all my other siblings are never around, and he's the only one who's kinda my age, and he really does understand me...in some cases... I try and try to be patient with his "bad" side, but there are just those times that enough is enough and I burst out and tell him, and it all just crashes from there....blah!!!  Anywho, for all it's worth, I love my brother, and hopefully nothing like this will ever try to anger us again... *** I've got this awesome book at Presents of the Mind.  It's a wish list.  Haha!  There's like 6,000 things to do in life.  Really neat.  Kinda makes me think tough... once you accomplish all those items... how wold you feel?  Bored?  Like you've done   everything   that there really is to do?  Or create a new list?  Hm... to early to answer that, eh?  I'll write my answer once I complete the rest of the 5,950 of them...teehee!  Carpe Diem!
