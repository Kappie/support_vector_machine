In Gladiator they tried to squeeze the Emperor's sister in there for some positive discrimination or whatever the motive was to create this useless character. In Troy, on the other hand, the females are there because Hector was married and Helen is ofcourse the character with the face so beautiful they launched a thousand ships. But the movie doesn't hide the fact that it's about the guys, and not about the girls, unlike Gladiator which was about the guys too but they tried to hide this by introducing a character for the ladies even though the ladies like sword fights too...  I understand what you mean, Gent, but I feel he did a good job (the best Pitt can do, that is) with what the script asked for. I also thought that Hulk was a horrible movie, Bana was in way over his head.
