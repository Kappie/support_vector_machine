There was some random conversation about rainbow sherbert (me and Shane in favor, Amy indifferent and Tony completly against it) and tonight we got some, so woot!  I finally get my sherbert.  So Amy's cousin's (Tom's) cousin is here (or she's something like that.... I dunno, family relation of sorts).  Her name is Alison, she's pretty cool.  And Amy, being the genius that she is, told her that I like Shane, and she hasn't eased up since.  It's mental.  Dinner, I'll write more later tonight!!
