It was very nice lying in the sun thinkin of other ppl sitting in a cold dark classroom mwahaha. I got some rash thing from the grass tho (it's alright it's gone now).  Joelle made up some optus transcript.. which was quite funny... she can add the questions  to the blog later.. well anyway this prank of ours allowed for joelle to ring ppl up (even ppl we didnt know), only if they had optus tho of course and make them go through a demented set of questions which was part of our survey... the catch was that they could win $10 worth of credit! ehehe. Renee Gallard was just one of the victims and she actually believed it (joelle went through every question) she even thought it necessary to lie about her name - calling herself Michelle. Most of the others caught on to what might b happening. :(   I also got to go around in a wheelchair at lunch and show off my "wheelie"  whoop whoop. I brought the wheel chair back to Adam after that.. neways then in maths (which YES i did attend) i was punshed for being late but later i explained my reason (she apologized) but she continued my punishment of havin to sit next to Phoebe! with the excuse she was makin up for all the other times when she hadnt punished me!   4 more days of yr 11!! whoop whoop!! sooooo good... I think i will change my German exam from wed to like monday or tues.... coz then i wont come to skool on wednesday at all... the only class worth going to is maths AND that wld mean only 3 days left of yr 11!!!   I fixed up my room a tad too the other night.. got the stereo outta Oma's room and set that up with the speakers.. and got the speaker (top shelf) stereo system (middle) and my comp (bottom) so that my comp can easily just plug into the stereo.. anyway it kool (WELL I LIKE IT!) :@ :'(  rightio i off  later blog
