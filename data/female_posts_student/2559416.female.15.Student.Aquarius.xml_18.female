cocoa...which I hate...but I couldn't seem to get hot...or even a little warm...I kept frozen...so I decided to go out...find another place to stay...maybe at a friends' home or something...so I went out...and then...again.....the cold made my life miserable...the car didn't start...the engine was frozen...same as me.....so I walked...I was staying at a house in the mountains....but not that far away from some friends' place....so I went walking...but I got lost..the road had been covered with snow and I had no idea where to go.....then I heard a noise...it came from the trees...I went there and found a little girl...lost..crying...I tried to talk to her...to hold her so that she wouldn't feel cold...but she went away....well not exactly....she just rejected me...and continued crying..I stayed besides that tree....near to the girl...maybe someone would try and save her...and well...I'd be saved to...but she didn't seem to be looking for anyone....she didn't seem to want to go anywhere...then she calmed down...sat besides me...suddenly she pulled out a knife...but not any kind of knife...It was one of those hunter ones....with all sorts of edges...I got kinda scared...and then she did it....she stuck it in me....I screamed...a lot...but no one was there...just that little girl....killling me..she looked at me....into my scared...hurt eyes...all she said was she needed to quench its thirst...I got confused...but didn't care....the pain was unbearable...and had lost the strength to move....to scream...to fight....to breathe....I was dying slowly...with a little girl....who just said she needed to quench its thirst...then when she saw me almost dead...she said...- I'm sorry..but it controls me...I have no life...since I made this decision it has been controlling me...this feeling hasn't left my body..and it will never leave..it needs it....I need it...I'm sorry...believe me I am...but there's just nothing I can do...I was lost...just like you are...but at that time it felt better....it made me feel better...and now...I cant live without it...I just cant and I'm sorry....I'm sorry you had to be the one who had to fulfill its need...for blood... ...at that time I felt some strength coming back...and I was totally confused....What was that girl talking about???.....What was IT???....then I asked her....she looked straight into my eyes....I wanted her to answer fast....fast before I died...she said she couldn't tell me...I begged for an answer...I needed it....all she said was if she told me she couldn't let me die....and I tried to smile...and asked her..again...to tell me.....to please tell me and save my life...but she said it had been because of that intrigue that she was where she now was....lost and trying to escape...she said shed rather let me die...than save my life...so that I didn't have to go through what she was going...but anything felt better that death at that time....and I told her I didn't want to die...she said she had warned me.....but that it had been my choice...and I was going to regret it...very much.....but I didn't care...so she did it...she  *saved*  me.....by making me drink my own blood....it felt disgusting...and everything became silent....I fell asleep...I woke up...at night...again....but I felt no more cold...the night was the same as the one before...but I only felt strong...the cut the little girl had made me...Didn't hurt....at all....it had even healed off....perfectly...in one day....I freaked out...What had she done to me???...What had she turned me into...and....where was she????....seeing as I has stronger than I had ever been and the cold didn't bother me...I began to look for her....I searched everywhere....but couldn't find her.....then I felt this urge....this need....I craved for blood.....human blood....but I wasn't like the average vampire....I craved for it...but I also needed the meat...I remembered the little girl giving me some she had saved from another body....it tasted great....and made me feel strong.....stronger than I ever had felt....and...even though I knew it wasn't normal....I went looking for someone.....to eat....while I was /hunting/ I looked into my pockets....there was a knife....same as the one I had been cut with...it was new...well it seemed new...and clean...in perfect condition...it was perfect for what I needed....and I found the perfect victim....a young woman....who's car had broken down...I was looking at her...from in between the trees..and I came out....walked towards her...looking snobbish and interesting....she looked at me and asked for some help..I said I'd help her.....but the need grew stronger....I couldn't even act as if I didn't want to kill her...to eat her...to drink her....so I just took the knife y stuck it into her stomach...she was in pain...same as I had been the night before...but I didn't care...I wasn't like that little girl.....I didn't ask for the woman to forgive me...I just killed her....took her into the woods..and ate her.....drank her blood...feasted on her meat...and fell asleep...I woke up the next morning...even stronger than before....but my conscious wasn't clean...I remebered everything....to the slightest detail....it felt horrible....I had killed and eaten another human being...but I was no longer human...I didn't know what I was...I looked human...but there was something in me that had changed...and now I understand what the little girl had been saying....how I was gonna regret making that decision...and I did..I regret it...too much...now I know what IT was...she was young..and didn't know what she was feeling..she called IT the urge she felt....the need for human flesh and blood...and now there's no way back.....suicide just doesn't work....eating other people makes you stronger.....strong enough not to die...and now I have to live with this....without having the strength to control myself..to end this up....because IT moves me...IT controls me...and I'm not like any other cannibal...there's something more to it...something that cannot be explained...something that's stronger than me and that has taken over me...a dark force...that took the human away...and turned in the beast..
