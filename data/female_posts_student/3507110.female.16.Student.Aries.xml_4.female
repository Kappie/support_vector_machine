Why is an enigmatic word in itself. Who invented why anyway? But I suppose that question is entirely too redundant. I'm sitting here, 12:14 in the morning, thinking about who else: You. Did you guess that? Thought so. I should be in bed seeing how I'm leaving with Jessie tomorrow morning at quarter to eight. But sleep doesn't come easy in the wee early hours of the morning for me. No, those are the hours that your face seems to like. Kind of like a flower just noticing the sun and opening it's petals to the rays in a cheery Good Morning. But I suppose that it's better that nothing, better than forgetting everything. My arms have been itching but I haven't been scratching them. It seems that the more you scratch an itch, the more it itches. So I haven't been. I think you would be proud of me. It's not easy, there's always that little voice. She keeps me awake when I need to be sleeping and gets me into all sorts of trouble. I suppose she's the entertainment here so maybe I should thank her for keeping my life in unorganized chaos. My dad got home from his business trip today. I don't think he was home for more than 10 minutes when he and my mother already stopped speaking to each other. Is this how all 26 year old marriages turn out to be? A constant battle between wills and a constant barrage of hurtful words and actions? It makes me want to isolate myself away from all men and strap on a chastity belt. Bet you wouldn't like that idea very much. People can't all be assholes can they? I mean we aren't born to have our head shoved up our asses are we? It seems to be a big topic nowadays, probably was a big issue way back in the day. Are people meant to be evil or are we born with a blank ticket and shipped off on trains with the hopes that we turn out all right? Good question but I don't think anybody has the answer. Just opinions. Everything is opinion nowadays. That's why I maintain, you shouldn't put all your trust in the government. Not with all the dickheads running that place. Too interested in what can line their own pocket books compared to the people. I can't say that I'm completely for Anarchy, though it has its upsides. I think that if our government dissolve and we could do whatever we wanted to, I'd get to you as soon as possible and see where you wanted to start first. And then I would continue with life like nothing was different. We are left with impressions on us that can never be lifted and I'm one of those very impressionable people. Pathetic as it may seem. I really hope that one day I can see you again. Until then, I'll just keep dreaming.
