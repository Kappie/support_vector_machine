At around 2, I was deathly sleepy.  But now I'm just like, "Eh.  Whatever.  I'm doomed to get no sleep tonight.  Let's be a martyr!"  But then I didn't know exactly what was so horrible that I needed to be a martyr for.  So that ship capsized pretty quickly.  Kerry told me he'd be up at 6.30 to study humanities.  I'm waiting for him to get up so I can invite him over to study with me.  I already asked my mom, and she said it was okay if he came over.  Yay!  Misery just adores company, you know.  HE'S ONLINE!  YAY!  Okay.  Will talk about my night later, then.  =)  GOOD MORNING!
