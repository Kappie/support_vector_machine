I bled all over the carpet, just in time for our christmas party!  Then I had to clean it up and I felt like I was going to faint.  Haha.  I laugh at myself a lot. I don't know why.   When I was younger, whenever I did something wrong (in my own eyes..like eating to many cookies..)  I would hit myself super hard over and over again. I always had horrible headaches and no one could figure out why, but I knew.  I thought I would learn my lessong and never do the thing I hit myself for...but I wouldn't.  So I had to teach myself to stop.  Instead of hurting myself I would force myself to say "Its ok, everyone makes mistakes, next time i wont do it this way."  It was hard to change...the punishment somehow gave me the forgivness I really wanted.  The only way to stop was to search for God. It worked.  God is awesome.   I love him so much, he changed my life.
