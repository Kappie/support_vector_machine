Okay.. so maybe not today... but I was planning to do something today! (Yeah, yeah) Oooh... I can hear out of my ear again! (it sporadically goes *i love that word... i don't care about grammer ok?!* and i can't hear... which is sooo annoying! it's like being . . . unable to hear!) Mmm... I guess I just need some 'aaah isn't it lovely doing nothing' time. Mind you... if I had my way I would probably end up doing nothing the whole time, and that isn't good! Thank you people for dragging me out into the big wild world! Uhuh, let's just say that I'm drunk, it's easier that way! *mind you, if i was drunk i could probably actually speel* Ahh, that's the life. Woah, I really don't make any sense at all, couldn't you have told me?!?!!
