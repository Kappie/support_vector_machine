She said “I Love You”, Oh how it was true The feelings within I can’t explain My love for her I can’t contain  When I was about to tell what I feel My life just ended, I lost my dear What a shame I was too late Did I deserve such a cruel fate  I wish my angel knew what I felt, I should have done it before and got it dealt I love you my angel but what a sad good bye The last thing that I did was to make you cry
