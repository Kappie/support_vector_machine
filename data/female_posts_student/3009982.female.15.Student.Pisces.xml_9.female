The bridge part goes like this: Release us from our past As we seek Your face   Before we started singing the song, the worship leader prayed that God would heal the church's pain and past of all their 3 pastors leaving the church.   Was pretty surprised when me heard that since you know, it has been 2-3 years? And numerous preachers have preached bout that issue and I had the impression that the healing process and already been completed, that there were gonna focus on the growing process now.   Shows that some ppl in the congregation are still hurting.. No one brings up that topic already and the worship leader who prayer that 'God would release us from the past' sounded like there was still something holding the person back.  Reminds me of my past week, that I kept my spirits down because of my lousy results. When many many people told me to move on, try harder next time, work harder from now on. I still dwelled over it for a day. Thats 24 hours. But nah, I'm fine now, moving on. Speaking of which 'Keep On Moving' by 5ive is play now. Hehehehe.   Oh well, yeah that prayer just struck on a thought on how keeping the past with you can hinder you from moving on. Not saying that the worship leader had hindrances, just that it can happen. Whether that person still has problems with it or not, I do wonder whether the rest of the church members still struggle with that though.   Mmmm, shouldn't wonder. Mind your own business, M-R.  Goodnight everyborrddiiee..
