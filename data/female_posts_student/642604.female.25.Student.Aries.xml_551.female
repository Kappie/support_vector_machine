I can't remember why at the young age of five Lynn, my piano teacher, believed that I should but to everyone it seemed like a great idea.  At six my mother took me to a dinner theater to audition for a local rendition of The King and I.  I got the part.  At seven it was The Sound of Music and due to the ages of the kids and work hours for minors the Von Trapp children were cast to two different actors for every part.  But shortly after this happened we received a phone call and preferred me over the other girl by so much that they wanted me for every night.  So I performed, the youngest of all the actors, every night for a long run.  But I won't bore you with any more of my resume.  I've been singing for as long as I can remember.  I never went through the phase of wanting to be a doctor or a lawyer, I wanted to be a singer.  I had dreams of Broadway from the very first musical my parents took me to and the dreams were just made that much larger every time they would take me to concerts and to other musicals.  Special trips to large cities were planned just to catch whatever musical was coming around.  My parents never discouraged me so I didn't ever want to be anything else.    The older I got and the more I was told that I was above and beyond the best singer my age the more my attitude and cockiness grew.  When I was very young and we had first moved to D.C. from N.C. I, at age 8, believed nothing could stop me.  I was good, I was the school soloist, I was praised non-stop in church, I was acting in musicals, I was the best of the best.  So when my parents told me of an audition in D.C. they asked me if I wanted to go for it.  Of course I did, I would go in there, wow those people and call it a day.  Then I could go home and tell all my friends that I was going to be in a National Touring Company of Les Miserables and from there my fame would grow.  I had it mapped out.  After standing in line with hundreds of other kids and listening to their mothers tell them they were the best, I was ready to show them exactly what they wanted... me.  I had never been fearless till that moment.  I had been in dance recitals, piano competitions and recitals, I had sung in front of large crowds, I always had lead roles in the plays I was in... how could I possibly know what stage fright felt like.  I felt myself shrink the moment I stepped in front of the panel.  I felt my attitude and bravery shrivel up.  I screwed up the timing of the song, I screwed up the words, I screwed up the entire audition.  Before I could even finish the small part they wanted every girl to sing, the panel of judges cut me off and I was asked to stop.  This wasn't the plan... this was not how it was supposed to go.  I went home and cried my eyes out knowing that I could never show my face again.  I began to have doubts of my ability until auditioning for a very select choir where I was once again praised and given solos.  This continued and eventually so did my auditioning.  With church and school and even local theater I was a big fish in a small pond.  No one my age could belt like me or understand harmony like I could.  I was good at it.  Once again I began to believe that this could work, I would sing for my career.  I continued to head downtown for large auditions.  Les Miserables came around again and I thought, why not?  Rent came around and I went for the audition.  Both times I got past the beginning stage and with Rent sang in front of numerous people in one day.  But eventually before even getting a real call back I got booted.  It was my lot in life.  I would get further than 75% of the world of singers but eventually I would fall short.  Weddings became my thing.  They were easy.  Everyone always wanted the same songs, I learned the popular love balads of the time knowing they were the most requested.  I would get up, do a song or two and get paid for it.  I did well.  I was still getting praised, still believing that I was one of the best.  But my previous doubts would come back to haunt me.  I never got stage fright again until after a battle that waged at the end of my junior year of high school.  Up until then all emphasis was placed on my voice.  Showchoir at Chantilly High School during high school years was the thing to do.  I'm not just saying that because I was a "band geek" persay and my world revolved around singing, I'm saying it because it was true.  It was like a freak of nature event.  Popular kids, the ones everyone wanted to be, were in showchoir, guys and girls.  It was such a big deal that eventually three showchoirs were created, but the best and the brightest were in Touch of Class.  We did real dancing, lifts, drops, one guy for every girl, we were a serious show to watch.  Costume changes, scenery changes, we were our own little play without a plot.  I was in Touch of Class when one of the two choral teachers, my junior year, began to hint that I might want to watch my weight.  Now, other things that have nothing to do with my voice or performing were going on or had taken place in my life and my weight was beginning to suffer because of it.  I didn't care a lot of the time and things that had been important in my life seemed trivial.  But one thing I never took away from, one thing I always put 110% into was Touch of Class.  It was my escape, my release.  After the one encounter about my weight had passed I slowly forgot and my confidence returned.  Then came the competition in Disney World.  On the side of the main competition there was a competition for soloists but each school could only enter two.  We had auditions.  I auditioned.  I got more applause than any other.  Trust me, I'm not being cocky when I say that I was in.  I sang my heart out and those who hadn't heard me, heard me that day.  There are three panelists, not students, who decide the two to compete.  Trust me again when I say I know I was in.  But funny that when the list came out I was a runner up, I wasn't going to compete.  I knew that the score sheets were passed out to the student after the decision had been made so I went to my instructor and asked if I could have my score sheets.  He put me off for a week and a half giving me different excuses every time and then finally told me he wasn't doing that anymore.  It was all very hush hush and very secretive.  So I stood by watching two of my friends compete in the competition and not me.  I never said a word to them or made them feel bad but inside I knew it was because they were a size 2 and I was a size 12.    Then came the big one.  We had a big show at the end of the year which was a major attraction so much so that we had to perform three nights in a row just to appease those who wanted to buy tickets.  Jazz and Pizzaz.  The elite jazz band and the elite showchoir.  And don't get me wrong, I wasn't hidden, I was given a solo song all of my own, I had backup singers and everything.  But I was asked to not be in certain performances due to the costumes needed for them.  So unlike those who might not be in a song due to their solo being right after I was not in songs because I was fat.  Then suspiciously I didn't get in to the choir again after having an excellent audition for the next year.  I was devistated and heartbroken.  I was fat.  I was so fat that I got kicked out of showchoir.  Our showchoir was beaten year after year at Nationals by showchoirs with much fatter people yet somehow for me to be not in the single digits of sizes made me a throwaway.  So I moved schools.  Desperate, maybe, but I didn't not want to be in a chorus at school and I certainly didn't want to be in a chorus under the same man who had revealed to me that weight was in fact everything.  So I switched schools.  Don't feel too bad for me cause it was the best thing that could happen.  At my new school I wasn't the fat girl in the chorus I was the girl with the kick ass voice in the chorus.  I was back on top.  Except now in the back of my mind I knew I'd never make it as a singer cause I wasn't skinny enough.  Now for most girls this would be enough to make them anorexic... and how I envied those girls.  But other things were happening in my life that were far more important than school chorus and again my weight was getting worse.  I couldn't get control of it.    Then there was school, jobs, all the while I sang like it was the only thing I was meant to do but really I knew my life was destined for Administrative Assistants.  Who wanted someone who didn't finish college and really had never persued another interest in life other than music.. and writing but that is a whole different story.  I kept doing weddings and the occasional appearance in church but that was it.  I never rejoined the choir at church after high school because I had a new life that involved new friends and new boys and the choir just seemed like another scheduled thing to take away from my new life.  Singing got put on the back burner only to be brought out occasionally.  Then one day I got it in my head to reapply to Berklee College of Music.  I don't know why or what put the idea in my head but I got online, filled out the application, sent in the money and waited.  Finally it came, I was in.  After applying on a whim, after talking about going back to school for journalism or English Literature, I was going back to school for music.  Singing to be exact.  AND I was moving to a specialized school in Boston to do it.  This was serious.  Did I believe in myself so much that I knew I could get back on top or was it that I just needed a change?  I didn't dwell on that concept for too long, I just packed up and moved.  My first semester was easy as far as classes go, I made Deans list with no problem.  Music was in my blood.  I just got it.  I didn't understand those who had to struggle much like math wiz's can't understand those of us who actually found calculus a little difficult.  But the problem came in the singing classes.  My stage fright had resurfaced.  I would sing the songs beautifully but my performance lacked because I was boring to watch.  I didn't move, I didn't let people see that I felt the music I just used my voice for it.  Well that's great if I were planning to do jingles for the radio but for someone who wants to perform it's not acceptable.  My teachers were encouraging, they loved my voice, but my performance was critiqued often, especially by me.  The worst of course were the classes where we would have to perform and then watch ourselves on video the next class and critique ourselves.  Every time I caught a glimpse of my weight I would cringe.  It's all I could focus on.  All I could see.  All of my new friends were skinny and pretty there and I was fat.  As far as I was concerned they had everything they needed and I would lose out to them every time despite my voice because they were skinny.  I came home this past summer and I never wanted to go back.  Slowly, after spending time with close friends and family and after being given a reason financially to stay, I began to question if I really wanted to go back to school.  I began to talk to friends, family, co-workers I trust, and asked what they would do.  Every single one of them told me I belonged at that school in Boston.  So after talking to a few specific people who's opinion I value a great deal, I changed my mind of staying for me, I decided to go back.  But still I wondered if it was the right thing.  Then tonight I went to a concert.  Josh Groban.  Now many of you are probably laughing because I am known for the Phish or the DMB shows but music is music and I love it all.  I watched him, not dance, not do crazy faces or jumps or acrobatics, I watched him sing.  He walked from time to time, played a few instruments, but not once did he use some gimic.  And no offense to Josh but he's no heartbreaker.  He doesn't have a rebellious stage ego and he certainly isn't model material.  But his voice makes him attractive, his voice and his ability make him adorable.  He didn't dance.  I don't dance.  He didn't wear revealing clothing.  I don't wear revealing clothing.  He sang mostly balads.  I sing mostly balads.  His best work is something your mom might listen to before you would.  So is mine.  The point is he is everything I am.  He's just a singer.  My faith has been restored tonight.  I can do this.  My voice IS the most important part of a career in singing.  I am almost excited to go back to Boston and work on it some more.  For the first time in a long time I know where I am supposed to be.  I am supposed to be in a world surrounded by music, it doesn't matter if I don't have many friends, it doesn't matter that I might not have a social life when I go back.  I belong in music.  I belong anywhere where they can teach me more.  I belong anywhere where my grades are dependent on singing a song.  Just a few days ago I was saying I don't belong in Boston, that I don't belong here either.  Maybe.  But I do belong with music, with singing.  I belong anywhere where they can teach me how to feed off of music.  I found that strength once again to leave everything I love behind to further my dream.  It's the most important thing I posses and I will be damned if I am going to give it up.    I never believed I would be anything other than a singer and till the day I die I never will.
