Although there's supposed to be classification by colour but no one's actually realised that when they're designing. But all that can be fixed later, I guess.      Exhibition is pretty slowright nowbut I'm sure it'll pick up. 10 posters in 4 weeks! We're also way below budget at the moment, after calculation we'll only need $65 at most. At least, maybe $45.       Meetings have been coming along pretty okay. We've decided on our location, time, most of the props needed, and some other stuff like allocation of tasks. The proposal will be coming back soon, and for the non-exhibition people(okay now i feel like an exhibit), watch out for the exhibition!Coming your way 30th August to 3rd September, only in NY canteen. Guaranteed fun and enriching- with free food. Don't saywe didn't tell you about it.      I thinkthose inexhibition have been really easy to work with so far. Everyone's been really spontaneous with suggestions, although sometimes they get slightly far-fetched, and out of point. (Yes, like Peranakan food.) But all in all it's been good, and from what we've got so far progress will be pretty fast once we start on the posters.      Ms Fong was wrong about the class spirit - it's the same thing everyone was telling 2/13 last year. We really DO have class spirit. Everyone's just too lazy to do anything about it.September the 10th is only 46 days away (trust me, that's not a lot. I speak from experience with CO concert.)      I'm not going to say we CAN do it, because we WILL do it. =) Rock on, people!
