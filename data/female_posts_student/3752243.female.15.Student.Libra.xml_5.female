I know you can eat ice cream all year round, but it is just more fun in the summer, don't you think? No, O well I do, and since I am the author of this here blog that is the only opinon that matters, not that I don't give you cootos(is that how you spell that word? I am D.Y.lexic you know I can not tell these things.) I want my friend Sarrah to come home for summer, she promised she would. which means she has to. This has been a waste of a day. I am going to see a movie tonight,lets hope that will be fun. My post seems to be all over the place lets hope this does not continue in the future.If it does I would like to apoligise right here and now. So now that that is said, this post must come to and end.Hoccha is a phrase i will close with. Author-Eve.
