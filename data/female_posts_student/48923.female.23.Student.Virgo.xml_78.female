(kitty playtime)  1 to 4 hours - demented projects  (freelance, teach my self webstuff, my website of evil projects, and other things off of my todo list)  1/2 hour to 1 hour - computer putz around time.   (i will need an egg timer for this, to make sure it doesn't end up being a depressing 8 hours.)  15 minutes - stretch    15 minutes - midafternoon meal   1/2 hour to 1 hour - chores   15 minutes - harass the cat  (nap in the sun)  2 hours - freetime without the use of technology   (read, knit, other projects, more cat harassment, dinner contemplation...)  or work on the demented projects.  1/2 hour to 1 hour - computer putz around time.   1/2 hour to 1 hour - dinner prep   15 minutes - dinner --if i have a summer class dinner would be ultra quick, and i'd leave now.  when i come back i'll unwind for 15 minutes, possibly putz around on the computer, harass the cat, and harass the boyfriend.--  4 to 6 hours - freetime   (computer, read, demented projects, see a play, harass bf, harass cat, go to the park/the river/the city, etc.)  sleep
