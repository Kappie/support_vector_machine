Wednesday- soc stud exam. super easy. in facs we were making spagetti sauce and casey put some of our sauce into his and put some of his into ours. band me and katie-o were playing keep-the-tin-ball-in-the-air-game. and it was really fun until ms.wahl took the little ball from us. gym we played stfball and my team is REALLY bad. math with shuggy always blows.  Thursday- soc stud DBQ was stupid. mr.luc is gay and gives us a 3 day notice about our speechs, that danm, hippie. science we took notes for 90 minutes. french we had our little breakfast. and lisa almost puked, again(that happens whenever we have a party in french)  Friday- french profi. i got an 85! soc stud we did a review packet for a while and casey wrote poop and fuck in german all over my paper. in facs we ate spaggetti, which was cool. in band we played these shitty songs. gym sftball again. and they we really mean to matt solamano cause he got hit in the ass with the ball and jake zigler said he shouldnt be out because his ass looks just like his face. i felt bad, but not that bad. then in math me and jess glued an eraser to the bottom of a desk, but it fell off.  mmmmmkay.so later days                      MEH
