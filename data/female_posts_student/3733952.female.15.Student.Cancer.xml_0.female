So yea, I was stuck at a house with a bunch of old people. They kept like ordering me around. One lady was like "Missy, I seem to have misplaced my napkin..." And I'm like... 'and?' But then Mother came and said, "Livi would be glad to get you a napkin." Like the old lady couldn't have gotten up herself! Grr! Then I was in charge of giving cake to everyone. They treated me like I was a slave. And Grandma was introducing me and my 13-year-old cousin, Lizzie, to everyone. The old people were like "I remember this one (indicating Lizzie), but not this one (indicating me). We gave Grandpa a toast and had sparkling grape juice. Jon, Lizzie's 12-year-old brother, acted like he was drunk. It was actually quite funny. It was very nice that Sister was hanging out with Danielle, my 8-year-old cousin.   You may be wondering why the title is Einstein's Great Fall. Well, Lizzie and I got bored and went up to the toy room. One of the windows didn't have a screen, so I opened it. Then I saw some Barbies lying on the floor. Liz and I started playing around, tossing them out the window once in a while. Then Brother and Jon came up too. We decided to make a movie of the Barbies. It is so funny! Filming dolls being thrown out the window... The little doll's hair was sticking straight up so we named her Alberta Einstein. My favorite quote from the movie is: And this is my pet machine gun, Fluffy! Yes, we probably WERE drunk from the sparkling grape juice. But of course, Sister and Danielle realized that we were up to something so they made my aunt tell us to put them in it. Grr. I don't like little people. In the end we just gave them the part of screaming when the Barbies fell out the window. We showed the finally masterpiece to the entire family and they were laughing so hard! It was great fun.  Now, about the whole Jack thing. This is Livi's blog and Livi is going to write what SHE wants, savvy? If you don't like it, don't read it. Livi loves all of you dearly, but you have got to understand that not everything is going to be in your favor. I know what that one adjective is that Jack thinks you are, and I agree with him totally. Please, lay off!  Bye!
