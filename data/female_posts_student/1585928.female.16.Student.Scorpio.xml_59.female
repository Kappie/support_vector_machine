Tuesday night, Baker went with Me and Julie to Margarita's! then we met up with Johnny (Rob) and Charlie and rode around and did nothing really!, then we went to Baker's house and chilled there a lil while!... Yesterday, Me, Julie, Baker, and Johnny all went to the Mall, and old navy, and Marble Slab, and back to Clinton and took Johnny to his truck.. then Julie and Baker and me, met up with Casey and talked to him, and then we went to Rowdy's house! Austin, Derek, Rowdy, Nick, Charlie, Johnny, and some girls we don't like were there! Those other girls left shortly after we got there! =) they are soo gayy!, but anyways... While we were at Rowdy's, Me, Julie, Austin, and Derek decided to ride to Wendy's, so me and Austin thought it would be fun to ride around his neighborhood on the hood of the car first though!, haha so we did! it was funn! Derek was driving, he did good, thanks for not killin me tIn TiN!, hehe!...  so after we went to Wendy's, we went back to Rowdy's house and Steve and Kirby came over too!, it was funn!,  so later.. when we were taking Derek home, we got pulled over on Springridge, Julie was doin 54 in a 40, thats not that bad!, but the cop was being a bitch at first and was like I'm gonna have to give you a ticket for this one lil girl, because your doin 13 mph over the speed limit!!, and Julie was like ok, whatever!, and he takes her license and goes to his lil cop car for like 10 min. and comes back and it like, well I'm gonna let you off on this one because I hvae a son and I know how high your insurance will go up if I gave it to you, but next time your gettin a ticket and we were like umm aight!, can't we just go, and you stop lecturing us?... so finally we left and took Derek home, and then we went home!... I talked to David for forever on the phone! I finally went to sleep at like 3:30 or 4:00... Today, I got up and went to the tannin bed, then came home and got dressed and went to work! After work Julie met me at El Sombrero and we ate, then went to David's house! I love that kid!!*... We chilled over there a while and I just got home a few minutes ago!, but I'm really tired so I'm about to go to sleep! so goodnight!! ** I Love you!! **  -|-|-brittany-|-|-
