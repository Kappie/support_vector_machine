I went to robbys to go swimming for a little while, it was so much fun, except he kept kissing me and hugging me and stuff...ohwell, I kicked Duncan in the head and he almost cried *whoops* but its all good cause he knows I love him. hehe. theeen daddy came and picked me up around 7:00 and we went to go pick up serene from camp, I got to see JUSTIN (my love) and CHASE (my drunk)and VICKI! Poor Justin got blown up and broke his leg so he's on crutches but he's doing okay, chase has matured a lot....Ok maybe not but he's still so awesome, I can't wait till I go up there the 18th of July, I get to spend 2 whole weeks with all of them! *biiiiig smile*  I miss you guys so much!  Friends are like television. Some are like PBS and always asking for money, others are like the news with sad tales to tell every day, some are like that one station with the foreign language, you don't understand a word of it but you watch and listen anyway; and then there are the ones like commercials: always changing, ever so annoying and only seem to be there when you're bored. But every once in a while you meet someone who's like a really good movie of the week or that on TV show you hardly ever get to see anymore because you're so busy. My point is: hold on to the friends that you care about and since we don't have a remote control to mute someone or just change the channel, pick your friends carefully.   :-D      ...I still want some comments from my other posts...I wonder if anyone even reads this stuff....
