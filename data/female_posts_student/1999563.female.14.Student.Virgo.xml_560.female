Today I went to fred myer and bought this really good smelling shaving cream. Its like melon or something. I got Bed Head after party!! Wooohooooo!!!!!!! I have been wanting it for a long time, it smells super goood and it has cool packaging. :) The last thing I got was some dove shampoo. :)  There were so many people my age at the store it was kinda creepy. Summer scares me sometimes. I mean really, why do teenagers have to wander around the town all day...why cna't they be computer addicts like me?  I was going to finish my garden stuff today but it's WAYYY to hot!  I mean really, I cannot work under these conditions! It's like 90. TO HOT!! I wish it was 80. The perfect temperature. Or 78  ;)   You know what.  I seem to have lost all my confidence. I used to be this really confident person but now I feel like a blob of uselessness. Isn't that sad? I think it is.   I mean for improv you need confidence. If your not confident your scene is gonna suck. And I have my big competition soon. Waaa.  But oh well. I will get over it. Its these stupid braces.  They are cutting up my lip. :o
