Good thing i was "prepared" for this activity, how? well, we practically don't have a maid at home for a couple of years now, so im adjusted to the way of life i live, i help my mum and dad cook dinner...enough...this is not about me..lol.  anyways, after i cook the rice, we had some picture taking inside the home. I posed with Steph, Vick, Ryan and Charlo. They were nice little boys who are  not able to taste the lavish life we live.   I don't pity them.  Why? well, they work so hard to maintain their homes, to be able to eat at least 2 times a day... isn't it admirable what these people do?  even if they know they have no clear future in this damned country,  they do everything to survive, they just don't give up. That's something to be proud of.  They (Nanay Cynthia and her family) don't have the mentality of "let's not do something because nothing will ever happen to us in this country", instead, they work and strive hard to eat everyday and send their children to school. We should be proud of those people.  We prepared the fish tempura and we all saw how  Nanay Cynthia  was fascinated on this all-new recipe. we taught her how to cook it. Vicky put out the fish and we sort of de-boned it. I knew how to de-bone fish (well, a bit ;)) so i was the one to do it. Steph, meanwhile dipped the fish into the egg and cornstarch and the breadcrumbs. Vick was the one who fried the fish :)   Cool..the tempura was all done!! and plus, in fairness, it was GOOD! :*)  Rosy and Theres gave us some of their prok chops coz Nanay Lolet was a muslim and muslims are forbidden to eat pork.  Nanay Cynthia  also tells us that in St.Louise Village, all of them help each other. She tells us that they give each other food.  Yes they are a community.   We cook the porkchop. We re-cook the fried rice i bought and voila! we eat! bad thing was, Ate Rochelle and Charlo already left for school. They have half-day classes. but that's a good thing they go to school. But  Nanay Cynthia  tells us that most of the kids here finish only up to high school! That's why she always reminds us to study well and make do of our resources.   After we ate we went out and met up with the on the meeting place. The kids played games and we gave away prizes. These kids were so happy when they received such gifts. I never knew that a small piece of candy would make a child so happy. Probabaly because we were all so blessed with earthly materials in our lives, we often take them for granted and ask for more. Now, our lives only depend on earthly tangible materials..how depressing, right?  but anyways...we made our exit, did a prayer...bid farewell to our Nanays...The day is ended happy...with fulfillment. :)  Larissee
