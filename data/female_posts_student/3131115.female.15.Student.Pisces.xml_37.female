Well like..I dont know. I really dont..I mean, I feel like he tries to make me feel like I am HIS. I mean..I totally am..but I am a person. I love William with ALL of my heart. Every single fucking last piece of it. He doesnt need to keep my on a leash for me to do that. I want to be able to love him as a person..not as his dog. I know he doesnt look at it this way, and sometimes I dont..but a lot of the times I do. I love doing things for him. I love getting up and getting him drinks and cooking for him and getting him things and buying things for him. It makes me happy to see him happy. Although, I feel so bad because when I'm at his house and I ask for food he makes faces and stuff and I hate it. I know he does it jokingly..but he does it SOO much that I feel like he really does that and then tries to make a joke of it to not make me feel bad. I dont know..I love him so fucking much, I just wish that he would see that. I WANT him to be my life..I WANT to spend the rest of my life..I WANT to love him, and I do...He just NEEDS to see that. I wish there were some way for me to tell him that. *sigh*..anyhow, I dont know what else to say.     Baby..I love you, and I will always love you!
