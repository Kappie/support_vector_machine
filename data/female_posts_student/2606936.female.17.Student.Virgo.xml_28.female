We decided jokingly to discuss the meaning of life on a school trip and I stated that if you look at it scientifically, the meaning of life is to create other life and perpetuate the species.  Dom: "....... so, you're saying the meaning of life is to have sex?"  And you can imagine the rest.  But i was reading Jitter's thoughts on it and i thought i might state my position on it for ya.  I think the meaning of life is different for us all - it's what you make of it. But for me, it's to be happy and impact the world in a good way. If i can make one person smile every day, I feel like i've done well.  So many of you go around, worrying about not being world-changing. But then your presence can have such an impact on others' worlds, and you don't even know it.   I was once pouring out my worries about being important or needed or whatever to the Schnig, and he told me that a friend of ours had at one time been so sad that she had been cutting herself. When he asked her why she had stopped, she said a lot of it was because of me. Just being happy to see her, greeting her, made her feel wanted.  It was so small, the things I did, but they made her life that much better. This made me feel that my life was not a waste. If i have helped one person to be happy, then I have not lived in vain.  So just know this. This is why I am nice, why I compliment people, why I laugh at stupid jokes teachers make, why I make an effort to be kind to everyone, to get to know people. I'm not sucking up, or being "social butterfly"-esque, or whatever. My two goals in life are to be happy, and to make others happy. Y'all dont' realize how the little things impact others. My friends don't realize that sometimes, just giving me a hug or something can make my day. They do it because they want to, and that's what makes it so special. They want me.  And so, I try to give out, to "pay forward," i guess, the care that people give me. Just remember how much you mean to the people around you, how much your seemingly little actions can do for the world. Don't hold back on telling your family or friends how much they mean to you, because that's often what they need most.  To be happy, we all have to take care of ourselves and each other. That is the meaning of my life.
