While some people are in the Caribbean for vacation, I just spent an hour sitting at home making my blog look beautiful.  Wondrous.  It might last longer than a tan though.  Maybe ;-).  Real updation shall occur tomorrow, because I know that I've been neglecting all my little children out there.  But, I am quite tired now.  Peace.  Love.  Eat Moe's Tacos!
