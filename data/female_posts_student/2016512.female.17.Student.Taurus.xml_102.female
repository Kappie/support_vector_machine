(that's me!) i also watched the house of representatives discuss bills. i would have loved to been down there, but i already had an office. boo that! anywho i survived GS or Future Feminists of America as i see it. i'm out of shape because of lack of excercise. *cough* i have nothing to wear because of all the "government attire." my counselor never figured out my name, *woot go Doris* but i met some cool people.  so saturday i went with my sistah to paint an outdoor stage. i could have killed her but i pulled through. all i really wanted was sleep but i was denied. i hung out with her and the boy friend all day. we had lunch and proceeded to go to the Mall of America for no reason. grrr. and then we walked along the lake, but i tried pistachio ice cream. mmm yum! i also got some new books and SAILOR MOON! so i have watched the first 4 episodes but i've got 4 more to go. it's joyous!  i hung out at Amana's place that night. i made a character on some game she had. i liked doing that more than actually playing it. i tried to sleep the night away but was interrupted frequently by Blue and Scout licking my face or stepping all over me. the cats got a little out of hand. so i still have a major lack of sleep. i saw Les Miserables on Sunday afternoon. it was crazy-awesome. i liked there set. you can tell they GET a budget. but hey i'm not bitter.  so i'm at home now. the floors look awesome and my room is semi-moved-in. i've kind of given up on trying to do anything. i ran through my piano songs for the recital...which you're all invited to. i still have to glaze my project and stuff but i don't think i'll do that anytime soon.
