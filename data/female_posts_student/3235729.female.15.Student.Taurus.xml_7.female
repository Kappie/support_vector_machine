In 1st I pretended to read while Mr. VanD was in the room (which wasn't all that often...) in 2nd I zoned out during some abuse presentation, in 3rd I fell asleep, in 4th I pretended to dance, and in 5th I didn't do shit all except be really disturbed at the pink teddy bear that was under the sink in the science lab for some reason. The only class today that I did actual "work" (if you can call it that) in was Driver's. We got this assignment thinger, which was ridiculously easy. Which reminds me. I had my written tests in Driver's yesterday. One was a signs test, and the other was a basic driving test and shit like that. They were both multiple choice. I think you had to get 80% or higher to qualify as "passing". I got 88% on my driver's test and 100% on my sign test, and I get my learner's tomorrow (provided that I pass the eye test...) I don't understand how people fail the driver's test (5 people in my class did though...) A) It's multiple choice, and B)  Most  of it is common sense, although evidently common sense isn't so common in most people.  And while I'm ranting, I decided that more people need to blog. I don't know how many people read my blog, but I'm guessing quite a few. And most of them don't have blogs, and need them. I sit here every second or third day and write 1,000 (I may be exaggerating a little bit) words of rambling ranting goodness, and occasionally I read a couple people's blogs, but not often, because people are lazy bums and don't have them. I don't know why, but I love reading people's rants and rambles. Don't ask, I wonder about that one enough myself. So if you're one of those lazy bums who sit there and get to read the glouriousness of a thousand people's blogs without contributing to the bloggageness with your own blog, GET ONE! It takes like 3 clicks...lazy bums.   -Joebie
