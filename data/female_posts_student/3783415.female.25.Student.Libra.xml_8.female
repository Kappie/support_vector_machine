He is, of course, correct in pointing out that logic only demands that the set be revised and not which particular beliefs be thrown out to do the revision.  (1) All knowledge is thus and so.  (e.g. Nothing counts as knowledge unless you couldn’t be wrong about it in any possible circumstances)  (2) Alleged knowledge of hands, etc., is not thus and so.  (e.g. it would be false if we were brains-in-a-vat and that is a possible circumstance)  (3) I know this is a hand.  So what do you throw out? (1) and (2) together are inconsistent with (3), so one has to go. Moore claims we should throw out the belief we have the least confidence in. Which could hardly be (3). In fact, Moore claims there is no argument we could give that throwing out (3) would be the more sensible move.   How do we feel towards this claim of Moore’s? Has he proven we have two hands? It is certainly appealing… but… something… doesn’t… feel… right….
