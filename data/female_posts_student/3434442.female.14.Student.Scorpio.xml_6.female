Tomorrow is Josh's b-day, also when "the pact"(a pact they made that they would both be kissed by the end of josh's b-day) ends.  No kiss with Lennon yet.  I want to, its just that I get nervous and abandon the whole idea.  Very VERY frustrating.  Today in anime was great.  I played Soul CalaberII (spelling please josh?) and super smash bros. melee.  Lost both times, but hey its all good.  I cheered for Lennon and Josh on the side lol. *sigh* it was the very last day for anime... I will miss them all, except Kevin... nah he's pretty cool.  Josh says that when I want to do something with Lennon, I should go for it because they are equally the amount of hopeless romantics.  WTF is a hopeless romantic? Anyone? Never mind, thanks again Josh!Looks like they are both losing on the pact...poor guys.  Josh makes very interesting videos lol. Today in shop I was complimented on my "indian." Gym... well watched Rob stare at my boobs and hid behind Michael.  Math.. nothing special. Social Studies... continued to be interested in  First Knight  which is a pretty cool movie. Science... I got to be the mama bear in this expiriment, my cubs were josh and Lennon Jr. lol.  English... the usual goof off with ben and eric lol. very entertaining people.  Encore... studied my elvish.  after that i watched pirates of the carribean in Mrs. Ashby's classroom. CLeaned out my locker at the end of the day.  Then went to anime and you heard about that already.we sat around outside till my dad came, josh was 'spying' on me and lennon, again attempting to make us kiss.  its quite entertaining when he does this. Oh yeah, before i forget, some one burnt up the recycle bins on the 8-9 campus, there was paper and ash EVERYWHERE! Very amusing. well gonna go. toodles.
