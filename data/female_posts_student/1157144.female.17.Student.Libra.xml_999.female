It is suspose to be here on the 24th of June.  It's a dell and it's hella bling bling.  He even got me the bamboo green snap on! (it goes on top and gives my computer personality!).  Also, my dad is looking at getting me digital camera. Its a really cool little tiny one that is about the size of Kasso's but a little thicker and not as boxy, its more horizontal.  If you didn't read the other post, Jason and I are going to Hawaii at the end of July.  That should be quite interesting.  Me and Celeste will be gettin it on.  When I'm done with her, perhaps I'll move onto Jarrod.  Mu-hu.  Can't wait for SUSHI tonight!    Adios!  Only 2 weeks left.  BOOTCH!!!
