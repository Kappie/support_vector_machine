It made it okay to the dragonlet that dozed, hidden from the casual eye by the overhanging rock ledge. She wasn't old per se.. well, not for a dragon at least. Somewhere between two centuries and three, if not three and four was she. But, compared to the rest of the dragon race, she was young. Considered thirteen, at best.. and only then if one was feeling generous.  But the little azure reptilian creature, she was not the proper size...  She was small.  Miniscule.   A runt, which is the name that many of the older dragons gave her. She had been undersized ever since birth. Due to one faulty gene, one gene in her entire body out of the millions housed there, the one faulty gene that had the ability to change her appearance completely. When one her age would be by now roughly the size of a small school bus, she was instead about the size of a house cat.  Size aside, though, she had the looks of a dragon.. blue scales made up armored skin, lethal spikes ripped from the very tip of her nose all the way down the base of her spine to her foot-long, whiplike tail. The two scaly bat-wings that shot out from her shoulder-blades, the span longer than her body itself but right now, folded tight against her back like a tortoise shell. The deft, four fingered hand-like paws, each nimble digit accented by sharpened keratin stakes of claws. The strong back haunches of the creature like loaded springs, feline.. almost. Her mouth, the elongated front canines that protruded from her mouth to give her the look of danger even when asleep, the row of needle-sharp chompers housed within.. Even the lizard eye, golden, ever-searching, now covered by a filmy eyelid as well as the tough outer lid, out of the same material that her skin was.  Yes, she was without a doubt a dragon. It would be nigh impossible to mistake her for anything but, if it were not for her size. One would immediately assume she was instead a fire lizard instead of dragon.. if they were not familiar with the species. One with just a touch of knowledge on the subject would know by the ridge of spikes, the shape of her head that she was indeed dragon.  A Blue Dragon.. the race of dragon most commonly dealing with liquids, with the life-giving substance on this planet.. Water..  ((TBC- to be continued..))
