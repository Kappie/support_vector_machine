I really didnt know there were so many sites that you can have a journal/diary/blog on...but believe me there are. Xanga, Blogger, OpenDiary, Livejournal, etc. etc. Well im @ work again (can u believe im 14 and i have to work over summer? s0o0o sadd huh? i barely even HAVE a summer...two weeks at camp thats it. Thats my summer. lol. thats so pathetic. Im pissed at Mike right now if hes the one who went on a sn like seth's. Thats so irritating and petty. I mean that just proves guys are worse than girls when it comes to not liking someone. Its amazing how many ppl waste time online (i cant talk i do it too...of course) but it realli is. imagine what the world would be like without the internet. I certainly couldnt. 10 days until camp woo-hoo!! i REALLY cant wait, its gonna be awesome. Morgan you BETTER save me one of the bottom bunks in the back! Well i gtg ill write later. Mwahz xoxo~~Laur
