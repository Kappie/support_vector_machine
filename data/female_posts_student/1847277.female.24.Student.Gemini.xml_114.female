But lo and behold, it was actually just a new cartoon featuring anime style Strong Bad.  Funny stuff.    I can't believe I leave in two days.  I am in a general state of disbelief lately.  And I've also become crazy scatter- brained.  Don't know why/how this happened, but it's annoying, yo.  I keep losing things and forgetting stuff.  Sigh.  This bodes poorly for my trip, as I'm bound to forget some critical item.  Although I've already packed clothes, so at least I won't go naked. :)  I still have some emails to catch up with, some things to pack, some things to buy, and hmm, some other things I'm not remembering.    I think Matt and Diana are coming over tonight!  Yay!  That is happy.  I probably won't see Diana again until, well, gee.  I dunno.  I assume she'll visit Ann Arbor some point during the fall.    Hmm.  So despite all that's going on, I still don't have much to blog about.
