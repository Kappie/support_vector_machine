Despite the lack of sleep, rather uncomfortable chair, yucky hospital food, and attending to her every 20 minutes or so, it's acutally not as bad as I thought it would be.  I've spent pretty much every waking moment reading the Bible and having some long, much-needed chats with the Man upstairs.    It's funny how in our moments of greatest suffering, we are able to be closest to God.  I believe it glorifies Him, in addition to providing us with strength.  I'm sure that as a loving father He wouldn't want it any other way; what parent doesn't want their child to turn to them during their moments of great suffering?    Mimi is still in tremendous pain; though they've given her morphine, it barely masks it.  The doctors have come to the tentative conclusion that she has an infected disk in her spine, which has been causing her pain to the point that she can barely move without yelling out in agony.  Now her right foot is swollen and hurting, and she's having some tremendous pain in her right arm as well.  Not sure what that's all about, but hopefully we'll know more later on today.  .:Sigh:.  I do wish that Mimi would turn herself fully over to the Lord; she'll never truly have peace otherwise.  She's in so much pain that she talks about not wanting to live any more in that condition.  While understandable, it just hurts me more to hear her speak that way.   So, more prayers for my family are once again in order.  Man we've been through alot lately.  But luckily, God is up there hearing our requests.  It would certainly be nice to stop fighting these battles for awhile, though...
