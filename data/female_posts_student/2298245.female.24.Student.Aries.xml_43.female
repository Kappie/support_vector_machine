I'm done, and I don't plan on hanging around school, so barring a roommate departure, I will not be blogging for the rest of tonight or most of tomorrow, when I will be flying high in the friendly skies - the operative word being "flying"  not "high."  Perhaps I will return tomorrow evening.  If not, look for me on Sunday.    I will try to blog as much as I can from home, but given the difficulty in having to be at my at my father's mercy for the computer.  But we shall see....  Until then, take it easy...
