I told her about failing Government and breaking up with Josh, my problems with Jake and his problems with Kari. I got a lot of things figured out. I love Sandee. So then, I had Marching Band practice yesterday night. From 6:30 to 9 o'clock. Gee, that was fun. Marching around the Gymnasium floor, forward and backward, breaking to check my sections posture occasionally. Great stuff. Jake said not a word to me, and if that's the way he's gonna be, he might get himself into a little bit of trouble, or I might be okay with it. We'll see. And then tonight, I had music practice from 6 o'clock to 8 o'clock. I GOT MY SHOW MUSIC! Yay. Yeah, Kari's a little sneak and got it before the rest of us. (Sorry Kari, I love you). But yeah...I have a concert in the Park next Thursday. That oughta be great fun. Ha! Well, Jake did say he wanted to call me on like Tuesday...so he would have called me Wednesday, but I received no such call. Maybe because my phone line was cut by the Jokinens, who are building a barn across the street from my house, and I didn't have a phone for half of the day. Could be it. And hey, guess what, guys? I might go into the NAVY! Woo-hoo! That'll be fun. Anyway...I g2g.
