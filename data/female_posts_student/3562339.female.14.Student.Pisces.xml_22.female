We had an hour and a half practice today for the "promotion ceremony."  Soooo boring, considering basically all we did was practice leaving, practice entering, and then we just sat in our seats the entire time waiting for the entire grade to go up one by one and having each row practice standing up in unison.  And the most annoying part is that like Ian Cohen, Chelsea Citron, Justin Cerone, and Stephanie Cirillo were all sitting right in front of me playing this really annoying game, and it was like, shut the fuck up, especially considering that Stephanie and Chelsea were very bad at this game.  And of course everyone was sitting right into the sun so I was being blinded the entire time.  At least it's not as hot as yesterday.  And another thing adding to my brain meltage is the fact that the teachers aren't even trying to teach anymore, and all we're doing is watching movies.  I mean, it's nice at first, but when it's just like non stop, my brain basically dies.  Bleh.  In Science we would have watched  Jumanji , but we had Graduation practice instead, in Orchestra all we did was play "keep up the rhythm" and other such games considering it was a free period, in SS, the last teaching group finished, and then we started watching  Antz .  Then in Family and Consumer Science (FACS) we did our foreign food labs.  God, Mrs. Waters is like a dysfunctional Stepford wife, if that's possible.  My group was making canolis, since our country was Italy, and she couldn't get canoli shells, so she gave us tortillas instead.  Nasty.  Then at lunch two random girls were sitting at our table, and it was just like, fuck off!  Then in Language Arts, we just finished watching  12 Angry Men  which was surprisingly good for a movie in black and white about a jury.  And finally, in Math, we finished watching  School Ties  which was a really really good movie with Brendon Fraisure, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, and others.  Now that we've finished watching all of these movies, I wonder what we'll do tomorrow.  If we have nothing but free periods, I think my mind will officially die from boredome.  Anyways, I've been rambling for quite a while now, so I think I'll stop.  I CAN'T WANT UNTIL DORNEY ON MONDAY!!!!  w00t w00t.  ONLY 3 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu  P.S.  Yay for Alicia getting her braces off!
