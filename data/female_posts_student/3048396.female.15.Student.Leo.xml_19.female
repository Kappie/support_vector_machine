I swear it was the best one ever. I haven't had that much fun in a long time. Ross and I told his friend Andrew that I was pregnant and Ross wasn't the father. Fun stuff. He actually fell for it...and cared...it was great. I also told him I didn't know who the father was. It was amusing. Then he started thinking...hey this is April Fools Day and then we told him that yeah most of it was a lie...but I was really pregnant and Ross was the father. He kinda still fell for it. Yeah it was soo much fun. I laughed and had a great time.   Just so you all know. Im  not  pregnant. Just to keep that straight...lol  Last night was the Brotherhood Beef Supper at church. I had to work n such but it was fun. I washed dishes with my Grandma, mom, Keith and Beryl Marra...and a few other people. We had a good time...but boy we're my hands dry afterwards. Then we ate n such and it was yummy like normal. I love it. lol I think we had a pretty good turn out too...so thats good.  Today was just one good day. I had alot of fun. I don't know why...Im just SO happy! Its a great feeling. Jon gave me a ride home and we took the gravel road...not a good choice..he was goin like 70...and we almost went in the ditch..scary! Then we went crusin up town for awhile and he starting passing people...almost hit someone...but it was all good. We listened to Sheltered Reality. Good stuff. LoL yup. I make him give me rides...cuz Im to lazy...and plus I had my gay trombone to carry home. Ugh Contest tomorrow. Oh Joy. I actually have to get up early. Eh it sucks. I have to be there about 9:30...but I don't warm up till 10. Odd. Anyways....I guess thats all for now...  -Tara
