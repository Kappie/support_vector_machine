Walking..erm no..more like drifting around in the school. hahah Acting chim again. Oh well, my tummy's feeling very bloated. Loads of air inside that seemed to be having a conference inside. Debating when to stike me with a torrent of torpedos. Hmm.. Why din I get SARS? Would had been killing 2 birds with one stone!  First, School will close and exams will be delayed for people craving for a breath of fresh air AND I can just perished from the face of this Earth! Ahaha...so much for being corny. Maybe God has decided to make things easier for once in ending the epidemic of depression on this plantively evolved Earth. And I still hate myself mostly.. This past year has been nightmare at elm street. There had been wonderous times but after which they gave way to horrendous twists in my ankle-- leaving me crippled. Much too crippled. But I had been through worse times..so why do I feel so weak?  Maybe I've no stength anymore to deal with these spasmotic life. It's like living a life as showcast in Final destination (2) Life sucks only when U sucked. I think I sucked big time. ha
