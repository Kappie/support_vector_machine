(Disclaimer: I am very tired, please excuse any typos you may find in this essay)  First,  Irene  is in town.... just like old times really, except now we are juggling 3 cats that really don't get along that well... an adventure.  Second, VSU Career Day . I met with alot of different reps, and learned alot of different things. What I have never thought about was retail management. While this is not what I want to do long term, Walgreens basically threw a Jax job at me that starts at 43K. I have another interview later this month, and I very well might get it. Three students from the entire fair were asked to come interview, and I was the only one for the Jax position.  Mom  said "Liz, this isn't like anything you've ever thought about doing..." Yeah, I know but it is something! Still not optimistic about the  FSE , and the fact that I have little experience doing anything - really, I need to consider all options.   Third, Advising with  Dr. Adler.  I wish I had known Dr. Adler my freshman year. The man is pure genius. He knows the university inside and out and all advising situations as well. We have done a course substitution for GENS 4000 by using BUSA 4800. When he asked me for an "official" defense of the substitution and heard what I said, he commented that was one of the best defenses he had ever heard. I guess I'm doing something right. I then made a joke about being an advising nightmare, and he commented that I really wasn't, that in fact, I was very interesting because I have actually tied my three areas of study together. How cool is that? The director of the Honors Program called me "very interesting".   Then I went out to hear  Rick 's Northvia play. Possibly for the last time - but I understand that for him it might be for the best.  Irene  commented that it was good to see people her own age... I guess I'll find that out next year right? I got to see  Danny  , who I hadn't seen in a very long time... that was really cool. Hope to see him again. Also got to see  Miranda, Staci, Bill, Jerry, and Patrick . Good to catch up with them all and see that everyone was doing well.   Overall, this was a good, however, very exhausting day.
