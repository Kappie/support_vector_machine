A very good friend of mine from my school days apparently gave my phone number to another girl I was friends with WAY back then, and told her to check out my website, expressed the need to have an open mind, people change, but sometimes it is for the better, yadda yadda, blah blah blah.Well, I just sat through a ten minute tirade against me for my beliefs and my sexuality and how I am abhorent to God and my children will be damned by the actions of their mother. When she finally stopped to take a breath, I asked her what it is about me now that disturbs her so much, and her response(after a short silence) was that I am far too open about it, and that I should be respectful of other people and not put them on the spot like that. Not having any freaking idea what she was talking about, I asked her to clarify, and she broke down in tears and sobbingly admitted to me that since we were in the sixth grade, she has known she is a lesbian, and that she has been a closet pagan for almost as long! Wow, two closets she has kept the doors shut to for all this time. The kicker is that she is my age (34) and she is afraid to tell anyone in her family because she is afraid her mom will freak out(understandable) and(here is the amusing part) not allow her to date anyone. SHE IS 34 YEARS OLD! I mean I know her mother is a dominating bitch(that's nothing new), but that just boggles the mind, ya know? Wow, what a way to start the day! Oh, the end of this story is that she told me if I were to ever move back to the town that I grew up in, she would like to get together and see what happens...
