But to frikkin Sarasota...were ever the hell that is. I'm so pissed off. HOw can they expect me to leave my new friends right when i was beginning to be comfortable here?...They're like..'can't you make new friends' Im like hell no! whats the point?   I was so mad...i AM mad!I have never been more pissed off in my life! Well they already ruined my life by moving here so it wont make much difference now will it?!    Its bad enough that I miss everyone back in WV now i have to leave AGAIN...im just screwed. oH YA AND INCASE SOME PPL WERE WONDERING 'what about Dr.Phillips magnet?' THATS DOWN THE DRAIN...I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AUDITIONING FOR IT ON SATURDAY BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO IM NOT GOING TO THE FUCKING SCHOOL ANYMORE. that was THE school that i was set on going to besides Freedom. This is so messed up. I have so many other things goin on the last thing i need to find out is that im moving again. This sucks. I really can't stand my parents right now.They don't even think about what me and keith want...hell i wanted to stay in WV and they did't give 2 shits about it.    I HATE MY LIFE!!!!!!
