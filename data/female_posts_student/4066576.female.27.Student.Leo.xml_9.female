       
      I came again IAE to extend my visa.   I have been staying one and a half year in Toronto.  This time is second time to extend student visa.  I am sick and tired of living in here because I have to care about my study of English, visa, and money for a living.  I really want to take a rest and trip. However, I can not get a vacation for a while, maybe, at least 5 years.
