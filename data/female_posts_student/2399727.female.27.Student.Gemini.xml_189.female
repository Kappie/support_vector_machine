I've known who I was going to vote for since before the election was even called.  That was painfully obvious.  What surprised me was the accuracy with which this little quiz confirmed my choice.  I dutifully selected my answers and discovered that with 100% accuracy, the leader I am voting for and I share the same views.  That's a nice bit of rare validation.    Many websites I have seen have called this coming election the most important in the history of Canada.   urlLink Real Women  explains, "This is due to the fact that the definition of marriage and family, which is the very cornerstone of society, will be determined by the next government."  I haven't been able to find the flip-side here, but I know places like planetout.com are toting a similar line, but for much different reasons.   urlLink Paul Martin himself  thinks it is the most important ever saying it is "offering Canadians a choice between U.S.-style tax cuts and a caring society."    I personally like the comments by  urlLink Matthew Fletcher , "Is the Prime Minister so engrossed with himself that he really believes this? Or is he so naive as to think that his own MP's and even other Canadians will be inspired by more of his empty rhetoric. Yes, this is a time when destiny is ours to hold. I think the Canadian electorate will make this a very historically significant election; significant in the personal career of Paul Martin Jr. anyway."    More to come...
