Also, it is at this time that I am just getting home, having left this morning at 8:00 A.M.  Yuck.  I really should be sleeping because, frankly, I have forgotten the meaning of the word.  Therefore, I shall make this short and save both of us some trouble.  The parents performance of Robin Hood went well...as well as a first show can go, anyway.  Parents tend to be easier critics than most, though, because they are too excited at seeing their little darling to pay any attention to error.  All in all, it was enjoyed by everyone :)  After play, I went home for one precious hour to eat dinner with my parents.  Highly enjoyable.  I love my parents.  *grin*  Anyways... back to busy-ness.  Kacie hosted a little fondue bash at her place so I darted over there for a coupla hours.  That was the highlight of my day.  I got to spend some much needed quality cuddling time with Geoffrey and that lifted my spirits mucho x2 x2!  We all ended up watching Sweet Home Alabama, a fine selection, chosen by none other than Craig.  All the girls (Kacie, Ebby, and I) were happy about that one.  Good party, Kac.  *thumbs up*  Now, I shall totter to bed... goodnight my sweetie pies.
