Yesterday was the athletic training end of the year party.  I must say it was a good time.  I had a few suprises up my sleeve ;) caught most off guard which was always fun.  The best was seeing them smile though.  Didn't end up leaving until ten of 8.  We watched a Leauge of Their Own. I love that movie. Then we cleaned up and stuff.  Was the last time I'll clean that training room in highschool so I had to do my "normal" routine.  They, of course, made fun of me.  I guess it's not normal to ASK to clean certain things, but... I dunno... Miss C gave her speech to the seniors and I didn't cry, I was proud of myself.  It could have been because Mark was nudging me the making jokes to me the whole time just so I didn't cry. But either way I was proud.  Then... the hardest part came.  I had to say good-bye when we were leaving. I cried.  Yes, I know Im a sissy.  I can't help it.  I was sad.  weird.... anyway... that was my day yesterday. It kinda sucked- but it was good. I dunno.  Im just going to miss it.  I have so many memories from there and what's what Im going to think of when I think of my senior year in highschool and when it had to end... it just upset me.  None of the other seniors were upset but I guess that's because none of them really had a connection like I did.  Hell some of them barely showed up.  I lived in there. I "found myself" there.  I grew as a person and made some awesome friends.  It's just sad for me. Oh well, that's life and there's nothing I can do about it.  To anyone who reads this from the Athletic Training room- Thanks for making my senior year so great.  You guys have been like a second family to me.     Today was the senior awards assembly.  That was nice just for the simple fact that I missed half of my double lab in Honors Physics and all of Calc! wahoo.  I also got a $1000 scholarship so that was even nicer. Other than that, the assebly was long as hell and it made my butt numb from sitting so long.  Then was the rest of school.  School right now seems pretty dumb to me. We really don't do much in any of the classes.  Teachers have gotten as much senioritis as we have.  I must say, I have it pretty bad, but I can still do work if asked to. So far, I really haven't been.  Afterschool was the NHS pizza party.  We were supposed to get it in the winter because we raised the most toys in the Toy's for Tots Drive but everyone's so busy during the school year after school that this was the first time we could arrange it.  Mr. Roman didn't really like the idea of pizza during homeroom, I dont understand why.  Then I came home and fell asleep for a while.  I was so tired! then... I woke up and went to babysit. I needed the money otherwise my mother was either going to sell me to gypsies or put me in a debtor's prison.  I have paid my debts off however and things are all good now.  Other than that, nothing's really going on.  I'll talk to yens later.  (like how Im starting to talk like a Pittsburger- I think that's really funny, just a few more things I learned in the training room! haha) later!
