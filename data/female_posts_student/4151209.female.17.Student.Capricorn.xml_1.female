This changed our friendship-a lot, and I think he's afraid because of this- but I think that even if things don't work out between us- we'll always have our friendship- I think I might breakup with him- I can't pretend that things aren't different, and I certainly can't pretend that it doesn't hurt when he doesn't call- before all this started he called me every night- now, it's like never.  Why can't he see that even if this doesn't work out, I value our friendship way to much to let anything ruin it- the thing is- maybe it's already ruined- maybe. He ruined it by confessing how he really felt and then just ignoring it... I suppose, however, I'm the maddest at myself- I broke my promise- I let myself become vunerable- I am Brittanie, and  I  am a promise breaker.
