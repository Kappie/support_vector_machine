I spent every saved up penny from babysitting and other odd jobs over the (can we call it this?) summer.   So here we are in the mall...im so freakin excited and i pick out some real cute stuff and my mom rushes me through every store and makes it like impossible for me to be a "bargin shopper" (me only having 300 bucks ya know)...and she refuses to buy me anything!(grr) so heres a girl who for the last 2 years spends a ton of $$ on clothes and shit for school and this year shes tellin me to wear what i had last year and blah blah blah...newho...so i get home and my jeans are to big, my sweaters are to big and some shirts are too small...im like "WHAT IS THIS?!" So i have to take most of em back, lol...(i also got a cute poncho-i like!)   But i got the TBS cd and the Ashlee Simpson cd so i was pretty content for the rest of the night even after a hell of a shoppin day!         Tonight was fun...my daddy came over and we decided to make s'moes on the bonfire so my mom made me and nick go to 7-11, lol. We orderd pizza, made some s'moes and drank. It was interesting i suppose...i had one stinkin wine cooler(which is like nothin) and i swear to god i was drunk(not really)...my brother thought i was insane...i fell off the computer chair and i just could not stop laughing...then i had this massive headache but i kept drinking and got sick to my stomach...took a shower and did my hurr..   yeah i deff cannot trust myself w/ scissors man, i tried to trim my bangs and now they're all uneven and its rediculous...i shoulda left em!    Such craziness...ohh and i soo wanna have a party, lol...like fer serious. I wanna have a party the last weekend b4 school so i can be like: its a "NO!!SUMMER'S NOT OVER YET!! party...but i highly doubt that would happen...unless u wanna bring the beer and we chill in my back yard with the 'squitoes(west nile!) or...we can have it in the livingroom(lmao!) Which ever u perfer.      well im out...nighty night!    xo: amanda
