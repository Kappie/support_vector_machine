But I would walk 500 miles, and I would walk 500 more...  E3 is awesome. personal picks: world of warcraft and femme fatale 2:crimson butterfly. personal boos: any game which relies on sex and/or violence as its main/sole selling point (ex: grand theft auto!!).  i was waiting in line for the halo 2 demo when a portly man with a digital camcorder accosted me. "z'cuse me miz," he says with a heavy accent. "i vork for the finland yada yada company. vood u mind being interviewed for a review i am doing on ze show?" sure...but i'm not really in the industry, i say. "iz no problem," he reassures me. "just say how u like ze show, vat u think of ze games, very zimple." okay, i can do that. "oh, by ze way, at ze end of the ze interview, i vill ask u to zpit in my face." p-pardon...u want me to zpit in vous face?? (french, finnish, whatever) "yes, zpit in my face. zpit zpit. it's ze vay i end all my interviewz. kind of like my zignature." uh...i don't think i'm comfortable with that. "ok zen. i give u 50 dollars. zpit in my face."   sorry senor, i only zpit on ppl i know. but danke all the same.
