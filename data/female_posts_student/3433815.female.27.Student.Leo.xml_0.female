Sure talking and finding out what's going on in everyone's lives are great to hear, but not only do I not have the money to spend on alcohol (very overpriced, by the way! but I'm not drinking, cause I'm driving), I now start watching other people at the bar, and wonder; do they know that they are acting so dum, then I feel really old, like a mom. Don't get me wrong I enjoy getting a good buzz, but would rather be at someone's home (spending less and able to crash if needed). So now I feel old. yes it's good to be and act responsible, but what happened to the carefree years? did I even have them? hmm... anonymous - Thanks for your comments. I hear EXACTLY what you mean. believe me I have said the same things to myself. (moving on) sometimes I wish I had a magic drug that could erase memories / feelings / hate. just to forget it all, cause right now all I think of is the bad and feel that all guys will be the same, that there is no hope for the future. and did I mention that I'm getting (feeling) old (almost 27! eww)!? ugh! well we will see how tonight goes, I'm going out (some friends have flown in), I may even drink! maybe even dance?! ugh (can I shave off a million pounds first?) Wish me luck! :)
