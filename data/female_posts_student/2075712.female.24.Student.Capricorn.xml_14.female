I live on the west coast and these yummmy treats are sold on the east coast..I found a recipe online but to be honest I've been to lazy to try making them.  Anyways...I'll stop being a fat ass now and stop talking about food, like always.  I've had light brown hair with blond highlights for over 3 years now and now that I've completely dried out my hair and scalp, I've been thinking about going to back to my  natural color...dark dark almost black brown hair.  I would really like to save some $$$ and do it myself at home but the last time I tried this my hair turned brownish green...which was NOT cute.  I'm gonna go now cuz I'm gonna do some research on dying my hair at home...oh, yeah and I'm gonna attempt to add a shout box...not that anyone visits my site...I just think they're cool to have.
