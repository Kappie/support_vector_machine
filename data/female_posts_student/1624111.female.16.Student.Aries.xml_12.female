I dont remember what it was called "Circle of..." something. What it was was all these circles laid out with a tiny one that said (me) in the center (it was like a dart board or something) and we were supposed to put our friends in the circles. our friends, our parents, our neighbors, basically anybody we knew. and the circles (there must have been like…7) went in order…like…the circle closest to the (me) was for the people you knew the best. and then you put arrows on the people you wanted to “move” and youd point the arrow to the circle you wanted them to be in. and eventually we had to put God in one of our circles. the point of this whole activitiy was for all of us to go “wow, God is only in circle 6.” and to draw a little arrow from Him pointing to the inner circle. something like that. but the thing I remember about this stupid confirmation thing was what my teacher said. now I never really liked this woman all that much or thought she was incredibly intelligent, but for some reason I haven’t forgotten something she said. she was talking about that inner circle…the one closest to you. and she said that in your entire life…you only really get a few people who ever truly belong in that inner circle. I think she said two or three. and she wasn’t saying this to scold us for putting too many people in our closest circles…she was just kind of saying it reflectively. like…if at the end of your life you look back and do this exercise, youd only have a handful of people who really belong in that circle. well, that inst exactly what she said, but that’s an explanation. and im not exactly sure why I remember that… i guess it just got me thinking. and that was a long time ago, so ive been thinking for quite a while. I was just thinking that those are the people that you really truly love…the people in your closest circle. not that you don’t love other people…and not that it isn’t real…but, there’s like “I love you, youre a great person, im gald I know you” and then theres like “I love you, I cant live without you” and theres a difference. Like monica said, "to love someone, you have to know them. And I don’t mean you have to know what kind of food they like, or what their favorite song is. You have to understand them; deeper than any preference, you have to know...their soul" and I don’t think you can do that with just anyone. i think the people that you really really love are the people who mean everything to you...those few people. like your husband or your wife or your closest friends. like...i was thinking about souls a while ago... there are the people who youre like "yeah, im pretty sure they have a soul..." but you dont really know them all that well. (not that anybody doesnt have a soul, but...) and then there are the people who youre like "i know they have a soul." and you just know it. but then there are the people who...whos souls youve...known. whos souls youve...felt. people who...even if you doubted the basic goodness of humanity you could say "this person has a soul." and...i dunno. you can just...look in their eyes and feel it. that reminds me of this bible passage..."...the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of david, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul." (1 Samuel 18:1) i think thats real love (friendshipwise, at least). to actually have your soul be "knit" with the soul of another. i think you have to have an incredibly deep understanding of another person to have something like that. and i think you only really get to know a few people that well in your entire lifetime. I think there are very few people you ever truly fully understand. what was it dickens said? "every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other" (Tale of Two Cities, chapter 3, my page 21) yeah...so i think you only really ever know a few people so well as to know...their souls. And those are the people in your “inner circle” of relationships. Those are the people who change your life…those are the people you really love. the people you understand beyond any knowledge of likes and dislikes…the people you care about more than anything. And I guess…my point is…well, I have to be careful not to take those people for granted. I have to be careful not to lose them, because you get so very few in an entire lifetime. You have to remember that these are the people who make you…whole. I remember part of one of my Pleasantville quotes I omitted was “Maybe you only know it when its gone. Maybe its like theres a whole piece of you thats missing too.” That’s when bud’s talking to his dad and hes making his dad (george) realize that he really does love betty and that “maybe it isn’t just the cooking or the cleaning” that he misses. And I think those few people almost become such an important, necessary part of your life, that they become a part of who you are, that they, as I said, make you…whole. and those are the people in your “inner circle” (or…perhaps they overlap with the (me) a little bit) those are the people you  really  love. and that’s all im going to say about love because that’s all I’m prepared to defend. So…just…remember you only get a few and remember to let them know you really care about them. appreciate those people for me, okay? Thanks.
