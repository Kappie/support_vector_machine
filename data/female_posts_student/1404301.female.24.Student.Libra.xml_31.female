I am meeting one of my fencing friend for lunch, her name is Sarah. I met her 2 years ago when I first arrived in Adelaide.   At 1pm I will be back at the library and I will try to think about International Finance, not that interesting but if I want to be a business woman one day, I have to deal with it I suppose.  Then at 5pm, let's go to work, I am doing the dishes in a pizzeria - pretty interesting job but lovely people I work with.  Finaly, the best part of my day will be to meet Dylan at home to have diner...I wish it could be 11.15pm already...  Hope you are having a good day!
