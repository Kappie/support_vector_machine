Nothing much crackin' on this side of the fence, so yeah. In closing, I read the ultimate "fuck you" Shakespeare-style in a book today.  "May your first day in hell last ten-thousand years, and may it be the shortest." Wow. If it wasn't so colloquial that would be an awesome thing to piss people off with.  And give me EC Kelly, I just used a vocab word.
