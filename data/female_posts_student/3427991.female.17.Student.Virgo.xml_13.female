The la Salle Canteen  sucks ...worse than all saints..worse than Lokyuk...Its small..not much variety.....n its well..very Malayish...if thats wat u called it... Duh....i need to bring my own lunch bag....  N it seems to me that is either La Sallians are use to mingle up around boys too often..they doesnt seem to be GENTLEMEN at all....N they got well...picked by our MUET teacher...a lady with  superb  english...really superb.....well anyway she said sth like ex-lasallians from our class should have show us or guide us a bit lah..instead of mingle back to their own group..should have set examples or sth...well in which ovbiusly they didnt...hahahhaha......n well they called this SHY....heheh..since there is only about around one class of girls if all the girls add up together..in the entire school...since La Salle only  accepts  girl starting from Form 4...in which majority of the girls are in Form 6.......
