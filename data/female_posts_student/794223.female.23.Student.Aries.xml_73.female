If he's not better by tomorrow, the both of us are going to the doctor to get tested.  The good news: Opa put an offer on the house in East Bernard.  It's this beautiful, one-story house with several hundred more square feet than ours, and mountains of storage space.  In addition to being exactly the kind of house my grandfather has been looking for, it's about a quarter of a mile from Aunt Rite's.  This is so important, as Mimi will need to be closer to family after she leaves the hospital.  This way, she can be within driving (or even walking) distance of her daughter and 2 other granddaughters--Jamie and Brandi.  As I will be leaving Texas for Grad School in August, I will rest significantly easier knowing that my folks will be basically next door to the rest of the family.  This house, assuming that we do buy it, is such a blessing from God.  After the hell that we've through since Christmas, it is amazing to know that the Lord is indeed providing.  Not only has He given Brandi a second chance at life, but He is providing my grandparents with the support and means to be taken care of without so much worry.  And I've been insanely blessed, with Tulane basically wanting to fund my graduate career.  Caroline's right--life in our family is never a happy medium or in-between; it alternates between devastating nightmares and miraculous, divine blessings.  Most people have one our two gut-wrenching experiences in their lives, and are lucky to have a miracle occur.  Our family goes from rock bottom in the pits of despair to ecstatic moments from heaven, with no interim period of just moving on about your business.  I feel as if my life has been one giant, bizaare ping-pong game.  While I don't envision that changing for me anytime soon, I sincerely hope that my grandparents can enjoy some peace and quiet during their remaining years, instead of CRISIS...Miracle.  CRISIS...Miracle.  CRISIS...Miracle.
