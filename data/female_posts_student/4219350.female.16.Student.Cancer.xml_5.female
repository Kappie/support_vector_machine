I feel kind of bad, his family went to the beach but he couldn't go because I was there. He said he didn't mind or whatever, but I still sort of worry that he did. Typical fears. Oh yes, and I am now his "biznitch" I think thats how the line of thought he was saying went. I wasn't really paying much attention. He was joking anyway. Though, if he wanted he could have me seriously whipped, more so then now. Mom got me two pairs of jeans and some anti frizz stuff for my hair. I don't really have the heart to tell her I'm not going to use the stuff for my hair, it would be to much work. Well maybe if i was going out or something. But well, that never happens. I'm what you call a social hermit. At least that's how I see myself. I only come out when I have to, or when Jamie will be there. You know... I'm more or less obsessive about Jamie, in case you didn't notice. But my life basically revolves around him. Him and school is my life. Kind of sad really, I'm almost 16 and one of the major things in my life is school. The Jamie part is fine though. I wish my birthday would hurry up and get here, I want my book.  Still a while though. I can wait I guess.  BNR
