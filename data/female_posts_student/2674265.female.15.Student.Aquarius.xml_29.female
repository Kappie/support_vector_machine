So. as i was walking down the road a grey van pulled up beside me. a man in a black suite and a red tie grabed me and pulled me in. the van smelled of insences.  Blossom. and was very bright on the inside. like in the movie austin powers. there was a little boston terrier sitting on my feet. he was fat. i felt like laughting at this fat dog but thought shouldnt i be scared. i wasnt. It was humerious adn cheerfull therefor i was not frightened. The man in the suite turned to me." I am Felix. Felix Sway. I am an Van Gogh inpersonator and i need your help. I here you can paint." i shook my head in a yes motion. "but not van gogh. " i looked at him questionably. "you know"he said," any other kid would be screaming about haveing to get to school right now." "you couldnt ahve kidnaped that many kids then cause i dont know a one that woukkld ask for you to take them to school. " "whatever" he walked off. .....................to be continued...
