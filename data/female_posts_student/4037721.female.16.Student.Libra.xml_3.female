I still tried to get that one hour, but alas I cannot force myself to goto sleep at the drop of a hat. So I ended up just staying awake in bed listening to my music until the time came to leave for the airport. Once everyone was awake and had taken in some form of caffine to keep awake, we stuffed our suitcases into the small boot of our small car. It only just fit mind you. I think my Mother packed way to much for one weeks worth of holidaying. The way to Luton went faster than normal and I only saw one other car coming in the opposite direction, well what do you expect at 3am!      Soon we had parked the car in the long term car park and hopped onto the shuttle bus round to the departure termial, struggeling with the sheer amount of lugguage we had and stuffing it along withour selfs onto four bus seats and left the larger on in the asile beside my Father. Once the bus stopped we all dragged our tired selfs and our luggage to the check in gates. We didn't have to wait as long as I had expected to be checked in, we only stood in a small que for about five minuites and we were at the check in having our tickets and passports scanned and checked by the eyes of the woman who was weighing our lugage. I was quite suprised that we hadn't gone over the limit. She handed us our boarding tickets and my Mother said that we had seats A, B, C and D in row 29 and that one of us would be sitting on our own with two stangers. No one said anything as we knew that the person would be Dad.      By this time everyone needed refueling with food and caffine and we stopped at the cafe before proceding to the boarding louge. My Mother needed some caffine quick, so while she went to do that My Father, My Brother and Myself went to check out the small shop that sold almost anything you would need for your travels in one place. My Brother brought some sweets for the flight while my Father and Myself scowered the books to see if there was anything worth buying. After some consideration my Father decided to purchase a Bill Bryson book he had yet to read called "Notes from a Big Country" to read on the holiday.      We went to meet my Mother in the cafe and she decided it was time to move onto the depature lounge. By this time I was not looking foward to the flight or the holiday at all, and knowing what charter flights are like, I knew that we were all going to be crushed into a small space for the following four hours. We had a couple of drinks at the bar, brought some breakfast to eat on the plane as we had decided to save money and our taste buds my skipping the in flight meal. We all headed to the toilet once more before eventually boarding, and by this time the display was now flashing red saying that it was the last call for our flight.      We all rushed off to the depature gate before having our passports inspected for the third time already and got onto the bus that took us round to the aeroplane. Along with an odd 30 other tired passangers we climbed up the shaking stairs to the crampt aeroplane. We took our seats and as always I got the window seat. I like to know whats happening outside, and as I predicted the seats were very uncomfertable. Not only are they too small for a very short skinny person, but I am tall and have a larger ass, so I was not very happy. It was so uncomfertable, I couldnt bare to sit there for more than about ten minuites, never mind four hours.      After a rather dodgey take off, and some squirming in my seat and a long four hours of turbulance we landed in Fueteventura. It all looked very dry, not much greenery to be seen, and I was starting to worry what our holiday would end up like. After getting off the plane and collecting our luggage, we made our way round to the First Choice rep to find out where we would be staying. She said in a rather high voice "You Will Be Staying at the Maxogarden Villas" finishing it off with a cheesy grin. We were all a bit puzzled by the 'villas' part as we had booked late and payed less than 1k for this holiday and only had the garente that we would get a three star, one bedroomed apartment that sleeps four adults. We decided that it must be a big villa that is split into apartments, we wouldnt get our own villa for the price we paid...would we?      Soon after a seemingly short coach ride, we were dropped off outside an apartment complex called "Verdemar Apartmentos" and were told that Maxogarden Villas were under their management. We went down to the reception and the receptionist told us that our accomadation was still being cleaned so we would have to wait an hour. So we went and sat by the pool bar and had a couple of drinks and puzzled over where we would be staying. As we were surrounded by alot of green and white apartments with a communial pool, we guessed we would get one of those.      Soon our accomadation was ready and we were told how to find it, by crossing the street for some reason. As we approched the villa looking accomadation we thought that she had given us the wrong instructions and I saw a "No Diving" sign and a life ring on the wall outside the patio. We wouldnt get a pool, no way. The keys fitted the door and we walked in. It was amazing. I looked out the window and saw a small pool thinking we must share this with another family. We all walked out onto the patio/pool area and saw more french doors on and my Mother said "That must be another familys part of the villa, we will probably share the pool too." We decided to look around the accomadation a bit more and we went down what seemed like a never ending corridor to find not one, not two, but three bedrooms!!! We werent sharing with anyone, It was all ours. We were all speachless, there were no words for it. We were all thinking "Someones made a mistake. Any minuite now someone will come and tell us we have a small one bedroom apartment across the road". But no one ever did.      urlLink    The pool at the villa where we stayed.  urlLink      After and amazing shock, we decided to explore the town and find somewhere to eat. It was quite a long walk to the main town. The only aminetlys near us were one bar called "The Flistone Family Bar" and a small supermarket that sold all the essentails that us tourists need. The town was busseling with life, its was huge. We caved in and decided to go have a chinese as it was the easy option out and we were all tired and hungery and didnt want to walk around for the next hour trying to decide where we want to eat. It was a nice looking place called "Slow Boat II". I ordered spring rolls to start, and then crispy chilli beef for the main course with some egg fried rice (or egg friend rice as it said on some other chinese resturant menus). It was the best Chinese I have ever had. Everyone else agreed. We decided to skip deserts as we were all full and we felt feeling great.      After the long walk home, we sat by the pool, had a couple of drinks and a chat and decided it was time to hit the hay.      That was my first day. I will be updating the other seven days over the next seven days, lmao.
