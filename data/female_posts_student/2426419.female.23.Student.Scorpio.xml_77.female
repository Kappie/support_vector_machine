In high school, before I became a Christian, I despised most of the Christians I knew.  I think a lot of that had to do with their way of evangelism, which  included a I know something you don't know attitude.  They were on the  "right" side and I was on the "wrong" side and until I came to their side  they were better than me.  Those people made me not want to become a  Christian.  I don't know if that makes sense.  Anyway, when I became a  Christian, I was taught not to be friends with non-Christians because of  their negative influence which didn't make sense to me completely.  I wanted  to know how I could ever impact people I seperated myself from.  Now, I see  how dumb all of it was, and I have had a fear of coming across like the  people I didn't (and still don't) like.  I didn't known much about  evangelism but I did know I wouldn't do it the way I had seen it.  I didn't  want to treat people like they were a formula and if I plugged in the right  numbers they would follow Jesus too. I have understood the idea of forming relationships, and that idea felt  right to me.  It was still just an idea, though.  I didn't know what came  next.  I still don't but God has shown me something.  I have been looking at  the end product too much.  I was looking at these people who I knew needed  God and thinking of the day when they found Him.  There's nothing wrong with  that but I realized I had to look at all of the stuff that happens before  that.  It is discouraging to look at someone and think I am not close enough  to them to be sharing Jesus through my life.  Instead, I want to see the  relationship and the person as the most important thing and not be focused  on what may happen because of it.  I also saw that I was spending all my  time knowing a lot of people a little bit.  I started praying for God to  show me who I need to be pursuing a real relationship with.   thanks melisha -- you still have my vote to lead the conversation sunday night.  j
