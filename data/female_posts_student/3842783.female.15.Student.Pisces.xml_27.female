We should open the door but where is the key?? .. "hnk do you have the key?" my mother said "no mam I dont" I said "Najma do you have the key?"Mother said "sorry mam I don't" Najma said  oh ...  oo o o o oo oh  where is they key ??????? We decided to go back to my sister to see if she has it, coz  she was the one who locked the door.so , We went to her house and we were sure that she has the key . But ,She doesn't , She told us that she doesn't remmember if she locked it, and she doesn't know where she put the key . We went to our home again and looked there and here , Maybe we'll find it, but no we didnt . So , we were so angry . Najma and my mother began to wash the garage and then the car and water the plants. When I looked at them, One thing came to my mind. where is the camera??? I looked by the window to our house ,And saw the television  and our computer and said where are you ???????? We have to wait for my father to come to our house and open the door, We called him and waited for him to come. ooh we have ice cream !! , and we have finger chips . We ate them ,after that the time passed slowly, slowllllllllllly .,I looked  inside the car and searched, maybe I'll find the keys . after one and a half  hours, my father came to the house and opened the door . haaaaeeeeeeee finally we are in our home. but until now, we didn't find the key.  ya rabi rah nakull razalah walah lah ???
