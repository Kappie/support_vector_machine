It was so great. :) Anyway, after that, I went and hung out with Bryan since I had a good two and a half hours until I had to be home. It was good fun. We just drove around and talked. Good, carefree, fun times. Today, I worked. It wasn't too bad since it was only four hours. I only work one day this week. Tuesday. :) YES! And it's only for three hours. Double yes! Tonight, I just stayed at home since everyone I know is either A. working, B. at drumshow, or C. out of town. Bummer. But, it's ok. I went and rented Freaky Friday. Such a cute movie. :) I had a mental health night. Good times.
