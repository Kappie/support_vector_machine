BRANDIE HAD A BABY!!! now, ive never written about brandie in my blog before, but we used to be close friends in middle school, and then in high school we never had any classes together so we kinda drifted, even though we still talk and stuff like that...well...she had a baby!! She had it the last week of school, that would explain why she missed the last day of school and her exams...but get this, she didnt tell any of her friends. OMG we would have totally supported her and would have kept out mouths shut about it. I told someone one day i thought brandie looked pregant and they looked at me like i was crazy, and then some started agreeing, but we never had enough balls to ask brandie, even though we all knew her and zach s. never used condoms and have been bangin for years now. I think shes lucky it just now caught up with her. But anyways, im excited for her, and i cant wait to get home and see the baby!! We dont even know if its a boy or girl...Lauren, Hollis and Zack A found out by calling her and her sister saying "she cant talk on the phone, shes feeding the baby" ...opps. well, we're all excited for her and cant wait to see the little thing!! i bet its sooo cute, brandie is a very pretty girl, so i bet the baby takes after her. Brandie will make a great mother..shes just that way. I do wonder what zach s' preacher father said about the baby...ummm...hahaha Brandie and Zach have been dating since 7th grade, and now we're going into 11th..thats a long ass time. Well, i can only wish them the best!! :D *much love* oh and LAUREN IS BACK!! YAY!! SHES BACK!!! IVE MISSED HER SOO MUCH!! SHES BACK!! YAY!!!!! stupidassmotherfuckerleavesmeallthedamntimebitch
