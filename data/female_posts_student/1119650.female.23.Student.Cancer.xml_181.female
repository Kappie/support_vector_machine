Yes, I'm 21 and I'm in charge of the office.  The only other people here are Wheelchair guy who smells, my friend Anthony, a guy called Krobot who tells everyone his last name is "Robot with a K" and an auditor.  I want to run across the countertops and pelt them all with jelly beans and scream "You're not the boss of me now!  You're not the boss of me now!  You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big!"  Alas, I'll just sit here in silence and drink my decaf tea and pray for 4 p.m., although Krobot could commit me to the occupational health mental health offices if I pulled the jelly bean stunt.  That could be entertaining.  That would, however, leave wheelchair guy in charge, he doesn't even speak English well and he smells, and I can't do that to Anthony.  Damn me and my morals!
