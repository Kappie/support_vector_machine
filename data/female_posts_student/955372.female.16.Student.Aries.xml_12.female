Like there are many plot holes in the movie, and *sob* pierce brosnan is getting chunky and is losing his appeal dispite the dead sexiness of his english accent. Ok and is it just me or did the evil guy look a bit like Conan O'brien? yeah i thought so. I was thinking that the whole time. It made it really hard for me to take him seriously. ps john cleese is my hero and a half. Ok moving on I watched 10 things i hate about you twice yesterday, so 20 things i hate about you (lol Hannah). It was amazing! I am so in love with that movie. In the next entry you will see several hillarious quotes from the movie. mmm heath...  ps my favorite scene from that movie is when heath sings to julia, mmmm
