My stomach is churning right now, and I just don't understand why. I've been trying to tell myself that I really don't care what he has to say, and that I was just too good for him (that itself was eas to say). I'm trying to dissolve any emotion that I may have felt for him to just throw heartlessly into the winds of time, easily to be made a part of my past, but it's just a little more difficult than I had imagined to eliminate as part of my future. Or future thought that is.
