Beth was saying something about her big word and so was Helen and im like WA? So i have decided to go find MY big word. One second, i need to go to the laundry and find myself a bottle of acid. Brb. Back. I found a big word: Presenting the soon to be infamous Casey's word:   Sodium-tripolyphosphate   That is now my word. I don't know how to pronounce it, i dont know what it is, and i dont know how it relates to me, but it is my word. TaTa for now (-tigger) Luv CM
