It was ok, Dan was asking like a dork. Hehe...Yeah I stole his necklace and started scratching at my hand with it, then I used my nails and I ended up with red hands. It kind of hurt.....but I will deal with it. So anyway. Im really upset at the moment. They had my Gran's funeral and I didn't end up going. Im really upset and mad. How could they do that! She was my fricken Gran for gods sake! I had everything ready! How can people be so rude! Geez! Man! Im so bloomin mad! Well yeah. Im gonna go now, Im talking to Dan on the phone.  Bye for now, Bridget!
