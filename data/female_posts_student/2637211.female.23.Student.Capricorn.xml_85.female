I was trying to write my response paper for the class, and I looked at the clock: it was 9:50. There was no way I could make it to class on time, and I was literally exhausted, both from lack of sleep and lack of coffee, so I just said "fuck it." I called Liz, called Jerm and went back to sleep for another hour, until Jerm came and picked me up. No car for a week is just dumb. It's not that I go anywhere, I just hate feeling so limited. I needed to go grocery shopping. I think most of my issues were due to lack of caffeine and food.  Today Jerm and I are going to a reenactor's dinner thing called Emperor's Birthday. It's a chance to hang out in costume, eat and get drunk with old-timey faire friends. Jerm is now frantically sewing up his doublet, and I, despite my best intentions, am going to wear what I already have, because I'm super lazy. Who really cares?
