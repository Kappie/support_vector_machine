I think it's the latter, considering one of the girls I truly,  truly  hate just came up to me and told me that another girl I truly hate said not to date some guy I had  no  intention of dating in the first place. Stupid bitch... Now, I had thought this guy was cute but he's like two years younger than me, which destroys all my interest, because I'm not fond of younger guys. But I was stupid enough to tell my stupid guy friend, who doesn't know how to get his mouth shut, and, now, it's apparently gotten to bitch 1 and bitch 2. Lovely isn't it? I may just kill that guy after school for this... Idiot!  On top of all of this... I was completely ignored and excluded from from any conversation during lunch. It's kind of normal, but it really hurts when they do it, and it really smarted today, because I was stuck just sitting there shivering the whole time.  I'm really getting sick of people treating me like crap, and I'm no longer going to let them. Next person to do it will most defietly get chewed out, and I don't care if I lose them as a friend, because, if they treat me like this, there not my real friends anyway. I need people who I can trust and people who won't treat me like the scum beneath their boot.  Ok, I've ranted enough for now I suppose.   Love to all who care enough to read this.
