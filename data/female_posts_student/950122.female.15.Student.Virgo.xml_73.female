I called my friend's guy...friend, an ass. Well, it's not really that bad, but I guess it was so sudden that even I was surprised.  I kind of regret it now; after talking to my parents about it, I guess I was too righteous. But still, someone needed to push down his pride. In my humble opinion, he was getting too high on himself.  Now, what's done is done. Can't change that. I just hope his groupies don't gang up on me. n_n;
