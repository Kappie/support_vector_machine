Fingers touch to find my way, Each foot fall, my heart betrays The fear which drives me through the day.  Suddenly the ground is lost, Flailing arms as body's tossed. Splashing down in crimson pool, The warm embrace is much too cruel, I curse this lowly, wretched fool.  Floundering in this self made hell, Warmth increasing as I dwell, Within the confines I create, Screaming as myself berate, Giving in to this, my fate.
