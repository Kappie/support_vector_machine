AND IT SNOWED TODAY!!!!!!!  THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!  and it wasn't crappy snow that doesn't stick or whatever or is really slushie ice......it was serious snow that was coming down like crazy!!!!  i've never seen this kind of snow EVER in my entire life!!!  I made huge snowballs and parts of a snowman.  Then i had a million snowball fights!  I made the biggest snowball ever with Brittany, it was soooo awesome!  it came down for a really long time!  me, Jess and Britt met up with Sarah and Nadia and we took these 2 little 8 yr old boys down!  we threw all these snowballs!!!  aaah it was so cool!  i tried to play soccer while waiting on jess to come out, but it didn't work out.  I got so much snow down my coat!  This is officially the best day of the year so far.  Stars play Pheonix tonight at 7:30, thank god there's hockey on valentines' day.  Otherwise i'd be sitting at home feeling sorry for myself and wishing there were some really hot guy around to keep me company.  AND i have girl scout cookies also!  I've decided that my Valentine this year will be Niko Kapanen, since i don't really have one.  Brittany's going to come over and watch the game/hockey movies with me tonight while Jess babysits and possibly comes over also.  Cookies + Hockey + hockey movies + friends = awesome day!  Happy Valentines' Day!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
