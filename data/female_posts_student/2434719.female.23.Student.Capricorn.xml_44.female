"oh hedish is woussy and is afraid of bees." no no my friend. i was fine with the first bee flying around...and the second... but when they got thier friends and ATTACKED MY MUFFIN, i lost it!! i had to get up from the table, and my muffin had bees crawling all over it!!   the neightboring table noticed me yelling "go away!!" at hte muffin, and i had to explain the situation becuase they thought i was a bit nuts.  i had to leave it there... and go where the universe told me to.   stupid bees.
