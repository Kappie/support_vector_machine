Today SUPER boring tutorials and lectures.. Espcially e Maths one, OH MY GOD!!!!! Now then i really glad that when i was in Sec4 i didnt take A-maths, but, that's also why today during the 1 hr lecture... i think i only can understand 1/4 of it?!.. Oh god.. pls bless me in my ICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hahahahhaha........ Anyway, me not a Christian...so...hehehee...So, say for fun.. (NO offence........)  Then what... Let me think, yeah, today during IT1505 tutorial, i saw Krystal was drawing something on her handbook, so i was like asking frm her... Her handbook was full of little stories of the day, whereby she wrote down.. I "saw" her days in CJC, with her friends... When she really got so relunctant to leave CJC coz of her friends there... then saw her throwing temper to her guy....etc...hahaha.... Krystal seems to be a very moody girl.. Actually seriously, i really think that she still misses her friends n clicks in her CJC, although she always say that she dont really like the life in there.. Somehow i can sense that she's quite lonely here... in NYP... Frankly speaking, sometimes not that our classmates unfriendly, but sometimes just really cant "click-away" kind of thing... Maybe that's what they always say : Fated to be Friends..... If not fated, then how? Cannot be leaving Krystal behind right? Just hope that she'll be as cheerful as before, when she's in CJC? :> ............... Smile Krystal!   Eh, then now what? Today went home with my "unrelated" cousin...Hahaha, very funny ar, somehow dunno y no topic to say lehz.. Maybe coz SOMEONE is beside ar, that's y everything not convinent to say.......... hahahahhaha..... *Bleahz..... :P  Herm herm, then what?..... Then i saw some people deny of blushing lo....hahahhahaha.....so funny.... :P, like that larz........ horz?!... hehehe..........  So cold nia tonite.... wearing my long sleeve pajamas... Since when i haven wear this long sleeve pajamas le?? *Thinking........  Apel
