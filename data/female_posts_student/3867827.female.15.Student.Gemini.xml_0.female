HOWEVER, I ended up working at the tea house where a total of one person came in in the period of three hours. Hence, at 12:30 Ms. Peggy told me that I could go home because she seriously doubted anyone else would come in. So, I went home, with the intention of changing and then convincing my mom to take me back to the church, because the work day was still in progress. Mom, however, was not in the best of moods and said that she wasn't going to spend all day driving me around. So, that was the end of that, well not entirely, as I did get teased about not showing up Sunday. So *sighs* I spent the day reading, listening to book tapes, writing and crocheting.  Sunday was rather uneventful so far as Sundays go. I woke up at six was downstairs for breakfast at seven and out of the house with my parents by 7:45. Then I stood at the front door from 8:00 - 9:00 greeting people, which is always amuzing. I love watching how people come up the curb in front of the door. Some people hop, some people fall over it and some lift up on both feet and then come in. Lol. It's great anyhow. Then I took notes on the sermon until 11:00, just because I'm not really interested in the current topic that pastor is on (he's trying to prove against evolution and an old earth, something I have already put a considerable amount of time into researching) and so I had to find a way to stay focused. Then I wandered, somewhat aimlessly as both Nessa and Ben weren't there so I really had no one to talk to. Punched Kyle just to say I punched someone and so I felt much better about the issue between my friends. We listened to short term missionaries from Afghanistan report about their work and then went home, where I'm pretty sure we just sat around like bumps on a log for the remainder of the day. Monday was fun. After sitting around for most of the day we went swimming and such at the Safer's house. And now I have to go again so more later.
