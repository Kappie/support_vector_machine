So here's a little about me.   I'm an active player on Neopets. My username is lilo301. Check out my lookup!  I absolutely ADORE pandas!!       I really like cats, too. I have 2 of them. Their names are Nellie and Zoe.         I also have 3 pet gerbils. One is named Moose. The other 2 don't have names yet because they were just born last week and we don't know what gender they are.           Here's one thing about me: I HATE SCHOOL!!!!!!!!! This is what I look like in shcool:        Hee hee hee...   I am Spongebob's #1 fan!!! I've seen every single episode. Challenge me if you don't believe me. urlLink     Video games are my specialty. I'm a big Yoshi fan!    urlLink      As well as being mentally strange, I'm also really hyper too!!!!!! I'm kinda like these guys:    urlLink       urlLink
