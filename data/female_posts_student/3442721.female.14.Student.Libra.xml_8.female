I swear i spilt pop all over myself from that darn thing. Let me see, Oh yeah we went to relay for life in fostoria... Well that was fun cause jen (Who was on crutches and sometimes a wheel chair.) and i played ball in the tent with a rubber flashing spike ball. that thing hurts when your hit in the face. i am so bored right now i think i'm dead.... oh well bye!
