Ok, well it started out that me and alex were going to go look around the garage sales in big meadow. well we got distracted from that and decided to do other stuff. we walked around big meadow, and into the section where they are building new houses. we went into one and took a picture of ourselves in front of the fireplace. why? we dont know. then as we were walking back to my house, i took a picture of someone's house, and me and alex plan on anonymously sending it to amanda. haha. good stuff. so then we went back to my house, and we got some soda and went back to the field. wow...i just realized that i am describing all of this in detail when in reality only about 3 ppl read this, and one of them is alex. oh well. so then after the field we decided to go to subway. so we go to subway, and then after we go to ricky d's to get some ice cream. we got the licorice ice cream, which made our mouths turn a deep shade of green. it was awful. so then we went to the park, and then the library. we left some notes in random books. it was embarassing when we first walked in because tommy's mom was there, and she saw my mouth, and she was like 'licorice ice cream?'. i suppose it was kind of funny too. then we were walking back to my house, and we came across this HUGE pile of rock and dirt, so we decided to climb it. on my way down, i tripped and i slid down the pile. it hurt, but it was so funny too. i'm such a klutz. throughout the whole afternoon me and alex took various pictures. it will be interesting when we get them back. haha. well that was my day up until now, and i doubt it will get anymore exciting.
