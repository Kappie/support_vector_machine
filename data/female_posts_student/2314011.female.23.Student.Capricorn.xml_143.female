Having one of those "Everything must get done now" weeks.  It started out seeming entirely do-able; the week's beginning, that is.  There was no pretense or easing back into the routine after the break, which was more work than break to begin with.  And suddenly, this week has completely escaped my grasp, leaving me scrambling, trying to mitigate my damages as best I can.  Have to keep reminding myself that all these tasks  will  get done.  If not in the next five hours, in the next five days at the latest.  And that's just going to have to be okay.  The fact that next week heralds the last 5 before finals begin in May is looming, albeit quietly, in the psyche, as well.  Still have two subject to outline, one of which is the Mother of All Classes: Contracts.  The typed notes for that class reached 46 pages today.  Yay.  This weekend is dedicated to the final draft of the brief; if it gets done Saturday, I'll be shocked.  I've tried giving up gauging the revision process, and the result has been over-estimating.  Between revising the rough draft and working on the front-matter (i.e. table of contents, statement of facts, etc.), it will most likely take up a good chunk of time.    So, with all of this in mind, I figured tonight would be a good time to get cracking on the material our Civil Procedure professor "covered" in our 2.5 hour class Tuesday.  I read the 6 Rules of Civil Procedure assigned, choosing to forego the corresponding cases, thinking they would be covered in painstaking detail as he has a semi-tendency to do.  Actually, I take that back, he  does  have a tendency to cover material in painstaking detail when it's completely self-explanatory.  When it's complicated, intricate, lengthy, etc., however, he skims the surface.  And thus, not only were the 6 Rules of Civil Procedure that I prepared for class covered, but so were their cases, as well as 2 more Rules and their cases.  Hence the 80+ pages of reading attempted tonight.  It was folly from the beginning, part of me knew, but another part (the same that thought we might not cover all the material Tuesday) thought it might not be too terribly monstrous.  As per this week's developments, that part was wrong.    And so, with the advice of my favorite lesbian sage (she's been on a roll this week), I stopped studying at 830; choosing instead to spend the few hours left doing the things I've been craving for many days:  yoga, blogging and, perhaps, reading about London.  Ranting about all this has helped the cause, too.  But the planner deep inside is already scoping out Friday afternoon for the rest of the make-up readings.  I just hate the feeling of being behind; and nothing is right until I'm caught up.  But I absolutely refuse to miss yoga class tomorrow night, and if it's going to make me choose, Civil Procedure will lose.    Overall, though, I'm managing to keep my "at peace with all things" outlook on life pretty much in tact.  And that's a good thing.  The Media Board, exhausting though it was, went well.  Think we chose a good group of kids to run the university's media establishment for the next year.  Some positions were sought more...intensely...than others, but, thankfully, the right person for each job clearly emerged.    I was very relieved it wasn't necessary to give a character reference to an applicant with whom I have a bit of "history."  Just the usual high school-college drama crossover, of which full-disclosure is not necessary.  But partial-disclosure is.  She decided we were arch-enemies in high school, but since we had Intro to Psych together freshman year of college, we could be friends.  Since I had nothing against her in high school and was fairly interested to see where this new "friendship" would lead, I didn't object.  Eventually, it helped bring Levi and I back into close contact and for that, I am thankful, whether she'll ever know it or not.  But, when her relationship with the Boy dissipated for the last time, I was gone from her life, as well.  And, as before, I was neither hurt nor surprised.  In fact, I took a bit of pleasure (and still do on dark nights) in the fact that he'd finally chosen the right girl.  Every time I would see her on campus while the friendship with the Boy became what it is, I couldn't help but wonder how/what her friend/relationships had become and if she had any idea what had become of the two people she banished from her life.  And so, seeing her name on the list of applicants for the university's new magazine (the yearbook's new form), a part of me smirked and a part of me sighed.  I knew already she wasn't qualified, speaking strictly of my first-hand knowledge of her professional and scholastic abilities.  She's completely capable, to be sure, she just has no motivation nor ability to commit, both of which are *major* requirements for a project of this magnitude.  But, I resolved to put this and more baggage to the side and assume the consummate-professional hat for the evening.  And, as I referenced above, I needn't have worried.  Her references, sadly but not surprisingly, spoke for themselves, and I remained blissfully silent on the matter.    As my turn approached to ask her a question from the prepared list, however, one sentence would not leave my mind.  The statement's been on the tip of my tongue for more than two years now and it needs only the slightest opening to be uttered, an opening that's never actually been given, though.  And, no doubt, she's already heard the news, but my fantasy of being the first to tell her will probably never dissipate.  And so, while she quietly answered the question before mine, I struggled to banish this vision from my mind:  "Hi Laura, I'm Andrea, Student Bar Association Representative.  I have a prepared question to ask you, but first, I just have to let you know:  Levi is gay."  And after hers and the entire Board's eyes fell out of their heads, I continue:  "That's right.  Gay.  We're gay together.  And you can't stop us.  You had him; thought he'd be the One, forever, for all times in all worlds.  But no.  He's mine.  In ways you could never understand.  And plus, Tori is ours too.  She used to be yours; thought she'd be the one, forever, for all times in all worlds.  But no ..." and so on.    But instead, I gathered my wits, wiped a guilty grin off my face, met her eye-to-eye and said:  "Hey Laura.  You know me..." watched her saccharine smile widen into one that just might have been genuine and asked my stupid question.    Maturity and growth are our friends, but slimy-mean visions can be great to cat around with sometimes.
