There are too many people in the world to hurt, Too many things to see. Stolen souls seek their lives, Children learn how to grieve. I'm surrounded by the ocean of ignorance, Floating on the statue of me.  All the people have left the ocean. They've washed up on a beach full of rage. Wreaking havoc and destroying things, The leapt back into their cage.  No on is ever free from the ocean, Enlightenment is learning how to float. It's the curse of all human beings, That we can't learn to build a boat.
