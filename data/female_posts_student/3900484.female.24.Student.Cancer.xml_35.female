I can't stand people who sit around and do mindless things like watch TV all day, every day.  I have a few shows I like watching in the evenings, but it is by far one of my least favorite things to do.  I understand the ability to relax in one's home, in front of the TV.  I have enjoyed that every now and then, having a nice quiet time in.  Watching TV and doing nothing and needing to do nothing.  I feel so useless though, if that is all I do.  I like being busy.  I like having deadlines and projects and goals I am working towards.  I have known this about myself for a long, long time.  It keeps you from having to stop and think really.  About anything, sad things especially.  Work is an escape for me.  It's not that I'm burying my head in the ground or anything.  If I happen to meet someone I instantaneously enjoy being in the company of, I won't ignore them.  I just so rarely feel that anymore.  More and more, I like being alone.  I am comfortable by myself.  I am happy in my skin, as many have said.  When I was still dating looser-boy, whom I refer to quite often in the most derogative of terms, if you haven't allready noticed, he asked me if I was happy.  I said I was content.  Satiated, if you will.  I got the reply that that was a bad thing, a bad way to be.  To be honest, it had been quite a long while, years, since I had felt remotely  right  with the world.  I think that at that time, that percise moment in space and place when I was with him, I just needed something.  Something to ground me from feeling like I was reeling from all the blows I was receiving.  Someone to touch.  Touch is very underrated.  I was happy just to be around him.  I guess thats why it has taken me so long to understand why he didn't feel the same.  And why I still feel sad about it every now and then.  I do miss him.  But I think its become missing more than him.  Missing the act of being with someone.  Of belonging with someone?  I don't know.  Missing having someone you feel you could say anything to.  Having someone to go home to.  I miss his cat, almost more than him.  How ironic is that?  I don't really know how I thought it would end though.  I think we were doomed.  From the start.  Yugh!  I'm through with all this relationship junk.  I'm how I am.  Screw my family.
