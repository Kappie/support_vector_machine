( which is fair enough!  ) so we aimed for forfars just gonna get food,  but then we decided 2 try 2 get lost?!?!  i cant actually remember who decided this, or why we'd want to...but it seemed like a gd idea!   so we wondered down sum random roads and found this random park with like a huge kiddys adventure play area! genious!  at this point we were rather hi on sugar ( as usual  :S) n ended up doin the monkies walk in a linked line down the middle of a road!  we like soo had the rhythem! :)  great fun! n ppl who saw us seemed 2 b amused! hehe! we then spotted the sea, looking extreemly big n funky, so we aimed townrds it..it was like soo in tidy thing! like just about hitting the wall! im all  'yay'  coz pete had his lil digi cam with him, so we took some funky beach photos and wave photos that i can use in my work, n we had a group photo...to  'chereish the memory'  as kimothy said! hehe!  n i kinda still hav petes hat which i nicked off him the other day...well i didnt actually nick it, he said i could keep wearing it after i borrowed it...c im not evil! n he just kinda forgot it after we went 2 the beach..hehe! its wierd! ive like neva dun hats b4! but its really funky n it keeps ure ears warm!  genious!   so for once, by the time i got to band i was like really happy n jolly- people were shocked coz  i was actually smiling!  ( they've kinda got it in their minds that im goin through some kind of teenage rebellion lookin unhappy stage...but hello mayb i just hav issues!   eargh! ) but i was happy! n wen im happy- nicks happy n deans happy! so we were a happy percussion section! n i wasnt as shy wen playin kit n stuff! ( in my funnky petey hat! )!  *go me!*  hehe!  then i got home......hmm!  its completly crappy ! dad got in a mood with me...and i didnt even say anything 2 him! so he stormed up to bed n then if id gone up 2 c him he would've shouted at me 2 leave him alone, so having lots of practice with this, ( and still being in a very fragile! ) i didnt go upn i left him alone!  (makes sence ya?!)  so wen i eventually went up 2 say goodnight he randomly starts havin a go at me how im a bad daughter n i dont bother coming up 2 tlk 2 him n make convo?!?!?! do u get this?! coz i dont! wot am i 2 do?!  i soo dont need this!  so then he upset me more! n im now in one of those really, really fragile moods! so like u say sumit in a slightly mean way n  *poww*  my eyes start leakin!  i think i need 2 see sam. i havnt seen him in like ages....n it might make things a lil easyer...but then it could (n i think  it soo will ) make things 100 times harder! but then if i dont im still stuck in my dilema, which doesnt seem to be going ne where! hmm i dunno! yeah  i need 2  c him! i  want 2  c him! i  miss him ! but then thats like 2wice we havnt worked.....i mean its not like we're spoke bout gettin bac or owt...havnt really spoken that mch, but eargh! i hav a completly split made-decision! ( therefor no made decision!)  i hav my friends who r tryin 2 help, if they dont no sam,they're just like thinkin of it from my side....do i wanna get hurt again?! coz they dont no him so they are more set on the wot i want n how i feel! ( which still doesnt help wen even i dont no !) its good 2 no their opinions tho n like hear their stories n experiences n situations!  n then ppl hu no him r like yeah but he's.....n u2..... n stuff! but theres so many  buts ! everything is like  but then if......what if?!?!    *eak!*   Vx
