I went to see Troy today with amber, mark, alex, rob, ian, and maggie, and it was pretty fun. I enjoyed it. Especially the naked brad pitt. Oh lord... It was... wow... It's strange, I was really fascinated by  some of the fight scenes. It was strange, when they were fighting it seemed like certain parts were sped up, to emphasize the speed of Akilese (excuse my spelling) and yet at the same time it was slowed to show each stroke of the swords. The choreography was so incredibly intricate, it was beautiful. I know that's kind of morbid, considering how violent it was, but it really was amazing. Then we all went to waffle house (plus tracy), and then I ended up here. I know I'm not playing by the rules, but I find myself not really caring. That's a horrible thing to say, and it's a horrible thing I'm doing... but what if I can't really help it? I didn't choose for those rules to get set down in the first place, can I really be blamed if I don't follow them word for word? ...  Oh well, good night, sweet prince.
