They were actually more than good they were great.  cue *happy ska, happy ska* Than things started to turn around in simple directions. And I got lost. Did I mention I am  still  lost? Eyah.  Things suck. Charades in band was a riot tho! And for the record. My happy streak was only 10 days. Ahem.  "Anthem of our dying day," is an awesome song. I suggest all of you go out to your pc and download it. Yes. That's right.. ^^It's by Story of the Year,  if any of you were actually going to dl it. Im going to go. My head is a mess. Blah. I need someone to talk to, and a drummer. That stuff makes it possible. Holy cruton of Christ. Someone save me..I'll love you forever if you can.
