After he shook her hand, so licked it....yeah thats our Mel. I talked to Noah and Andy, they're both so cool. So then Mel and I spent the night at Emily's and we watched the Catchstone video in which Noah raps in Hebrew and we see Marc and Andy in their boxers. Nice. It was really funny. Ugh, Emily got me up at 7:30 that morning. Grr, Liz needs her sleep. So then Saturday afternoon, Jasmine and I volunteered at the LP Winterguard Competition, which was fun I guess. Steve Pyter was there, and we hung out with him for a while. Anthony was there, too. We were talking about the whole director situation. He said that Anthony had a decent chance. Do you have any idea how awesome that would be if Anthony was our director?! OMG, we would have so much fun if would be ridiculous. Ok, anywho, LP got 3rd I think. Nice. That was pretty much my weekend, because I pretty much did nothing today. I did write 2 songs this weekend, they're pretty cool, too.
