The dickies boys... eating pizza like angels. I really wish I could have just walked up to any of those hotties and like do them. Gawwwwddddd. they were smoking hot. Element boy. Well let see after Kdays I spent the night @ Creamers house. And we watched Dirty Dancing Havana Nights which was so beautiful coz the dude is so smokin cute. and then the next morning we watched Grind and the boys are LUSCIOUS! and america's next top model.. best show ever! and then surely enough it was time to go home.
