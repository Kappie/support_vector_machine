I wore a more comfortable shirt today than yesterday, so my sunburn didn't kill me. Ooh! and I took 2 benidryl before class started, and half way through class I fell asleep, then during second block I fell asleep again, for the majority of class. I felt so lazy. I seriously think that in the long run I'm going to get skin cancer from gettin sunburnt so much. Ah well, hopefully I won't. umm, went to Lewter's class. Chris was kinda gloomy today, which is most out of character, for he's usually obscenely hyper and cheerful, at least towards me. (?) Ah well, I suppose if he wants me to know, he'll tell me. Nick, I love you! Thought I needed to throw that in there. Chelsea, I love you too, but not THAT way...lol. Well, I'll blog at you all laterz. That's all I got to say about my day.  Love,  Shannon "Even if you are a minority of one, the truth is the truth." Mohandas Gandhi
