But how depressing is it to see open mouthed braindeads gaping at a screen all day, watching anything and everything regardless of quality or even whether or not the programmes interest them? I put forward my brother as a "perfect" example of this sad state. He watches gardening programmes, crappy soaps (well they all are) and gameshows, etcetera etcetera etcetera. Ah that reminds me of (the original) The King and I, that was so good if only for the incredible dresses which I would kill to wear, the soundtrack, the hilarious King, the cute kids...ok actually that's quite a lot!!! Those dresses though... Amazing... Yeah I know corsets were awful everything, but I often think that the style of that day, corseted or uncorseted, would've suited me much better than the modern day dress! It coveredlegs completely, etcetera!      Dad's playing records, I'm makin him pick out a good selection though, 60s stuffrock 'n' roll, none of his danceband crap!!      Buddy Holly now!      Anyway.      Some of my friends have gone out 2 the Vaults or somethin 2nite, I went last week though and as the venue is ABSOLUTE CRAP (unless your idea of fun is being eyed up by REALLY drunk, REALLY pervy old men...) I declined this time! (also hardly anyone's going, nobody I am desperate 2 c right now.)      I wonder how many people wish they were someone else. I have to say, I never do. This is my trick. Although I have quite low self esteem, there are a couple ( and i mean, a couple) of things I like about myself (and thyr all but one "inner" things, trust me!). So when I feel really depressed i usually end up thinkin, would i wanna b "whoever" if it meant not having those things? And cause you're accustomed to having these few good qualities, u realise u can't say "yes". (I don't "plan" to use this "technique", i'm not a complete wanker, it's just the way my mind happens to work!)      I'm hoping no1 reads my blogs, as I'm coming across as a bit of a twat really, but never mind.      I feel horribly bloated having eaten like a pig all day, makes me feel sick. Like Christmas when you eat WAY past your comfortzone limit, cuz it's CHRISTMAS for goodness' sake, and the food is good, but you end up unable to imagine ever feeling hunger ever again (it passes with time - certainly in time for next Christmas!!) Not that anyone wants 2 know, but this feeling is much more acute when u'v been being sick non-stop for 2 days (allergy 2 tablets was taking)          ANYWAY          better go my darling brother has politely (yeah rite!!) asked if i wish 2 partake in a game of table tennis.          L8rs!
