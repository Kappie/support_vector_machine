My life is the social equivalent of tofu really, but I kind of don't mind it like that. I need my own space, away from friends who would kill me (seriously) if they knew I liked McFly and Busted. But that's not important right now. Although I do love them, especially the cute drummer from McFly. And the guitarist Danny. Mmmm.....Sorry. I'll stop fantasising about unreachable faraway people now.   Instead, I'll ramble on about unreachable people who are tantalisingly near. Person, really, if I'm going to be specific about this (which I am). Gorgeous, kind, lovely male person with dark hair, blue eyes and a melt-worthy smile. He's almost as cute as Harry Judd. Almost, but no-one's perfect. We get on well, or so I thought. Until he started being unhappy and I,stupidly, got worried and asked him what was wrong. Clearly that was a nasty and bad thing to do, or so he implied. Oh well. Love is a nasty thing anyway. All it does in the end is hurt you. I prefer chocolate. It loves you back, produces the same feelings as falling in love (the same chemicals anyway0 and requires a lot less advanced psychology.(That's what love mostly is, e.g. what will he think if I do this?Or this?etc.) Chocolate doesn't shout at you, it doesn't shut you out, it doesn't ask you out and dump you four times in a row in less than six months.(this did actually happen, it's not just a silly example).  Yes, I KNOW I'm a doormat. I was pretty messed up at the time, food-wise etc.   I wonder if anyone's reading this. If you are, then I'm sorry to bore you. I know none of my friends are, because if they were I'd get a load of stick, so I haven't told them about this. I hope they don't find out; if they do, I don't know what I'll do. Not something constructive, that's for sure. Probably lock myself in a dark room, eat chocolate and dream of The Guy, rather pathetically. Well, I like being sad old me, and that's the way I'm going to stay. My dream job IS a historian, I DO like McFly and Busted (though I can't afford either of their albums) and I DO repel guys. OK, so I wouldn't mind not repelling guys. But the rest of it I am fine with.   Sorry to be boring again. I guess that's just the way I am.Bye for now. McFly rock!  xxx
