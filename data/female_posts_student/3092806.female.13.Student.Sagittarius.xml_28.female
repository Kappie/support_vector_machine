Alright, I did say that I wasn't going to mention him in this blog but give a girl a break, I can't be perfect!!! Anyways, this entire situation with him is like completely puzzling. You see, my twin sister and his little sister (my best friend) got into a big fight in which my EBGF was mentioned. My sister told her that she was sick of being tortured and tormented by her brother to which she replied that he was probably treating us badly because he felt we were treating him badly. Treating him badly? I don't even talk to him anymore!    Alright, I know that not ever telling my EBGF that I had a boyfriend hurt him but I didn't think it would hurt him so much that he HAS to find revenge... I mean, I have NEVER said anything about him to anyone at school, at all... Hm... Maybe that's issue... Do you think that's so? Do you really believe that he misses me at all? The chances are slim but oh, how great would that be, 'cause I miss him a lot too... Well, er, sort of... I miss the friendship we had with one another... If we ever start talking again, would things EVER get back to the way they used to be? Do we have anything in common anymore? I know that he shares the same love for the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean, and the same passion for the computer game, The Sims; but do we have anything else in common?    Honestly, I'm a little nervous about reinstating our friendship again. What if he sees the real me and hates me? I don't know if I could deal with that. I don't open myself up to others... How would he react to my expressions, my words, my thoughts, my everything? I'm scared that he'll see the real me and completely dislike me for who I am... Then I'd lose him, forever. I know we're not friends anymore but I know that in a case of emergency that I can go to him if I really have to. I know he won't turn me away, 'cause he saw me once, the real me and he liked what he saw... And I know, despite all of his mean, crude, and self-absorbed jokes, that the guy that was my best friend when I was little is still in there...    I'm hopeless, aren't I? I'm always trying to look for the good in people, don't I? Well, I believe that everyone has at least a small portion of good inside them... Some may just need some help in finding it... Oh, well...    I'm outie...
