Then I came home n worked out for a while, and that kicked ass. Did my homework and such, and now maybe I can actually go to bed early tonight! Sweet!  Saturday will be a test of my sobriety powers. That's right. I am going to  attempt  to stay sober. If you're there, help me out. Support me by like beating me or something. Now sobriety doesn't mean I'm not going to drink a bit, but I'm limiting it to where I don't actually get drunk. I get drunk so often, I figure it couldnt hurt to stay sober this once. Oh god I don't think I can do it. We'll see though...we'll see.  Well, I'm outta here. Keep it clean, crazies.
