Even though I was so damn comfy in my bed. I got up and walked my dog. It was a nice walk, not too hot, not too cold, but Cody was bad and kept going into this one giant bush and eating something in the ground. He does this thing where he refuses to move. It's kinda annoying, he's a very stubborn, opinated dog. But I worry about him more now, because it takes him a longer time to get up and by the end of the walk (it wasn't that long) he was exhausted and it took him awhile to get up the driveway. My poor puppy. After the walk it was 2, I had a pbj sandwich and M's. Not at the same time mind you. My mom was home from work cause she didn't feel well so we watched lifetime together. Some good mother-daughter moments. I told her about the movie and the news blip on the woman who had sex with the 13 year old and she told me to stop cause she felt even sicker hearing that story. We watched the very exciting lifetime movie which I am not even going to begin to explain cause it's all very complicated. Let's just say it has a amnesiac woman, a good looking cop, a PI guy who gets shot, a fat nice lady, and this weird couple who ended up being her husband and her sister.  Yeah.  Anyways after that we watched a tv show. By the time that was over it was five, I started to do my wash, and I took a nap while listening to the Goo Goo Dolls. I always play the 5 songs on there that I really like. Slide, Black Balloon, All Eyes On Me, Acoustic #3, and of course Iris. I still love that cd and I got it when I was in 5th grade maybe which is funny. I like pretty much all the songs, those are my favorites, the only ones I hate are the ones sung by Robby. God, he's horrible. I woke up. I had dinner. Chicken, incase anyone wanted to know. I then went on here. So now I am going to go clean my room. And take a shower later. Then read a bit and go to bed.  Oh yes, and tomorrow should be fun, I'll be hanging out with Sean. He wants to come over though at 9:30 IN THE MORNING. So I have to set my alarm clock tonight. We're going to see two movies...The Village and Napoleon Dynamite (sp?). So very good.
