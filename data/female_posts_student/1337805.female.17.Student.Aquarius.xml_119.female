I was gonig to write this nice long one, but then, I got interupted, and because I was at school, adn had different settings, and wasnt sure I was going to finish it, I posted it with the intentions of going home and doing something with it then. And people read it. Now, it clearly states the name JANICE. Not Jessica. Not Celine. Not Sanford. JANICE.  My cute little disclaimer on my blog reads: "Respect this, and please, please, unless it is your name mentioned, don't assume I'm talking about you. "  When you ASSUME, you make an ASS out of U and ME.   So Jessica, the next time you read a blog, no matter if you know it's about you or not, if it doesn't state your name, DON'T HASH OUT.  Haven't I been thro this with you before?
