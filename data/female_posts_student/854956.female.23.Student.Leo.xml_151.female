I'm letting all know in advance, that there will not be a Wacky Wednesday next week, either... so, look for it the following Wednesday... Sorry, I can't make promises because of finals... however, I may surprise everyone and actually get one posted... :-)  We'll see... In the meantime, I'll probably make an update post the next 2 weekends... :-)  later
