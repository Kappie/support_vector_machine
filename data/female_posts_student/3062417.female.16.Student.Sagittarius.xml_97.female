I've been thinking a lot when I've actually been awake today. I hate thinking. I get depressed when I think.  Well, right now I'm talking to Gavin. First time in a long time. Wow, I miss that boy. I just don't know what it is about him that draws me to him. I love him so much and just want him to be happy. If he's happy then I'm going to try very hard to be happy for him.  So many things are running through my mind right now. I don't even know how to express them in words.
