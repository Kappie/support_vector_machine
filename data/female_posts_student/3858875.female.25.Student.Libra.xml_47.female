"Our enemies are innovative and resourceful - and so are we," the US president told a high-level meeting of Pentagon officials.   "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people - and neither do we."   His comments came during a signing ceremony for a $417bn defence bill.   White House spokesman Scott McClellan said that Mr Bush's mistakes should reassure rather than alarm.   "Even the most straightforward and plain-spoken people mis-speak," he told the Associated Press.     from BBC News
