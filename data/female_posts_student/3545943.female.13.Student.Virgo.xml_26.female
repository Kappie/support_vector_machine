       
      When the world starts to get cruel, Don't just close your eyes. Turn your back. When you can't look anymore, Don't just avert your gaze. Turn your back. When it hurts too much to fake it, Don't just keep staring. Turn your back. Swallow your pride and turn your back Walk the other way. And when they start to talk about you, Let it go forever. Turn your back, Turn your back, Turn your back.
