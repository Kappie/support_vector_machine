I've been hangin out with one of my best friends Ruthie and that has been a blast.. but I've also been missin my other best friend Kristina... I haven't seen her in what seems like forever but luckily I'll get to see her in like 2 days!! You see, there's this retreat thing and I get to see both Ruthie and Kristina, not to mention all of my gurlies that I havent seen since like June 2, so im stoked. Aight, gotta head out so I'll write more later! Grace
