I wonder how we're gonna make it through the parade tomorrow. That is assuming there is a parade. Its been raining like crazy here lately. We were driving to church and I thought we were gonna die. Yeah and so after church we went to IHOP for breakfast. Fun stuff. So I think today me and my Mom might stop by the mall and see what prom dresses are on sale. I want to get a cheap one for homecoming next year. I don't know if they'll have any good ones though. We'll see. Paul came over last night :-). We watched The Breakfast Club. And then we sorta just sat around in my basement and tried not to fall asleep. We had a really fun time. Anyways, I start my babysitting job on June 8. Exciting. Its actually really good because I don't have to do anything! They don't even need babysitter. And they're paying me well too. So yay for that. And then parade tomorrow, two more days of finals. Reminds me I have to study for biology. Boo for that.
