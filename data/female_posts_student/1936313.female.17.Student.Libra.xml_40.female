Katie and I wrote our little poem for our Creative Writing teacher... she's been the most influential person in my life... and yeaa.. hehe.. she cried, we cried.. Her 10I class looked at us weird and hah.. that was that...  I skipped Math class even though I shouldn't have and went down to the drama room to watch Karaoke... which was... amusing at least.. Sat in Spanish and did nothing.. then I had a spare and everyone else skipped with me so we sat in the stairwell and exchanged our grad gifts and hmm.... that was that..  Then we all skipped our afternoon classes and went home at lunch.  So there's Wednesday for you....  Thursday was supposed to be -my- day.. I fought with Dad to make Andrew go to school so I could have just one day to myself before everyone started bugging me again. So naturally what does Dad have to do? Come home from work early and start nagging at me...  Needless to say, I threw a hissyfit and he left me alone for the rest of the day...  I'm a brat.. I know.. but if I didn't get one day in now, I wouldn't get one until August... I'm dead serious.  I'm not looking forward to sleep now, which is why this is coming in at 12:30... i haven't slept well for the past 3 nights, and I'm not expecting to start sleeping well until well past the end of the month... the damn tea I make myself drink everynight isn't helping either.. grr...  Guess I'll try meditating.. hah.. I always fall asleep during my excercises...  Thats all I guess... Night!    - -Show me the meaning of being lonely, is this the feeling I need to walk with? Tell me why, I can't be there where you are... There's something missing in my heart.- -
