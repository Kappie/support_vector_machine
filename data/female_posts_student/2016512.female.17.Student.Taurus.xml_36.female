I was skimming through a kid's Back-to-School catalog from JCPenny, and practically the whole damn thing was light-hearted skater/punk wear, complete with a shirt with a tie attached to it, including it's very own oversized saftey pin.  Converse, plaid skirts... the first page of the boys' section was all gothic hoodie wear.    What is this world coming to?!?  That being sad, I'm saddened to tell you that I've had the strangest urge recently to invest in several pair of opaque tights and plaid skirts to wear for everyday clothing.  I can't believe I'm letting myself get into this.  Anyone alive with a sex drive, Manda
