Minute after minute passes by me Seconds speed by even faster  It's the same scenery for a very long time and a whole half a day until I see it again  I'm forever stuck in this very boring race-like cycle When will it ever end?  Round and round and round I go I never stop yet I go so slow.     **(this poem is about the hour hand on a clock in case yu didnt catch on =D)**
