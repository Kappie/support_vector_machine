I was actually suppose to be out with my family at my grandma's since this mornin. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to wake up that 'early'(errmx.. According to my definition of early..hEhee). 
Sometimes I feel bored to the extend that I could sleep all day! But I'm afraid of putting on more weight man! Enuff weight with me already manx! Need to lose some. Ok.. Cut this crap. I wonder wad does everyone else do on a Sunday if u were to stay at home n do nth else?~ Any suggestions? However, lucky me, I've got some good pals who r willing to chat with me on e phone! Thanks a lot... U Know who u r~ ok.. I'll stop here for today. Update once I've got e time to!
