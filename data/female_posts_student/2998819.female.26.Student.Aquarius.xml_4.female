I was able to run the whole way and my breathing was getting back on track easier.    Saturday I have my first running group meeting.  I get to find out what pace group I will belong to and who will be in my group.  I am nervous, but I am also pretty excited about it.  Hopefully my brother and I will be in the same group, but he is a tad bit faster than I am.    I will keep you posted how things go on Saturday.   Good luck with your long run this weekend.
