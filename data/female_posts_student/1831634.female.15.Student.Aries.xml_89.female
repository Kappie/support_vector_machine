I have all the bio reading notes, all the hum reading notes, I've got regulars RJ study guides, bio study guides, french study guides, algebra notes, and I'm all set!  man.  it's 3.30.  I gotta get up at 8 today.  =(  I'm going to be one sleep deprived child.  BUT... notes!  if you want notes, just get them from me.  =)  I make very nice notes.  jack makes horrible notes.  I was talking to jennifer chang today, and I was letting her study using my and jack's notes, and she was like, [pointing to jack's] "whose is this?"  'jack sun.'  "oh.  figures."  hahahaha.  he's been spreading his notes.  -__-;;  oooh, well.  SWEET SWEET SLEEP!
