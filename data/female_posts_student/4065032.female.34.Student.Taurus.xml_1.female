My biggest fear with my bird friends was that I would wake up to find evidence of an unsuccessful flight attempt. I suffered through several baby bird deaths at my house in Missouri and was not wanting to relive those "grounding" moments.   One day, though, it happened. The bravest of the four babies, or the clumsiest perhaps, ventured away from home. It landed on my bike as if it meant to, although I knew differently. It looked around some and let out one of those tweets that seemed to take so much effort to blat out. The adults were soon hovering, singing, urging the rookie pilot to move on. Naturally, it did. Interestingly enough, the new flier stuck close to home and would gaze up at its siblings wishing it had made a different choice minutes before its descent. At one point, it flew up to the nest, not really knowing how to latch its tiny talons on to something firm. It managed to softly smack into the beam on which the bird home was glued. It fluttered and fluttered and just couldn't make it in. So, in another graceful, I-meant-to-do-that, fashion, it followed a large J path onto the ground below.   The landing in the grass was not as smooth. As a matter of fact, it was literally a crash landing. I think it scared the baby and the mother (and me) because the bird laid there for a bit with one wing outstretched...no movement whatsoever. Then its head turned and looked toward the place from where he traveled. The mother swallow witnessed this all and quickly landed beside her little one and just sat there. This time, there was no effort to play it off as no big deal. Once the shock ofthe landing wore off, the bird tuckedits wing underneath its body and regrouped. It dared to take flight again.   This time, the bird landed on the chair, which was situated below the nest and in front of my glass door. The landing was shaky, but it did get the job done. The youngster sat, perched on the arm watching its siblings reap the benefits of the latest insect catch. After several moments, the baby left the arm of the chair and flew up to the edge of the nest as if it knew exactly what it was doing. It shoved its way past the other three babes and tucked itself in. It didn't leave again...at least not that day.   New bird lessons:  Sometimes the best landings are a result of a few previous crash landings.  If you get scared, home is usually a good place to go.
