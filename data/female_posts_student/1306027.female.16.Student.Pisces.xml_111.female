True love exists, yes, I know this My heart was waiting for you And when we met I felt my chest Pound fast, racing for the chance To know you, to hold you To open up and show you The way it feels when you know...  You are not alone Know that I would fight the tides To be to together When you feel alone Listen to this song To make your heart feel better.  Two hearts entwined, yes, you are mine And I'll be yours forever I've the done the math, I'm less than half We're better off together And I want you here by my side As much as you are on my mind When I'm gone you should know  You are not alone Know that I would fight the tides To be to together When you feel alone Listen to this song To make your heart feel better.  Rainy Mondays feel like Fridays When you're smiling at me I can feel the space Between us collapsing Our love is everlasting.  You are not alone Know that I would fight the tides To be to together When you feel alone Listen to this song To make your heart feel better.  (Listen to this song... let it make your heart feel better)  Omg.. that is just awesome. Why can't anybody ever write a song like that about me? O, that's right.. I'm meant to be alone forever. **CRAP**
