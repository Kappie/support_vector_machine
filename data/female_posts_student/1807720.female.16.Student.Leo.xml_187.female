I had more fun there then I have in a LONG time and I also got a good workout in that place.  The first game I came in third and the game I came in second.  The top three in both games were all girls - go figure.  We beat out all of the guys.  Then we all went to Fish Creek, but suck at starting fires so we went back to my place and cooked hot dogs and had chips and pop and stuff.  Then we went to the field out by the back of the school and some of us played Frisbee, Basketball, Soccer, or just went for a walk.  Then Chels left for work and the remainder of us went to Boston Pizza for dinner.  I barely ate though, cause again I didn't feel good.  When I did eat, like an hour lately I felt like deadly ill again, but that wasn't going to stop me from going out with friends and having fun.  After dinner we went to Chapters for a while and then to the movies.  Then I drove the people in my car home and Sara took the others.  It was a very fun day!  This morning I woke up and felt actually pretty good for once, compared to like how I usually feel in the mornings these days.  Then I went to go work out at the YMCA.  I didn't want to leave.  I was so relaxing working out and being in a busy, crowded environment.  I didn't want to like overdo it or anything, but I went from 8:45-10:00, which well isn't too long I guess.  Any longer then I will probably be like aching tomorrow.  When I got home though I felt sick again, though at least this morning I had an appetite for my breakfast.  My weight is slowly dropping though.  I am like not trying to avoid for or anything, it just makes me feel sick.  I suppose everything is fine though, as long as the weight comes down slowly then I don't think I have to worry too much.
