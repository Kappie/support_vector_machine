Ah, man tomorrow night and Thursday is going to suck. 3 district assessments all in a row, 3 I HAVE to study for, because since those things are freaking tricky and they're a test grade, so I wanna do good.  I had a good dream last night :) It was perfect, too bad it was only a dream...  Actually, I just had a weird dream about Austin. It was like he was still alive, just hanging out, talking and laughing. But he was with us, though we knew he was dead...Then we all got up and left to go meet somewhere and I realized that even though physically he was there and stuff, he really wasn't, so in my dream I started crying. That's when I woke up. So now I'm sad :(   I don't think I'll ever understand Why you love me Why you love me just like I am
