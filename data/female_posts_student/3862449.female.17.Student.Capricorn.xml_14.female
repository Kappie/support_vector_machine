She was extremely nice and helpful and was able to get me a copy of the proposal for Dr. Kastner's project. I finally was able to learn the purpose of my work. I found out that images I have been downloading and pouring over are a collection of mass-losing evolved stars from the Large Magallanic Cloud. He wants to use Spitzer to take infrared pictures of the stars to learn more about late stage stellar evolution by looking at the chemistry of the "envelope" surrounding the stars. Now that I know this general information, my work is a lot more interesting. I finally finished checking all the images yesterday and taking notes on my observations for Dr. Kastner. Today I will begin the final part of my task, which is collecting references that are already published on the 66 stars.
