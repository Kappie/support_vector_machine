And she gave away the secrets of her past and said, "I've lost control again", and heard the voice that told her when and where to act. She said, "I've lost control again".  And she turned to me and took me by the hand and said, "I've lost control again". And how I'll never just why or understand. She said, "I've lost control again". And she screamed out, kicking on her side and said, "I've lost control again", and seized up on the floor -- I thought she'd died. She said, "I've lost control again". She's lost control again, she's lost control.  Well I had to phone her friend to state her case and say she's lost control again. And she showed up all the errors and mistakes and said, "I've lost control again". But she expressed herself in many different ways until she'd lost control again, and walked upon the edge of no escape and laughed, "I've lost control again". She's lost control again. She's lost control.  I could live a little there in the midst of the light. When darkness closed in I could have broke down and cried. I could live a little in the white of light. When the change is gone, when the caring's gone. To lose control when the caring's gone. Joy Division.
