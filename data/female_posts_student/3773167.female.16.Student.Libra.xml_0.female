Speaking of reading, I broke down and bought  The Code Book  by Simon Singh, the guy who wrote  Fermat's Enigma .  It looks interesting, and I'll probably read it in the car.  I also bought a really cool journal/notebook thing with graph paper inside.  Mom laughed about that... why would I want to think about mathematics, she says.  I said mathematics is elegant, and boy did she get a chuckle out of that.  Guess I better get busy.
