Geez... what should i do? but you know what? no matter what place i get, i still get a big patch to sew on to my blazer. cool huh? I'd better go and work on my speech. wish me luck! PS, the next time i write, i'll be telling you what place i got, and it'll be over with. then you won't have to hear about it any more! yipee!
