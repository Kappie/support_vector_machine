Must be my LAN...it's also giving me the dumb publishing screen, where I have to press "Manage Posts", etc. when I want to look at another for reference. I have a feeling they do this when they're making some coding changes. But still...the other version looks fine to me, unless some peeps are doing really weird stuff with their BLogs and it's causing problems.  The Net is gay.  Happy Hellday all!  $|  Abby is coming home in practically three seconds, yay! That makes me incredibly happy, what after this downer of a day.   That's my two new words, "w00t", after the already-used and infamous word, and "downer", after the amazing Nirvana song of the same name, to describe the two ends of the spectrum of coolness.  I'm going to go run and kill myself now, peace aout dawgz.
