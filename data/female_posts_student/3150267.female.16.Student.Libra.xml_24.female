Even when i saw something interesting, i still couldn't use it... i was afraid tt when i let go of my skin, it may never come back... N i will miss it a lot. (put a lot of effort in changing the script n adding stuffs.) I like the background colour, how it matches my blog, how presentable it looks n how romantic the colour is. It's such a nice combination tt i really would wish it would be alright a few days later. The thing which i m more afraid isn't changing a new skin, but rather after changing a new skin. What if the website hosting the pictures r back again? What if i missed the chance of having a nice blog skin again? What if.... There r just too many "what if"s, n i don't really wish to take the chance... maybe it's the one for me? haha.  I m quite proud of myself for fixing wm n ms's new blog. haha... but i really hope tt they do like it n do treasure it. I don't really want me to thank me but i would rather prefer them to remember me when they see the blogskin. ^_^ bhb hor. haha.  It has been quite a long time posting a new entry. Coz really veri busy wif my schedules (going out) n school stuffs (talking crap wif my frenz) haha... we juz got back our mid year results, I didn't do very well. But i noe the reason to my downfall--lazy to study n slacking as usual during the exam period. haha... I passed all my subjects but didn't really score well, not even for my sciences. Almost failed my chinese (a very terrible thing if my mum finds out. she will slaughter me. hehe.) n juz barely make it for my a maths. haha...   Well, i really hope tt all of us don't take the results so seriously. It's just a exam, n for those who didn't do very well, plz don't give up ^_^. It's not over yet, i believe tt if u really work hard n really do study, u will score for ur prelims n ur "o". ^_^ everyone will face failures n unhappiness, if we manage to learn from our downfalls n learn to accept the fact, i think tt we will soon be able to put our best leg forward. *wink*  Had a few wield dreams recently, the first one was leaving st john during a parade to meet py, dayima n wm at tiong bahru plaza. the worst thing was tt i told Yvonne tt i would nv be irresponsible n leave during parade. N yet i stupidly walked out of the sch gate n ran all the way to tiong bahru just to meet them to shop. haha... Next was abt desmond, i dreamt tt he was a korean-chinese mix (it's jus my dream, so plz dun puke. jking). haha... he called his mum to tell her his results n was babbling in korean. i was stunned by his action n suddenly he looked like bae yong jun (tt korean actor, not sure if this is the correct spelling, sori)... *giggling* my dreamz r juz so interesting.   wm juz called to ask dayima n me to go watch movie wif him. or was dayima the one who wanted it? haha... how come wm suddenly so free to go out wif us to watch movie, thought he's always occupied wif his own things. haha.. jking.  haha... think crapped enough for today, later still need to go tuition at orchard. (a veri stupid idea isn't it? travel all the way to orchard juz for lessons + didn't recieve any useful informations when i was there)    ~Those who love deeply never grow old; they may die of old age, but they die young...~    ::In the arithmetic of love, 1+1=everything, n 2-1=nothing... haha.. interesting rite? wat do u guys think?::
