Everything we experience in life begins with a first impression, and we inevitably branch ourselves off of these moments of complete unbiased opinion. The moment someone, something appeals to our senses it is in our nature to react to it in some way. Before our mind has time to process these reactions there is a short moment to experience an unanalyzed essence in our world. May it be a cool breeze on one's neck or the lulling smell of honeysuckles in the air, it still takes a few moments for a chill to run down one's spine or the sweetness to fill one's soul.  The reason I decided to write about first impressions is because I know how important they can be. I also realize that even though one can change his or her perspectives of something over a course of time, if the first impression is strong enough it will never be forgotten... I wish I could come out of my body and see what other people see in me. I wish I could have an unbiased opinion of myself for only a moment. Would I see the Emily Ferrari I think I am? I don't know what everyone out there thinks, but I'm still wondering...
