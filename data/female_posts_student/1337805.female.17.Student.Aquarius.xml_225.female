So I'm back. and now I get to figure out how to transfer all my posts from my xanga to here. Can't wait. :)  Plus my Xanga was accidently and mysteriously printed off, and Mom read it, soo....I need to find a place to blog now.  Nevermind, I figured out a way to post them. So pretty! Too bad it wasn't in like, the actaully days that it was posted in. Oh well.
