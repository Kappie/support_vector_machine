All national-based papers are there along with four of Washington’s local papers, which have relocated to Boston to publish just convention news. Even though none of these smaller newspapers have a circulation of more than 21,000, the companies are charging advertisers about $10,000 dollars for a full-page ad. The point of these political papers is to be the first to report the most wanted gossip about the candidates. Hardly any paper compares with the National Journal, who has 90 reporters at the convention and sends out email bulletins to people that subscribe. Even though covering the two conventions will not be cheap, the newspapers expect to make profit from the advertisers.   Really, these newspapers are going to be reporting on the convention and the status of the candidates. I would think with so many newspapers competing that none of them would profit much because mostly they will all have the same information. However, these newspapers are aiming their stories directly at the people at these conventions. Most of which are from out of town and are only interested in the political race. It seems newspapers will shift their entire focus for one major event to get to these particular readers. Not to mention they make a quick profit from advertisers, who are zoomed in on this particular target audience. I don’t know if this very ethical. The papers seem to increase advertising prices and shun other news stories all because of the convention. What do you think?
