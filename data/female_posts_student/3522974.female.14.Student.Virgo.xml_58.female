They were talking bout how they had to train the dogs to hump Jim's leg, so they had to get this little chihuahua to practice on a plastic toy. Also, they were talking bout the stripper scene, where the guy that was tied up in the closet had to sit tied up there all day, for like 12hrs. Just sitting there, waiting for his que. Oh...there was soo many things that were funnier that they were talking about, but unfortunately, i can't remember them. Bummer. The other day, i watched the Honey Commentary. I found out that Romeo (is that his name?) , in the second half of filming, had to put his feet apart, so he appeared shorter, coz, he suddenly got a growth spurt while they were still filming the movie, and they didn't want him to look taller than honey. And Raymond, the lil guy, you know how he was missing his 2 front teeth? Yeh, well, half way through filming honey, his two teeth came out, and so they had to blacken them out everytime he smiled. Neways....i shall go watch another commentary. Barnicle Barnabus and Mum were watching the funniest reality TV series before, it was of this family from detroit, that were put on a reality TV show, where they got sent to Peru, where they had to adjust to life with this traditional family. It was a mum, a dad, and 3 boys. I went in there a minute a go, and it was 'bath time', and so the host family brought out this big tin full of murky yellow water, that they sed was their 'shampoo'. fter they all stuck their heads in the buckets, to clean their hair, the host family explained the ingredients. It ended up being the host families supply of urine! It was soo gross! The 15 yr oldd son looked soo pale, coz he is like full hygenic, and he was like ewwwwwwww!!Ahhhh!. N e ways, i g2g, LOluv, kc
