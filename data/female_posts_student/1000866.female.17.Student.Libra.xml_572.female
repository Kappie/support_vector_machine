I saw Diane there too! :) That was cool. She was there to see Andy play. There weren't a lot of people dancing though so...that wasn't cool but oh well.  Tonight I think I'm going to see a movie with some friends. Good times. I haven't been to see a movie in a long time.   I think I'm going to go do more of nothing now.
