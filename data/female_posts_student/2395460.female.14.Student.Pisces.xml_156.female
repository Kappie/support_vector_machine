Cool! All that spewing blood comes at a price that's higher than normal, $55.   If you're not planning on going to Best Buy at  urlLink midnight , and you don't want to spend the next two weeks downloading a  urlLink pirated copy , the best price I've found is at  urlLink eCost . They've got it for $46 and shipping is free. I've had great luck with eCost and delivery has always been speedy. The  urlLink XBox version  is there for $43.99.
