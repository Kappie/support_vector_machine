Its a real pain having to dumb things down to talk to people who aren't too bright (example my ex)... Ryland is one of the smartest guys I know, he has a bunch of tattoos and a nipple ring (I too have tattoos and a nipple ring)its great to have a friend I have things in common with... While I was out today grocery shopping he left a message asking me to call him at 8pm tonight when he gets off work.
