I mean Chem is still kind of confusing but tonight I just sat there tonight and worked through it and it makes alot more sense then it did before.  I feel like I really have a good chance of doing good on the quiz tommorow.  And well I got a 70% on my math quiz but I think I could have done better but I guess I will probably get some help with the stuff I don't really understand to much and well that stuff we did today in class I found confusing cause I don't think she did enough examples so I am bit confused but tommorow we have a work class so it is all good.  Everything is great right now I feel so awesome it's like this odd feeling that have come over me.  I feel so calm it's so odd but a nice feeling and I feel so great.  Lol sounds silly doesn't it but I am actually not over worried bout the chem quiz tommorow cause I know I ready for this and I can face what comes in my way and what comes next on this path of mine.
