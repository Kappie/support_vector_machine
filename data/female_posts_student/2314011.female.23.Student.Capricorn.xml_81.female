Drive for hours across one or more states to drag myself from my car, down the hallway, through the door and it always looks completely strange...as though something huge is obviously out of place or missing, but, because I haven't been around to monitor each inanimate object's activities in the last few weeks, I can't tell exactly what.  "They've been up to something, I can tell."  But as soon as my ass hits the futon and my hand grasps my faithful remotes once again, the wave of "home" washes over me.  Probably won't know where I am when I wake in the morning; but I'll stumble into the kitchen, flip the coffee switch and it'll come back to me eventually.  Have two days to get organized before classes resume, for which I'm very thankful.  Think I may do some wall-covering redecorating tomorrow.  Or maybe I won't even get out of bed.    The transition to my tiny abode has been a bit shakier this time, as I didn't have miles and miles of Montana highway on which to reflect on the break and shift into Moscow-mode.  The Boise route shaved an hour off the overall travel-time, but it feels twice as long; you have to pay attention to those damn curvy roads!  Who knew?  So I find myself missing the quiet cave of a den we called my room in the basement.  The apartment's quite a bit toastier than the cave, but the mountain fortress surrounding it more than compensated.
