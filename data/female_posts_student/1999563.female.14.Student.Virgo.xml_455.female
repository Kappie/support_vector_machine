For though they may be parted there is Still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be. There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be. Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.  Dashboard confessional in coming to town. June first. Which kinda sucks because I don't think I can go because thats the night of our tennis party.  I feel as if I don't have a life..I have just been posting all day long.  I really feel like making a meaningful post...but..I don't know. Does anyone even read this? See, the reason I blog is because I like everyone ot be able to read my thoughts..my dreams..my life. But does anyone even care? If just just stop posting would the world notice?  I am in a depressing mood, just ignore me.  But, I get to be a counselor this summer. Yay. But how am I supposed to minister to little kids if I am always so sad? I don't even think I am always sad. but on lonely Friday nights like tonight I wonder if its all worth it. Will my life be worth anything? When i'm gone will people care?  Why can't I get a boyfriend? (now I am starting to me shallow) Its seems as though if I had a boyfriend I would have someone who loved me...someone who loved being by me and always wanted to hang out with me..  I know all this is fulfilled by God but I want a human being. I real live person. I want someone, anyone, who loves me.  Is this to much to ask?
