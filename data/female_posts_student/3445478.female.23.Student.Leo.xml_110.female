Now when I have Nick wrap his fingers around my hand to pull up into a sitting position he automatically pulls  himself  into a standing position! Strong boy. 99% Boy!      Great News...Because of the fact we only need a babysitter a few hours 3 days per week...G'ma Pam offered to help out for this upcoming semester!!! I can't begin to describe how grateful I am! I like that Nick will have one-on-one care and she is already aware of all his quirks...like facing to the rightside which is not good. Also, Nick can be very demanding. He is a high energy boy that likes to be busy with someone 20 out of 24 hours per day. Shawn and I think daycare will be a great option for Nick ...when he is a bit older. Maybe starting this winter. I think the interaction Nick will get at daycare will be a great thing, but right now, he is still too young and needs so much from the person watching him. We three are lucky to have another option-Pam.           Tonight, I am going to put Nick to bed in his very own crib. This is a big step for both of us. Last night he kicked me all night long in the stomach. Like I wrote before, Nick is a strong boy. Ahhhhhhhhh! Poor stomach. I woke Shawn up around 4am to switch spots so I could relax my stomach for a few hours. Nick is doing great with Oatmeal cereal. No other solids will be started until he is 6 months old per the Doctor. He loves when it's cereal time.       Th  is afternoon Nick and I hung out at G'ma Lu's. There was a number of people either still there or they arrived early this morning. Nick played with everyone while G'ma Lu opened presents. Nick was exhausted by the time we left. He fell asleep in the carrier. He loves it at G'ma Lu's house. There is almost always lots of people for Nick to watch. He has started to "talk" much more often. Mostly when he is frustrated!
