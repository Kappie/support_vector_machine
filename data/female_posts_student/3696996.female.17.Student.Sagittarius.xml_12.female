I had more crazy thoughts about life and time last night hanging out with people...it's comforting to know that other people think about some of these things too.  I'm trying to get my parents to let me go to the beach on sunday for the 4th.  That'd suck if they didn't let me, I'd be so sad.  If I don't go then I'll go to CT for the weekend with my family.  I have a pen on my desk that says "This pen has been stolen from Michael's Shoe Store."  I thought that was kinda funny.  I am desperately in need of something fun to do right now I'm wicked bored...
