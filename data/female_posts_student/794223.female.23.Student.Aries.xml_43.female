I cannot even begin to imagine how powerful this 3rd movie is going to be; if the music behind the film makes my mouth drop and gives me goosebumps, I'm terrified of just how amazing the last movie in the Trilogy is going to be.  By the way: you can hear both Billy Boyd and Viggo Mortensen on the soundtrack ;-)  I'm taking a much-needed break from studying for my Latin American politics final ma√±ana.  Thank God it's my only one.  Did I mention how stupid it is to take a final after you've graduated?!  I think I'll write a letter to the editor of the Daily Texan and complain.  Ok, back to studying.
