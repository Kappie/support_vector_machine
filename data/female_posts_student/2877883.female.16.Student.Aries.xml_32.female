Not on purpose, obviously, but that could come from the facts that  a.  I didn't have Bio or lunch with Miss Carolina today, thus limiting our contact to a very quick discussion of the math quiz (which I found to be not too hard, but I don't really understand what we're doing so I had to guess on a lot of things)  and    b. I never have any classes with Meliss, nor lunch today, (haha I said nor) and I lost both she and Carolyn this morning and studied for my math quiz while just sort of standing on the side of the hallway instead.     what a fabulously social enlightening day.  What makes this worse is that the entire 4th lunch that I had after tech long today, I was forced to listen to Abbie Staruk tell her stupid irrelevant stories and then say how she couldn't stand some of the  perfectly nice people and wants to tell her friend that she doesn't actually like her at all and just wants her to stop talking about completely irrelevant things, because apparently she doesn't care.  Sound familiar?  I don't care about your dumb little stories about Cuban exiles or your hatred for most every girl in our grade.  Thank you and have a nice life.   Tomorrow shall be quite quite busy- I'm babysitting at 4 and then going to a BC basketball game for 7.  So that means all of my time from 4 until 10 will be completely booked.  I shall be quite busy.
