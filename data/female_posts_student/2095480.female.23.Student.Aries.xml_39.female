Everyone wants to find love... and sometimes we find it in the most unsuspecting of places... for the girl... "Anna", she found it in a Secret Service agent. So, what does this mean for me? For you? I dunno really, but I will go out on a limb and say maybe it means we should look in places that we really don't expect to find love. Maybe we should look beyond the "first date" as a possible love opportunity and look to our very daily life. Is there someone in it that loves us? Its crazy. Keep those eyes open. Good luck.
