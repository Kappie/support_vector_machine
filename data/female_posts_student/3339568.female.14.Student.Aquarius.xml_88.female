We drove up to the lookout over Collaroy Beach. The waves were so huge! Then we drove home. I gave up going out with Mel and Gemma 4 that. How utterly disapointing. Church 2nite. I sooo miss it. And I don't know y, I mean i went last week. Weird. I don't wanna go back 2 school. How evil. I'm teaching miself "Wonderworld" by  Oasis  on the guitar. Yay. I really love that song. Listening to it now actually -  "There are many things that I would like 2 say to you, but I dont know how,I saidmaybe, You're gonna be the one that saves me, and after all, you're my Wonderwall!"  Quite a good song. Mmmmm...  Em, G, D, A7sus4    I really don't wanna go bak 2 school. I love seeing my friends every day. And, crazy thing is, I miss Luke. Yes and I saw him on Tuesday. 5 days. How sad is that. Once I go back 2 school I'm gonna have 2 get used 2 going without him 4 5-6 days   EVERY WEEK!   I'm gonna die. Ahhh...I'm already dead. These have been like the best hols eva, and they are finishing and I totally can't accept it. Just like Mel can't accept that  Summer  is gone and over, and isn't coming back 4 ages!   I'm looking forward 2 Ash and Tim's b'day party .  Should be good !  Grease   dress up theme, then   girly sleepover.   Should be fun!! Eh'xcelent. But the only bad thing is I've gotta get 2 pressies and mi costume in a week!       Argh...stupid school!   Mi back 2 School   Blues...   Blogging off   Beth
