My dad lives there, he just recently (2 years ago) got out of prison so I try to spend some time with him in the summer and after winter. i'm really tired, which is why i am writing so freakin' early. I prolly won't be able to write tonite, cuz i'll be snoozing. Today, jess and I had to get up at 5:45 am to go watch jimmy at DM camp. i am so tired, and i still have muny band and i still have to pack...and get directions to where we are going ... i have a lot to do. well, i guess that's it, just a disclaimer: i may not write every nite while i'm there, dad will prolly have me busy , lol!
