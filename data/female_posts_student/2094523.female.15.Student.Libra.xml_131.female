I mean lifes like that , Could be better, Could be worst but for the majority it cud be definitly much worst than much better. anyways in comparison to other peoples problems in the world our complaints are almost nothing.  i dont understand the ignorance of us human beings.. i guess thats just the way we were made  Anywho, u know how celebrities who are so rich fling money around and buy anythin and everythin they want. unlimited amounts of clothes, 50 cars, a hugemungous house, and all the useless gadgets? u know how that pisses u off alot and u say 'gee what a spoiled asshole' but when u think bout it.. if U had that kinda money ud do the same. i bet ure ass u wudnt give away ure money to charaty.. THATS RITE i know u u and ure greedy ass just like me!
