I mean, I guess it makes sense considering I went to bed at 2:00 last night or this morning, however you look at it.   i hear we have a showcase thing this Thursday at Oswego. That should be pretty fun I suppose. Then nothing this upcoming weekend with marching. I think that'll be really good. I'm hopihng to hang out a lot with friends I never get to see like Kelly and all them.  I am just so out of it right now I can barely type. I'm sure there's about 20 typos in here so far, but I just can't be bothered to go fix them.   And I suppose since I am that tired i should go sleep. Good night....
