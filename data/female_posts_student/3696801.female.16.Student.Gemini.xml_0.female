They are all sooo cute...but at that age they don't know how to sit still or be quiet with someone else is talking. Yep its me and tyler in there helping...aww he will be a good dad someday...awww hahaha. But they are alot of fun don't get me wrong...just im tired every single day after VBS...how will i survive when im like 25 with kids all day long...hmmm....oh well not the time to think about that. Today I also went with my friends Amory and Blake and Tyler to her uncle's church...it was really nice...we heard Megan from Casting Crowns speak she was really really good...I enjoyed that. And here i am now...tired but still writing this...thats why it might be alittle weird...but neways...i think thas all i have to say today. Goodnight.
