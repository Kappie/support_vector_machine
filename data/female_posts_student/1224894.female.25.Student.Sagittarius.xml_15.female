To start with, yesterday was declared a national holiday since it's the end of Ramadan, and with Gloria's new policy, the Muslim holiday is considered vital. It's good for both students and employees since everyone deserves a break. To top it all off, my class will start at 10:30 later this morning, so, i can still have a short time of surfing the net, maybe sleep for a good many hours.   Early yesterday morning, as i was making the schedule for the Choir that would lead the Novena Mass and Misa de Gallo this Christmas, i received a call from my Mom telling me to go to Gemma's place since everybody was already there for the Ukay-ukay, a craze that started due to hardened times and everyone practices practical buying.   I told my Mom i'd be with them soon, since it would really be better if i'll fit them myself. Anyway, the moment i arrived i recognized so many faces that i haven't seen in a while, mainly, because i've been busy with school, i have no social life (due to my Mom's adverse reaction on me going out)...and gald to see them once again. So, Armin, Arien  Nang Alding were there, together with Marilou A., some neighbors and people from Buenavista BIR office.   I had a good time since i became a "sort of" model...for UKAY-UKAY? He he he he...not exactly what i had in mind whenever modelling comes into it...i would prefer to model laundry soap than Ukay-ukay, but as it happened, i was kinda having fun since almost all that they chose for me to wear fits me perfectly.   So, as Mama set aside some blouses and shirts for me and for her...we had a call from convent...reminding me of the practice i'll have with both COM and CCRM for the Alliance of the Two Hearts. About 12:15, Ma and I went home, grab somce lunch and i showered then took off for Church.  Yes, I was late...they were already there waiting for me and i was so glad that many were able to attend.  Practice started and everyone had fun, even the new ones who're not used to dancing. I was kinda wondering about some of my old animators...where the heck are those people!  About 5, i gave Father Ruel the DVD's that he ordered from me...and ordered again..."It Runs in The Family", "Kill Bill", "Williard", and "West Side Story".  Then, Tambok, Ma, Auntie Joy and I went to some houses for the solicitation for lights and decorations this Christmas that will be decorated in Church.   Around 6, Gemma already texted and we have to get back immediately for another Ukay moment...at sa awa ng Dios we got home shortly after 12 a.m. Ang saya-saya!!!   Me going to sleep now...
