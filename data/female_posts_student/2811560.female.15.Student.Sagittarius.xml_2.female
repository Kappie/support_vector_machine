So I cleaned the whole house and showered in 2 hours, and they came over around 2. Matt Miller, Rob Pyde, John Kasper, Mike Fanizza, Kelly Kennedy, and Jasmine all came. We actually had a really good time. They stayed until like 7:30 (I know, crazy) at which point I kicked them out because Kelly and I wanted to go to the LP basketball game, which we did. Apparently the rest of them went to Mike's to play more halo. After 5 hours, they still hadn't had enough. I swear, they're like animals. It was quite interesting actually, because I sort of had a little problem with the oven when I was making pizza. Our oven hasn't been cleaned in like forever, so whenever we cook stuff, it gets really smoky. So, every time I opened the oven door, the smoke detector went off. It was crazy. Plus, John Kasper let me borrow his Cavaliers DVD. Sweet, I was excited. Anyways, it was real fun. And LP won the game too. Yay for them.
