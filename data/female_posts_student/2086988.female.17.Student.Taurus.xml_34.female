Well, I took my first final today, alg 2, got a 85! wut wut. Tomorrow I have no finals, wednesday I know I have chem but I don't know about history, because some teachers are gay and haven't finished grading our shit. Oh and I have to take German now, because of that one absence, see if I didn't have it, then I would just need an 80 to be exempt instead of an 85, and I have an 83...MOTHERFUCKER!!!! I don't wanna take german, :::Cries:::. As long as I don't have to take history, I good. Anyways, I don't care, I'm just updating this for Ritika. So enjoy it.    So I'll hold you tonight like I would if you were mine to hold forevermore
