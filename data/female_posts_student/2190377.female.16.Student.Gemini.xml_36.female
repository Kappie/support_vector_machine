I felt strangely anti-social today.  What do people talk about? I can't remember.  Weeeiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrd.  Although last night I was all hallucinate-y and crazy.  Hearing noises that were'nt there and whatnot.  I think something is wrong with me. Maybe I'm just becoming a hypochondriac.  Anyhoo! Yeah.  What a good movie.  I cried for about two-thirds of it.  Which is ... a lot.  for me anyways.  I don't cry a lot... especially in public, except for that one day when i went kinda psycho.  :/  I'm just kinda in awe.  wowowowow.  I watched EVERYTHING I'm proud to say.  Horror movies are good training I guess.  ummm yeah.  Matthew Mahoney is definitely the most friendly person I have ever met.  ever. :) I wasn't my normal eeee look at me I'm an effervescent ball of fluff today and he was still SO nice.  Not so much today but just my general impression of him.  Have you ever met one of those people that always seems happy and just.. nice?  Like they'll smile at you even if they don't know you.  Or if he doesn't look HAPPY he at least looks pensive.  I wanna be one of those people.    I have a few funny stories.  They aren't really postable, though.  Besides my psychotic behavior of last night anyway.  I'll write that later but... it's kinda embarassing.  By the way, Maria is black.  That girl knew all of those BSU questions.  Insane.  The only one I knew was the one about grammy awards winners or something (halle berry and denzel washington hehe)   So I was reading about the people in the movie I just watched, and was shocked to find out that the guy who played Jesus is also the guy who played the younger son firefighter man in Frequency.  Weird huh.  This is such a sedate... fragmented entry.  It's pretty much how I feel though.  Time to study chemistry, but I'm soooo distracted.
