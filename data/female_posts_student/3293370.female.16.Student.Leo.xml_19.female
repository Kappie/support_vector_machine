Anyway ... dance recital was last night. Jasmin, Mark and Sara went to watch me. Boy I feel loved. The family was having a party last night too so I just told the 3 of them to come over and party it up with the old asians. Oh man, it was quite the night. Coors Light = not good to play High/Low with. Woo wee. Syr spit it all out on everyone because he's a pussy and couldn't take it. What a retard. Everyone was so drunk. Note to self: avoid karaoke machines when drunk. Intoxicated singers and dancers are quite amusing. Sara, Jas, Mark and I sat on the stairs watching all the people sing and dance. It was hilarious and a half.   So, things with Mark are progressing nicely. I like him a lot. I can just be me with him; I'm not insecure about our relationship at all. I could show up in an old t-shirt and some ripped jeans and know that he'll still like me as much as he would if I were all fancied up. We've been doing a lot of stuff, I've gone farther with him than I had initially intended to. We talked about that too and decided that we should slow it down a bit. I mean, I don't regret anything I've done with him, it's just that we ARE moving too fast and I really don't want to do something I'll regret. He's an awesome guy and he's so understanding and just ... ahh, so amazing. The family likes him too, I think. Which is a good thing. Hehe.
