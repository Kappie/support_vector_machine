I thought I'd take a break from posting my poetry because I haven't had any comments in a while and I don't want to be a redundant person, LET'S MIX IT UP!  I miss everyone terribly because most of you I don't get to see, but absence makes the heart grow fonder so..... I want to hear from whoever when you get the chance, if you get the chance to just drop a few lines to my email,  urlLink catconner@hotmail.com , or give me a call, like I'm gonna put my number on my blog, but I would love to hear from anyone and everyone.  I'm thinking of pulling something together before the "S" word starts, so we can soak up those last few rays of summer.  Love and miss, but I'm still here!  Hope all of you have a wonderful day, week, year....hey!  just have great lives because my small, but wonderful blogger audience is full of wonderful people whom I adore!
