Play over, no more rehearsal...missing peoples...missing the cute upperclassman Assistant Directors that is...hee hee..boy crazy is bad.  Did the governent intentionally make Easter Sunday on 4/20? I mean, do you realise how much a conflict it is going to make with the pot-smoking Christians out there? Granted, there aren't many...but I live in the place with top schools and tons of druggies. It sucks.  Until next time, adios muchachas. Clean Girly, Manders, Solitary Boycotter of 4/20
