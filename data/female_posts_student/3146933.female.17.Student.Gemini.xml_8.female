I'm so bored though...but at least I'm at mom's right now. Went to the drive-in with Monica, Mom, Kenneth, Kristi and Tori. Rode with Monica and got in trouble b/c I wasn't supposed to be with her that night. Long story but oh well. Maybe I'm not grounded. Who knows? I stay grounded. I wish I was perfect so I wouldn't :/ *sigh* but oh man. I had some fun today at least. I got to have my senior pix taken and I got them done at Classic Portraits. I say..everyone should get theirs done there. The woman that takes the pics is so nice...and her sets are so pretty. She has like, everything. I hope they turned out as good as Monica's did. I got new glasses too tho..they're cute. They make me look smart..lol..ok I so don't have any exciting news..or well any news at that..so I'm off I guess...to talk to monica and brad...I love Monica and I heart Brad. alicia
