I'm not drinking nearly enough fluids, my calcium level has gone significantly down, I'm not eating breakfast and barely eating lunch, I'm not geting out for as many walks anymore (damn weather, making me be fat and lazy), and now with this abumdance of Halloween candy Mom bought me, this'll do me over. Starting either before the LDC, or right after, I'm going for walks again. I'm keeping that weight I lost over the summer off for good.  Damnit.  Or at the rate of this house warming up, maybe I'll just freeze and be healthy that way..:P
