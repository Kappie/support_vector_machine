I sure hope I did well on that last Chem quiz Friday cause well I got kind of confused on it.  I think during tutorial tommorow I am going to go ask her what I got on that quiz...cause she still hasn't posted the marks and I cannot stop thinking about what I got. This guy today in chem like insulted her teaching.  Someone asked "Why do we have to do this?" and then she was like "Well the students told me that they liked it" and he was like "Well not everyone said that" and then she was like "Well would you rather have me teach" [cause yearh we were using labtops and he was like "Uhhhhh NO!...Like no offence or anything" and then she was like "no offence taken."  She seemed to know that she needs a little improvement on the teaching.  I have to admit though she is getting better.  And well she is alot nicer to me now then she was before, but her teaching is getting there, it is improving.  One of my cats had to be put down today.  He had diabeties and well he went partially blind from the insulin and well then she would just lay on the floor and he wouldn't move or eat and the odd time he got up he couldn't even walk straight.  I had Socks since I was five but well I am glad I don't have to see him suffer anymore so I am not really upset.  I knew it would eventually happen one day so I am just accepting the fact.
