She said, "I think I remember the film, And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it." And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got."  I see you,  the only one who knew me But now your eyes see through me I guess I was wrong So what now? It's plain to see we're over, And I hate when things are over... When so much is left undone  And I said what about "Breakfast at Tiffany's? She said, "I think I remember the film, And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it." And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got."  You'll say that we've got nothing in common No common ground to start from And we're falling apart You'll say the world has come between us Our lives have come between us But I know you just don't care  And I said what about "Breakfast at Tiffany's? She said, "I think I remember the film, And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it." And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got."**  sigh...reminds me of my own fruitless efforts...   im trying as hard as i can, dammit, im trying...im trying...im trying... God knows im trying...
