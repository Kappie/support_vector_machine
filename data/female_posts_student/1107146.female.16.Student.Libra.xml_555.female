The heat in this house has a smell, and it's really frickin' nice. And Katie is running a shower and it has a really nice sound to it. So that probly means I'll be hitting the sack here in a second because I'm really tired...and tomorrow's a really special day.   If Abby happens to be reading this...NOTHING IS GOING ON PLEASE IGNORE THAT LAST COMMENT...heheheh.  Well, that's it for now friends, I hope you enjoyed the wonderful poem.
