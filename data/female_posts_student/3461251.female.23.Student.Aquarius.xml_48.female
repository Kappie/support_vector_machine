By the time we got home - I was so tired though but it was well worth it!  Now I can't wait for more of this weight to fall off.  However, trying on cloths made me realize how much I didn't want to go to Michigan.  I do realize that I've lost 100 pounds, which is fantastic but I also realize if I tell people that at the wedding - There gonna just look at me like "So... You still have a few more hunderd to go?!" - Blah. I'm sure I won't get that much negative feedback but I'm afraid I will and I'm not even sure if I could handle it right now.   Sunday was a nice lazy day though!  Ashton  Amanda came out for dinner and it's always good to see the baby!! He's growing way to fast though and its so scary to think he's going to be 2 years old in a few short months.  Anyways, even know my weekend was great - I can't help to think about Josh.  He's back in DC for his grandmothers funeral and I haven't even heard a word from him, not even a phone call or off line message.  Ugh! I feel so outta place all the sudden with him and that's never happened.  I'm starting to wonder if maybe I should just move on and forget him, I mean he did it to me once before and I accepted him back into my life with open arms.  Although, I know I'd never be able to do that because for some reason - I just adore him way to much but still this whole thing isn't fair to me.   Hopefully soon - He'll get in touch with me but till then, I'm sure Shay will rub it in my face that he's called or whatever else she wants to tell me. :-(
