I also decided to participate in the Self Challenge.    I began the challenge on Monday and have been doing pretty well so far.  The only temptation I keep having is for chocolate, but I have some will power (albeit not enough to say no to a fun-size Reese's FastBreak.....mmmmm.....But it was tiny!)  Other than that my diet consists of pretty much all vegan, earthy-crunchy, hippie food.  Not so tasty, but I feel much, MUCH better- and no stomach pains!!!  I'm definitely feeling sore, but in a good way!  Once this icky Boston weather clears up I am resuscitating my baby and we are going out for a ride!!!  (For those of you who are confused right now, you obviously don't understand the relationship I have with my bicycle)    The only TV I've been watching is Cartoon Network (I'm only human!)- other than that my DVD player is in overdrive with The Joy of Yoga!!!  Today I discovered FitTV (great for motivation!) and put my sticky mat to work.  It has never felt so good to be so sore.  At least I know it's not from something lame, like falling down a flight of stairs, which has also been known to happen.  I feel like I am making really positive changes in my life, and I also know that that sounds corny, but it's true!  I love yoga, and it feels awesome to get back into it.  If only I had a yoga partner... But I'm barking up the wrong tree on that one.    Well, I guess that's enough of me raving about the joys of healthy living... Don't get me wrong, I love the bad stuff as much as the next person- but I have to get back into shape so I can enjoy the bad stuff to its full capacity- he he he!  I shall write more later.  Have a blessed day!  *me*
