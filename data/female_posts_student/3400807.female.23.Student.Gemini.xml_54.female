Yes, yes, I am in fact jumping on the bandwagon. I liked  urlLink this idea  so much, I'm going to use it, too. Mostly so that I'm justified in asking  urlLink Kyra  the questions I wanted to, but it's very cool all the same. So, here's the deal (for those who didn't click on the links): Ask me any three questions (preferably profound or at least thought-provoking) and I will do my best to answer them completely. But, here's the catch: if you ask me three questions, you have to let anyone else do the same to you by posting this same information on your own site. Deal?
