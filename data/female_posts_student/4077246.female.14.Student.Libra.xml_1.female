Tomorrow I get to leave right after school to go to my state swim meet...It should be ok...I don't expect to win anything but I can always imagine...LOL(like I'll ever win at a swim meet!Ha) but tomorrow should be ok...Lunch today was horrible...These people took mine and Step's seats so I went and sat with Lexi and Kryttle...But I better get going...I'll write later...Bye
