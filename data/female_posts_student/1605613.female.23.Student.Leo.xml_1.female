The Devil Rays are apparenly realizing that picking up other peoples trash will not pay off and will try and develop some of their own talent.   Travis Lee is the only of these players worth mentioning their stats he hit .275 19 HR and 70 RBI last season. This collates great into their 2005 pennant run.
