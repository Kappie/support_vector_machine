I think these assholes who sue for worthless shit (see: "hot coffee lady" at McD's) should be put down, shot, and run over by a herd of spider-mutants. So my conscience would suffer greatly for my gain.  Altho it did hurt like a be-otch. Or at least I think it did. I can't remember. The amnesic was really good. Could I throw in memory fraud?!? That would kick muchos assos.
