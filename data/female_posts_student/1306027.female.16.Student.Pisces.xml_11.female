I sleep during the day, and blog in the night hours. Special... I know. You would'nt believe the massive amount of lame infomercials are on this late at night... its making me gag (x 2). I once wrote an article about informercials. Maybe I'll post it one of these days. O and as for Bucky, don't worry he'll be back by tomorrow. I promise.     Sleep Prevails- Catch you later
