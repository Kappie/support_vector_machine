Summer jobs, summer sports, and summer trips have all been arranged and people just can't wait for their lives to begin. No one's doing the homework, no one can bring themselves to sit down with a textbook to study when it's 87* outside and it doesn't get dark until 8:30. When there's only 3 more days of school left, can you blame them??? However, the only downside? FINALS. You have to tie yourself to a chair and study to make the grade, otherwise you're not going to be able to do anything short of breathing once your parent see that you have a C- in history. (Thats not me, thats a scenario). So, I've skipped out on waterpolo, a sport I'm soooo excited started up on Monday. I only went Monday. We have a though tournement Sunday. Yay!! But I am out of shape, and I will be playing with the 18 and unders, and I will have to shape up or I'll simply be keeping our coach company while everyone else is out in the field. But finals are more important, and I think that I've done pretty well so far. I guess we'll have to see. Two more tomorrow and I'm done. Then Friday I'll just cruise threw school, and it will all be over. Like a bad dream that's lasted way, way to long. lol.  Well, like man would say; "I'm out like a fat kid in dodgeball". PEACE~
