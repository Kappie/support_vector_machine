I have no clue what I've going to do. I want to go to college and get a good paying job but how do you do without knowing what you want to do. That's my problem. I have no clue what I want to do. I don't find myself good at anything really.  *The Great Lakes Medieval Faire. Very few thing can make me happy. The faire makes me happy and now it's over. I might cry.  :'(    *Family. I swear if it weren't for my little sisters, I'd never see my father. What an *ss. We barrowed his van Sunday to go to the Faire's last day and the faire was like from 10-7 or a little after and he got p*ssed off for us coming home late. AFTER I HAD TOLD HIM WE'D BE ALL DAY! But no! The dumb *ss can't ever be wrong. Or else his f*cking world would crumble. I hope to God he f*cking wakes up and realizes he needs some help. Then he makes me feel like sh*t. He b*tched my older sister for the being gone all day. I stick up for her and she can't even get the balls the fight back and tell him he's wrong. She's a wimp, he's a drunken ignorant *sshole! Then here he goes later that night. I'm p*ssed at him. When we fought he said I was a pyscho all because I was brave enough to call him out! Back to later that night, he comes in and gives my sister money before she leaves for college again. He tries to get me, I think $15 and I tell him straight up that I don't want his money and he asked me if I was mad at him! What the f*ck! Of course you stupid *ss wipe! now he thinks we haveno problems and everything is back to the way it was before. Maybe he'd see the truth if he was a drunk and if he went to some anger management classes.   *Family... again. And once more the problem is him. My father decided to go school clothes shopping. Thanks to him, I have no school clothes. For he went and bought stuff off of   urlLink  blair.com    and the stuff comes in and looks worse then what it did on the site, not that it looked good on the site to start with. I mean, this ugly stuff that you'd see old people in their 70s or 80s wearing to bingo. I wear stuff from Torrid, (  urlLink  Torrid.com    ). Now I have nothing to wear to school. Isn't that great! Thanks dad!   *I do not want to go to work tomarrow. I feel like crap and my emothions are f*cked up at the moment.    God I need help.
