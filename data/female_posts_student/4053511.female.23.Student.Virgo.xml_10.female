Well, needless to say after standing on my feet for 5 hours straight and listening to the same six songs over and over inbetween the speakers......the Kerry people still have some convincing to do.   If the event would have run more smoothly instead of at least a 15 to 20 minute interval inbetween each speaker it would have been fabulous.  It was held in the Five Flags Civic Center in downtown Dubuque.  It holds a huge amount of people.  But there were so many people that were trying to get into the event that the fire marshall had to cut off the number of people coming in.   Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters also gave a mini-concert for free.  He had heard that the Bush campaign was using a few of his songs at their rallies and decided to come and play his songs where they belonged.  So that part was pretty cool.  When Kerry finally came out to speak it was ok.  I'm still not convinced that he is the man for the job.  I'm not sure what they could do or say that would make me think that he is suitable to serve as President of the United States.   To be brutally honest, even though I graduated with a BA in Political Science, I really cannot wait for all of this election crap to be over.  Then, I may or may not look for a different country of residence.  But regardless of the outcome, I already have plans to be very hungover on the 3rd of November.
