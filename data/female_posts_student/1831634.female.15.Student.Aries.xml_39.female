I had to tape the sinfonia 8 concert.  lol.  I was working w/a cd recorder!  it was so strange... like put in cd.  press rec mode.  press select.  press record.  press stop.  press rec mode.  press rec mode.  press select.  press record.  press stop.  press finalize.  hahahahaha.  I messed up a bit in the middle there cuz I couldn't remember all the keystrokes, but I got it all in the end.  only missed the first five seconds of the judge.  =D  not bad, considering they just pulled me in from outside and said, "are you a first/fifth pd psn who can press buttons?!"  LOL  now... to the fun stuff!  I was nervous as all heck and some more yesterday night.  I was sooooo so so so so dreading today it wasn't even conceivably funny.  NOT AT ALL FUNNY.  I was ranting my head off.  lol.  I actually went and drew pictures... for FUN.  ya... the horror!  drawing!  for FUN!  ya... see what art has done to me.  anyways.  hoped up to announcements today that we wouldn't get rankings.  too bad.  -___-;;  suffered through the entire first 30 minutes of algebra.  then... LUNCH.  I swear, I could NOT eat.  I really really could NOT.  ask kailing.  or deanna.  I was one nervous wreck.  I could not not not eat.  or focus.  or do anything.  then I made kailing wait until the end of lunch to go up with me to get our ranks.  we literally waited til like the last five minutes or so.  3, actually, cuz I made kailing wait for me while I ate an apple.  lol.  so we went up.  we were saying how su's table was gonna be looking at us...  lol.  and they were.  hahahaha.  so then we went up...  I went to my counselor who spent a long time looking for my name.  then when she finally handed me the papers, I was thinking, "two sheets?  for one rank?"  then I realised that it was actually a summary of every class I've taken for hs credit.  lol.  then I was like, "where's my rank?!"  and I saw it.  and I said, "oh my god."  and the counselor smiled at me and said, "can't ask for much better than that."  and then I thought, "haha, kailing is right behind me..."  but I said, "yeah!"  hahahaha.  then I grabbed kailing and began squealing like crazy.  I dragged her off the stage... literally.  she kept tripping b/c of her high heels.  hahaha!  and then on our crazy trek back to our lunch table, we ran into andrew tang who asked us our ranks... and all we said was, "we're both in top ten".  LOL.  then we got back to our table.  and I found out kailing's rank.  and we both squealed and "oh my god"ed some more.  hahahahaha.  man.  SO FREAKING HAPPY.  I am still high.  yeah.  I think kai and I were being v. loud.  lol.  then we made a pact to not tell anyone else our rankings!  suspense!  we don't want them to be able to list out top 10.  lol.  anyways.   we walked back from lunch, and I was telling kailing, "you know, this means that you beat  979  other people at this school!"  and she said, "oh my god you're right!"  hahaha.  then...!  algebra.  we went in and ppl asked, "what're your rankings?"  and we said, "we're both in top ten."  and the entire class went OMG and someone went YOU'RE FRESHMEN?!  LOL.  and then and then and then... we were high!  and I was even NICE to fan!  hahahah.  was the entire algebra class listening to our group today..?  hahahaha.  I think they were.  anyways.  then commapps.  w/stupid ppl. talking about being in the 800s.  I was surprised.  I had forgotten that there're actually ppl outside the 100s... it's like, for me, inside 100s there is light.  outside... no sense of it at all.  actually, I have no sense of where the GPAs are at different ranks.  just that mine is .004 from jack's.  argh.  and then after commapps, I packed up my backpack and talked to jack by his locker.  he told me he was rank four.  actually... I just asked for confirmation.  lol.  I could already tell from my gpa what his rank was.  yeah.. and I didn't tell him MY rank... so then he got mad at me.  like... yeah..  actually mad at me.  or disappointed, which very often is even WORSE than anger.   dilapidatedshack: :-D beD XTC: hm? beD XTC: why? dilapidatedshack: ranks!! dilapidatedshack: hahahahahahaha dilapidatedshack: hahahahahaha beD XTC: wats ur rank? dilapidatedshack: =D beD XTC: u better tell m,e...... beD XTC: since you know mine dilapidatedshack: you told me your GPA, dear beD XTC: I told you mine...not knowing that u would be so selfish.. dilapidatedshack: and since I knew what my gpa was beD XTC: are you 6? dilapidatedshack: it's not that hard figuring your rank out beD XTC: ? beD XTC: are you 6? beD XTC: oor 5? beD XTC: or 3? beD XTC: ...grrr... beD XTC: whgast wrong w/ you? dilapidatedshack: I need to go eat dilapidatedshack: =) dilapidatedshack: congrats, btw beD XTC: you know dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: I'll remember this beD XTC: ....... beD XTC: grrrr..... dilapidatedshack: I know you will dilapidatedshack: =) dilapidatedshack: I'm in top 10 dilapidatedshack: if that helps dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: see if you get my gpa again dilapidatedshack: lol dilapidatedshack: I will tell you... dilapidatedshack: eventually dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: tell me if ur higher or lower  beD XTC: no really... beD XTC: I'm not kidding.... beD XTC: tell me....... dilapidatedshack: can't dilapidatedshack: made a pact with kailing dilapidatedshack: =) beD XTC: ...... beD XTC: and so you know my rank because....I feel used dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: I'm sorry, jack beD XTC: really now... beD XTC: at end of year... beD XTC: I swear dilapidatedshack: you swear what? beD XTC: ........you won't know anything about me unless you work w/ me... dilapidatedshack: -_________________- beD XTC: cuz...I really feel usedf beD XTC: ...... dilapidatedshack: gah beD XTC: go die... dilapidatedshack: I'm really really really really sorry dilapidatedshack: anyhow dilapidatedshack: brb beD XTC: ok...you know what?

I mean... 5th?!  lol.  you know what's scary?  those ppl are all going to plano senior high.  top 5 TOTALLY surprised me.  not kailing, o'course, but I mean.. me and jack?  lol.  we were talking today, and I said, "you know... kailing and grace sound SO much smarter than jack and sunshine."  to which he replied pithily, "my name sounds so stupid."  to which  I  replied, "well, my name is  sunshine .  I mean, it sounds like my parents were on crack when the named me."  to which he just laughed.  and he also laughed when I told him my gpa was .004 below his.  hmm.  he's not v. nice.  lol.  he doesn't care what other ppl's ranks are.  only me and kailing and 2 and 3.  lol.  beD XTC: the first thing did asks.......what's ur rank dilapidatedshack: well dilapidatedshack: there's her personality for you dilapidatedshack: -___- dilapidatedshack: [can you tell I don't particularly like her?] dilapidatedshack: [ah, well] beD XTC: yes dilapidatedshack: do you like her? beD XTC: shes ok beD XTC: no didy's not telling me her rank beD XTC: -__________- dilapidatedshack: did you tell her yours? beD XTC: yep dilapidatedshack: give her your speech beD XTC: somewhere around 30 dilapidatedshack: it made me feel guilty as freaking heck beD XTC: it wont work on her dilapidatedshack: why? beD XTC: and only beD XTC: cuz beD XTC: ur a good friend and you actually feel guilty beD XTC: and actualyl...I dont really really care what her rank is...  haha.  how sweet.
