I finished some of them, but not all.. like that stupid ass music project. I hate it when she doensn't announce when we're to pass her projects!! Just because we always miss her class, doesn't mean that we're going to read her damned mind..   Anyway, tomorrow is a holiday; Hari Raya I think.. but our retreat is tomorrow, so we're going to go to school anyway. I'm not so excited.. I'm not really in the mood to 'open up', cry and stuff like that.. I hope I'm just in a bad mood. I don't want to end up ruining everyone else's retreat just because I feel like a pathetic bitch.I hate it when I feel like this..  It's during times like these I realize I need a punching bag...
