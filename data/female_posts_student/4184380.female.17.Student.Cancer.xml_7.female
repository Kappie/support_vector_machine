I used to get depressed when I was like this- but now I'm really not--- I find myself to be almost relaxed.  For the remainder of the night I am planning on watching some more episodes of Family Guy, painting my fingernails, and surfing through the channels. At three in the morning yesterday I managed to catch the music video for Rollover DJ by Jet. I was happy.  Tomorrow it appears that I am going to be driving my sister and boyfriend Andy up to the drive in to see however many movies we can before having to return home.  I have found myself to be addicted to music lately. All types, all the time, any place. Today alone I have burned.. 12 cds I believe. I discovered yesterday that I had a hidden stash of CDr's so I got to burning them. I have plenty of mixes now.... I'm beginning to think in musical lyrics. I'm going over and over songs in my head all day too. Oh just thought of a new song to download---- "Closer" by NIN.  Well I believe that is all for now.
