Was just trying to tell my parents about what I did in Canada, and I tried to be honest with them, and tell them how I was feeling and said that I found it hard leaving there and my Mum goes "well you know you didn't have to come back here if you didn't want to you know", I was like what do you mean by that? She said, "well if everything was so perfect in Canada, why did you come home? I mean if we are such bad parents, and if we do everything wrong, and if nothing is good enough here." I said where did you get that idea from, I was just saying that I had a good time.  My dad then said "well you don't have to go on about it, you always say how good everywhere else is, I mean what more do you want from us?"  Is it wrong that I had a good time?  Maybe I shouldn't have said anything to them. I just don't understand what I did wrong.  I feel real lonely.
