(Did you know that you could buy purple grape juice?) Sorry, just stumbled upon this website while I was trying to searching for homework answers, damn, still waiting to trip over them. WOW! Ricotta cheese lessens PMS!!! (Have to buy some for Izzy ;P ) Shh, don't tell her. No really... I'm in doodoo now. (Just kidding) I always have to say that so people don't think that I'm actually serious, and to tell people when I'm serious *well duh* Sorry, I've been writing a letter for the people in Russia I stayed with, and you kind of have to speak straight English to them. (Even though I'm not bothering) Yup, confuse them to hell, that's one of the 400 commandements I'm sure... Hehe, looks like I'm doing well on you! *Weirdo* I know, I know, I'm brilliant *freak* Well, minus the two extra heads of course.
