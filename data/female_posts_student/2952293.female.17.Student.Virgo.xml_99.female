The lady has not been paying me everyday, like she said she would. Which is causing her to not pay me the correct amount. Fucker.    Anyways, yesterday was time to see The Working Title (aka stupid-as-fuck Joel, who's hot and stupid and cool all at the same time). I also had to volunteer for the Young Voter's Project. That wasn't too exciting on my list of excitments, and I worried about Anna getting bored, but I had been told it wouldn't take long. Well it's a good thing Erica called me. I told her I was going to the concert, and she wanted to come, so Erica and Anna came over around 7. I was supposed to be at the club at 7:30, but my mother had hidden my backpack (with ID) and then gone out with the dog. So I drove around until I found her. Then I drove by screaming, "I'm going to kill you...Where's my backpack?...I'm going to kill you!" Great times.    We got there a little late, and I was screaming, "Come on, time is money!" So I had no idea who would be there and how I would find out what to do next. On Saturday, when Luke showed me the sign up sheet, nobody was signed up. And yet... who did I spy talking to kids?? LUKE! WHAHAHA just kidding! I mean he was there, and I may have a tiny little crush on him, but no Erica, I'm not going to hound in on himabout what's in his CD player! So I went and got my clipboard and signed up Erica and Anna. Then I signed up this girl that Anna had seen at a few shows, but more on her later. So I went towards the back of the crowd and Luke worked the front so we could meet in the middle. Then I got into a fight. I find this kid, with these freaky, blown-glass earrings ( I assumed were from Fenton Glass, yeah you know it!) and I give him my speech.    Guy: "Alright then, let's do it!"   Me: "Okay, let's do it."   Guy: "Yeah, let's do it."   Me: "Okay, this is really awkward now."   Guy: "Is it?"   Me: "Yes it is, can you just sign it?"    Later...    Me: "Just check the box for the issue that will most likely influence your vote."   Guy: "Well, I think I'm going to check other and write the issue that is most important to us all."   Me: "What's that?"   Guy: "Abortion."   Random girl wearing a potato sack: "Cause we don't believe in killing babies!"   Me: "Look, you really don't want to get into this with me."    Then we start getting into it...    Me: "Yeah, cause if I get raped, it just makes all the sense for me to have to keep that baby!"   Guy: "Yeah."   Me: "Listen, you are a guy, you don't even know WHAT you are talking about, and I don't want to hear it! Finish the pledge, cause now it is really awkward."      So there were two other bands playing (Noise Ratchet and Me Without You) who were Christian bands! No wonder I had a lot of Bush support and kids in cross t-shirts. After we hit the line, Luke and I went and sat to wait for Rose. We talked about the Chrisitan kids, and I was like, "No, I'm here for The Working Title, no Christian bands!" We started talking about music a little bit, and I slipped in Texas (Anna- we tell strangers on the side of the road) and he agreed to the love for the Warped Tour. Then I told him I him about my fight. He was like, "No I get it. But we are a peacful group." Dude, you do NOT test me on this issue, ESPECIALLY if you are a guy, so there will be no peace kept here! Then Rose came and yelled at me since I didn't go to the headquarters first. Fuck you, I'm a volunteer- you take what you can get! So we went inside and started to talk to lots more people. Anna and Erica came in, Erica complaining about the price, and then we ran into Saddler (the crazy kid who smokes pot with his mom) and oddly enough, he remembered me. That's a very rare occurance. They went to stand by the stage while I continued my work.At one point, I went up to this couple (who already talked to Luke) and he came over and put his arm around me and goes, "I'm sorry, I should have told you I already talked to them!"Later he calledme sassy. I left to go watch TWT. That girl Anna knew kept staring at me- seriously WHO IS SHE?! At one point, Erica whispers in my ear, "You can see which side their penis hangs on!" So, I started laughing. I laughed so hard, and at the exact same moment, they went quiet, so it was just me laughing. Joel's hair: did astrong wind current sneak up behind him? He goes, "Everytime we come here, we're sick. What's up with you people...always being sick?" KID IS SO STUPID. Then I continued my volunteering. I complained a lot to leave. Rose completely disappeared. Oh and she kept rubbing Ross (drummer from TWT) and I saw her use her sexuality to get people to sign the pledge! Eventually it was over. The ticket man looked like Steve Buscemi. I asked him why the smoking band hadn't taken effect:      Me: "Excuse me, sir."   Steve look-a-like: "Did you just call me sir?"   Me: "Well... I didn't want to be rude. I was just wondering why people could smoke in here after the smoking ban?"   Steve look-a-like: "It won't take affect for 60 days."  He raises his cigarette from under the counter    Me: "Uhh, not that there isanything wrong with your cigarette smoking!"   Steve look-a-like: "It doesnt' matter, I'm not going to stop!"      We tried to go get food with Saddler, but the place was closed. So we came back and Rose comes up to me and goes, "I thought you had left! I hope you don't mind that I got a beer. It's after work, but I don't want you to think badly about me!" Then when we finally did leave, she asked if I smoked! Joel and some guys had a dance-off. Then we saw this couple MAKING OUT HARDCORE. It was disgusting! When they finished, everybody cheered, but I walked by and muttered: "You make me sick." Then we went and got Wendy's and 5free five-piece chicken nuggets! SCORE! We watched some Drive-Thru DVD: "So she rolls up and I'm all, 'Take off your clothes!' and she's like, 'Why?' and I'm like, 'Cause that's what publicists DO!'"-Ace. Finally, around 4, we went to bed, only to get up at 8 so I could go babysit. When Erica was leaving, we hugged and she whispered in my ear, "Our balls are touching" then we rubbed our "man beards" on each other. Love those drive-thru bands!   Good times were had.
