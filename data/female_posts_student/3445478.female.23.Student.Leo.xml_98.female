I brought tons of pictures of Nick and showed everyone. There were a lot of babies there and I kept trying to guess how old they were according to Nick's size and  every  time I was wrong. Nick is  really really  big for his age. All the babies that were his size were at least 11-12 months old! I missed both Shawn  Nick like crazy, but it was good to be around people and to do work that I knew I could not screw up. Whenever I am taking care of Nick, I hardley ever know for sure what he wants or if I am doing things right. I am looking forward to him telling me  Shawn what is wrong or right or what he wants. I called G'ma Lu and before I dialed, I told Nick who we were calling. When the message beeped, I told Nick to talk to G'ma Lu...And he did! He cooed and talked for 40 seconds or so. Smart Boy! Last night Shawn, Nick  I went up to the Kallevigs for dinner on the grill. It was fun. We watched, Under the Tuscan Sun. I liked that movie. I want to go to Tuscany! Shawn and Nick hung out the whole evening, too. What a  super dad ! Today Shawn  Dave (future brother-in-law) are going shotting. I have no idea what Nick and I are going to do yet. Something fun!
