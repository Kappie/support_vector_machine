Maybe we shouldn't be seeing each other until we learn to respect each other. You're still keeping me in the shadows. I don't want us to become another Roger and ilynn. Always talking about God yet always repeating the cycle, falling into the trap the devil has so carefully camouflaged. I feel disgusted even to put their names on my blog.   For you, it's just pretty impossible for us to be only friends given our characters and what's been happening. But it's not only you. There's another.  But as for him, I want him to know. God comes first. God is number one.   Enough is enough. Yes. Frustrated, rejected, used. That's what it is.  Scared, lonely, empty. Is that how it's supposed to be? Fighting back but truly. The going is tough. Extremely in fact.  Would leaving me alone work? Probably yes.  Low self-esteem accompanied by the "I'm not worthy" feeling.  Take it Lord please. I can't handle this.   I'm a fighter and always on the defensive. Always needing to make sure that my position is established and safe. Pent-up emotions. Am I trying too hard here? But You have to change me before You can use me. I'm afraid of the dark.  Please show me a way out. Out of this never ending darkness.   I'm still a clay, raw as can be, ugly as it is, untouched, unshaped.  Lord purify this clay I pray, then mould it Lord, into a pot, a vase, a vessel, anything that You deem fit. Purifying is hard work. Strenuous.
