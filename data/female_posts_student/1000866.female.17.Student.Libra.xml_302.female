We were going to watch Sixteen Candles, but they didn't have it, which is ok because I've already seen it, so instead we got, Just Married. It was surprisingly...a lot better than I expected it to be. It was pretty funny. So, after that, we just kind of sat around and talked for a while. It was just a fun night with the girls.   Hmmm, I just figured something very cool out. Haha, fun. OK, I'm out of here. G'night everyone.
