I am going to drive on are paved road tommarow and I am so excited I hope that I dont crash. I drove up to are house and backed out of the garage and into the garage it is so fun. I am the only one who is excited about driving I have17 year old sister and she doesnt want to drive, plus she doesnt have time. She swims.
