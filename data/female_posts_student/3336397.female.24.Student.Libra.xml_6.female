Anybody who would be reading my blog would be like I am obsessed with the MBA. Could be true, lets say I am defending and hiding myself behind the mask of MBA.   You know I always wanted to project myself as sophisticated, porshe, classy and a very respectable women I don't think I am perceived like that at all.Anyways forget that , I have come this far and I still want to run. You know in this we are just faced with really hard choices in life and I guess that makes life really hard to live.   we all just strive to achieve the unachievable , if we achieve something now we want more and more and life just goes on we like pathetic human beings just are not satisfied eh by the way I know I am generalizing it so my apologies , there are some people who have risen above me and are contented.   Ambition is an aphrodisiac its like a drug once hooked you are gone but in a good manner according to me.Right now the feeling i am feeling are sad, scared, confused, tired and curious.I want to do so  much for myself , but then i question myself am i being really selfish , is that really me . I wish i had answers but there are no answers they are just choices which unfortunately either ways hurts people. Should i hurt myslef or should i hurt people and that my friend is the crux of life it is as simple as this basic choice u become selfish or you sacrifice there is nothing good or bad . It is just plain and simple life which is very beautiful but very surprising and cruel its just the way you want to take it.   Lot od philosophy , I will get back to my A4 sheet and make notes so take care and best of luck for the day
