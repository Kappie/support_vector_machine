I was suppose to stay after for Big Brother Big sister, but I didnt know that last friday was the last day. So at about 3:30 or so I went to let the dog in the house and I suddenly got a sharp pain in my hip... a  bad pain. The pain stayed and worsened. It was to the point that I couldnt walk... n I know this sounds gross but it took me a friggin half an hour to get in and out of the bathroom... it hurt that bad. I couldnt bend or do anything. Sitting down hurt, laying down hurt and walking hurt so basically I always hurt. My mom brought me to the doctors... n all we know now is that it has nothing to do with nerve damage and nothings broken. However I may have an infection from my back surgerys I had a few years ago.. when I had rods put in.. but I'll pray that thats not the case.. even though I'm not that religous...lol. So I got home and ended up falling asleep on my bed while watching tv... and I woke up in pain... again and it made it difficult for me to fall back asleep and than i had to go to the bathroom again.. Damn urine... lol. So I ended up falling back asleep again, and when I got up at about 8... i still fuckin hurt. So I ate breakfast and just tried to relax as much as I could. Anyway, hope my back feels better and that for once i figure out to use this damn thing... lol.
