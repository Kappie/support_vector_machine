If you've seen Evil Dead II, just think of the part when Ash realizes the bridge is down - that's the NO there. Haha that's like the best part of the entire movie. Except when he trapped his hand and weighed it down with books, the top one being "A Farewell to Arms" Hahahahahaha. That's the best part. That's so clever. I love that. Anyway. About Statesmen Day. My sister is driving me to school tomorrow and I think she's staying. So I don't have a ride home. I'm going to cry. I don't want to stay. Social-anythings makes me unbearably uneasy. I have to BEG my sister to take me home.  I still don't understand the day 'counting' for absenses or whatever. That's stupid. Please please please. I don't want to go to Statesmen Day.   I've been thinking about this one thing that's big in my life. Something I can't quite figure out. I don't like talking about it though. But...it's something I do and it's not good...but it's also not exactly bad...as I've been thinking. It's not all that wrong...And I'm trying to change it and stop it but...I am happy with the way it is now, so why should I bother stopping? I mean, I know I'd be happier when I stop and fix this problem, but...I'm not hurting anybody by what I'm doing now, and I'm not completely unhappy now...so...I don't know. I'll have to think about it more I guess.     Music: Agenda Suicide - The Faint
