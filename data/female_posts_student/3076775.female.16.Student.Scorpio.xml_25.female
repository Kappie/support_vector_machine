I just got back from the movies. We went to see Van Helsing. I took someone with me. Yes, I suppose anyone who reads this on the regular basis would expect Nick to have been the one to go with me. Nope, wasn't him. Though, I was GOING to invite him to come with me. He wasn't home, so I asked Charlie. Nothing personal, Nick. I know you've got other things going on.  There was a tornado last night. The tree in the back yard on the property line got alot of the branches blown off. The tree beside our house has a big branch ripped down. Other than that, we didn't receive any damage. Though, all these people around us did. There were plenty of uprooted trees on Wooley Springs Road, as well as our road.  I'm afraid that the reason I haven't blogged much lately is because I'm becoming depressed, or I'm REALLY incredibly bored. I'm trying my best to get over it, but it's hard. I mean, all I've been wanting to do lately is sleep. Probly I'm just really bored and I feel isolated from my friends. I just wish I had someone to talk to over the summer, that's all. I'm not trying to put a guilt trip on anybody, I just felt like getting this out of my system. Ah well, I'll get over it. Sorry to bother everyone.  Umm, I promise to blog more cheerfully tommorrow. I will!!!! really! lol, tootles all. Love, Shannon Today instead of a quote, I'm going to pose a question. Anyone who reads can answer if they want. Just to get people thinking a little while out for the summer. Question: What are you most afraid of?
