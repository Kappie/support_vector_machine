But for me it sucked I spent it looking at the weather network site making sure the weather was crappy for all the losers at my cottage... My own brother told everyone not to tell me about everyone going up because he doesn't want me there he even told my parents and they went along with it... He said he cant stand me and his girlfriend who was once one of my closest friends (until she met my brother) told me that since she and my brother are getting married she cant be my friend... Lucky for me I have people in my life who although they may not be related they act more like family than people who share the same genes. maybe one day I'll show all of them I am far better than they think... Too good to be associated with such childish behavior
