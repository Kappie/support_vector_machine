All is well at the moment, and [yay!] it's going to rain today [and throughout this week and next week].  Quite irritated that I was awoken by a storm at 7 this morning [after only 3 hours of sleep], but oh well.  Warmoth has processed my custom guitar parts order, so I'll have my parts by mid June.  I rearranged my bedroom, and I've worked on a new house design.  Been busy, but life is good.  Well I must run now, but I just wanted to update you and let everyone know how I was doing [Sharona's probably the only one who will read this, if not the only one interested in seeing how I'm doing].
