Only 10 messages from Ky, et al, "Hi Mag, where are you?" or "Hi!  Where's Mag?"  And finally I got where I was going... Diso!  I begged and bartered and convinced Ani that it would be in his best interests to journey out to suburbia to pick my ass up.  He called me from the Gardiner whining already about the traffic!  Yeesh, as if there was anything I could do about it except commiserate!  And shock me, shock me, shock me, if that sweet boy didn't waltz up to my door with flowers!!!  Like, when was the last time that a boy brought me flowers???  Beautiful lillies, and I kept thanking him for them and he kept thanking me... for what, I don't know.  He was very disappointed that my parents weren't around (they were in bed, shame,) but at least my doggy was there to greet him.  Yeats actually barked at him when he came in!  (My poor ignorant puppy is a little afraid of people with dark skin...)  But they made friends soon enough.  It was adorable, actually.  Yeats loves tall men, almost as much as I do, and when we left I think Yeats was more sorry to see Ani go than me.  When we finally got to the James Joyce, things were a little shaky at first...  Finding Ky was no easy feat, for starters.  Then there was the matter of shaking off an annoying little hustler who had taken a liking to  several  of the chicks in our group.  ( "Are you Norwegian?" )  He did  not  know how to take a hint.  When he very nearly got into a fight with a group of Ginos (read: greasy hair, shirt collars upturned, very shiny shoes, and  attitude ,) Ani asked me if I thought he should go over and help the guy out, but the female verdict was unanimous: if he got his ass kicked, he probably deserved it.  The ovary-bearers can be cooooold-hearted.  I know it.  And can I say I got D-R-U-N-K!?!  I had a fabulous time hanging out with my girls, and it was made only more fabu by the handsome boy I had hanging out with me.  He was so sweet and affectionate.  And for all the yuppie he is, he fit in perfectly.  He's just one of those guys.  I've gotten the impression from looking at all his pics of his travels that he really is one of those people who can fit in anywhere, he can make anything work for him, he can make friends with anyone.  Ani's just awesome that way.  All the same, I think we may have gotten our first "looks."  There was an older gent in the bar, and he was absolutely intoxicated (either that, or so numbed by years of practice that he just looked like it,) and he kept staring back and forth between Ani and I.  Never said a word to us, just a light sort of smile on his face and these looks at one of us, then the other, and back again.  Whatever the look was, it didn't appear to be at all hostile, but it creeped me out nonetheless.  Ani plays the race-card with me all the time.  I can't tell if it's him or me--I mean, he says he does that because it makes me uncomfortable and he likes getting a rise out of me, but...?  I have to admit, Ani is the first guy I've gotten seriously involved with who was of a noticeably different ethnic background than myself.  (Ani says that Peter, the Polish Prince I dated, doesn't count because he's still white.  Though I argue that Peter's  practiced  culture is a heck of a lot more different from mine than Ani's, but whatever...)  I don't know if I really understand.    After last call, we took off.  We had to take a cab, he would not let me walk "Do I  look  like I belong in this climate???"  He asked me.  (Ahem, Ani, weren't you born considerably further North than I?  Just asking...)  Although, it's true.  He can't take the cold.  His condo is always ridiculously hot, which is fine for mackin' the ladies and gettin' them to shed some layers, but is a little uncomfortable for a casual hang-out temperature.  Ky, who has been an envious sort of supportive about me getting together with Ani ("You bitch!  Hee-hee!  You're gonna have seyex!")  told me as we were leaving that all the girls were stoked about me  Ani.  Yeah, me too.  We got back to his suite, and he almost immediately rolled one up.   As if being drunk off my ass wasn't bad enough, now we're going to throw pot into the mix, too???   It actually had more of a sobering effect than I thought it would.  We looked through all his pics from France, and I got really...um...nostalgic.  OK fine, I got a little teary-deary thinking about how far away some of my favorite people in the world are.  Mark's in France, BJ's in Rome (or is it London?), The Brit's in Amsterdam, and my best friend Bridget is all the way in Oz!  It was just too much, and I actually even let a few tears loose.  I don't think he saw them, which was good, because I didn't want our night to turn into a sobfest.  It came time for bed, I didn't waste any time.  I shed my clothes and scooted under the covers, feeling absolutely more comfortable with him everytime we're together.  Our pillow-talk slowly dropped off, and I thought he'd be dropping off slowly too, but hormones are what they are.  I still can't get over how much I love being with him that way.  He fills me up just right.  And that night there was no hesitation, it was just so pleasant. OK, that's perhaps little more bland than I actually feel--in fact, he friggin' rocked my world.  I breathed hard and moaned softly and raked my fingernails up and down his back, and bucked and squirmed.  And when he whispered in my ear how wet I was and rocked a little harder, a little deeper...I came again.  He kisses me when we make love, my face and my neck and my lips... oh my, it was lovely.  How's that for un-bland?  I don't remember falling asleep on Thursday night (which was actually Friday morning,) but when I awoke at nine a.m., his whole place was full of light and warmth.  It was incredibly reassuring and pleasant.  I want to wake up there again.
