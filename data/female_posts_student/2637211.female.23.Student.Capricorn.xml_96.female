Liz and Dave eventually made it over and after Melissa shooed us away so she could prep for Mike's impending arrival, we headed to my place for pizza and irish car bombs. I'm still recovering. I haven't been so drunk in quite a while... I seem to get pleasantly buzzed fairly often, but I don't drink like that very often. Anyway, we adventured around Davis a bit and talked a lot... I made overly frank, candid comments about nearly everything, and apologize now for any offensive things I might have joked about.
