She is in the hospital; she is way back in Gulfport, Mississippi, and I am way up here in New York, and it's driving me crazy not to be there for it.  It's a serious thing; she's going to be there all week, and she's been subjected to all kinds of tests, and they still can't figure out exactly what is causing what's wrong with her.  She's sick, and I'm scared.  She's my mother, the person who is supposed to take care of me, and she is way too young for something like this to be happening to her.  And I can't get by without her, at least not anytime soon.  I know there comes a time when we have to say goodbye to our parents, but we never want it to come, and this is certainly not the time.  I still have so much more to learn from her, so many more days to spend with her, to get to know her better, and to see our relationship grow.    Anyway, if you're prone to praying, then throw a little one her way.  Her name is Cheryl Black, and she's an amazing woman who gives so much and gets little in return, but none of that even matters, because no one deserves this.  I mean, she is going to be fine, at least for the semi-immediate future, this much I know.  The prayers are more for getting her to take better care of herself, to get her to quit smoking, and to keep her alert to things like this when they happen in the future, so that she will be able to catch them before they get too bad.  She wasn't even going to go to the hospital when this whole thing began.  My father made her go, and in doing so, he saved her life.  The prayers are that next time he won't have to, that she'll be willing and able to do it herself.
