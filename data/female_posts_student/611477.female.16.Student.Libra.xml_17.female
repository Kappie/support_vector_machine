Current music: "Uncle John's Band" - Jimmy Buffett.)  Update on previous post: Second incarnation completed!  (In Mr. Burns voice) Excellent....  but it doesn't seem too photo-friendly; the neck part seems frighteningly short, though it fits fine.  Now I've got to make myself a decent thing to wear over it. :)   In other news, though I haven't finished #4, I've started on Mystery Tank #5.   (Notes on the numbering system: Mystery Tanks and Mystery Not-Tanks are grouped together because often enough at the start I haven't decided on sleeves yet.  What a mystery!)  Mystery Tank #5, so far, is being knit top-down.  During the diversion of the last post's project, I realised... hey!  Garter stitch actually looks kinda cool!  But busy.  So for this tank, every other "wrong"/purl side, I'm knitting a row... kinda interesting.  (Let's see if I'm still saying that when I'm wearing it!)    I'm actually considering making this halter-like... how well does knitting unravel backwards from a provisional cast on?  Meh... braining for another day.  I'm at the front short rows for this thing now... maybe I can actually "hide" the wraps decently, not twisting all the stitches.      ---> Or should that be       \|    -?  Anyway, status bars updated.
