I grew up listening to country music because both my parents listened to it. I could sing every word to Tim McGraw's "Don't Take the Girl" and absolutely loved anything by Garth Brooks or John Michael Montgomery. My first concert was Joe Duffy at Cheyenne Frontier Days, my second, third, and fourth were John Michael Montgomery, Jo Dee Messina and George Strait. It's probably my Wyoming upraising but whenever I feel depressed I switch to a country music station...since no one reads this, I guess my secret is safe.  I think that I am the type of person who will end up cheating on their spouse, boyfriend, whatever. I read  urlLink this  blog quite often and am completely enthralled and captivated by the lifestyle.  I think it would be thrilling and exciting having two lovers who have no idea about eachother. I don't see anything wrong with it. I suppose that could be a problem in the future.
