How Come.. we dont even talk no more      And you dont even call no more      We dont barely keep in touch at all      And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more      And I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin Now      After all the years we been down.. aint no way no how      This bullshit cant be true      We Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!         We were so young     So full of live and vibrance      Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went      So close, almost some bonnie and clyde shit      When Ronnie died  you was right by my side       With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes      And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it.     You even had the same childhood I did...    Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours    And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it     We grew up, grew apart as time went by us...     And I blew up to both yours and mines suprises.     Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it      much as your pride tries to hide it. you're cold      Your touch is just like ice.      And your eyes is a look of resentment.      I can sense it and I dont like it.            How come ...we dont even talk now more      And you dont even call no more      We dont barely even keep in touch at all      And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more      And I heard it through the grapevine...We even beefin now      After all the years we been down...aint no way no how      This bullshit cant be true      We family...aint a damn thing changed...unless its you            I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the satan in your lies,      Aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise.      (HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?      (AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?      And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away,      We barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face.          I want an explanation...you're gonna have to talk to me about this for real! Its not gonna end like this and Im not even playin. I've tried to call, I've tried to make it work and it ends like this....HELL NO, im NOT gonna stand back and kiss something this amazing good bye! IT AINT GONNA HAPPEN!! I want you to read some of my other blogs, just in case you didn't get it the first time....
