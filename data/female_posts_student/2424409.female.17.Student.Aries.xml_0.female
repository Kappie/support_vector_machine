I have been having issues...just with my lack of sleep and lack of understanding in the school work departement, mostly math...and then there is stupid people that i can't stand lately and want to make disappear...  I hate stupid people, with a firey passion, i wish they could all just get a life and stay out of mine, they are so nosey and stupid, and have nothing intellegent to say, it pisses me off and they bring the hate on themselves, and they think their so cool, which is quite pathetic...  I want to get a job... I have been handing out resume's and letters of recommendation, but I seem to be having no luck in that departement..It sux...I've been trying to print more, but have been so busy that I haven't had time...  I have been asked to return to myvolunteer experience job... they loved my help and enthusiasm...but Im really busy with the things that are going on and have not much time for a life...Im drinking right now, so im not thinking too straight...  Well I must be going for no I'll write more later possibly tomorrow  ~Nicki~       You are going to Marry Josh Hartnett. He is really shy, but don't let that fool you.
