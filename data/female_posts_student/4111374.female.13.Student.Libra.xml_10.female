Well its like when you have no ankles becoz your legs are so like, fat, that your bottom-leggy-bit just goes straight into your foot...not a pretty site.   So the first thing I noticed about this word is that it has the word 'ankle' in it...WHY??? why should ankle be part of the word if it isnt even part of the body part....people who have kankles have NO ankles. If there's no ankle on the leg, there shouldn't be an ankle in the word...should there??   The second thing I noticed was that the bit in front of the 'ankle' bit was a 'k'. WHY??? There is no 'k' in fat...there is no 'k' in obese...there is no 'k' in overweight....I AM SO CONFUSED!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?????   Who invented the word kankle becoz whoever it was i am going to smack their bottom.
