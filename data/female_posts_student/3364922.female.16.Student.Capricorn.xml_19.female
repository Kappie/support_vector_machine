Values, media, billboards, themes, attitudes,SWAT codes (symbolic, audio, written and technical),all that crap. I also had work studies today, and was notified of a couple assignments overdue, oh well. I'll work on that later. hmm I had human biology- a test tomorrow on gaseous exchange (the respiratory system, its structure, and functions of its structures).umm yeah. That should be fairly easy. I had maths, which was extremely boring. Yuck. I hate maths,   I had art today too, one of my favourite subjects. not today though  I have a tonal portrait over due and the teacher is pissing me off by asking for it, BUT she's the one that fucked it up in the first place. I had it finished the way  I  wanted it, but  noooo , the eyes weren't good enough, the shirt wasn't good enough, the paint wasn't light enough. So she decides to try and fix it herself! She scribbles all over it with texta, saying that 'this isn't right', or 'that isn't right' or 'this could be better'   bah. It's my work, I was happy with it, and now I have to paint over the bloody thing again.   grr.  *grumbles some profanity*  apart from that, my day was all well and dandy. A tad cold, but I got my walk the night before, my walk home from school, and my netball game (which we won) at six.  *grin*
