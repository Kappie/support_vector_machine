Butwe are in the first group to present, then was like everything was fast, and i didn't even elaborate page by page for the website... luckily, the tutor made a copy to take a look at that himself...   Wasn't feeling very good b4 the presentation, someone said somethings which makes me know what real friends are for... Might be a joke, but it ain't that funny anyway...( *note: I'm angry with that someone!) Then you all will think that I'm petty, but those who know me well should know that I not a person who can take these as a joke.   But after reading those comments from my friends for my previous blog entry, I'm glad that I still have them with me... You all brightens my day. Anyway, who's annoymous who wrote a comment? please tell me who you are... It's nice knowing that thepeople you cared for, cares for you! Take care, my friends!   Also, to those from Jyss 4E3, sorry that the bbq on 7th August is cancelled... Ms Teo's not free lah... Maybe,we can meet for dinner or lunch some other time?
