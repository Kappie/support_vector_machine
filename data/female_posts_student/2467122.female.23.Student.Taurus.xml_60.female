Supporting ethics, human dignity and the civil rights and liberties of all people (except Red Sox fans) has always been my downfall.  I just signed up to  urlLink volunteer  to help the Kerry campaign.  We all know what a big fan of politics I am.  I actually read his stance on the issues (especially Education- ahem) and I have to say that I approve.  We'll see where this goes.  I'm sure as it gets closer to November I will have a lot more to say.  I definitely like John Edwards- another do-gooder- and like the fact that there is attention being paid to the marginalization of poor Americans in this country.    I think that this will be a very eventful year.  You had all better  urlLink register to vote - I MEAN ALL OF YOU!!!  P.S.  I should have realized my destiny sooner- I  do  have a deeply rooted love of Donkeys!!!  (Hi, Eeyore!!!)
