Wait, before that I hung out with my mom. I remembered seeing, at Walmart,  Harry Potter  for like 6 bucks. So we went there to buy the fourth one. But those low, low prices made us go crazy and we bought out the whole store! I needed a bunch of stuff for Texas, and my mom ended up getting it along with everything else, that was nice of her. But the store is under construction so the entrance wall is kind of blocked off and there were so many carts, a visible path of entry could not be found! There was a worker standing there, doing absolutely nothing, so I asked her, "Isn't it your job to be friendly?" BEEYATCH. Towards the end, I began to get dizzy and light-headed from too much exposure to those low, low prices. I had to be taken out of the store. My mom and I discussed the Olympic torch. She said it had left California, but I didn't know it traveled across the world. I asked her how it got across the ocean, and she said, "Well, it goes on a boat. But they have to keep running in place." GO MOM! We went to this pet place and played with kitties. They were so cute! Then I went to Elizabeth's. We drove to Blockbuster and Meijer, and whenever we passed a man we yelled "Happy Father's day!" Many just scowled like they do to their own kids. Then I yelled it to this like 12 year old and was like, "Happy father's day, now come visit your kid, damnit!" That was good. We got crrrrazy at Meijer's. I chewed a dog toy and ran around. We rode a pony for a penny. Then we went to the castle park (aka not as good as UA's) but that was fun. I made up a song: "Happy, Happy Father's day. Happy day for you! You're bald on the top and round in the middle. Happy, Happy Father's day. Happy, Happy you!" Back at Liz's shack/really nice bedroom we watched  Abandon  again, since that's like our movie, but it was boring. Yes Erica, you figured it out. "SET OF ABANDON!" Then we watched the Early November DVD, hehehe I love you. Then we watched, here it comes the one I'd been waiting for....  Y Tu Mama Tambien" . OH MY GOD. I wanted sex and I got so much s-e-x I absolutely NEVER want to do it! First scene: sex, porn, completely naked woman completely naked man. Sex over here, sex over there, then Saba and his first experience with group sex! WHAHAHA. We had threesomes, we had two somes, we had fastsomes (aka the boys blew it real quick), and we had, my ever-so favorite, GUY ON GUY action! WOO HOO! It was hot as shit.  We watched the Fall Out Boy DVD and that was funny. Then I watched some stuff on the computer, that was good. We went to bed late. And I got up at 8... I was late to babysitting at 9 cause 270 was fucked. Then I babysat for five hours. I thought I was going to die. They were okay, but oh god, then this girl comes to be tutored and her sister is there to wait. So she played with the kids and me. Kid's name is also Allison and she was like, "How old do you think I am? Are you ready for summer? Are you in college? Are you anxious?" Anxious? Anxious for you to SHUT THE HELL UP YOU LITTLE FUCKER. Well that's it.  I leave for Texas on Wendesday. This will be my last entry for a week or so. Wish me fun! Let me know if you want a postcard!  P.S. I just bought a Harry Potter wand at Target.
