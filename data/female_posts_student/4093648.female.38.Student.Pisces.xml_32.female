When his thoughts or memories become too overwhelming or distracting he can extract them and place them in the pensieve. Then he can reflect on them when he's ready and not have his brain force them on him the way brains will often do. I thought that was such a great idea. I would love to be able to take troublesome thoughts out and store them somewhere so that I could get on with my life and get things done.  I've never been good at banishing my thoughts to the back of my mind where they won't get in the way. They are much too persistent.  The more emotionally charged the memory the more insistantly it taps on my shoulder demanding attention. The idea of plucking it out and locking it in a box sounds like heaven. Like an annoying dog that won't go lay down when you're trying to get something done. You can put it outside. But the thoughts in the pensieve can't howl and disturb your neighbors.  If someone can figure out a way to make a pensieve the whole psychiatric industry would go bust.
