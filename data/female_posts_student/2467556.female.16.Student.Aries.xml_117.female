I agree with NHL.com, Tampa Bay needs to stop relying on their goalie so much same with Calgary.  Masengill wants me to get Britty to hook us up with World Cup of Hockey tickets....although i tried to explain to him that i don't think its going to happen....  Senior Awards were today!!!  While everyone else found it boring, i found it very entertaining and borderline depressing.  I mean, a) i'm watching all my senior friends get recognized and i'm seeing my boys for one last time, b) in roughly a year, we'll all be doing the same thing!!! Oh and Jimmy got recognized for DECA, very very proud of him!!!  Cavanaugh (John, if you don't call him by his last name like i do) also got recognized for something, although i don't remember what.  haha me and Sarah are going for the "blanket award" lol!  Jessica broke up with her boyfriend today.  They went out for a month and a half and he never kissed her and barely held her hand.  So not totally right for Jess.  She broke up with him because she started liking another guy and she felt that it wasn't right to continue to go out with Kurt while she liked this other guy.  Makes perfect sense to me!  But Kurt YELLED AT HER!!?!?!  Seriously, if you saw this kid, you would be like "whoa, he has the capacity to yell at people?  really!?!".  And he was all telling Jess that people were going to hate her for breaking up with him.  um.....not really considering that alot of people such as me, Britty and Stewie were telling her to go out with this new kid anyways.  Psh, way to be mature Kurt.  Speaking of maturity, there are alot of people i've noticed lately that really REALLY need to grow up and get some balls.  Not going to say any names, but they just need to eventually and i wish them the best of luck in trying to do so.    only 4 more days.....  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
