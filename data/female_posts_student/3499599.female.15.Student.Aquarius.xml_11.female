And I'm sure Alexander will join him soon at looking at the screen so..forget that.  Journalism Camp is fun. Uh...coming here for literary magazine was the best idea I've had in a while, I suppose. And Justin just said it wasn't my idea, and now, like I knew he would, Alexander is looking at the screen. Ok I need to end this.
