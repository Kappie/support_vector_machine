Okay so we're goin out for a couple of months now already and he got home from Atlanta and had 2 days untill he left to go to D.C. We planned on doing something at least one of the days before he left again. So he gets home and calls me at like noon.. We keep talking for a while and then he says hes really tired and hes gonna take a nap unless I wanna do something. So being the kind person that I am (haha) I tell him that he can go ahead and go to sleep and we will just hang out the next night. So then the next day he calls me a couple times and then around 4:00 he says hes goin over to his friend Brandon's house and then they are both gonna come over and then we can kick it. So I'm like okay just call me when you get over there. So he says okay.. and then..  HE NEVER CALLS BACK ..Not even before he leaves for D.C. the next morning. I was really upset.. Actually I still am as you can probably tell.. So then hes gone for two weeks and I think he is coming home in like 2 or 3 days.. I'm not even sure. We'll see.. He probably won't even call me when he gets home again, ever. What a  greaat  boyfriend huh?       Whatever, now I'm all upset. Gotta get him off my mind- PEACE.
