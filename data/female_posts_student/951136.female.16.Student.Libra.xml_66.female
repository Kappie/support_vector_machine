( totally lack of time. i knew how to do it damnit.) so ya know, and thats only the ones i KNOW i missed, so i needed a 95 on that test to make a b for the six weeks...cha...exactly. so i need to make an 85 or higher on the alg semester final to feel a B for the semester... chemistry i had a bloody 74 in...i'm fucked as hell. i have no clue why. tho i didn;t turn in a lab. i dont htink i finished it. so i'm scared to ask him about it b.c. if he offers for me to turn it in as a late grade, i wont have it done...sigh. so I should fucking be falling apart. and OH yes! exactly! that song is HIGHLY how i feel it was all fun and games. AND THEN! EVERYONES going to be like, hey see those girls. they stalk me. NO WAY! MEE TOO! I KNOW! i see them always looking at me! YA! in the halls she starts at me! ya me too...i mean, flint-nick-jeremy-jessica-kai-kerri-travis-trye-corbin-nick c.- emily-alex- and i'm missing what, the rest of the ppl we ahve no clue what they're names are.....and they probably ARE all friends. or linked together by the same friends! nick knows corbin who knows nick who knows kia who knows kerri who knows flint who knows jeremy who knows jessica who knows alex- who with OUR luck knows trye and travis! tho i think we're save with them.  wow...suddenly you realize wow, and thats minus micheal, and scott, and shareef, and dave, and ....sigh.....am i going to have to go into hiding? damn. soo, ya. i should be depressed. but i'm not. and i know i have the next 96 hours of studying hell, but, idk, i'm brain dead. so lets just fail them all and get on with it. but then its christmas, and i hate christmas light. SPECIFICALLY chistmas LIGHTS!OMG!! i was putting them up adn the latter started to slip, so i grab on to the tree and freeze- i'm terrifed its going to fall and scrape this side of my face off as i slide down. and my moms in the garage still getting more lights. and my neighbor comes home and gets out of his car and sees me. and runs over, not sure whether it was because i looked like i was in mortal danger or just b.c. w. one leg around the tree and one on the latter, was somewhat of questionable position.so either pity or hormones- the reason for his coming is in question, but none the less, he was like, do you need help!? and held the latter so i could up right myself...that was nice. so- i'm never putting up christmas lights again. and i hate the word christmas its hard to spell fast........i'm going to go watch a movie and waste time...sigh...and practice over and over again and depress myself even more....they're going to move cheryl up... i know it...  :*(  "can't bare to face the truth so sick you cannot move and when it hurts he takes it out on you  and lately i'm not hte only one i've said never trust anyone Now everythings about to fall apart i wont be the one whose going to let you down, maybe you'll get what you want this time around the trick is to keep breathing."  blargh...sigh....
