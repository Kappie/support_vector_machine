We spent the day dying of heat and complaining about the mediocrity of our romantic lives. Yeah, Kelsey likes this guy who she can't stop talking about and he sounds adorable, Anne just broke up with a guy that has turned into a drama king/ass and I like a guy who probably wouldn't spit on me if I was on fire. God, life is great! Actually, he might spit on me but then he would deny it later if asked. So now, here I sit in my basement thinking about how frustrating my life is. I bought this candle today which smells like laundry detergent and its awesome. It smells clean, and I love it. Although a nice candle in the scent of motor oil might be refreshing...only like 2 people are going to understand that. Why does everyone have to be so judgemental and play these little mind games that make me want to pop their little heads off? Ugh, why can't things just be how I want them to be. Oh, in better news, 2 days (not counting today) until the mission trip. I can get out of this boring state and have some fun. Maybe a break from my life will make me see how all of this crap really isn't that bad but for now, its awful.  ~Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to hide the bodies of those people I had to kill because they pissed me off
