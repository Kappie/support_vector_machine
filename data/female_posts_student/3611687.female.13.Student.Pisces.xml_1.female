It's called the 'Restaurant Project'. It is such a big project it is taking the whole term. There is much work involved. It is now due in two weeks.    At the start of my project on the paper it says, You have been given a large amount of money from a wealthy distant relative. Then it says , After searching you have found the old Dunlavon General Store and you have bought it. Then you have to set up the restaurant. You hire Pablo   the Painter and then you have to work out the area of the ceiling and walls of each room to be painted. Then you need to work out how much paint you need and what the cost is. Once that task has been completed you must work on the carpeting. You have hired Carrie's Carpets for       the carpeting. Then you have to work out the area of the amount of rooms that need to be carpeted. Then again you need to work out how much carpet needed and the cost. After  that  task is completed you need to get started on the tiling. You have decided to hire Toby the Tiler. Then again you must work out the area of the remaining rooms for tiling. Then like before you need to work out how many tiles and the cost.        Then you have to work out the furniture. You must work out how many chairs you will need and the cost of all the furniture. Then it says by now you have spent another $50 000 on kitchen supply and anything else needed.  So now you have to add up all the costs of setting up the restaurant: Painting, Carpeting, Tiling, Furniture and the extra $50 000. That total is one section completed.        Then you have to write adds in the paper for staff but not real ones. You also have to design all the staff's uniforms and it says that you have to write and invitation to a celebrity for the opening of your restaurant and a magazine reporter is coming as well and his name is Stew Dapple. You have to write Stew's report of the restaurant. You have to write duties for the waiters and you need to write 10 health and safety rules for all the staff.       At the end you have more maths to do. When your restaurant is up and running you have to work out how much you are going to pay the staff plus other expenses for the week and the icome and profit. By now you are finished.  My restaurant is called Arabian Nights because my dad is arabic. I am going to write my reataurant name in arabic. By now I am doing very well on my project and are very close to finishing it. I hope I get a good mark for it.
