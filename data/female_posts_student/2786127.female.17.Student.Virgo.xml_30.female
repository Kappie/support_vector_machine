I got hit on by my a substitute this morning, a "stifler/staci's boyfriend" look-a-like who told me I had an "infectious laugh" when we were in the library. He kept hoovering over me and asking me questions. creepy...he was shorter then me. and a teacher. meh, flattering none the less. I'm pathetic needing attention right now.  So I'm officially single now, if i wasn't before. I'd have to say after not having any contact whatsoever for a week with your boyfriend then you're definatly single. yep. Genie...I thought you were gonna hook me up bud... don't leave me to die in the arms of rapeface.  I went and got job applications today. woo work! woo money...the work not so much. I want to work at booster juice i've decided, it smells mega good in there and the lady said there was a good chance of ash and I getting hired because summers soon. so thats very excellent. Atleast thats out of the way.  More later? I need to go call Ben.
