It was a good ass thing I purchased parking tickets and luckily we didnt have to walk that far unlike all the others which have to walk miles away from the amphitheater. When we got into the amphithrater it was like a circus to me, so many people, so many stuff on sale, it was so exciting.   Got myself some beers and off we went to the lawn for our seats. While waiting for no doubt to come on, we stood right by these people who got into a fight, over what I did not know. But it got to a point where it was very exciting to watch, I pulled out my camera hoping to take some pictures of them, and then on second thought naw forget it, a lil voice inside my head told me not to, what if they turn and kick my ass instead what would I do then? I was a chicken, I figure they was on something because two chicks was fighting, they were just pulling each other's hair and punching each other. A few punches were to a point where I had to turn away it was so disgusting, they both were bleeding, and gosh that was nasty.   We moved towards the top and it was so cold. There were so many people out there that night. The show started at seven sharp. The first band that played, I didnt have a clue of who they were. Then blink 182, I didnt really like them, I didnt know any of their songs. Most of the time it was an associating moments for me, catching up with whats going on with friends that i havet seen in a while. I also ran into a few friends that i knew. Linda and the gang from Santa Clara, Richard and Amy from Vellejo, then I ran into Brendon and Georgette from San Jo. That was amazing, out of all the people there, I mean there were hundreds and hundreds of people but still I ran into people I knew which were totally kool. Took some picture here and there.   By the time no doubt came on, I couldnt even feel my toes and my fingers anymore, apparently, it was so cold, I wasnt just freezing I was actually frozen lol. It was a good thing Gwen Safani sang all the songs that i knew of, she sang songs from the single hits of 1997-2004. I was yelling, screaming, singing, dancing, jumping I was having such a great time. By the end of the night I think I lost my voice. Gwen was always at her best, she looks so incredibly good. Gosh, I love this bitch. We stay until her very last song, didnt want to get caught in traffic so we took off even before it was over. The show was great, we had one hell of a time, it was so fun. I'll do it again next time for sure....  Didnt get home until 11 somthing, then got ready to go clubbing at 1015. We didnt get in until 1am. We made it for ALCOHOL. Took two shots of remy, then I had an LC, yeak, then had a bottle of beer, I was good. While bumping and grinning, shaking my ass on the dance floor, this white chick came up to me and said you are one beautiful chick, very beautiful, I like you. Then she star at me from head to toe twice. I was like thankyouverymuch with a friendly hug then she totally grabs my ass. I was like whoa sugah. That came to my surprise. The club was cool but I was so tired. Dance for an hour, meet up with more friends by two thirty I was floored. It was boring to me, other times I would have so much fun but this time, I sat and watch everyone else dance, hving a great time. Left the club at three something, got home before four, shower and just crash.
