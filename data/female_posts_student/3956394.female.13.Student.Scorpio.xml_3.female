Well im thinking more then usual and trying things ive never done so i can say that im not sure about these headaches.What should i keep my mind focused on? Trying to be a goody goody and not get in trouble or trying to get home (Still at my cousins) and have some fun with my other friends? Im SO comfussed and i have no clue how to solve it.Since im having days were im friends with my cousins and days when we hate eachother, today is a friend day.Yesterday wasnt.. and probably tomorrow wont be =P I would concider it a pattern.But right now, i cant focus on that.I have to focus on thinking about what to focus on >.
