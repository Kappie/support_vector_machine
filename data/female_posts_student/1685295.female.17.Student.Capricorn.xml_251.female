The funny thing is that they are pretty similar. Anyway I didn't notice till like the last page that it wasn't adding up. LMAO Kazza Lite isn't my thing, not after it became horribly slow. Maybe that was just me... Limewire seemed to be fast, and thanks for the Aqualime, great thing. Man, I am now going to hit myself with a large piece of wood until I get smart...   PERSON: trying to start the essay tevren2k3: oh, i'll leave u alone, tell me when u are done PERSON: probably not until late PERSON: maybe tomoorow tevren2k3: u should really get started on it PERSON: i know tevren2k3: u've been putting it off for a long time PERSON: see u 2morrow tevren2k3: bye   Damn I am a dumbass, how the hell am I going to lose such a brilliant chance, damn I feel like such a fucking dumbass.
