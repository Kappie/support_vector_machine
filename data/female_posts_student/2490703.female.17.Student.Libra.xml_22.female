I'm going to miss them. Janell is a person that I can talk to and trust with my secrets. It's going to be sad when she isn't around. Ryan isn't even home today...I'm so BORED! Oh, I skipped work today, so that was nice. Maybe I'll get fired! WOOT! Well, I'd rather quit. I start my other job tomorrow, 8-5 pretty much everyday. It's crap. But I have to jet, I'll talk to you later!  Peace and Love, Melissa
