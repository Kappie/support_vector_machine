I have missed Alek so very much in the past couple of weeks and finally last night we saw each other. It started out weird and then it was soon as if we were never apart. We went to Barnes for a little while and when we were walking into the building I saw a friend of mine from Lonestar. She asked if Alek was my boyfriend and quickly I replied, "this is Alek." That was strange considering that in that moment I wasn't sure what he was and things went back to being weird. All night that strange awkward feeling would come and go until later that night when we got back to his house. I knew then that it was right and meant to be. Hopefully this feeling won't come and go. I will keep you updated as thing progress.
