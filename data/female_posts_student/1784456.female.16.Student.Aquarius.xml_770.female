It's like brushing my hair, it's soooo relaxing. (...Wow, I'm sure we wanted to know that!) Mmm... back to taking over the world I guess. Any way, back to buying a .nu (again!) I'm just gonna work out how to do the layout aaargh! I figure that all you need is Photoshop, Evrsoft (don't ask) and some very heavy things to throw at the computer when it doesn't work. (Why are you still here?) Mmm... I'm wondering the same thing!
