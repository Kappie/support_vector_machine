Rose..did not like her tinfoil hat.  I had told her how I had tried to call Aaron yesterday at one point and intercepted someone's call. She then ranted for a while about all the stray microchips in the atmosphere that are out to get us and declared that, once we got home (we were in the car), that she was going to make everyone tinfoil hats. It's..very interesting to observe my mom when she gets into these moods.  hm. I played tennis this morning. I won my games..blah blah blah. Nothing to be very proud of. I wasn't playing against people close to my own level of skill 'n whatnot. It was fun, though, beating the annoying 'lil boys.   "You can't hit hard! You're just a girl!" I serve. "Whoa. DID YOU SEE THAT?! That was so cool! She went like *whoosh* and like wow."  I couldn't stop laughing whenever I played against them. it was hilarious ^^; silly boys.  Ok I'm gonna go..write..stuff. Yeah. enh. need something to do.  Quiz stuff..
