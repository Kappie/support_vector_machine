It's not sexy.  It's not flashy.  It probably has a print run of 5000.  There's no need for sex appeal.  Really.    The cover image is actually kind of clever.  It's a woman (of course) holding celery behind her back to catch the salt she's throwing over her shoulder and the article it references has to do with "sodium sinners."  Okay.  That's fine.  But why does she have to be naked from the ass up?  Her pants are half-way down her ass, for that matter.    My boss was half-way across the room when she stopped, did an about-face and came back to inspect the cover.  We were thoroughly outraged.  Then Cort, the resident geezer, stopped by and I thrust the magazine into his hand and said, "Look at how NOT appropriate this cover is!"  He looked over it carefully and said:  "What's wrong with celery?"
