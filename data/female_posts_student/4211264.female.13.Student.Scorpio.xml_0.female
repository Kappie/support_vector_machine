Oh yeah, and when we were playing hide-and-go-seek, I was hiding in the shower, and someone walked in to go to the bathroom while I was still in the shower. I almost decided to go out, but then I would be a perv because their pants were probably already down. So I stayed in the shower, almost laughing at all of the farting noises, and almost barfing because it smelled like serious shit. My god, I'm never hiding in a shower ever again. NEVER. Right now I'm listening to Greenday, and the guy whos singing sounds hot. If  sounds  hot, think about how he looks... wow. One thing I hate about AIM, is when people put up an away message that says "I am away from my computer right now". Can you TRY to make a creative one? It's not too hard, heres one of mine  The average person goes to the bathroom about 6 times per day.... this is one of those times.  Creative enough. I gotta go now, do something more important, actually thats just an excuse to go away, since I'm to lazy to write more. See yous lata.  -Sierra
