I know why he's always on my mind: I keep thinking about him and the more I think about him, the more I romantacize who he is. I don't even know who he is! I'm making everything up and I'm falling for this awesome personality that I'm associating with Mark. Pathetic, yah? I think I'm also pretty desperate. I'm lonely and I need somebody, so I fall for the next possible guy. I kind of have little things for people when I first meet them because I see them as potential boyfriends. How pathetic is that? Quite. Ho hum. Hopefully Prince Charming will come and sweep me off my feet soon. I'm getting tired of waiting and my feet hurt.   And Dez. Oh Dez, what do I do about you? You're my new Wayne. I love you and I've only ever felt like this about somebody else and that was Wayne. It looks like our relationship is taking the same turn too. I liked Wayne SO MUCH and we talked a lot, but then he started dating Lindsay. I love you, in spite of all your imperfections, but now you'll probably end up dating Richelle. Why does this always happen? I know the answer. I always wear my heart on my sleeve and it's beyond me why I do it. Every time I get hurt. I get pushed to the ground, but for some reason I always get back up again. Maybe I'm stupid but then again maybe I just have faith in people and truly believe that someday, the right thing will happen. I hope that day comes soon, because I'm so tired of getting hurt.  So, to sum everything up: I'm in love with Dez. I'm in lust with the Mark I'm making up in my head. I think I'm crazy.
