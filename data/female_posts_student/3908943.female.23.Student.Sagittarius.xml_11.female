Actually I'm out in the boonies, but I have found ways of entertaining myself (playing with the dog, doing stuff online, using my minicam, etc).  I think I'm just easily amused.  Since I've been down here though, I've been sorta working on stuff for Model Illinois Government.  Mainly I've just been coming up with ideas and such, but that is nothing new.  I'm always calling the Speaker or emailing him new ideas of mine.  I don't like the politics as much as I think I like social reforms.  Or at least that sounded halfway smart.     I am ready to go back to school - it should be an interesting semester.  And I do say semester since I graduate in December (woohoo!). I better find a job soon though or come January, I'm going to be a homeless bum!!  I better find something with two bachelors degrees, didn't spend all that money for nothing.  I'm not going to worry about it though now, I'm just going to enjoy my last semester as a student ever (well for a while at least...).  Another wave of senioritis is coming,  I can feel it.
