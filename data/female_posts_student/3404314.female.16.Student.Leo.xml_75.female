"babae na ko!!!" joke lng un!!! im already speaking in low voice not like before.. as if i was shouting!!! mahilig na rin ako mag-smile.. pero pili pa rin!!! specially now, everybody takes a second look on my face coz i have this terrible-looking pimple on my cheek!! how i wish this would disappear tomorrow or if not,, sunday!!
