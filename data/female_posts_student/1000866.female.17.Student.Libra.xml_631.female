It's crazy how different last year was from this year. This summer's going to suck though. big time I'm going to have to say goodbye to so many good friends and...yeah. I don't know. I told Bryan something too. Something I've been needing to tell someone for a long time. It felt good to tell someone something I've waited so long to tell someone I really trust and, I don't know, it felt right telling him. Funny how things turn out. I didn't even think I was going to be able to be friends with him at all a few months ago.   Anyway, I forgot what I was writing about because I was disturbed by a barrage of IM's so, I'm out of here. Good night.
