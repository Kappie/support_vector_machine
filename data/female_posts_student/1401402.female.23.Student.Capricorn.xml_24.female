We've only known eachother in memories. I'm so tired but I cant sleep. My thoughts for you are so strong and deep. Fate has end our friendship!!! I'm suffering. You've took me for granted which I knew from the start but still I let that lead to a heartbreak. How was I supposed to know it will end this way? This must end and it has to end SOON. All I need is time, recoveries, alone, and drink you away. If your still reading this, I'm sorry for what I've done so wrong to you. I cant think of what but sorry anyways. I'll never fall into a situation like this ever again. This would be the last tears I will cry for you and let this be the end. I wont bother you ever again. I will never be good enough for you am I?  No phone calls and no e mails from you. I'm so hurt and thats all I can say.
