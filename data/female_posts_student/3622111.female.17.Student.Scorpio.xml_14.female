Col, your student ID is definitely my next target, and please remember i did show u my driver license!!! i will visit u some time after i get back from the U.S. for sure, it's reli nice over UST after all. and close to my new home, hohoho...i actually start getting excited about moving, probably coz it doesn't give me such a headache since i dun even have things to move there (all stuff are in the U.S. =P), it will be a big big trouble for my dad, can't even imagine him trying to move all his suits and ties and shoes and glasses and watches......  by the way, i am getting my Hong Kong driving license on wednesday, it's valid for TEN years!!! woohahahahahaha...i dun think just not getting into my car is safe enough, one of the first things i will do after getting my license is driving to u guys' homes and maybe running into them, kakaka...  oh god, just remember, i have not even STARTED packing yet!!! >  Col, about the party after u left, basically we had hot pot with sausages and fishballs, also salad by Christy's mom and chicken wings by Shell, Sarah and Mimi, i think i only had 1 sausage, 1 chicken wing and 1 bowl of salad, hahaha...we did not do much except taking pictures and watching TV, most people left at 8-ish, Mary, Shell, Victore and i left at 9-ish, but we were not even the last, woo...i was so scared that i would lose my voice today, yelled too much ^^"" and yer, Mary had a stomache last night (got up 8 or 9 times for the washroom at 3 or 4 in the morning?), we thought it might be coz of the food but no one else felt anything...probably she is a bit too sensitive ^^""  i did try to call u today at 10-ish, u did not pick it up though...anyways, call me back if u have time, have fun!!
