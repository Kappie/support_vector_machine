Enough about him. Tuesday well. passed like normally. Go bp, thn the scene flashed through. I remembered that day so well. I can never forget it. I can NEVER take insults from anybody, whether it's about me or my school or something else. Since then, I had never step in bp ever again. It's been like...half a year? Well. I can't get rid of my fears. Those pairs of staring eyes... I had done so much wrong in my life and I told myself again and again never ever to repeat the same mistake. I kept looking around and stayed in silence. Everything had changed so much within half a year. They didn't know what I'm thinking. Well, at least one of them dunno what I'm thinking. But everything had passed fine and well.  Then I'm thinking again. I had no idea why. But I had so many thoughts. Words had naturally formed in my mind. But I never exactly did recall the words anymore...Thoughts can be so complicated but thoughts are always silent and personal...
