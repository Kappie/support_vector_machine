Maybe for a feeling of accomplishment I will call Quill and Press to see if I got a job...Ok they're closed.  I talked to someone at least! And they know I'm persistent! =) I'm feeling kind of down right now I don't know why.  Maybe I need some caffine or to watch some tv or read my book...So, I'm off to do one of those things, bye.
