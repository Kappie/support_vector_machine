Sure I don't play with the kids, or really go outside much, sure I don't really like to answer the door, but there is a sense of community.  I feel asleep listening to the old couple next door mumbling in Greek, I love it.  I mean, no one else I can think of has that kind of opportunity where they live.  They live in silent seclusion, the noise of their neighbors drowned out by the sound of their air conditioning.  I admit, sometimes I would like to live in a house where I couldn't hear the neighbors fighting at night, or where no one's grass is overgrown.  But that just shows the impersonal side of me.  I like living in a neighborhood with character and heart instead of fancy architecture (although I do dream of a beautifully constructed home).  I should really stop complaining about where we live.  Mostly, I love it.
