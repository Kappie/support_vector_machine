FOR GOD SAKES WHY CAN'T YOU DIE NOW. anyways. i stole the computer, and up until about half an hour ago, i was having an okay day. spent most of it with meg... we went starbucksing cuz we're cool, and all that jazz.;0 and went to old navy and i got clothes because i can. and hmmm the carnival last night sucked so much. i don't think i've ever gone through an experiance like that one. i'm typing to fucking dilegently. if i turn around and they're making out, screw life. me and meg tried to come up with a philosophy about choking on life. and it started to make sense, and then it died. well, she killed it. maybe this is supposed to teach me something. but i doubt it. i think it's offical that he hates me and i have to get over it. i shouldn't be mad at meg, she's like my best friend, well one of them, and i'm always shunning her or something and it's not fair to her, and i always feel really bad. and i want to jump on them but then again i'd get shot. so whatever i'll sit and type. mr. deeds is on this is like the 3rd movie we've watched. i want to go out. i need more nicotine. roar i have one left i'm going to cry or something like it. i love this songgg. well i'm offically retarded or something like it because tears are like, filling my eyes and if they see me i am SOO screwed OVER. :) WOW I HATE LIFE MORE THAN ... ANYTHING. why must they really be. this is like my venting stage right here. i think i've tied like 80 string bracelets or anklets i'm ready to go make a choker or some sort. oh my FUCKING word. i can't be selfish. robin stop being a stupid bitch he's just a guy. that you just happen to be in love with. i... am so fucking retarded it's so cool. i'm contemplating going home. going out that window and in through my basement window. like, seriously. i want to go to my own bed. i just realized something. i won't be able to sleep. i didn't read those little dudes. and i don't have them with me. SHIT. i have to go home and sleep. and i need my cuddlingness. i could fall asleep in his arms if i could. ew. why must meg really replace me. i'd rather that faggotity dutch girl. no wait, no i wouldn't. i hate her too. i just watched shania. i love that woman she's so awesome. ew it's almost 5 can we like, unlock ourselves from eachother PLEASE. i'm done with this i'm gunna go mope. i know i know. you hate me. well, fuck you.
