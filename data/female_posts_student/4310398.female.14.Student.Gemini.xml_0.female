She printed mynew schedule out wrong, so she had to change it again. First hour was boring, and we got our text books!! On the first day of school... It sucks, you arelucky you don't go to my school (unless you do... then you're just as lucky as me!). Spanish is just boring on it's own! I hate taking foreign languages...Second hour was very very boring, the worst all day. It's english, and this is quite weird because I really like english. Third hour, math... We have all thevery loud and 'challenged' (I mean stupid people as in the ones who act stupid, even though they could (HAH) be quite (yeah, right) smart. Mainly jocks*shivers* and preps *shivers more*. They annoy me so much... Well, for the most part. They're always like "Oh - my - gosh!! Like, totally!!" And it getson my nerves, I just wanna' punch their faces in... Ahem... Anyways - fourth hour we had an assembly, which sucked! Housley (assistant principal)(gross)was lecturing us on "Wearing the same color frequently", which means he was talking to our group... Yes, us! A lot of the people in our 'group' (or what ever you wanna call it) wear black regularly, but we're all really quite nice! Housley is afraid we're all in gangs, and we're gonna come and blow his headoff... Which is freakin' absurd!!! I don't think anyone (well, maybe Hannah or Ashley (R) if they got angry enough... hehe) would do that.. *cough* *sneeze* *cough* Any-hoo! Ashley is getting out of (advanced) speech, and getting into regular, and I have to stay, which sucks pig ass! I only have oneclass with Hannah all year, NONE with Ashley (R) Ashley (J) or Kaitlyn!!! Ah!! This one girl in fifth hour (which I did get into Life Skills) seems pretty nice... So, I dunno.    I wanna go to Oneighty now.... Yeah, I think I wanna have a really short paragraph.. On to the next! Woo! There is someone that I deeply despise in my fourth hour speech class... Ashley (R) Hannah, Kaitlyn  Ashley (J) should know who I'm talking about. It'squite... Weird, because... I dunno why, it just is. There is another person in there that I don't really like either, but.. Anyways.. Dont'cha hate it when somepeople think you're their friend but your NOT? Sarah Harp probably does, because I am NOT your friend!!! Ah, I wish you would go away, I DO NOTlike you... Biatch... *evil smile* Hm.. Where's my butcher knife... Just joking, I'd only do that on a weekend! It's a school night...  (Just to warn you people... this is a paragraph mainly ALL about cute guys... So, beware! Lol) Ah geez... There's this really cute guy in Ashley (R)'s GT class, I wanna get in there so badly... I've always wanted in there, but I haven't taken the test yetbecause my delightful mother is choosing to procrastinate (yes big word... and I know it! In your face! ...Go look it up), which sucks. If you haven't noticed a lot of things suck.. Heh. Yeah.. And there's this other really cute guy, I saw him at school last week picking up his schedule... I saw him at the movies, and he conveniently (hehehe) sat directly behind me, and I saw him today at school. I don't know if he's in 8th or 9th grade from Lone Star, Allen Bowden or Pretty Water because I don't remember him from last year... He's really tall! Hehe. He even has the same shoes as me! *gasp* We both have (well, a lot of people have them... Including Hannah  Ashley (R)) Black, High-Top converse. But, I am thinking mine are quite a bit smaller... Yeah... In first hour there's this one guy (his name is Steven! I *smartly* figured that out when Mrs. Castillo called role! Hah) which is really cute! Heh. Yeah. Very nice, eh?  Travis is still in the hospital (obviously)... Poor him, I hope he gets better soon. Travis, if you ever read this.. You're in my speech class! :-D (uh.. short paragraph.. again.. just for you, Travis! lol)    Okie dokie, I think that covers today. Shall chat with thee tomorrow... Or something. Have a super-de-duper day! Toodles  ta ta for now!
