I am preparing for the foreign service exam (I'm not really optimistic about it, only 400 of 70000 are accepted), I just want to try. I am currently reading a book about Madeleine Albright (former Secretary of State) and her foreign relations policy. The book is a beast, but I rather enjoy it. If you are into really heavy reading about policy, it is the book for you! I am almost done... I am proud of finishing this one... wonder which one I'll start next...  I've been so nervous and stressed here lately about all sorts of topics, not limited to graduation, job and friendships, that I am practically having to take PeptoBismol (sp?) everytime  I eat... It sucks. I don't know how much more my poor stomach can take of this.  Nothing really new over at Fine Arts. Same old drama. On a good note - I had dinner with  Keith  on Friday night. It had been a while since I had seen him and it was good to catch up. I miss seeing him on a daily basis at school. We always have a good time hanging out.    Irene  is visiting this week during her spring break. I worry that I won't be able to hang out with her as much as she expects. I have a really full load. I got to talk to  Scott  this evening... always good. I miss having him around here. Consider this a shout-out to you! Finally, seems that  Rick  has something up his sleeve... he keeps talking about this "big secret". I can only imagine....   We have a VSO meeting coming up Thursday (damn it! I knew I had forgotten something). I'm stressing about this one b/c of the equipment and transportation issues that we are going to face this go around. My goal: keep Harding happy. Note to self: buy stock in PeptoBismol before VSO weekend.  That's it for now.
