Jenn: A Tale of Two Cities is haunting me!!!!! But i dont mind.  Carton: A Tale of Two Cities?  Jenn: The book by charles dickens that depicts the crulties toward the French Nobility during the french revelution.  You are one of the main characters.  Carton: I see.  Well, like Church i find the views about death very disterbing since i am dead.  Although at least i have my head, as it were, on.  Jenn: Thats good to know, expesially since you were beheaded.  Inuyasha: Ouch!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Good Day, mate.  Jenn: I am wondering, when i read the book i pictured Sydney Carton as rather like a proper Jack Sparrow.  Which means that he looks like Johnny Depp.  Which means that these two, Sparrow and Carton, look almost identical.  Inuyasha: I see it!   Carton: Weird!  CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow: Totally!
