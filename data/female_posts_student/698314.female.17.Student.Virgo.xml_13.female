There's only like 2 more weeks!  Im majorly slacking. All the sports teams are done (yes- even softball which finished shortly after my last post) so that means that athletic training for me in highschool is just about over.  It sucks.  Im going to miss it.  Even though I'm doing it in college, its just not going to be the same.  Im going to miss all the people and the jokes, the friends, the bonds, the late nights, early saturday mornings (weird yes, I know), the good times and the bad (man were there some frustrating times, but I think it just brought a lot of us closer together as a group).  Those people are like my family- I spend so much time with them.  It's really very sad.  It seems like now though, that schools wrapping up and sports are done, I have a lot more to do.  Yesterday I worked the 6th grade field day (as a student athletic trainer! :-D ), yesterday was also the NHS blood drive that I helped organize (so I had to be in at 6:30 to set up).  I missed all my classes yesterday, it was quite nice.  Tomorrow I'm missing class again because Miss C set up something so we could all get certified (or recertified in my case and many others) in first aide and CPR.  That should be quite fun.  This means I'll only be in class 2 days this week! wahoo.  Monday night is the Burlington County Student Athletic Training Senior Recognition banquet that we're going to.  That means I have to get dressed up... great!! Then Tuesday afterschool we're having a party for athletic training.  Wednesday night Im babysitting! Yea... pretty busy.  Aside from just these things, they bring more challenges because I have things to do to get ready for them, expecially the athletic training party.  It'll all be worth it though.  Other than that nothing else really has been going on.  I keep myself pretty well occupied although I must say it is weird comming home before 5:30/6.  Im gonna peace out of here... later
