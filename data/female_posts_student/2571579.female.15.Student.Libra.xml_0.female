As i rolled over in bed for the 20th time after that i heard the door open and the noise began.  My aunt yelled up, 'Casey no sleepin on the job' i wanted to sink into my bed and never get up...but i had to and now they're making noise and being annoying...What kind of a winter is this? The sun is blinding. It seems like spring already. I feel bad for the skiiers and snowboarders, which i would be one of but i hurt my knee, but i stil wanted to go up there and eat some of Montage's great food lol Well i should go before the kids destroy anything, later
