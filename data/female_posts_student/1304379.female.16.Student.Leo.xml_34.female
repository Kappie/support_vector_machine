My conversation questions were about drugs and criticism. If only it's about abuse or suicide. Owell. I wasn't prompted any questions for the first conversation [is it good?], and he didn't even allow me to say finish! Lan lan. Hahah. The second took a little longer.. Which is like I still wanna say the first one lor. I haven't even said a single  chen yu  yet! Haha.. In the end, I only used one, which was  guai wai mo jiao  aka beat about the bush.  The two examiners were so damn nice. Really. They are not as bad as I expected. Haha.. Male telling the female examiner, "Wow, what a bright smile!" [wah, hao can lan de xiao rong ah!] Anyway, the male examiner's mandarin was DAMN BLOODY seh! So cool! It sounds like those LC tapes we listened to.  Actually, I wasn't exactly smiling because I was happy or something, but because I was damn nervous la. Haha..  Both examiners were quite old. And lao shi told us that all the examiners that came today are YOUNG FEMALE TEACHERS. Liar! But I prefer male examiners really. They are more lenient to girls don't you think?  When I finished oral-ing [no pun intended], I wanted to JUMP! YES. Literally JUMP and SCREAM. Hahaha! It's this emotion simply inexplicable. Haha! I hope I'll be able to get a distinction man! Or a high merit at least! AHH!!  I'm still damn excited. Hahaha! Lit tomorrow. What a drag.
