My personal favorite is the rather large piece that broke off of the top of a very tall tree and landed partly on our garage, partly on our power lines. It's still sitting there happily - or at least it was when I left the darkened, hot, and humid house this afternoon for the creature comforts of the computer lab at school. The sound of chainsaws and woodchippers was all around the neighborhood, just not on our block. Hopefully they will have finished the cleanup by this evening. If not, then all of the food in the fridge and freezeris a lost cause.      When I came home to the carnage last night, Matt was there, and he said, "Well, let's go out to eat, maybe catch a movie, there's no point in sticking around here." The man does make a good point every now and again. So aftersome deep-dish and a couple of pints of Killian's (and by the way, if you'd ever like to see me turn into a really cheap date, start sending the Killian's my way,) we head on to the theater. Listening to the radio, and an ad for some *ahem* "gentlemen's club" comes on, and Matt goes, "Ooooh! Gentlemen's club!" Completely joking, I say to Matt, "Skybox?" "Alright, we're going." And so the evening takes yet another unexpected turn.      The only other time I've been to a strip club was on a Saturday night, when Dave and Suzzy took me there for my birthday. 10 bucks got you in, drinks were a dollar. Well, to lure people in for weeknights, the cover still applies, but hey, the drinks are free! Marketing at its very finest, I tell ya. They should teach business classes using these places as models. And so, the bottles of Miller Lite kept magically appearing, and, er, disappearing. Had a couple lapdances from a girl who absolutely killed me with eye contact. She did have a gorgeous body, but it was her down to earth way of playing the game and the looks she shot me with those eyes that made her stand out and made me willing to hand over the $20. Little things like that just get me, I guess. Oh, the $10 cover got you a 2-for-1 dance coupon, too. Well played, sirs. As for being there with Matt, well, the beer made me care a lot less, obviously. I just rolled with the evening. It wasn't really spending a night out with him - he just happened to be sitting at my table. Didn't let it keep me from having a fine time.      Highlight from work yesterday: I had punched out and was talking at the info desk with Jaymie, Allison, and Katrina. They pointed over to a guy who was on the couch in the cafe, asleep, and snoring loudly. They couldn't get him to wake up, and someone suggested dropping a heavy book on the table in front of him. So I grab a hardbound abridged edition of the Oxford English Dictionary (3,000-ish pages), walk over to him, and man, I can't do it to the poor guy. So I poke him a few times, "Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir?" His response: louder snoring. So I brace myself raise the book, and BOOM. Once again, louder snoring. The whole cafe is laughing now, and I'll be damned if I'm not gonna fix this. So i run back to the cafe, grab an electronic timer, set it for one second, and put it right up to his ear. BEE-BEE-BEE-BEEP! BEE-BEE-BEE-BEEP! Sounds just like an alarm clock, and has the same effect too - he's up witha shot. "What? What's going on?" "Oh, sorry sir, you just seemed to have fallen asleep on the couch and we were just concerned, just wanted to make sure you were okay." I walk away and put the timer back. Suzzy goes into the backroom of the cafe and damn near pisses herself laughing. This is why I love my dumb little job.
