The women had some sort of skirt thingy wrapped around their bottoms, nothing on top  the men.... hahaha.. i'm not sure what was 'there'. Anyway, the husband of one of the women (Alohop) had died, they (the tribe) said sorcerers ate him and they were going to eat the sorcerer as revenge.. but they were also scared of the sorcerer, so they built a treehouse to stay in and went down in groups to hunt for food. Apparently, sorcerers could take many different forms of animals and catch human beings to eat. Sorcerers look at people as animals to eat...      Meanwhile.. the uncle of the guy (who was in another tribe) who was accused of being a sorcerer said that, indeed, his nephew (Nanole) was a sorcerer.. he said that his nephew ate the guy's flesh, then put his skin back on, after a while, the guy woke up, then died later that night. he said Alohop's tribe was too weak and Nanole could easily kill them.      Back to the tribe of the guy who died.. their hunting wasn't going along very well, their food was running out, and it was raining a lot, so their wood for fire was all wet... and they actually said  "Who's causing all these rain?"  and  "If a child dies of hunger, we will definetely ask them for payment."         What the?! rain is rain.. well, later they sacrificed a pig to the gods, to stop the rain... they also decided not to kill  eat the sorcerer Nonale.. they were afraid Nonale's family would kill them..      I mean, wow, this is just  amazing!  these people are  so  weird... but it was awesome.. i learnt something.. gross as it may be..
