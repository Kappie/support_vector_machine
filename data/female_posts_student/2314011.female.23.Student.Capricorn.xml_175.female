Just to remind you, dear readers, Neil is Neil Gaiman, author of the Sandman graphic novel series and several other venerable works.  He's one of our favorite obsessions, and that's saying a lot.  He has is own blog and an option for readers to send him questions.    "If he thinks it's not worth his time, he won't answer and you don't have to worry about it."  The Boy encouraged as I deliberated, already knowing I would.  We didn't want to be the crazed fans, after all.  We knew we were going to be so cool when we met our celebrities, because that's the only way to get them to realize how good friends we will all be.    I passed off the request for advice as a cool-headed college student just trying to handle the possible interview situation a bit better than her contemporaries.  But I couldn't sleep that night after receiving his response:  "The best thing to do with Tori is to throw away the list of questions, sit back and just chat.  She's wise, funny, kind and cool and it will be fine whatever you do.  Give her my best."    And so, a week later, I made my way up to Spokane early to hopefully catch a glimpse and perhaps an interview.  I knew at least I would ask about the Dew Drop Inn in London and get the picture signed for Levi, but if I could actually sit down and (gasp)  talk   with her, I wasn't quite sure what I'd do, but was confident in my ability to figure it out with the least amount of embarrassment.  There was a small group of 20-ish folks waiting when I arrived and it was clear I neither knew nor fit in with any of them.  Gay guys and goth girls lounged in the warm April sun and I sat off to the side, taking it all in, still trying to decide what I wanted her to sign if it came to that.  Eventually, they set up the barricade and we maneuvered around each other.  Veterans made sure those of us who had yet to meet her were moved to the front and we were grateful.    Then we waited.  We laughed with the security guard.  We bounced on our toes.  We sang her songs.  We watched her bus pull in.  We stopped breathing whenever the stage entrance door opened.   Finally, she walked out.  She answered questions and started signing items for people in the back before making her way down the front line of folks crunched against the metal barricade.  By now it was clear I wouldn't be wasting any contact I had with her in a request for an interview; she could say no and walk on down the line.  Besides, this was a time for fans and their artist, and the fan (obsessive and obnoxious as I can be) won.  I had to remember to take pictures and keep inhaling.  Then she was talking to the girl standing next to me, who asked for a picture; Tori handed me the girl's digital camera and took my to-be-signed-items from me.  I still feel bad about how terrible the pictures must have turned out; all hand-eye coordination was lost, as though I hadn't even seen a camera before, let alone knew how to operate one.    Then she was asking my name and I hoped I wouldn't smudge the song requests she'd written on her hand as I shook it.  I couldn't form a complete thought or sentence.  I was that person I promised myself I would never be when meeting celebrities.  No shame, no control; just gibberish and gush.  But she threw me a bone:  "So, how're things?"    "Things are good!!"  I exclaimed.    My god her eyes are green.  She still has your things in her hands.  Say something about them!!    "That picture you're holding?"  "Oh!  Look at that!"    "My best friend and I went in London, thinking we'd find this hip-happenin' place we wouldn't be able to get into, and when we got there we couldn't, but for a completely different reason."   Did I just get all that out in one breath?   "Yea, well, this isn't it," she explained with a soft smile.  "They're kinda scattered all over the country..."  "I know!!  My grandparents owned one in Paul, Idaho!  We just thought this was a gay piano bar in London and figured it had to be you!"  "My girlfriends used to say to each other when we needed to get out of somewhere...like code for 'Let's get the fuck outta here'...let's go to the Dew Drop Inn.  So, how am I spelling this?"  And she moved along the line, hugging some, remembering the names of others and asking about their families.  The whole thing was pretty surreal, to the point where I (again) had to remind myself to take pictures and remember every instant because   this was really happening  .    It didn't hit until she'd gone back inside to prepare for the evening's concert.  It didn't seem real until I called the Boy.   I sent Neil the link for the  urlLink review of the show , not thinking he'd actually read it or even respond, but just in case...  He did.    "Good review.  Nice job."    The whole thing still comes around and surprises me every once in a while.  I smile when I catch a glimpse of my name in her easy, generous script when I'm doing sun salutations in the living room.  I relax when I see her picture on my carrel at school.    When I blasted into my apartment in August, rushing to change clothes in order to get to law school orientation, for which I was 4 hours late, I thought:  "You can handle this.  You met Tori!"
