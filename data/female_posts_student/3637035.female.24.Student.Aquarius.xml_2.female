I asked him if he wanted to come to the carnival this weekend (that's our yearly ritual) and sure enough, he informed me that he was going to the Pride parade. So, I came right out and asked him. And he admitted it. He apparently has a really nice boyfriend and all, so good for him. I've known, we've all known Jeff was gay all along. He is now 23 years old, I believe (maybe 22) and when I asked him if he has been gay all his life, he said he in fact was. I couldn't imagine being trapped like that. We used to ask him and tease him all the time, and he used to get right defensive. He's had girlfriends... He was trapped in a closet that he couldn't find his way out of. Now he is finally experiencing self acceptance and inner peace, and I'm so happy for him. Beck is shocked, possibly secretly devastated by his admittance, but I'm not. I'm happy for him that he, like I said, has found inner peace, and the strength to come clean with himself. Good for you Jeff! I love ya!  Maddi cut her first tooth today, thank God. Poor little thing has been teething since she was 2 months old, and it finally came through.  Tristan and I went to the grocery store today. There was a black lady in the store pushing a stroller with a baby in it about Maddi's age (around 10 months old or so) and Tristan goes up and says "Aww, what a cute little baby. I've never seen a brown baby before, but we have a white baby at home". I JUST ABOUT DIED! I was so embarassed. I just grabbed him by the hand and ran away. Geez, kids say the darndest things. Shit! I've already taught him about how people are different, and how there's people that come from different parts of the world that sometimes have a different color of skin.  Anyway, that's it for today! (If I can think of anymore, I'll edit)
