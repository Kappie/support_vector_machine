Plus I missed two sessions and I'm missing two more. So I am kind of out of the loop. Anyways, our teacher is nerdy and it's really funny. There is this OBNOXIOUS girl who tries to get everything right- AHHHH SHE'S A FOOL! Well, we always get in little groups and work on assignments. I got grouped with these two other Indian kids. Somehow we ended up talking about our Indian-ness AND IT WAS FANTASTIC. I never find people who are like me, except the three original Indians running around the school, oh yeah and my favorite MEGAN KAMATH!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, other than that, I know no Indians. Well, actually, I'm only half Indian, and I'm Muslim, so basically I'm just terrorist, IT'S FINE. But it was really funny. And the smart girl kept yelling at us, since we didn't do our work. BOO HOO WHITE GIRL. I am kidding! It was good times.  I haven't posted for a while, because I was college visiting. What an experience that was. I left last Tuesday and my mom was already annoying me. It was really crazy, because I told my mom that I really wanted to see somebody famous, and at our layover in Chicago, my mom came back to where we were sitting and said she saw somebody famous!!! She was like "Go over to that kid and ask him if he was in  Mystic River . Then get me an autograph!" So we bet a dollar that I would, and of course, for money, I'd do anything! I walked over to him, and I was standing by his side, and he was looking the other way. So I said "Hi." It was funny. He turned around and I asked, "Were you in  Mystic River ?" He said yes, and I got all giddy like a school girl. I went on talking, "My mom noticed you. Can she have your autograph??" Then I handed him my Northeastern college brochure and a pen and told him her name and he started to write the autograph. I think somewhere in that time I said, "I feel like a groupie." Now Allison, do you know what a groupie is??? You were asking for an autograph, you didn't pull his pants down or anything. I am just that lame. I asked what other movies he'd been in and he said movies like:  Gladiator ,  Double Jeopardy , and  Unbreakable . He was the little son in  Unbreakable  who tried to kill himself. That was a really powerful role. Anyways I started sputtering random things for a little bit, and he stuck out his hand and introduced himself as Spencer, and I said my name was Allison and we shook on it. Then I was like, "I want a picture, can you wait here while I get my camera?" And he goes, "Why don't I go with you, we can meet your mom." WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MEET MY MOM- SHE'S CRAZY!!! So we walk over to my mom and she gets all excited and rambling on about his movies and she asked him why he was going to Connecticut. He said that's where he was from and my mom was like, "Well we are college visiting." And he asked me if I was a junior and he said he was too. Then it was over. We got on the plane. I sat in the row in front of him, next to an annoying beeyatch. Nice times, nice times.  We stayed with my dad to save a bit of cash. We drove to Boston the next morning to visit BU and Northeastern. I didn't like either. There was a blizzard in Boston. A BLIZZARD! The schools were bad. The funniest stuff happened while we were driving to Northeastern. My mom was trying to read the directions, but she was being stupid. I had visited the campus over Winter Break with my dad, and I knew where the admissions office was. The map directions were incorrect, but I kept insisting that I knew where it was. My dad said, "Oh right, we visited it, we know where it is. We just have to drive into the campus." And I was like yes that's correct, being that I just said that. But then he goes, "Well I don't know where that is. I don't know what to do." and my mom is freaking out, "These directions, I just don't know!" And I keep telling them that I know where to go, I said, "Dad, remember we visited it. I know where it is, just drive into the campus on this road." And he says, "Oh yeah I remember, we just go in here. It's fine, we know what we're doing." Five minutes later... "Where are we? What are we doing? I don't know what I am doing!!" I WANTED TO SHOOT THEM BOTH! Then my mom tells me that my father, MY FATHER- THE CRAZY INDIAN MAN WHO IS EVIL AND SHOULD DIE AND AFTER 17 YEARS I'VE FIGURED OUT THAT HE'S JUST CRAZY, is taking dance lessons. He's trying to be a "Renaissance man" as my mom says. I couldn't believe it. Dance, my dad, that's just sick and wrong. That night he taught me the Rumba, Cha Cha, Tango, Waltz, Fox Trot, and East Coast Swing. I just can't believe it, my dad and dancing, that's messed up.  Thursday we left for NYC. I love the city, just love it. We looked at Barnard, even with an open mind, it sucked. We walked around Columbia, it was gorgeous. I doubt I could get in there. I saw a yearbook of theirs, and Brooke Smith was in it. Hope she's doing well. We walked around Time Square, where I ran into Aileen. AHH THE UNIES WILL ALWAYS SMELL EACH OTHER OUT. I was walking by the MTV studio, and it was TRL time, and there were so many kids there. Then the camera panned down towards the crowd and they started screaming, and I waved. Who knows, I may have been on TRL. That night my mom and I watched "The Apprentice" in NYC! We were so close to the Donald himself. Love you Trumpy. The next day we skipped Fordham, come on, the Bronx, I don't think so. Later we went to NYU. I LOVE IT. I WANT TO GO THERE. NOBODY APPLY OR I WILL SLIT YOU. I had my information session with none other than... MEGAN KAMATH. I sing a song about her. Love that kid. That night we went to a movie, and when I walked out of the theater, instead of security guards at Easton, I saw the freaking Empire State Building. It was really strange. We left at like 8 the next morning to go to DC. That train ride was crazy. We went through Jersey, Philly, Maryland, Delaware, and plus on the trip we'd hit down in Chicago, Hartford, Boston, NYC, and then DC. I feel like I've been across this entire nation. It was really warm in Washington and nice. The magnolia trees were gorgeous. Our hotel was kick ass. We got robes and mints at night. It was the shit. We didn't do any school visiting on Saturday or Sunday. We just walked the Mall and stuff. We went to the Holocaust museum, since we DIDN'T do it in eighth grade. It was sad though. Monday was GWU time (George Washington University). I liked it there too. I ate lunch with a senior there. He was a really hot Indian guy. It was sweet. Then we headed home. We got home at like midnight, only to find out that my godmother had died that morning. It's really sad. She was my mom's best friend and they grew up together. So I'm leaving for Cleveland tomorrow for the funeral. These two weeks have really been emotionally and physically draining.  I went to lunch with Meghan yesterday. We had some goood times. And today is Anna's birthday, so I might go see her. Well this has been a looooooooong entry, and I'm tired and sweating from it. I must go, goodbye!!! PS I got my comments and they weren't as bad as I thought. But Senora was like "OOH the aJorge likes her acats!" AHH YES I DO LIKE MY CATS.   BYE!
