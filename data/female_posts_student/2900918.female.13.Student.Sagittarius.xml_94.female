I'm really[!!!] tired. I guessed I've just walked a thousand miles...Isn't that like a song? Yes, its oh-so definately is.   As I mentioned in my post yesterday, I went to find the photoshop disc. It is so hard to find a pirated CD shop! I don't even know why the police bother to catch them. I think I found the shop, but it wasn't open. I walked and walked and walked and walked.. Alright, I not gonna fill you with my crap, just know that I'm REALLY TIRED!!!!   and I have PFT [Physical Fitness Test]tomorrow.... supposed to be running 2.4 km.   I should ask my mom to give me a foot massage after all that walking and to prepare for the running. I sound as if I'm enslaving my mom, but ifI asked her, she would. I know what you're saying, commenting on how lucky I am. Yes, I'm admit that I'm so frickin'lucky to have such good parents... I'm not being sarcastic, I'M REALLY NOT!!   I'm going to Bedok Central on wednesday since I can't go tommorow [refer to above about PFT if you haven't been reading the shit] to continue looking for it.   Once again, wish me luck.  ___________________________________________________________________________________   Massage my foot!
