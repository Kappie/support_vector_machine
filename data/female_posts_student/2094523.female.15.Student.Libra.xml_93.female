There was so much that happened but our minds can only remember just a tiny portion of it. Each day depended upon what we made of it and what we did to make it good or bad. not others. we chose our paths daily, monthy and yearly. Its hard to say if this yr was good or bad because it was definitly a mixture between the both. If i said that this yr was the best i wud definitly be lying and if i said it wasnt it wudnt be true either. coz in a way it WAS the best and then again it wasnt. This yr turned us from good times in jr. high to the fucked up high school time..so far. We told our friends that we wud keep in touch talk daily and always remember the good times. But those were lies i found. my friends and i do NOT talk daily, and ive lost touch with so many of them but i still do remember the good times.  i just wish we could go back to them. I realized no matter how much i thot jr. high sucked.. in reality i think i actually enjoyed it. I can only wish it will be the same for high school. The good and the bad ranges from friends, to family, to death and reality. Jr. high came and flew by and we got hit with high school. and its definitly not the way i imagined high school to be like. i wish to turn back time. Setting aside school i had the most amazing times with my friends that i wont forget..from paris to simply lunch hrs to class times to inside jokes it always stands out. fucked up summer i had though. but we move on we learn and we seek new challenges. Overall id have to say that this year was amazing. and i can only simply describe it as: Life is Good.
