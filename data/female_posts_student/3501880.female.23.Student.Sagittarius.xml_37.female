Again, another day in law school where I will come across as a complete and utter dumbass!!! Not unlike the day in Torts last semester when my prof. called on me and I just hid behind my laptop as the rest of the class turned around to stare at me and laugh.    Listening to:   My iTunes Party Shuffle...Right now, Justin Timberlake--Like I Love You. If only he did...    Watching:   Daydreaming of running away to Chicago and becoming a call girl...They make GOOD money, and probably have more self-respect than lawyers.    Mood:   Argh...   I am a sucker for questionnaires that require me to subject my friends to the innerworkings of my mind! Rahahahaha! So, here we go...  *I stole this from someone else's blog*   1. Do you try to look hot when you go to the grocery store just in case someone recognizes you from your blog? No one would recognize me from my blog, cause no one reads my blog. Considering most days it is a chore to even shower, I have to say, "No, not really..."  2. Are the photos you post Photoshopped or otherwise altered?  Sigh...Unfortunately, I wished they were Photoshopped.  3. Do you like it when creeps or dorks email you?  I love with ANYONE emails me!  4. Do you lie in your blog?  No, but maybe I will start.   5. Are you passive-aggressive in your blog?  Come on, I am the Queen of Passive-aggressive...Just ask my dad!  6. Do you ever threaten to quit writing so people will tell you not to stop?  No, but rather I threaten that I will keep on writing...  7. Are you in therapy? If not, should you be? If so, is it helping?  YES!!! Just seem some of my previous entries...June 2 and 3rd, I think!    8. Do you delete mean comments? Do you fake nice ones?  No, but I have to tell my friends that they must leave a comment.  9. Have you ever rubbed one out while reading a blog? How about after?  Uh, I guess not  10. If your readers knew you in person, would they like you more or like you less?  Probably less...I complain...A LOT!   11. Do you have a job?  No...But if my dad asks, I really am trying to look for one  12. If someone offered you a decent salary to blog full-time without restrictions, would you do it?  Hell yeah!  13. Which blogger do you want to meet in real life? None, cause that would seem creepy and stalker-ish  14. Which bloggers have you made out with? mmm...making out with bloggers. I don't know anyone else in person who blogs.  15. Do you usually act like you have more money or less money than you really have?  Probably more.  16. Does your family read your blog?  I don't think so, cause I haven't told them about it  17. How old is your blog?  a week--two weeks, maybe  18. Do you get more than 1000 page views per day? Do you care? Ha!  19. Do you have another secret blog in which you write about being depressed, slutty, or a liar?  No, but I have always wanted to keep a fake journal, just to fuck with my descendents' heads!  20. Have you ever given another blogger money for his/her writing? No, I am poor!  21. Do you report the money you earn from your blog on your taxes? You can earn money from a blog?  22. Is blogging narcissistic?  Like a fox!  23. Do you feel guilty when you don't post for a long time? Yes, but I just feel guilty about everything  24. Do you like John Mayer? NO! I never want a man telling me my body is a "wonderland"...How fucking creepy.  25. Do you have enemies?  Apparently, but only because the Beastmaster spreads vicious lies about me to people.  26. Are you lonely?  I am a solipsist.  27. Why bother?  I usually don't!
