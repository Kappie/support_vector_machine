And it's like dude what about some one on one time.    Not to like dis my man but, you know who is like really hot??? Nick Marnell !!!! I like want to have his babies...like no joke. But he has a beautiful girlfriend (man she so lucky). Why are all the good ones taken?    But hey we all can't be as lucky as she is. I guess I'll just have to settle!!! JUST KIDDING. Mike is definately an upgrade and not a settlement. But I really do mis him. I'll call him later on today since it's like 12:50 in the friggin' morning.    I should have called like days ago. But I like already know what our conversation is gonna consist of like... -hey Mike sorry I haven't called in a while-   -it's my fault I should have called- (well duh!!!)   - how are ya??-   - good, so you like want to hang out at Corey's tonite and chill in the hot tub-    and that is always how our conversations go. "Dump him" you say. but when you look like me your like not getting enough attention.    But hey whatever. and there is this really awesomewebsite I think that ya'll should check out,  urlLink http://filebox.vt.edu/users/mfeid/vtpage/milkmovie.html  Milk and Cereal.   And so....
