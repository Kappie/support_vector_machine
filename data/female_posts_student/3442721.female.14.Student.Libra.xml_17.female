I wanted to tear their judgement heads off and play soccor with them. They called me gothic and a grunge. 1) I am a punk not a goth! 2)grunge my left foot i clean myself daily well on the weekends it's every 2 days so no shower on saturday.... but they judged me before they even tried to get to know me. Oh well why they are dating head football players and sleeping around and ending up on the streets like the football players will, I will be happy as an Emt and i'll probally marry someone in ems as well. Right now i'm happier than the majority of people cause i am excepting a lesson. the lesson is that you shouldn't care about what everbody thinks.
