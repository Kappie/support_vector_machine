They are the little pictures you see that represent the people posting their comments in the forum..."What is a forum?" I hear you ask? A forum is like a message service where people can log into and post comments about certain topics. Anyways, my favourite forum avatar for the week is by the one known as .BatteryPoison. from the forum Gothic.net.  The particular post from which I took the picture can be found  urlLink HERE .
