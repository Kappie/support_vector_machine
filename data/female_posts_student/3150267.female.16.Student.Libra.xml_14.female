Happiness is a    journey, not a destination... thus I'll work like I don't need money, love like I've never been hurt, and,    dance like no one's watching.  "Adapt and not tolerate... they are totally different 2 things... when you learn to adapt, you live with it with happiness... tolerating only makes the misunderstanding and gap between people bigger... ..." yah... it's true. Between friends, we should learn to adapt to their personalities and behaviours. Even if they are not what you really want them to be, but remember, they are ur friends. Treasure them and adapt to their lives. Instead of changing your friends, wouldn't it be better to change how you look at her?   To u-noe-who: specially dedicate this to you.. u r a great friend n always give me lots of advice when i really need help. ^__^ thanks for you concern too...  Things will get better n i believe that after every storm, there will be a sunny day... ^__^ ~God bless everyone~    ~The secrect to enjoying life is to be thankful for what each day brings...~
