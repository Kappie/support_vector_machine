Leaving Entropia (Epilogue)  [music  lyrics: daniel gildenlow]  walk with me  and see the world I see  it is our home  it's where we all belong   life is flair  a brittle dress we wear  a fleeting sigh  but though pointless it may seem... live as death were but a dream   you don't have to walk their way  you don't have to watch the show  you don't have to play their game   and you don't have to die to leave entropia   all remains... forgotten smiles in frames  two fleeting lives  cut down to pocket-size   walk with me  and change the world we see  we'll cease to be  just people passing by  home is where we all get by   you don't have to cry for more  you don't have to have it all  you don't have to win a war   if death is but a dream  then don't let me ...fall asleep...  ------  Hmm, what has happened... A lot, I guess. I had my birthday last Thursday and I now am 25 years old. It didn't feel like anything, really. I don't have a crisis, not at least more than I had before I turned 25 ;) I had a nice evening, a couple of friends came to visit us. I had cooked and made a cake and everything was so fine! Seems like I managed to spoil my guests (and of course Rico) with my cookings ;) But I have to say, that I really _can_ cook and bake.  We have decided to have a cat. We don't have it yet, but we'll get it in the following weeks. It kinda feels like getting married, since it's not my cat or Rico's cat, it's Our cat. I can't wait! A cat makes this apartment even more home-like. It'll surely bring warmth to our home.   Well, other commitments we're not planning to make in the near future ;) We've been together for 7 months and that's not much. But I'm so happy for all the time we have ahead of us!  I've also been busy with Christmas cards and stuff... I decided to make most of the cards myself. I took last year a photo, that's good for this purpose. It's not very traditional or typical, but then again, neither am I. I hope people like it. It's just so much work writing over 30 cards and it's not very cheap, either. I wrote a letter for all my relatives, who probably don't know where I am and why and the letter became pretty heavy. Well, next year I won't have that problem, since by that time everyone knows for sure my new homecountry, about my man and all that stuff. I also should still find a couple of presents, for Rico and my brother's family. For me and Rico is the cat the main present and we've agreed not to buy presents. But I have such a great idea and I just have to make it real =)  Ok, now I have to go and finish my christmas card-session so that I can send them today. Furthermore, I gotta go shopping. I got a little birthday and christmas money and I've been spending it generously ;) And then I have to continue looking for a job, it's not as easy as I'd thought it'd be. I'm so frustrated and bored of sitting at home. I mean, that'd be fine, if I could still earn my own money, but no one pays you for staying at home. I really want to be independent with my money. I don't understand the german or swiss women, who stay at home all of their lives and are completely dependent from their husbands. Brr. But, I haven't lost hope yet and so hasn't Rico. He's really supportive.  In any case, till later.
