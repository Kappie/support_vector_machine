And i almost cried because i got this ten dollar bill, except it was all wrinkled, and i felt all guilty because i have been so materialistic in the past, so now my sister thinks that she has to pay me money in order to make my birthday a good one. And i just looked at the wrinkled little thing and wanted to send it back, but i knew that she wouldn't except it, so i had to put it in my piggy bank with a cloud of remorse hanging over my head. Sorry, i had to read Anne Frank, i'm in the analogy mode. Hee hee. well i'd best be off. i have lots of stuff to do. jules
