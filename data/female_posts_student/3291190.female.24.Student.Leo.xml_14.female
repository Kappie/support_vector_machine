Instead of stressing over some stupid paper or worrying about statistics. Thank God for summer, I think it keeps grad students sane.    As for the girl who died, she had an eating disorder....which is really sad. I can't believe the way some people go. Its completely unnecessary, being thin, being rich, any of the above is not worth your life. Its scary how dangerous  destructive our perspective can be to our own livelihood. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies.    I am getting ready to go on a run, the sun is setting  its beinning to cool off.  Evan is getting ready to come over  cook dinner, then we are going to watch TV or a movie. I think its wonderful to enjoy time with other people. Its like we spend almost all of our time with other people because we have to (work, school, etc.) its just nice to do it because we want to, or we enjoy their company. yada, yada, yada....oh, did i mention i have a headache? must not be drinking enough water....hmmmm...how much do you REALLY have to drink?!?
