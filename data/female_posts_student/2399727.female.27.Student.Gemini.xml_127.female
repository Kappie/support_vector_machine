It was the best of both worlds for us; the Pacers (top team in the league) won so the Raptors are knocked out of the playoffs, and the Raptors scored 90 points so we all get a free slice of pizza! :-)  (In the first quarter, a fan is selected to spin a wheel deciding the number of points the Raptors must get for us to get free pizza - it was 90.)  The Raptors got the necessary final basket with 8 seconds left in the final quarter so the place went nuts!  Final score, Pacers 94, Raptors 90.    More to come...
