I was the only girl, but it didn't really matter because the guys were all really sweet to me. I met some girls from Drain who are awesome! We had some majorly fun times! We got in some trouble to, whether it was driving to Washington (Paul Michael and I) or having Keaton in his bath-tub with three girls (with swimsuits on of course) They actually don't know that we drove to Washington, but if they do find out... well we will be in so much trouble. Oh we just left the state after dark in some ones car who we just met and without telling our advisor and having Keaton pay for our drinks (of course he didn't know that he payed for them either) But I have to say Katie Tara Tara Chelsae Kaeleen Britt Paticence the other Katie. I had so much fun with you guys, it was pretty crazy! You guys need to come down and visit me! We can hang out with the guys :P Ciao
