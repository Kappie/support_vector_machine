My body gets physically tired at like 12, but I finish talking to people on here and then get to bed around 1 or 2, and not matter how physically tired I am, I cant get to sleep.  My mind is going 100 mph and thoughts are just flying through my head...analyzing situations that I would like to happen. Thinking about things that didn't go to well in the day I am trying to end.  Thinking about the past and how I messed up.  Thinking about christa and how much Im gonna miss her, and how she's gonna be pushed to the limit and there's nothing I can do about it.  Thinking about how physically and mentally straining its gonna be on all of us back home.  Thinking about how long its gonna be till I can see her! Thinking about all the stuff I wanna say to her, and how I dont see her enough to get it out.  Thinking about how Im gonna tell *you* that Im gonna be gone for a month.  Wondering if you'll care...Thinking about how much is gonna happen while Im gone, and how Im gonna be totally excluded! overall, I just think about EVERYTHING under the sun and its frightening....not like Im scared, just....consumed I guess you could say.  Im scared to start school.  Im one of those wierd kids that loves EVERYTHING about school, and Im scared that when school starts Im gonna forget about these things, the things that I think about, the things that make me, me!  School is good for me b/c its all a big game.  To me, its a game to see which teacher or student I can fool the most.  Who really thinks everything is ok, when in my world....things could come crashing down at any instant.  I think I split personalities too! But Ill save that for another day b/c I've already written a bunch today. But anyway back to my insomnia....I usually get to sleep around 4:45-5:30....mom wonders why Im such a bitch all the time, and thats part of it, but most of it is b/c my life sucks and most think its just wonderful!  um....I got to see dude last night and that was good.  I was kinda mad when he didn't say anything when his cousin was tryin to hook me up with this random guy that wanted to fuck me on the spot, but ya know...oh well!  I was actually kinda scared b/c of something I had heard about him and you just walked away like it wasn't a big deal.  Oh well, I guess things that you've said recently dont neccesarily mean you like me. anyway...I kinda stole these lyrics out of daniel nolan's blog from like a long time ago, but they're meaningful to me so.... Three Doors Down--Away from the Sun It's down to this I've got to make this life make sense Can anyone do what I've done I missed life I missed the colours of the sun Can anyone go where I am 'Cause now again I've found myself So far down, away from the sun...... I'm over this I'm tired of living in the dark Can anyone see me down here The feeling's gone There's nothing left to lift me up Back into the world I've known.......    Sugar Cult...Memory  This may never start  We could fall apart  And I'd be your memory  Lost your sense of fear  Feelings insincere  Can I be your memory   So get back back  Back to where we lasted  Just like I imagine  I could never feel this way  So get back back  Back to the disaster  My heart's beating faster  Holding on to feel the same   This may never start  I'll tear us apart  Can I be your enemy  Losing half a year Waiting for you here  I'd be your anything   I've been ok about everything until the other day....I knew coming over was a bad idea, but I was forced to go, and Im glad I did....for her sake, but for mine...well, it could have been better
