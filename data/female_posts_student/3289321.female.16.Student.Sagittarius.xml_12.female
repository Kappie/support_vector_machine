Man, I don't know what I'm going to do.  There's only one answer to this........this HAS to be the absolute BEST summer ever!  :)  You know, it's really weird how just one person can either make or break your day.  Just a smile from them, or a simple "hey", or even just a wave...it can make everything else seem alright for a minute or two.  And on the other hand, all it takes is a certain person not talking to you, or giving you one not-so-nice look, or acting like they don't want to talk to you...it can make just about everything seem bad.  I don't know, maybe I just let some particular people get to me too easily.  :/  I know, that sounds really stupid.  But it's true.  Some people just mean a lot to me and they're always going to whether we're "together" or not.  You know, I don't even care about that.  Again, this sounds so stupid, but my one wish is that everything will be ok before I have to leave for Charleston.  WELL, I'd better get off of here because I've got early dismissal in a few minutes for softball...we're playing at Kings Mountain today at 4:30.  Later  >
