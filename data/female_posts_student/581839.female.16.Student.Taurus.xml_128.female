MATH HOMEWORK. darn it. i don't think i can handle it! the next break is on the 20th. THE 20TH. that only gives us 5 days until christmas. 5 DAYS. so i will have to go through... 15 days of school and work, not counting weekends, before i get a break. ok, maybe 14, because the last day is just goofing off. anyway, i'd better go. its late, and i cant think, and i'm tired, and i have to wake up early. DARN IT. Jules
