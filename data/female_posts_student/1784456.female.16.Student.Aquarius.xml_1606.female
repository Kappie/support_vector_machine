It's suddenly found the backrounds for pages and annoying little extras like that that it's been missing. Maybe it just got lonely. Ahh, some nice person probably came and fixed it during the night *aren't burgulars nice?* Oh, about my last post. Sorry, but d. was probably a sane answer! I mean, who wouldn't beat up margret thatcher? Who actually wears blue on the day of the elections? *apart from the poor little dogs that ian duncan smith has employed to help promote the conservative party by making them wear blue poncho's* Ahh, but it's not him anymore is it? It's that vampire guy... Michael... Howard? *if he's a childrens tv presenter, sorry!* On the topic of politics...  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/031115/325/ee1zu.html  Only one in three think that George Bush is stupid?! Come on guys! He thought Wales was a state in the US! What type of idiot leader doesn't know their own country!
