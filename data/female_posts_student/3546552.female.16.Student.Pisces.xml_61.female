It was a lot of fun, but we defrinately have some competition if you can call it that. Right now we're sitting in the big choir room waiting for the last two choirs to begin at 11:00. Everyone wants to change into jeans so they went to do that...I haven't decided what I'm going to wear yet. I think I might stay i blackbecause it looks better with the red shirt, and yet my jean capris sound really comfy. The choir that just went did a lovely gospel song called Survivor...which reminded me a bit of Destiny's child...lol don't tell them I said that. They were good though. One thing I've noticed is that many of the choirs seem to have soloists or people who quote verses during the song...and EVERYONE sways back and forth. I think the judges must be getting sea sick. Also...most of the choirs have acappella parts it's nice, but let me tell you that some of the choirs cannot hold a tune...maybe it's just that all the instruments or the accompaniments are a little sharp. Well anyway, I'm off for a bit, I might change so yeah, I'll write more later! bye ~BS
