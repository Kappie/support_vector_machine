Ever notice how when you want to find something, you NEVER can? Aye, you see, I'm searching for my cousin, and it is rather difficult. I have found her school, I have her IM, and I know what state she is in. But she refuses to allow me to contact her... I've IMed her under several screenames, I've had friend IM her... It's incredibly annoying. I'm close to giving up and saying "Screw this, if you want nothing to do with me anymore then i return the sentiment."  Seriously, I guess this search is jst a formality. We haven't shared anything except a last name in years. We are different ages, years apart mentally, have different ideas of fun, different intrests, and all that stuff that makes it so that two people would have no intrest whatsoever in knowing one another.  So someone tell me. Why am I doing this?
