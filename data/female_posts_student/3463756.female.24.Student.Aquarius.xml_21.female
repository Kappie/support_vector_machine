So when I say family, or think of it, I mean the people I have chosen to consider as such.  I come from a large family, that every now and again I miss a lot. My grandmom has six sisters and all of them eccentric. She also has four brothers who contribute to any dearth of eccentricity. With their children and their children, we have a huge contribution to the planet in terms of eccentricity.  I know I got the same gene. K tells me that all the time. To me however anyone that uptight and sober has got be a little crazy. So I just let him think what he wants. atleast he doesn't think I am boring.  but I miss them and talking to them seldom makes it worse. I don't even know when I would see them. Now my other parts of the family which aren't so nice, all I can say is I choose not to consider them as even a part of my family. They are the ones whose existence on this planet is meant to be ignored and which I happily do.  and then those I choose. My friends. Another contribution to this planet's eccentricity. These are the people I love, who love me and without whom, I would just shrivel up and die. Its hard for some people to understand this but that's the way I am. The people in your life, make you who you are and make your life unbearable or worth living. (depending on the way you feel about them obscures)
