I pray tt he drives safely home and get some rest for his sista's wedding tomorrow.. He doesn't sound right when we ended cos I didn't want to croach upon the issue again and again... like a feedback loop that juz doesn't benefit anyone in this sense... Time will straighten things up...   I want to be alone...
