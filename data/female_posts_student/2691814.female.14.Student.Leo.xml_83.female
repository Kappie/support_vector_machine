Today i found out on the news that a teacher bet a student that if he jumped out of a 2story building he wouldn't make it! Well he jumped and he was fine lol...he went up stairs to get his money and now the teacher is in BIG trouble lol. Shows how some ppl can be stupid lol. Well lets see here...FCAT was boring as usual except for the 1hr. brake...those are fun lol. But anyway....yes....im goin to the movies with ryan this weekend...i think it'll be fun. I suppose after the movie we're goin to vans but its up to him. I'm just really sad that i wont be auditioning for VPA program. Really sucks.    Ya know...im just really pissed bcuz i haven't even been in Orlando for a year and we have to move...I'm sick of moving!!!! Of course you've probably read all this from my last post. But ya...im really ticked lol. Not much going on really...i kinda wanted to go outside to see josh...he's like the only guy that i like'as a friend' who lives accross the street from me. Alla the other guys except bill are just dumb. But bills gay so ya lol.      Ok here are the bands that im listening to right now-Yellowcard (hell ya!), Mest, and H.I.M. If you have any other suggestions on any other Punk Rock or just Rock bands tell me...i wanna hear them! lol..I'm also listening to Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz(luv him)lol.Well...i guess i'll be leavin...  Buh byes lol
