Then Erin came and we decided to go show Erin the "fort". Well, as we were about to leave Amanda asked if she could come over and hang out for a bit, and I told her that we were going to the "fort" so she said to call her when we got back. So Alex and I show Erin the fort, and she seemed to think it was cool. We walk back to my house and we notice Amanda's car parked in front. We go upstairs and open my sister's door, and inside is Chloe and Amanda sitting on Chloe's bed watching TV, with Amanda in her prom dress. It was so funny! She just decided to wear her prom dress. It was great. Sometime this summer Me, Alex, and Amanda need to go somewhere wearing our prom dresses. It would be fun. So after awhile Amanda leaves, so then me and Erin decided to have some chocolate ice cream. Well, I was being a dork with it, and smeared it around my mouth to make it look like a mustache. Alex said she needed a picture of it, so me her and erin walk to her house to get alex's camera. as we were walking, i had the ice cream on my face. it was so funny. so we get the camera, and on the way back we decide to go in the "fort" again. well we went all the way back, and we noticed an opening to the field. so we go through the opening and walk in the field and we walk forward for awhile, and we notice another "fort". this one was scary tho because it looked someone lived there. we got scared so we ran back to the main path in the field. the grass was really wet, so we got all wet. it was fun. me and alex decided that we need to go back on a nice day and check out the second "fort". it was really fun. then we came back to my house and just watched movies and hung out. today was boring, so i really feel no need to blog about it.
