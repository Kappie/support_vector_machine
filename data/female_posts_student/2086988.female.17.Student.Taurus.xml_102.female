Since I have to be at school tomorrow from like 10-4, then work on day Sunday, then have rehearsals, NHS service hours, my varsity audition, dress rehearsals, and the actual show. So, I'm going to be pretty much busy ALL week. So, in saying that, my mom has to call this morning and freaking bitch me out just because I didn't want to keep the kids for one time in my life. But she's all like, oh well it's the way you said it. WTF? What way do you want me to say it? I sware I'm going to go insane. And then Candace has to yell at me too, saying I never do anything, I'm always watching her freaking kids. She's the one who needs to spend more time with them, not me! Then my mom is threatning to take away my cell and net just because. I'm so sick of all of this. I just got under my covers and pillow this morning and just cried.
