Hmm...what else did I do that was remotely interesting? Not much, I spied on Martin during 5th today. I was really bored. Got new seats in spanish, I sit next to Theran. He was gone today, and he'll be gone tomorrow too for FBLA. Hmm....what else? Oh yeah, I realized today that the reason Ryan sometimes aggravates me and stuff is becuase I find him to be a boring person. haha. Hopefully, he'll never come across this, but if he does, then I'm sorry. It's just how I feel right now. So yeah. That was really about it. So, how about them Blazers?
