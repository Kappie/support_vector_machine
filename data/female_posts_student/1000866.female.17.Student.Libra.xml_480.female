It's not tthat I don't want to, just...I can't, and I'm a crappy girlfriend for not explaining it to him, which I STILL can't even do even though I know I should. Ugh. Now I'm pissed at myself. It's honestly not even that big of a deal. If I know him and...I really hope I do know him pretty well, he wouldn't stay mad or angry about this kind of thing. He's not like that, but he probably did wonder and...I didn't even explain. ARGH. Now I'm royally pissed at myself.   I'm going to go make mac and cheese. Maybe that will make me happy..
