I can't believe he is leaving.  I know that he has to go to work, but when it hits you it still sucks, you know?  I like that our family is relatively close knit.  We have our ups and downs and some of us get on each others nerves more than others...but there is a lot of love there.  So anyway, tomorrow we fight the traffic.  God help us.  LOL  I HATE LAX.  My sisters won't be able to see him off because of their school.  I don't like saying goodbye to people...especially when I know I won't be seeing them for a very long time.  You know?  Ah, sorry for the ramble.  I guess with Pa leaving and then Ed leaving the following month, it is just hitting me hard.  It is hard when they leave.  It is one thing if one just left, but having to see both of them leave...that is a whole other thing.  This is our life I guess.  So how is the week going?  I think pa is taking the kids to Chuck E. Cheese.  The kids are going to love that.  I know Nalani is going to miss papa a lot.  I hope for everyone's sake she doesn't end up crying.
