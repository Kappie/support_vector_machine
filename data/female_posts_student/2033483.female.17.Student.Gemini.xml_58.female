Review Session was canceled for history because Mrs. Liestra wasn't there, I was happy because I was home to see Hanson on TRL.  TRL used to be good when Carson hosted but now it's just a waste.  NHS was tonight.  That was fun to get semi-dressed up for.  Sean noticed my skirt which made me happy.  I'm tellin' ya'll it's the little things that matter.  I like it when guys wear ties.  I don't know why but I do.  We had to go pick up Tyler at Brian's house afterwards and had to stay and let Andy show us his magic tricks he learned.  Alex is talking so much lately.  But he still needs to work on Kayla.  I remember Andy used to call me Kiki for the longest time.    I leave tomorrow for Florida and I know that this will be difficult for some of you, *cough*Renae*cough* but I think you can handle it, but I want to know I was missed when I get back.  I want emails updating me on what's going on at school or life in general.  A lot can happen in 8 days.  Ben Folds will be coming so Renae have way more fun than you normally would because you have to have fun for me too.  Logan, I'll be back so don't get too comfortable.  Lexi, if you assign a staff member to a senior for senior profiles like they did last year make sure I get a good one and not a bitchy/ stuck up one.  Thanks!  Megan, remind Renae to get a spoon at lunch and not a fork.  Jessica...make sure everyone is well fed with animal crackers.  Email: KayJP13@aol.com  ~Kiki
