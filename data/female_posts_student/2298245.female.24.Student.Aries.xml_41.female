As a fairly conservative person myself, I find it appalling that there is so much support for this among people who call themselves conservatives.  It is not a conservative position, and the constitution should not be amended on a whim.  I do hope the President will take some effective domestic leadership and steer us away from this madness.  There are more important battles to be fought.
