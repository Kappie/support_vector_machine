There are sooo many films I wanna see now... 'thunderbirds' (dircted by Commander Riker lol), 'the prince and me' (who fancies comin to see it weds night?), 'spiderman 2' (tho bet thats hyped to oblivion too) and many more heehee. Good job it's the hols then...now all I need is the cash lol, I sent off my cleaning application yesterday so hopefully will hear back from that, if not, back to the drawing board, or being a lazy bum haha-de-bloody-ha.      Changing subject dramatically, my Mum has an old friend of hers from 6th form and their kids coming round soon, my mum actually introduced the guy to his wife at a party of hers, a regular matchmaker eh? They are due at 5ish and as I wastidying up for thier visit, I decided to have a nice old cleanout too...so now the place is spic and span (or whatever that saying is) and btw, Moomin (mon hamster) is clean as a whistle an all! yay! I best be off...gotta go make myself look impressive seeing as I haven't seen these peeps since I was, like,4! Ciao! xx
