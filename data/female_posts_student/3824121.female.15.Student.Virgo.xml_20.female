I think I need something to do during the day, cause I'm forming like little stories in my mind. One of the stories was that there was this bounty hunter chick in the future..... How freaky. O I found this online game right, and its flash and mmorpgish. But its in french. Do you know how much that sucks? It sucks so much XP I'm BORED and I need something to do! What is there to do??? I'm gonna mozy over to quizalla and see what quizes there are.
