And we know Rosie...never listen to me.   2) Cody Blonder? Stupid things?   3) I miss her MORE heheh, yes you are...well.....nah, I'll try to take as many bullets as I can for ya.   4) Entirely true about the caves, they're bitchin'.   6) No offense intended to John. A lot of people, actually, have been killed by murderers with a copy of this book, and I was serious about the murdering part. There was one part where Salinger talks about crushing someone's head and I felt really weird...so I wouldn't suggest this book to anybody, because there's really some unintended psychological effect that comes from it. Then again, it might be just some psychobabble placebo effect or whatnot.  7) "h4ck4ur$" is L337 for "hacksaurs"...actually, it should be spelled "h4ck$4ur$", I left out one "s".  8 (part 1!)) Yep, she was there, I think she quit high school or something and works there, she was really young. She was the cashier.  8 (part 2!)) That I did! That was me wanting to be black right thaar. And btw, Chingy is the best songwriter ever. The song  Right Tharr  has officially become my fav. song in the entire world and I'm going to be dressing in FUBU and speaking ebonics from now on.  (that is a  BIG  J/K for the slower ones of us)  9 (part 1!)) Jared for whom I have written a song? Good guy, he.  9 (part 2!)) AWW w00t frakkin' w00t. B-dayz=bitchin' no matter what, and two days of wait, bah. Actually, your b-day is on a Saturday this year, yes? So you'll actually have to take it on the 22 day because it's closed on Mondays. Actually I probably grossly miscalculated there...that's why I'm in Algebra II standard right now. Ya ain't a loozer, most of my friends waited a thousand years before they got their permits/licences (that was hard to spell)...look at Abby Mac, for instance. I got my on my b-day because I'm very anal about stuff that's cool. So yah.  Mine eyes hurt, all. I'm going to drink another Pepsi Vanilla (they're basically Vanilla Coke part 2, by the way) and pop in a movie.   And remember, "it's better to be pissed off than to be pissed on". Adieu friends.
