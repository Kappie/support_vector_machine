For the past few days, I’ve been trying to understand why things happen. Whether they’re for a reason, or maybe there’s something planned for me. If life is what they say pre-destined, then whatever I do is already destiny. But then, God did gave us this power to decide for ourselves, whether we do it for better or for worse. That alone disprove of life as pre-destined.   Now, I realize that chances were given for me to grab hold of my life and what I want out of it, but, I lost my them. Life is just too short, who knows…by tomorrow I might not be here at all.   Just a feeling, I might not live a long life. Out of morbid curiosity, my morbid imagination run amok each time I travel, whether to Cabadbaran or to school, especially if the drivers are reckless…I imagine myself being flattened by the tires, or even by the vehicle itself…there’s blood everywhere. Oh well, I do have a really weird imagination which goes uncontrollable at times. If God is listening and watching, I do hope that when I leave this world, it wouldn’t be as bloody as I imagined.  Just out of morbid curiosity.
