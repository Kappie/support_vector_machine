The situation made me think, especially as recently there has been talk of having to pay to park on the Wellingborough Rd. I signed the petition against the measure, and only hope that the council listens to the businesses that are along the Wellingborough Rd so that they don't lose custom. But I digress, the main reason for this post was that I wanted to rant about parking and traffic wardens. Maybe my rant will be somewhat different to other peoples opinions though... I'll admit that there seems to be mant traffic wardens about now, and that it is an easy way to increase revenue by ticketing people's cars, but I admire their bravery in some situations where people can get extremely hostile, and I certainly wouldn't want to do their job. I can understand people getting annoyed when they receive a ticket, especially if the area is not clearly marked out, but most places in Northampton are sign posted as pay and display. Can we really complain if we just sneak off in the hope that a traffic warden won't catch us? I worked as a van driver for a while, and one of my biggest annoyances out on the road was (other than people who drive at 45-50mph on a 60 limit) finding a car parked in a loading bay. I really wish that people would have more consideration when it comes to parking in a loading bay. A loading bayis designed to make delivering easier for drivers, who will probably still have to carry or cart parcels up to a block away. The worst time I remeber was a delivery and collection in Ely, requiring myself and a friend to move approximately 40 parcels 200 yards up the road ( and then up and down stairs in the shop!! ). The car that was parked in the loading bay in question moved not long after we finished, and was promptly replaced by another person who thought it was ok just to stop there for a moment. And I see the same thing occur in Northampton every day. Have some courtesy for drivers trying to do a job, and leave loading bays clear for them. If you don't and you then receive a ticket - please don't try and complain. The same situation as above follows for disabled parking bays. How many times do you see someone just pull in for a minute? Disabled spaces are limited, and are designed to make it easier for disabled to use the facilities in Northampton as easily as the rest of us. So let's try to leave disabled spaces for the truely disabled!! There are probably some of you saying to yourselves that you have never done either of those two things. But I bet you've gone over your time limit on your parking. It happens all the time... you look at your watch and realise that your time is nearly up, you rush back and reach your car 5 minutes late, but fortunately no one has ticketed it yet. If they had, many people would immediately be complaining, moaning at the traffic warden in question that they were only 5 minutes late. You were late though - you knew how long you had and you over ran. You had two options, which were to make sure that you payed for enough time before you left your car ( I always pay for more time than I need ), or return in time. If you don't return in time, don't complain. How many minutes and hours over parking limits do we go as a town every week. All that extra time adds up to is .... yes you've got it .... more cars that could have parked there in the same amount of time. So, basically the gist of my rant is, if we all act decently and treat the parking laws with respect, then far more cars would be able to park in town making it easier and fairer for everyone. Including the traffic wardens who wouldn't be needed if people didn't break the rules. Think about it.
