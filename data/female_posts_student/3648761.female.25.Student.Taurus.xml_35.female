My temp job is just about done. I only have two more weeks here. Last night I watched Seabiscuit, what a great movie, i teared a little. And of course i watched the secound to last show of days before the olympics. man oh man things are getting good, except for the fact that jennifer has been pregnant for 11months on the show.   Didn't get started on my project again, but I plan on it tonight.  I really have to clear out my bedroom, it looks so clutter at the moment.  I kinda started looking at cloths that I want to give away/throw out, but then I stopped and just left it there, my plan is to get it all done through out the weekend, and clean out my room to make room for some bedroom furniture that I bought. This weekend, I am dyeing my hair, hopefully it wil come out good, other wise, I will always dye it back a brown. Tonight, Is pizza night at my house, and Camille wants to watch Teenage conffessions of a Drama Queen(i think that is the title) This should be interesting. And i want to watch 13 going on 30. We'll see, might watch both through out the weekend.
