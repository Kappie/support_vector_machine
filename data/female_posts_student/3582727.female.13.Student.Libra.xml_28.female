And I don't see why, either; I went to bed around midnight last night... I think my bed's a little too comfy for my own good. Hm.      I already linked to this site on my team blog, but it has been making me very happy, so I thought I'd mention it here:  urlLink www.tiedyes.com . It's got tons of liberal, anti-war clothing, buttons, stickers, bookmarks, and more.       This is an excellent blog:  urlLink mwilder.blogspot.com . I agree with most of the things he says.       That's all for now.
