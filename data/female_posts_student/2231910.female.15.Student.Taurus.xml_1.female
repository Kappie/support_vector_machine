ANd the worst is they act like nothing had happen. " Should i leave the clique ?" have come across my mind everytime. I dun noe wat to do...... The pain in my heart yesterday almost make me cry really cry. When there is a clique meeting or watever, i will always keep quiet cos i feel so scared until i dun noe what to say. Really... nothing to say. Must this always happen on me, like the other time in primary school. I am so scared .... so scared until i dun dare to think to the negative side.Am i so silly to cry or feel scared??
