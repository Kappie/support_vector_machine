Tomorrow I'll have a piano lesson, so I'll practice (logic is beyond me here--I could practice today too but I'm not in the mood). Friday is adopt a beach and meeting Mom's friend's daughter. Saturday...oh, that's Father's Day. My mind doesn't think much past Saturday.   I could watch the movies Dad brought home except the thought of watching Love Actually alone in the dark theatre when it's still light outside (cloudy! my favorite!) is quite disappointing.   Brainstorm session: what do I want to do? I'd rather hold off shopping for necessities until I get to Harvard. I want to read, but for some reason I'm not in the mood. I'm not tired. I've forgotten how nice it is to sleep in. I could start crocheting again, but that's almost too dull to imagine. I just want some official errand to run, I guess.   Argh.
