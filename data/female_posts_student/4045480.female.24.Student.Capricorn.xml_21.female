Being the closet country fan that I am I heard this song "Girls Lie Too" by Terrie Clark and it really hit home for me, and I bet most of you gals will agree.  Here are the lyrics, but you should really get a listen to really get the feel of it.  I can honestly say I've used them all at least once in some form or another.  "So she can’t go out tonight again Her sister’s sick, she’s gotta baby-sit Yeah, that sounds like a pretty good excuse  Now you didn’t hear any of this from me But things aren’t always what they seem Brace yourself, this may come as a shock to you  (Chorus) Girls lie, too We don’t care how much money you make What you drive or what you weigh Size don’t matter anyway Girls lie, too Don’t think you’re the only ones Who bend it, break it, stretch it some We learn from you Girls lie, too  We can’t wait to hear about your round of golf We love to see deer heads hanging on the wall And we like Hooter’s for their hotwings too Other guys never cross our minds We don’t wonder what it might be like How could it be any better than it is with you  (Repeat Chorus)  Yeah, girls lie, too We always forgive and forget The cards and flowers you never sent Will never be brought up again Girls lie, too Old gray sweatpants turn us on We like your friends and we love your mom And that's the truth Girls lie, too Yeah that’s the truth Girls lie, too  No, we don’t care how much hair you have Yeah, that looks good Comb it over like that...Girls lie, too" -Terrie Clark
