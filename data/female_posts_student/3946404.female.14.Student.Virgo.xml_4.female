I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show it  I gave you my all, but you wanted more  Lost on the inside, filling up the score.   I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head.  Over and Over. I took and you bled.   I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show it  I gave you my all, but you wanted more  Lost on the inside, filling up the score.   I am impatient. Misunderstood.  What ever it is, I've got what it cured.  To your arms I run. My own life, it crumbles.  No longer am I damned. No longer do I stumble.   I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head.  Over and Over. I took and you bled.
