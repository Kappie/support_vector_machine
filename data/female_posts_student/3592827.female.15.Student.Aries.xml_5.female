After a week of lost sleep because of final exams and another week of insomnia due to music theory crap, I'm so glad to have a break. I don't have to put up with annoying people obsessing over their GPA's anymore! YES.  I'm going to see Harry Potter with some friends, namely Saumitra and Joanna, tomorrow. Harry Potter! Dude, that kid is too hot for his glasses. I'm sitting here.. sneezing because it's allergy season. My brother, Lance, has a couple of his friends sleeping over and they are LOUD. I was never that loud when I was 8 years old. Oh yes. That comment section is meant for comments and questions. I can't guarantee that I'll actually read all of them, but I'll try to check it every few months and answer your crazy questions if they don't pertain to gpa's and that jazz. I find those people that take FOREVER to say goodbye soo annoying. If you're going to go, just go! I don't care if you love me a lot or want to thank me fifty million times! Just go! This is a clippet of an actual conversation. The names are changed because I'm nice like that. Person: "I g2g" Person: "ttyl!" me: "k" Person: "lylas!" me: "alright. bye" Person: "I'll cya tomorrow" me: "you bet." Person: "I'm going to go sleep now." me: "k" Person: "oh yea, I almost forgot..." me: "oh?" Person: "I have to go watch a movie today." Person: "crap, that means I can't go sleep now" Person: "so I'll cya." me: "k" Person: "ttyl" etc.  I miss the class of '04! They're off to do all those big things that college kids do and leaving me behind so I can stay in high school for another 3 years! I have to play for graduation, so I get to see them one last time and say goodbye to all of them. The best of luck to them. There's at least one that's going to go on to become world-famous. But it's very late, or very early, which ever way you want to think about it. So, I'm going to go sleep in. Because that's what Jaynes do when summer hits. Later days~
