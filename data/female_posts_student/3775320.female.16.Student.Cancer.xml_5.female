Had to do it Seamus Heaney style, which means loads of onomatopoeia, double meaning things, images [the five senses], metaphors, similes... basically, very chock full of every poetic device ever.  I couldn't really achieve that, but alas here is my poem.  --------------------------------------------------  Scuttling busily all around, Forever present on the ground. Wearing great big plates of armour, Small and grey, a little soldier. Doing no apparent task Or else unknown but to itself.  But once in a while it senses that Another being is present too. Once it does the fool is alert, The muscles tighten, and the shell curls round Into a tiny steel bullet.  Once I had loved to kick them about. Make them roll, then squash them flat. Once I had enjoyed the muffled crunch Not heard, but felt, thgrough the sole of my shoe.  Then bending down to observe the victim, First I feel awe, and then disgust. For lying there, pitiful and weak:  My murdered victim in it's dying breath Staining the ground as a mark of its death.  --------------------------------------------------  By Sharon [which is me] 9 Feb 2003
