It was the saddest thing I have ever seen...it featured letters from solders who died...it showed all the death and destruction war causes...Why do humans do this to eachother? I will never know..but I will always know that every human life is important and no one should ever take away another mans right to live.  •In Memory of everyone who lost their lives in war•
