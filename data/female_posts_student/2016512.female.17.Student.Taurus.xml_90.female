GRRR! so i started to get angry and shake and cry. and then after about an hour, Namgets told me that "we're going to do this the right way"...well great because that's what i wanted to do the whole time. so he has finally let me screw the "deadline" and actually get a nice fountain...hopefully...if it doen't blowup. haha i have a feeling it will explode and i'll laugh, then sob, and then break all the pieces into tinier pieces. i can't wait.  i'm getting a haircut today and i've got three options which i think i've picked my final because of stupid senior picks. my mom doesn't want me to have short hair...but it's so cool. grr. so i've decided on this one (okay so i can't find hyperlink in this new format of blogger) well that bites so the link is - http://gallery.hairboutique.com/default.asp=6370 but i kinda want httpL//gallery.hairboutique.com/default.asp=5884  Plaster is key, -Betso
