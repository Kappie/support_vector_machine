We relax by the pool, sunbathe, have some snachish lunch, relax some more and get ready to go out for some dinner. I wont go into much detail as it will just bore you, trust me.  The only thing that was different from the other days about today was that we had a lovely visistor....ICK! We had a COCKROACH!!!!!!! I didn't really want to kill it, but if I didn't get rid of it I wouldn't of gotten any sleep that night, watching for it to come and crawl around my bedroom floor. My Dad couldn't catch it because it was too fast so I got some inceticide that we had from the tiny ants we spotted the first day and literally ended up spraying the whole can of it on the cockroach. But that didn't kill it, but it had slowed it down so my Dad scoped it up with some paper and I thought he chucked it over the road, but he put it in the BBQ. So it ended up dying slowly of stavation rather than the incetiside.  Anyway that night we ended up going back to Slow Boat II because it was the easy option and we knew it was good food there. Thats about it for that day.
