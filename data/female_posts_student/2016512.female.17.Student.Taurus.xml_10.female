It would be jam-packed with singing, dancing, cast parties, and costumes, but, well, *sigh* I'd have to quit work for sure, and I'd probably drop my Web Site Development class which lasts the last five weeks of the semester. Speech and KB would still be going on, as would piano and band time HUH, as well as my four daunting classes. I don't want to hyperextend my self, yet at the same time, I don't want to look back and think that I hypoextended it either. I guess I need to be happy with balance. Balance between excitement and peace, independence and relationships, work and relaxation, McDonald's and tofu salad.  Don't forget reality and disillusionment. Those should be balanced too. I'm certain. Goodnight folks.
