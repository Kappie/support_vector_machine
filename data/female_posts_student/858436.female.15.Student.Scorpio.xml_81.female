(The sacred bluff, s'mores, Old TiMe RoCk 'N RoLl!, it was raunchy and risque but definitely not mono-tonous, hehe)! What an awesome time. Oh yeah, I got 5 inches of my hair cut off! I'm still getting used to it. Today I officially got my job at the country club. Working with Jared, Alex, Grant, Jami, and Mat. I know Jared obviously but have never met the rest of them but they all seemed pretty nice. So come on down to the SCC and buy some food and help with my Buy Madeline a Car Foundation! Haha.  Blogger got a new layout and I like it a lot! Haha. And you can post comments to my posts! So make a comment! :-P  Hm.. that's about it right now.
