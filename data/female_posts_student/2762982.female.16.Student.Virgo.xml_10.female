She loves him...me...no, I think it would be too early to tell if my feelings were that deep.   I finished a commitment..woot!...but I'm bummed out.  Too much thinking for one day to be able to make any sense of it.  I hurt her...and I want to fix it, but there's no way that I'd be able to.  Nothing seems to be what you see.  Nothing is ever the way you want it to be, so deal with it.  rambling....so much fun >.
