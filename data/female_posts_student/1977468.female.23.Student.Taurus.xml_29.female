I know in the back of my mind they exist to DIE! they are bred to be eaten! How depressing is that? It's a fricken lizard, go let him catch his own food... at least there's sport in that, at least the crickets have a chance then. My sister is sick... she finds death, the consequence of sin, to be fascinating. She likes to watch the lizard, which she named "Edwin" devour the little animals she buys for him. Do you really think thats the way God intended it? Everything eating each other? No.  No sir.
