I was thinking Sunday, the 8th of august. Before that I am on vacation, the 7th is val's b-day, and we were planning to be in longbeach that next weekend so yeah. if there are too many conflicts I guess its a nevermind on that idea. or it could be done during the week but then parents would have trouble coming because of work and what not and I wanted this to be like a going away party thingy where all the parents and all the kids could hang and be merry. so give me a holla and tell me what you think!
