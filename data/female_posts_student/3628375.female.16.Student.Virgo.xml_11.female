I've been pretty bummed this past week, but I've been with Missy and Janet and a whole bunch of other people to keep myself sane. but at night, i just lose it. I mean, Monday morning I talked to John before he went and when we got off the fone, I bawled for like 2 hours, and then we went to Missys (cause her and janet spent the night that night) and I cried for awhile when I got there, and then tuesday night, i got drunk, stupid of me but oh well. Wednesday, I cried for a little bit, but then Janet cheered me up and told me that he's okay and that things are going to get better. And today I havent cried yet, but I know I will tonight! It just sucks. It feels so WRONG, not being able to talk to him...I mean like part of my life is missing. Well I got another week. Hopefully ill build the balls to call his mom and find out exactly whats going on. But I'm going to go now. Laters!!!      ***How can you smile with all those tears in your eyes?***
