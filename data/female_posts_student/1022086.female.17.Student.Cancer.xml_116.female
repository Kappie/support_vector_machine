I was supposed to have it cut this Thursday, but something came up in mom's schedule, so I rescheduled both of our appointments. I'm kind of happy because I was starting to be in a bit of a freak-out stage regarding the loss of inches and inches of hair. Phew. Now I have a bit of extra time with my hair! W00t!  Egh. There are some real jerks and morons out on the web. DA is turning rotten what with morons posting practically porno and calling it art. All the snapshots are are simple Kodak film with naked poses. The photos fit the definition of porn, and I don't understand how DA can allow that kind of crap to be posted on an art community. Although I'm not a very active member and have only posted a few pieces of crap from a long time ago, it still bothers me. But a year ago, that kind of stuff wasn't going on on there.   Then, there was this other feller on lj that completely bashed Christianity. He went off on a terribly harsh criticizing rant and concluded it with, "I'm not bashing" when that's all he ever did. Even the title was a call for an argument-- "Attention so-called Christians..." Many people commented, and I think I and maybe one other person were the only ones to stand up for what we believed in. I wasn't picking a fight, but I was very deeply offended. I'm not the perfect Christian and I falter a lot, but I still think He does at least exist. Even if I haven't communicated with God in a long time and am at weird odds with Him right now, I still thought the feller was very harsh and incoherent. Half of what he said doesn't make sense. I felt like his reply to my comments was mean as well, and all my comments did were stir up more trouble. So, I left a final comment and said I wouldn't be checking back for his answer.   He is an atheist and formed an online community called the church of something. It's like a forum for Christianity because he thinks it's stupid that different religions of Christianity disagree. Well, guess what, dude? Man always disagrees. And for another point, Christianity isn't religion, but a way of life. I told him so, but I'm sure he's so dense it went nowhere.   I know that everyone screws up, but man, hardly anyone remembers that Christianity is based on love. Everyone seems to relate it to an attempt to escape death, a way not to be damned for eternity. I admit that I've been scared, too, and sometimes I've forced myself back in there for fear of what is to come, but that's why I'm taking time off of church to ponder, partly. I don't want it to be like that. I want to find a good place to worship with communion with other people who aren't afraid or seeking power in the church. I know that that has to start with me, though. I never wanted my relationship with God to be based around fear; just love.   I've probably gone off into a completely different rant by now. Sorry if I confused you, but I suppose that, even though this entry should have gone in my handwritten, private journal, typing did make it a lot faster to get my thought out.
