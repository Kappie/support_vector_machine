Im a sap for them... they are my favorite kind of movies, well i bet u guessed it, i cried at the end of this movie too, altho not as bad as the Notebook. lol that was almost pathetic! lol Im gonna try to get out of trouble by cleaning my room, so i can go out tonight.. i wanna see THE VILLAGE! Also i have a new celeb crush, well not crush lol but i like Jude Law now, hes hott!! lol hes got those eyes that make u melt! lol well rara is in love with Orlando bloom, krissy will always love Ben Affleck ( i did once! ) lol and i like Jude Law now! o well, we can always dream cant we?! lol Seeing Love movies makes u think about when ur gonna find the right person to spend the rest of ur life with, and i thought i did once, but now i know that i didnt. Bc it wasnt that feeling that ur susposed to have.. but i did get a good friend from it, and thats about it lol and wow , right as i wrote that, Christina Aguleria's song Stronger came on lol maybe its a sign, Hell i know it is! : ) well im outie!
