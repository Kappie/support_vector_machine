I really liked Psych, though.  Transition would not be terrible either.    Train lost power on the way home.  They were halfway in a tunnel and couldn't get the doors open.  20 minutes later, we were on our way again.  In between, I had to get out, find a restroom and pay to get on the train again.  Just reiterates my rule about not getting on a subway with a full bladder.  The one day I broke my rule, I paid for it ... literally and figuratively.  More to come...
