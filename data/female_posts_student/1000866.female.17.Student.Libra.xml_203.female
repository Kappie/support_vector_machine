I wonder if in 7 months I'll think the same thing I did of my Novemeber 14th first entry into one of these. I'm kind of surprised I've actually kept up writing in this. I've never actually kept a real diary. I've always felt like I was just whining to paper. I don't know how this is different, it's just whining to a computer screen, but still....I've kept up with it. I wonder how much longer I'll keep uo with it. I don't intend on stopping writing anytime soon. Hmmm....interesting thoughts. 'Eh, I'm not in much of a reflective mood right now, so I think I'll go read and wait for a good storm to come! :)
