I didn't realized how much I miss this town. Yes I did miss it and I can't believe it. The town I hated since high school and I missed it.   I think I will be getting some movies for tonight. I think we should have movie night since my brother is going to be home. I got to drive the car today which was nice. I missed driving. I can't wait until this summer because I will have a car to drive.   I haven't even open any of my text books since I have been here. I just don't feel like doing any of it. I will have to do some homework. I think I will get something done tomorrow. Well I have to get going. Have a nice day everyone!
