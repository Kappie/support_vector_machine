I think I finally rolled outta bed a lil before 1. LoL Then I got to work....I got my closet looking really nice...I took all my stuffed animals and put them in a big TV box. They filled the whole thing....So I put most of my shoes on those shelves...and I got all my dolls n barbies all nice in boxes all pilled up in the back and now you can walk in there! I just dont know what im going to do with all those animals...hmm...I'll think later...It looks nice in there now so thats all that matters....Now the rest of the week I get to take everything I mean everything off my walls...shelves, my desk (its a hanging one..odd but *shrug*) tons of posters...all that good stuff. I only have 6 pictures left on my wall...:( Im sure gonna miss all those. They were like wallpapered on there. Im gonna count how many I had up but Im pretty sure it was near 250. Not sure tho. I'll figure it out later. So yeah...I did that all afternoon. Then Grandma H picked me up round 5:45 so we could go out to eat and to the summer theater up at the lakes. We ate at Mrs Ladys...yummy. I haven't ate there since Meghans B-day party a few years back. I had yummy nachos and ofcourse sopapillas (its spelled all weird i dunno...lol) Then we went to the play. It was actually really good. Tho they screwed up our tickets...but it worked out fine. They had a raffle goin on and they picked my cousin Rachel and she got an airfreshener lol and a picture with the *cough*hot*cough* guy...lol sorry. I didn't really mean that...But yeah. We had a good time. Katie was my date tonight LOL. I have so much fun with her....shes in what...6th grade now. Shes my bud. So yeah then Grandma and I had DQ on the way home...I got my normal Mint Oreo. Yum. Tho her driving kinda got me car sick so I doubt I'll be havin that kind for awhile....So yeah. Thats all thats been goin on....catch ya later.
