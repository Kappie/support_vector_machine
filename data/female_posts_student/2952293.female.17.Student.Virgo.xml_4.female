Ace was wearing an Epcot hoodie, and I love Epcot, it's my favorite Kingdom. It was also really funny when the first band was talking. One guy goes, "you can e-mail us and talk about barriers" (they kept mentioning how far away the stage was from the barrier to hold the crowd back) and the other guy goes, "or terriers. BEST IN SHOW!" AHH I thought it was so funny I laughed for like five minutes. But the funniest part was... I think I mentioned that we sat next to this guy and he is new in town and has no friends. He also wore a ring EXACTLY like the Lord of the Rings one. He was obsessed with the band Silverchair. Remember that song "Ana's Song" about anorexia and everything. I go, "Wasn't the lead singer anorexic?" And he told me that his girlfriend influenced him or something and then he became worried about his weight and I go, "what a bitch!" And then he tells us that she is his friend. AHHH! Somehow later on we said something and he was like, "I was anorexic for awhile" Man we messed up with that kid. He kept talking to this kid in the pit at breaks. This kid was really funny. He hates rock videos with "scantily clad" women. He said he likes women, but not in videos like the Perfect Circle's new one. I don't know, he was crazy. So I asked if he liked Britney Spears, and he said no, and then the kid next to us was like "I don't like her, she's too chubby!" WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! Oh but he likes Paris Hilton, no Nicky Hilton- WHATEVER THE HILTON'S SHOULD DIE! Then the kid in the pit tells me my earrings were really long. Who notices that stuff??? When the guy next to us went somewhere for a minute, we moved down seats. The kid in the pit looked at me and then looked around for him. Then when he came back and sat down at the furthest seat, the two guys looked at each other, and I looked back and forth between the two, dude some definite sexual tension was there. IT WAS AWESOME!
