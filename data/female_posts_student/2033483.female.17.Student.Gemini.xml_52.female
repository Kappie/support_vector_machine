Not for the obvious reasons of warm weather and no school, but so I could stay up late and go outside and look at the stars.  There's just something about the stars that has always fascinated me.  Looking up at them, I find myself lost in my own thoughts.  There's an entire world out there that we are completely unaware of.  Their could be another planet out there, that supports life billions upon billions of miles away, where they too, look up at their sky and wonder if we exist.  When you look up at the sky and think about your problems that you encounter from day to day in your life they don't seem so big anymore.   Some people need to look up at the stars and realize for the first time that they are not the center of the Universe.  This may lead them to believe that their world is crashing down on them, but in reality, their world is just beginning.  Don't go through life thinking you're better than anyone else.  Always remember, that the homeless person on the street is just as good as you are.
