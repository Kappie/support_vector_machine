The worst part is that she refuses to see a doctor.  Anyways, I hope she gets better!  *crosses fingers*  Today I'm going with my sister to see if we want to sign up at this new curves by our house.  My friend goes there and she has seen a lot of results in just one month.  My sister doesn't really need it, she's only 15 (going on 16) and only weighs like 105 pounds and I don't weigh that much more (i'm 120) either but I think we're both doing it just to get and stay toned.  Plus, it will give us time to spend quality time together.  I don't live at home so I don't get to see her that often.  As she continues to grow older, we are starting to have a lot more in common...and I don't even want to pull her hair out or yell at her anymore.  I really look forward to the day that me and my sister become closer...she's such a great person.  I really admire the way she's handled her life so far.  At her age, I was already rebelling and acting like an idiot teenager.  She seems to be more in control of her life than I was.   Anyways...hopefully I will get my ass in to shape!!  I thought I'd share this wonderful picture of one of my favorite men...ENJOY!
