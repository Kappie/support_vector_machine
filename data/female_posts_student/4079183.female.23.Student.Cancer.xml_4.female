I have heard that these days many women are choosing to set a date to have their baby on rather than letting nature take it course. They seem to be doing this for their own convenience and I do not agree with this at all. If your schedule is so busy that you have to plan when it would be convenient for you to have a baby then chances are that it is not the right time in your life when you should be having a child. Women's bodies were made to bear children naturally not by an incision and pulling them out. I can understand if this was done in an emergency situation or was necessary, but please... I think people are taking certain practices to levels beyond need.
