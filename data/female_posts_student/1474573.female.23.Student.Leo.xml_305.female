Although I didn't say anything bad about my bosses - I actually really like  them  - I  did  use quotes from emails/conversations that actually occurred yesterday.  SIGH.  Y'know what, for the most part, this job is great and I don't want to lose my job like  urlLink she  did.  It definitely helped to get it out, though.  Thanks, O, for the advice.
