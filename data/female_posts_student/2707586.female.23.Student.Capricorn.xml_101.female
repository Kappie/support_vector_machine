I finally found a place to live and I keep thinking less than a month and the roomie from hell will leave. I guess I was just around more this weekend than usual but she was totally on my nerves. Then we had a fire alarm go off around 8pm last night and running down ten flights of stairs with really slow people in front of you is not fun. Especially when two weeks ago a dorm I used to live in burned down so I was a little freaked out and was a little upset when people were like "Usually it stops by the time I get to the bottom" as that in itself is a reason to go really slow. And then a girl was mad because the RA woke her up and made her get out. I mean don't these people understand that if there was a fire that RA just saved their life? I really need to get out of the dorms.   Anyway hope everyone had a great Easter. Tiff- I missed the family this year! Tell all of them I said HI!
