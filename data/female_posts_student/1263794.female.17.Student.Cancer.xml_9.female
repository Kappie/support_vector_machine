I mean we have school 5 and half hours a day. I come home, I do schoolWORK for about 3 hours, sometimes more. That's almost 9 hours a day spent on school...... WHEN ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TIME TO BE KIDS????...... I mean my childhood is slipping away before my eyes and I don't have the time to cherish it. THIS IS INSANE FOLKS. At this rate I'm gonna have a heart attack before I reach 17.
