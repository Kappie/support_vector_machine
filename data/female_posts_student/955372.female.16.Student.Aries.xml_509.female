Meaning I miss Scrubs and Will and Grace, also it smells like a sock in mum and dads room, which is where they put the computer, so naturally where i am now located. It's really creepy up here, they should really try and lighten the place up with like some.... lamps... updates as things happen. which probably won't be that often.
