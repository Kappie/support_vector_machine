Apparently it's very easy, and the one who usually works there left me a note, but where the note is, and where the keys are I have yet to figure out. I'm kind of unhappy. I should have given this more thought. I get paid for it, which is nice, but still. Yeah, so church today was some big feast day. Mom made me get all dressed up and stuff. She woke me up because she was ironing my pants. Mom is getting to be more and more of a holy roller every day. She is the church lady, as dad said she is the matriarch. Something about elephants and all the people turn to Mom. I dunno, dad babbles on like that sometimes, which is usually funny. The church was packed, and at the end dad started talking to this guy, so I had to just stand there. I just wanted to push dad aside and run to the car, and get away from all the people. There were some actually not to bad looking people in church. Not that I was looking or anything... There were also screaming babies. I hate summer people. They always invade my space and are so dam noisey. You want to be noisey, do it at your own dam house, don't go causing a ruckas where I live. I want to go meet some of them, but there's this one girl there that is a bitch (I have hung out with her before) and well because of her I don't really want to go and meet people. Not that I would in any case, seeing and how I'm kind of to shy to make a first move in that area. Though it would be nice to have people to hang around with. I'm starting to get really bored. Only 22 more days to school, then I can actually feel like I'm doing something. Mom is taking me to this reptile show sometime this week, I'm actually really looking forward to it, she said we could take Jamie too, if he was interested. I dunno, reptiles don't seem like his type of thing. Anyway, he's back from where ever he was, so ttfn.
