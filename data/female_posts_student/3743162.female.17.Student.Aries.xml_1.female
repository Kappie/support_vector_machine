Anyhow it was my boyfriend, wanting to hang out, so he came over and we walked to a restaurant for lunch. It was really fun, we goofed around for hours walking around and it's sooooooooo nice outside, like 20 degrees, which is really hot for alberta. I had so much fun but then I had to go to volunteering at the Nursing Home. (I play BINGO there... yes I know, it's very stereotypical)  Anyways I really realized how much fun it is to do nothing with someone... it's nice to be going out with someone that you can be really comfortable with, and though we're really used to each other we still can suprise each other and it's still great to talk to him... I know I sound so young, I feel so stupid when I talk about being in love and stuff just becuase I honestly know nothing about it, except how I feel... it's like, what do I know about being in love and commitment and trust and stuff like that, I'm only 17, but a part of me wants to think that I know tons about it becuase I've expirienced it... who knows... I think that I think too much!!! I should just enjoy myself but I constantly worry more than I need to.
