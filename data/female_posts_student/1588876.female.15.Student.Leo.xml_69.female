Mullet lived in a trailer park (or as the p.c. assholes call it, a "mobile community") and one day he thought, "Hey, my cousin, Pete, is a landscaper. maybe he can take a weed-wacker to my head." Joe couldn't decide how he wanted his hair styled, long or short? it was the question of the day. he simply could not come to a conclusion, so he decided that he wanted both long and short hair. he had a semi-conservative look in the front and then a party in the back, with which he could braid, perm, and style. he of course named it after his classy self; therefore, calling it the "mullet".
