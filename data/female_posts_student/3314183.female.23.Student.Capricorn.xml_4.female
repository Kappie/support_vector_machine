Everything is about you. you're cold over there, you're having a flu, you've got not enough warm clothes. Every bloody thing is about you, yourself and you. YOU ARE the MOST SELFISH PRICK I've seen in this bloody f***ing world.  Why do you even msg then? I feel like I'm sinking. I can't breathe. I must be biggest idiot in the world. You are bloody lying straight in my face. YET! YET! I'm f***ing taking it. Taking it all in. Without any confrontation. Without even asking for an explanation.  Ask you when coming back. F***ing tell me you duno. When the bloody date was already confirmed two weeks ago. F***ing think I'm an idiot right. Maybe u knoe tat I koe. But it's like so what if u koe I'm lying. If ur not happy about it, wanna leave, feel free to ya. Nobody's stopping you.  I'm such a loser. Allow myself to be manipulated by you.
