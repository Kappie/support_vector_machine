The secret is using turkey bacon (mainly because it gets crispy after less cooking time than regular bacon, plus it's less bad on the heart) and cilantro mayonaise.  Now, the cilantro mayonaise is one of the few good things I got out of the South Beach Diet Cookbook.  South Beach isn't nearly as dangerous as I think Atkins is - "eat a pound of bacon with breakfast, a pound of hamburger in your patty melt for lunch, and a sensible dinner of a meat lover's pizza with the crust made of sausage!"  I'm all about cutting down on refined carbs. Heck I even made a batch of Moosewood Fudge Brownies with whole wheat flour.  So there.  But dang it, meat is expensive!  I did lose about 17 pounds with South Beach last spring, but at least 10 pounds was due to the lightening of my wallet with buying all that expensive meat.  I dig me some meat, but dang it, beans are cheaper.  As a fellow seminary student once told me, "I'm a freegan.  I only eat meat when it's free."  Back to cilantro mayo - to (approximately) make it, I use 1/2 cup cilantro, 1/2 cup light mayo, 1 tsp lemon juice (or lime if you've got it), a minced clove of garlic, and 1/2 tsp of soy sauce.  Mix and let refrigerate for a while for the flavors to mix.  It's one of my new favorite condiments. =================== Concerning the friends, Praise the Lord, folks are moving back to campus.  Not that my current on campus friends aren't wonderful (y'all rock!) but I'm sure I'm boring folks with my tales of personal growth and despair from the hospital.  If more folks show up, I don't actually have to go out and get some new experiences.  That's the key to life people.  You don't need to go out and get new stories.  Forget actually having a perpetually interesting life.  You just need to get new friends that haven't heard the old stories.
