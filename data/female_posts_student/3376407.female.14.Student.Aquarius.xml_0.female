And because most of the time I'm swimming it can get quite boring. But if you read my blog, which actually I haven't told anyone I have one yet, you don't want to hear about how boring my life is, but about the exciting parts.  On the 3, church is have a 4th of July get-together fellowship thingy at the Owens Farm. My family is camping out over night the 2nd, which I am so very not excited, because when ever my family goes camping.... it ends up not being so very fun. :( I think you get the point? And I need to go, Later, Ellie
