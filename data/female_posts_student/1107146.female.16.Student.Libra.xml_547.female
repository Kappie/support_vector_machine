Well...I randomly showed up at her house after school (after "assuring" her that the 30th is not a day of importance, tosh!) with her favourites...daisies, of course. And in three colours and three of each, of course. And I also gave her some chocolate covered cherries and blueberries from Starbucks. And then we had a "boring date" until I had to go and get Katie from Color Guard. It was an awesome day...she's so incredibly wonderful.  You never answered my question, Rosie...why are you "observant"?
