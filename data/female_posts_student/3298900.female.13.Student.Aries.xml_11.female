The life, never-ending, the river always flows. When will the songbirds sing? When will the moon lose its glow?  Dreams aint reality, neither are they true, Why do pple evn dream, when nothing ever happens to u?  Entwined on a fence, trying to let go. For God gave us grace, to go with the flow.  Lonely, even i feel sometimes. When can't i comprehend, What i say sometimes?  So maybe time has passed too fast,  to let us live our dreams, to show ourselves, what we will really be....
