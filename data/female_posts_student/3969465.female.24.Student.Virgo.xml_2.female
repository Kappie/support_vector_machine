Mainly I reckon because I am once more reunited with Gwendolyn, who is none other than my faithful bike!  I'm supposed to be writing my research outline now so all the hard work of finding a place and getting affiliation with the university of Frankfurt will pay off, but anyone looking out of the window can see why I'm not doing any work. It's nice and sunny and the beach is calling out to me!  Anyhow, I am glad to be back in Brighton or - and no one who has ever heard me complain will believe that- I am glad to be back in the UK. The reason for that is very simple indeed- Germany surprised me by how foreign and strange it had become. Okay, not really 'strange', but just strange enough to make me feel alien. Things like dividing up litter before throwing it away, weighing your own veg before paying for it and the general rudeness of shop-assistants and random people in the street, made me feel more than a little alienated. In short, I am not entirely sure about moving back since getting a culture-shock seems way too silly for me to get when in actual fact I have lived for 18 years in that country. And still the UK felt like 'home' when I came back and realized how glad I was to be back in a country where I know my way around.   Everyone laughed at me, when I said that I have difficulties with German mannerisms, claiming that they weren't that different from English ones. Well, I believed all those saying that and nevertheless found myself in situations that required appropriate answers that I simply didn't have anymore. Example: Sitting in a beergarden, I lit up a cigarette. The smoke from my fag slowly wafted towards a girl sitting close by. Obviously a militant non-smoker of the sort that gives you evil looks whilst probably imagining you slowly rotting and screaming for help, she cleared her throat and barked at me: "Oi, you! Can you put that fag somewhere else?"  No 'please', no 'thank you', while I, getting flustered answered: "Of course, I am ever so sorry that I didn't notice- sorry!" Obviously not the appropriate answer. The look she gave me was more than puzzled, while I was getting annoyed over the fact that she had been so rude and I had clearly not given then right answer which possibly might have been: "If you don't like it go somewhere else, now p*** off!" Chances are that everyone else noticing that exchange probably thought I was licking her arse, which is a highly annoying thing to think!  In any case, that is just one example why I'm glad to be back in the UK, even though I'm not all that glad to have to write my dissertation now and pack up my room as soon as possible afterwards then. In fact, I don't want to go to Germany. I mean, it's a nice place and I have lovely friends there, but it feels alien and weird and only now do I realize why everyone always says that Germans are a) rude and b) don't have a sense of humour. About the latter- well, yes, I am a cynic, but am I bitter? I don't think so...
