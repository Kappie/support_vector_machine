Saw Ross and Kurt there and Lizzie decided not to join Jessica and I but opt to join Chad to LHS's play instead.  After the play I drove home and worked on my AP History project till 1:00 a.m.  Saturday: I had my final confirmation meeting with Susan.  Thank God it was with Susan b/c I don't think I was prepared to have one with Father.  I passed with flying colors.  When I got home my mom and I went shopping so she could finally get off my case about not having presents for me.  The mall and Best Buy were insane!  Looking back...between Renae and my dad I don't think their was a time where I wasn't on my cell phone or it was ringing during my shopping trip with the moms.  When we got home it was time for Renae to come over and pick me up so we could use her free tickets to the Skyforce game.  I remember a time when they were actually good.  They suck now!  So do the Skyleaders.  Not ment to be racist but if you're gonna act black and shake your booty you better have a booty to shake Skyleaders!  After the game we went to Hy-Vee so Alisha could get chapstick and then we saw AJ (the boy) and decided to follow him.  Although we lost him b/c he drives really fast.  Even though Renae was huhum...speeding, we didn't catch up.  Then we found Ross and Kurt and followed them.  Fun times.  Met up with them at the stop light, followed them to Chance's house and then to the gas station.  We sorta mingled at the Gas Sations.  After Ross and Kurt I came home and worked on my AP History project till 12:30 a.m.  Sunday: I had a retreat at church from 1 to 8.  Confirmation is on January 11th, you'll have to come!  I was happy b/c the boy that was in my group for our normal classes was in my group for retreat and wow I have a crush on him.  Too bad he goes to O'G!  He's a drummer too!  This is the one you would approve of Renae, the one in the really sucky band but is forgiven for being in the sucky band b/c he's beautiful and plays the drums.  Sorta like hot boy that's not so hot boy anymore b/c he got a haircut.   When I came home I worked on my, guess what, AP History project.      Today was Monday.  I'm sure you already know that though.  Not much happened today.  Mr. P went crazy on Renae, Alisha and I after he found out about our speeding.  Oh well that was a bit funny.  We had fun googlism-ing our names in Newspaper.  I know productive.  I bet we'll have school tomorrow despite the blowing wind, snow and praying done by every student tonight.    Goodnight all!
