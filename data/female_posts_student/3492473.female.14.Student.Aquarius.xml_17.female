The sky was acting all weird and stuff and you know it's gonna storm so I'm like, "Mom, our garbage cans are in the street." The wind blew 'em there. So she says, "Wanna go put them back on the lawn and take the dogs out?" So I'm like fine whatever and I go outside to do that. I wasn't wearing a bra though! (I sleep without a bra on) I hate walking around without a bra. It feels weird! I like my breasts to be supported, thank you very much! I feel very naked without a bra. Just felt like sharing.
