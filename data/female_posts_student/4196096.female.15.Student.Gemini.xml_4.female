So tonight we are camping out in the tent again!And the boy's are coming over. Yipee!!! I think I get to see Sean tonight. Yeah fina-frickenly! I miss that boy. And I ike him like I like brownie mix, and guess what! That's kinda a lot. HAHA. "AND YOUR THE ONLY WHO DRIVES ME KICKIN AND SCREAMIN!!! YOUR THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOW'S EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN." We are singing that right now as I type. SO yes, back to tonight. Don't you wish you could be here tonight with us? We are going to have fun.......Oh wait? If the Fab 4 are together then um duh we will have fun! Brianne is like a butterfly. I hope the train doesn't de-rail tonight Shahrom might get scuured. And I think I would too. Especially since we will be in the tent and it will hit us! We are making Harley laugh. He's a cute guy. I made a new screen name today...and you all better IM me on it: MY BLISSFUL KISS . It means my heavenly kiss. Haha, I love how it's really gay. Well, we need to get back to singing and dancing so I'm out for now.
