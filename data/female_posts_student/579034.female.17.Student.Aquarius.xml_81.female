Now, is it just me or has Greg been using that term a bit much lately? I think it's the word of the month or something. So, Melly and I have instituted Tripple C (Me/ Cunt, Melly/ Cunt, Erica/Cunt). As new members arrive (and their certainly will be with Gregs use of the word these days) the name will change. Till then...  vive la Tripple C !
