All these rich people sit at home flooded with money while their is always some person out their with no money and probably close to death. Probably having a disease that could be easily cured if the right medicene was administered to them. If I ever am rich *COUGH* then I'll do a load of charity work and stuff! Yeay! And of course I'll buy Sandwhich Island or some thing stupid. So many people to help and so little time. Don't worry Izzy if I become a psychiatrist you can be my first patient. :D Oh wait, my Dad's first sorry. Going a bit weird today... (just a bit?) Hey I'll upload the third Mr Fopple chapter! Yeay!  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net/read.php?storyid=787588  How strange! Well Izzy get working on chapter 4! Yeay I can bug her about it again!
