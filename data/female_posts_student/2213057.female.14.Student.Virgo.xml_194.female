'no you retard, you don't squeeze, you suck!' well it sounded really bad, but i only said that cause she squeezed my apple juice and it went everywhere. then i went to rachelle's. we watched sabrina and the fresh prince of bel air, then i fell asleep on her. in her room we both went with the intention to sleep, but ended up throwing stuff at each other. so funny, we were flexing our bums and putting them in the air to see how funny it looked. we also dressed up, i had this wide flowery belt across my head, rachelle had purple soccer socks, little shorts on over her jeans and duckers on. ahahaha, it was fun. then we went bowling. i love wes! he is the greatest! he is honestly the best. i dunno... jon was acting sorta weird. and by the way kristin, he can't go to your cottage. wes, rachelle and i went down to dollar hub. it rocked.
