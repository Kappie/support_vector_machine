Some hopw my rabbits back in her hutch, she escaped last night and we couldn't get her back in! Aww, I want Cleo back. :( She's at the cattery with the rest of the monsters because the kitchen's being fitted. Mango would probably get stuck in the fridge or something if they were here! Wow, are they here? Looks like they are! ...they're upstairs? And the kitchens downstairs? Have I missed something? Oh, I might have to go, they're gonna turn the electrics off. :( Back to the ice age I guess. Word of advice ...pink is the colour of the world. Have fun figuring that out! Bubi!
