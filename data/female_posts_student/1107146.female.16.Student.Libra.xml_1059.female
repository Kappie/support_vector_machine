Josh ascended the stairs after reading The Blog, a site dedicated primarily to the vastly interwoven lives and troubles of a few students at BHS, an oppressed sort who really couldn't give a shit less what anyone thought of their methods. So it was that they started a BLog with Lindsey Reid as its leader, and therein their worldly and strange issues came to life upon the Internet for the world to see.  Weeks passed, the BLog was filled with odd topics: a strange tale of the boy Josh and a girl named Leigh Anne, the endless mental struggle of one of the sites lesser contributers, Rosie, and the endless wisdoms of the entity known as Will, who responded without fail where needed.  But it came to be one day that Lindsey was scheduled for a cruise, and through some twist of fate, she met Mitch.  Mitch was a confusing boy. At first, it was thought that he was a nicer sort, a calm variety, charming and appealing, but time has a strange way of breaking these confines and showing people for reality. It was that Mitch's ambition and stupidity bled through and together one day, and he began hitting on Lindsey, much to her and the rest of the Bloggers' knowledges, without much subtlety. As his forwardness wore on, the BLog was posed with an interesting question: who the HELL is this guy?  The question in Josh's mind, however, was "what is grind dancing?". He ascended those stairs to his sister's room, his sister, the dancer of years. Surely, she would know this strange sort of dancing.  "Hey Kate," said Josh, opening the door and looking to his sister, who was busily working on a project and talking on the phone simultaneously. "Hey," she said, turning her attention to the slightly-longer-than-it-should-be haired boy. It was an assorted rarity that he would ever bother her sister, and the abberation from the norm was actually welcomed in a nearly invariable life.  "Umm, got a question, I thought you would know," "Shoot," "'Kay, what is grind...dancing?" Her eyebrows suddenly shot up and she stuttered a bit, laughing nervously, as if stopping herself from blurting some awful truth. Josh suddenly felt embarrased and said, "Oh...it's " bad " stuff isn't it?" "Haha," she started with an orai smile, "it  is ,"  It came to pass that Josh became extremely wary of the Mitch person, instantly went out and bought Lindsey an easily concealable shotgun, which he loaded with  SLUGS , because he wanted to make ready-sure that if the Mitch kid were to put his "grind" moves on (and for those who haven't put the pieces together yet, take the name of the dance and apply it to two human bodies) that Lindsey would be well-equipped to deal with the perverted youngster with due finality. Though all applauded the boy's forwardness and utter "balls", they also jeered it, and laughed at him ever after, until they all had hemmorages and died.  Summary: I ask my sister what grind dancing is, she flips out because it's a "bad" dance, as in morally wrong. Uhoh. I thought he was an idiot, now not only to I know, but I can also tack on the adjective "horny" to that "idiot".   O ye gods, what shall you do? :) Hope you're having TONS of fun with this situation.
