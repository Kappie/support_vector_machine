Then, when I wake up, even if I have a little bit more energy, I am insanely starving and always have awful headaches.  So, then the rest of  my night is ruined because I have so much less time to do my homework and I constantly feel like I am going to throw up and can't even concentrate on my homework anyways.  And then, later, I can't fall asleep at night since I had just slept that afternoon.  Then, the next day, I am just as exhausted as I was the day before.  I hate it.  Why am I always soo tired?  Ad the thought of being productive for the whole day without being exhausted is inconceivable to me.  Jeez, but I can't have caffeine or anything because it makes me even more tired and gives me pounding headaches.  Any suggestions on how to get over my extreme tiredness all the time?   My mom brought home 3 driver's manuels today... 3, does she realize there's only one of me?
