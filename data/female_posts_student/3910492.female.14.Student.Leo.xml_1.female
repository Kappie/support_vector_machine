I am like, sooooo scared becasue I am going out with Coy, and Jon wants me to break up with him, and I don't want to!!! I like Coy a lot, but I sorta like Jon, but I like Coy SOOOOOOO much better. But I would go out with Jon durring the school year, but not durring summer. School would be fine, but I wouldn't like summer relationships with a guy at my school. I like to have long distance relationships with a guy durring the summer, and durring the school year some times, but the summer relationships don't work so well for me when I am going to the same church and school as the guy... but it is soooooo akward! I sat on the bus with him, next to him all night! And we like, slept next to eachother, and his head was like, an inch from my sholder! I didn't want to wake him up to move it, but it was akward!!!I am sooooooooooooooo confused! I hate mixed feelings! Like, I have mixed feelings about Jon, I mean, I like him, but I have a b/f! If I didn't, then things would change. Well.... I have to go!           XOXOXO           Geneva
