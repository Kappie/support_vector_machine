Someone quit so I guess I have to step up to the plate. Anyway, my plans for tonight have to be put on hold, because, I don't want to be going into work with a major hangover. Then after I leave at eight, I am going to be coming in again at 3, so that gives me no time to sleep. That also gives me a good oportunity to hang out with some friends. Then I'll go home and sleep for the entire Sunday. So I might be taking Sunday off as well as Saturday. It's all cool though because someone else that I won't mention will pick up the slack. Also there could be a brand new member to the Kakutama Sign crew, if she is up to joining.
