Just as you need qualifications to get a job, herein are the qualifications you must have to get love°o.O     °o.OTrue love is unconditional and everlasting, it is established over time and validated with memories of the past°o.O     °o.OTrue love, like many things, can only be seen in the eyes of the beholder. It cannot be jealous, proud, or anxious; it is what is found in the depths of your heart, and longs only for one who's heart longs for the same things as your own°o.O        °o.OTrue love begins, when you think more about the other person, then his or her reaction to you. When you dare to reveal yourself, and when you dare to be vulnerable°o.O       °o.OTrue love has no definition, for if you define the love you say is true, you have given it boundaries and conditions, and love, true love, has neither°o.O        °o.OTrue love allows great space, great scope, and possession is not part of it. Possession is simply a stage at the beginning, really nothing more than the marking of fresh circumstances. The commitment is to be there and allow all manner of growth and opportunity. To allow divergence. To allow privation even in a sense of unity, because unity depends on parts°o.O
