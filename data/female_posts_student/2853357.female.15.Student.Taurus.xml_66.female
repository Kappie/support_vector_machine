And not only have I gotten ZLICH response (mostly this past summer) but I've been working my ass of (most of the time) on it.  I remember I had that 2 month gap and it very much killed my story to the point where I don't have anymore readers.  And now every time it takes me a while to write, I start to get panicky about not writing... Because then people forget. And even if they do come across it again, they aren't interested.   God, am I paranoid or what?  My whole stupid summer has been revolving around this. And what have I done? Like what... 3 chapters? 2 FRIGGEN MONTHS!!!  I actually wanted it finished by the end of this summer... but I haven't. No where close... instead I keep expanding. I keep adding and adding and now the whole friggen thing has become just a very complex overly used jumble of hate driven revenge.  Is that right?  Well, she doesn't HATE her father... Does she?   God, even I don't know. Now what does that tell people?  That I'm a horrible writer that can't even write a friggen plot? I have NO idea where this is going. I'm just writing on spur of the moment... I have to just sit down and think up a plot instead of just letting it flow.   KILLING ME!  I think it's because- well... I'm writing about when she goes to the DEC meeting. And you'd expect MM to... what? Would be let this kind of thing slide? Or would he rant and rave? Or maybe he'd rant and rave but let it slide... Maybe he'd be happy? I don't even know the friggen character. He's as much of a mystery to me, the author, as he is to the reader.  I'm probably giving it away.     Okay... that's me ranting. I think i'll go give myself a paper cut now.   Patty
