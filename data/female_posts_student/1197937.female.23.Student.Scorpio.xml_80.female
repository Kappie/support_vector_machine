God, love, normalcy...i don't believe in anything anymore. well, maybe not so much these things, but ppl who tout these things. you call yourself a christian? then wipe off that hypocritical sunday face and be a real person. you love me? prove it by the endurance of subtle actions and not by words and romantic gestures please.  you think you're more normal than the person you're laughing at? sorry, i don't think anyone's normal. not you, not me, not him or her. i don't know what normal is anymore. i don't like this. i've been feeling black for a long time. not the race, just the mood. every night opens up a can of worms, which is probably why i can't sleep. i guess i'm just pissed off in general, mostly at myself. i wonder, if i had a painting of myself like the picture of dorian gray, what would i look like? dunno, but i sure wouldn't have the galls to look at it these days.   okay. i finally got a little bit of it off my chest. this blogging thing does have some use. let's see if i sleep better tonight. i go do something i should be doing now.
