Because of the feeling of my warm matress awaited me.My nice covers when over my sholder and i felt so warm and loved.My head on my soft sweet pellow comfurted my head as my matress contured the rest of my fragile body.And as i closed my eyes, everything got better.As soon as i closed my eyes, i knew everything was going to be alright.While at my cousins, it was very hard to sleep on a matress so hard and in the same bed as my kicking sister.But in my bed, im all alone.All the room to myself and all my dreams able to explore the room without anybody awaking and bugging them.And for the first time in one month (I stayed exactly one month at my cousins) I had finally had a dream.You know what kind of dream? My usual, non making sence dreams.And my non making sence dreams means SO much to me...It just makes me feel happy and sad, excited and grumpy at the same time.Oh how happy i was to see my worst enemy flying away in a hot air balloon and yet i was sad to see my only compitition fly away and never to be seen again.I have so many different feelings in my non making sence dreams and im so happy to be seeing them again.Seeing the things i missed the most that i couldnt have had for 1 month.Im for sure going to be lighting up all the candles around my room probably tomorrow at night.. it'll be relaxing and thats for sure =)
