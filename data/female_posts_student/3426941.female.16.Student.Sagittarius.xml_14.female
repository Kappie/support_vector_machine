It was basically seven days where I could loaf around and do absolutely nothing. It was uneventful except for the fact that I found the most fantabulous purse at an antique shop I frequent and what was even more tanfastic was that it cost...wait for it......... 18 fucking dollars. Yes you heard...um.. read me. 18 dollas'.  WARNING: THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO READ ME POURING MY HEART OUT SHOULD SIGN OFF NOW.seriously. Now.  So, I was reading Ryan's blog and then I clicked over to Dan's blog, then to Billy's. I realized that I have absolutely no life. I am sitting at my computer on a sunday night and I have no one to talk to and no one to be out with. That wouldn't be such a bad thing, except nobody's gonna even read this blog so it won't matter anyway. I have lived my whole life waiting at home for something exciting to finally happen. And finally it did. Last year about the middle of february my life changed drastically. I did something that I really never thought I could do. I walked into a boys school and auditioned for a musical. The audition part was easy. Walking into the Emerson lobby at Desmet high school with all of those guys was not.   I was originally in it for just the experience of being in another show. Just to get more exerience with performing and being onstage which is a passion of mine, no more than a passion, a love. I am in love with being onstage. I love absolutely everything about it. I love the rehearsals when I am being yelled at by the bitchy but talented Zoe. I love how my feet bleed after being in character shoes for four hours straight trying to get the damn step down. I love that feeling of being backstage waiting for the curtain to open and to feel the lights shine down on the caked on make-up.I love it. And for a while, I thought thats all I would ever become. An impassioned girl who performed, and then a woman who performed, and then, of course, an old woman with nothing left but stale memories of musty curtains and callused feet, the scars of the hell I put them through.   Last year though, not only did I gain experience in the theater, I gained experience in people. I actually feel like last year I really lived. For the first time ever, I was a real person with real friends who really cared whether I had a crappy day, who cared whether I recieved an award or got another amazing part in a play which I'd always wanted. I found who I was at Desmet. And I met someone who has made me a better person.(you know who you are.)  The fact is, most of the people I developed a close relationship with were older. They are wonderful people who are so talented and so amazingly kind, even if it wasn't real. Thank you to those people who know who you are. I will never ever forget my experiences.  The fact that these people are leaving is very sad to me. They are moving on while I am staying behind with a handful of memories and a book full of photographs. I am heartbroken that these people who meant so much to me are moving on with their lives.  I've done this before you know. People move away and promises are made. Promise to write, to call, to email, to im. I value these promises with everything I posess. One such person,( again, you know who you are,) I have faith that they will keep in tough regularly. This is one I'm gonna try to make work. But those promises that you have made can always be broken. It makes me sad, but they are moving into happier places. Trust me, there are far better places to make your life than St. Louis.   Good luck to all of you, and know that you have made a profound difference in my life. I willnever forget you. (especially you.)  I'm scared.  I have faith but Im scared. Unfortunately I've become too good at saying goodbye. Goodbye and goodluck. may you be in heaven fifteen minutes before the devil knows you're there! (just a little irish blessing.)
