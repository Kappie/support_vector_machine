I can't hold it in any longer. _____________________________________________________________________  The date is the twenty-sixth of June. The day is Saturday. The time is 6.00 PM. He sits in the MRT that has just reached Changi Airport MRT Station. The doors have long since opened, leaving the way for him unobstructed. The only obstacle in his way now is making the decision.  He has made it thus far, out of his house and down the entire MRT line to get to the airport. And now, it is so difficult just to take the few steps out of the train. His mind is in turmoil. He is struggling with his feelings. What should he do? Sitting right across from the open doors, he toys with his handphone. He knows all the details: Terminal 1, Gate 16, Flight QF 6. All he needs is the willpower to get there. It's so easy. He just has to stand up and march out of this train which is going to close its doors at any minute.  Why did he ever come? It was so stupid. He didn't care anymore. She'd never notice if he was there or not. All he would accomplish would be making a fool of himself. But he'd admitted to himself, he was still madly in love with her. He couldn't let her go just like that. She was still very much a part of him.  Just remembering how much she meant to him gave him renewed courage and boldness. Adrenaline flooded his body as he stood up and made a dash through the adjoining carriages and out the door.  I'm coming,  he thought to her,  wait for me.  ___________________________________________________________________  For part two, BUG MICHELLE TAN FOR IT!!! The true story will be revealed after part two. Stay tuned!
