You just bother and take time to come up with something "philosophical" or humoros only to complain about it after you've typed it all out. Paradoxical.  Oh well. Got my period unexpectedly. Not that anyone of you needed to know that - but I just felt like sharing. It just came out, all outta the blue, no warning signs whatsoever (okay, maybe SOME warning signs which I chose to ignore: a few weird cramps a few days again). It didn't even come according to schedule. Oh no. It just came. Caught me off-guard. Full force pain.  I had to skip german. My first class in almost 2 months. Yeah. That's going to help me. Missing out on ONE class is like just ... hangman. You really do miss out alot in that 3 1/2 hours of not being there. I'll just have to revise and pretend I know what I'm doing I guess. Wish me luck.  Nothing much has happen. I'd usually complain and say what a pathetic unsocial person I am being at home for always 10 days now - but somehow, I'm enjoying this peace and quiet. Money is NOT being spend, I don't need to tweeze my eyebrows or my armpits, no need to figure out what to wear - I can be at home looking like a complete drag and no one cares. It's perfect. Curling up with my books, with not a thing in the world to do but occupy myself. It's all really boring to be honest - but somehow soooo tranquil.  Been thinking about the future again. I'm still scared of it. Before I atleast had a rough sketch on what I planned to do after I graduate; now I'm just lost. I keep on coming up with other plans, erasing the previous ones which I've managed to cojure up so perfectly. I'm just to fickled. But then again, it is my future; I should be open to any possibility of having something better and more exciting - but there's no direction. It's just ideas. Ideas everywhere. But no promise, no concrete good-outcome, simply no direction.  I'll have to think about this future thing real seriously soon.
