I mean, I guess I've dated other boys and had "official" relationships that didn't last very long, but me and Mr. M. . . . it was what you imagine when you hope for the inseperable sort of friendship that has a little romance mixed in as well.   Mr. M and I met when he was a senior and I was a freshman in college. We dated for about two years, but I still think about him.  I wonder if, when I have a little tug in my heart that wished he were here, what I'm really wishing for is what we were and not him exactly. But, even though I want to get married within the next few years, and even though I feel those little tugs every now and again when something triggers a remembrance of Mr. M, right now I'm so focused on getting my life up and running with grad school and other things, being in love isn't on the top of my list of things to participate in.  I, like the majority of the world, have never been good in relationships. As I look back, I see that I have either felt as if I needed out, rushed things, or just  . . . well, I can't pinpoint how I went wrong with Mr. A junior year, but I'm sure it was something. Oh, it was inadequacy. Okay, so add that to the list. So far I'm not worried. I guess this entry doesn't have a point. My intention, when I started out, was to write about how wonderful it was with Mr. M and ask how someone can long for something they've never experienced. But then he IM'd me (yes, Mr. M) and  . . . I don't know. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm thinking about just deleting this entry, but I've spent 10 minutes on it, so I wouldn't want to waste that 10 minutes of my life by deleting it. Anyway, sometimes it's hard to imagine myself with anyone but him. But I don't like him anymore. Right? I guess there's not anyone I like. And that's okay. (shrugs shoulders). I have other things to think about. Like grad school and my friends and . . . it's just that the summer weather makes me wish I had someone madly in love with me to gaze at the stars with and muse about life. Someone familiar, someone I loved back, someone innocent and boyish and godly. As long as I have all my friends though . . . .  This post has no point, yet it is a very good representation of the conflicting views of a girl in her 20s.  Donations for therapy and grad school are not expected but will most certainly not be refused. Applications for a summer fling will be accepted through May 5th.
