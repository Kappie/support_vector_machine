We went to my father's hometown to celebrate my birthday and that was also the time my friends and i gathered.  But we're not complete: Xyra has some work, Arrah was far from us, and Chickay she's not at home.  Yet, we enjoyed.  I thought it would be really that fun.  But no, it didn't.  I think my uncle hates me.  He's harsh and I don't like him either.  That reason I have this notion that I'm living in hipocrisy. Whatever it is, damn I don't care!!! I'm tougher than hell!     June 1  - Orientation.  I met new friends and new classmates.  I think we have the most "kaloko" section.  We are only six girls.  And our boy classmates are crazy going people.      June 2  - 2nd day orientation.  If I was happy on June 1, on June 2 I really have a fun time. James was nice but 2 days were not enough to judge him, of course.  Cyrus was great too.  Enough with these guys.  How about my girl pals?  Hmmm...Vania she's not talking much, that way I wanna take a nap. Rue, she's pretty and I like her. Mona's weird. And the rest were fine.  We had this activity and james and I were groupmates and some of my boy classmates who were insane.  You bet, our room was filled of laughter.    And that ends!!!
