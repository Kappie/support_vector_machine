I tried, for around the hour, giving reasons of changing it, but he wouldn't change his mind. Later, I said, "You didn't give us back our homework, and we need those to study." I really thought I nailed it big this time. He said there would be time at the end of the day for him to give it back. I argued saying, "But we only have 5 minutes left, and we're still not done the races." I have good comebacks I have to admit. But at times, I can be the most dumbest person alive. The bell rang, and that meant the day was over. I said, "Yay now our test is on Monday, Mr. Leung said it wasn't. I was so shocked, I was thinking how could all those people on the buses leaving get their homework papers? I didn't know what to do. He talked to Ms Oberoi and they agreed that the test would be tomorrow, but only percentage would be on Monday.   I feel like the biggest nerd now. I'm talking about how panicky I was about the Math test. What made things worse was that my playing test was tomorrow too. I came upstairs and Mrs. Arbo said that all the flutes were gone. I was about to die. I said my test was tomorrow, and I couldn't go any earlier because I was helping with track. She said all I could do was come early the next day and practise. I really thought I was going to die now. I was freaking out. I started panicking and walked back and forth, probably hyperventilating? I'm not very sure.   I was in the hallway and people were handing out our math homework. I saw Safee and Anoosh walking by. They both came to the big crowd of people getting their homeworks. I didn't know why I did it, but I took Safee's trumpet, and started to crazy. He already knew I was crazy. I guess that's what happens when stress comes pouring out of you. We talked about weird things and came out of the school together. We still have the funny, silly,weird friendship relationship, that I got to admit. Joey saw us and whispered to me if I was going to talk to him about "stuff". I knew what she meant, I said I didn't know. I really didn't know. She asked Safee, "Are you going to walk her home?" And what shocked me was, he said "yes". I said that my house was far, I say that every time obviously.   So we walked, well I was way ahead since I was going crazy and was carrying him trumpet and skateboard for him. He was injured so he couldn't catch up, I feel so proud =). We were at his street and I thought,  okay bye now , but that wasn't it. He actually really meant it. That he was going to walk me home. All I thought was,  Wow this is his first time that he ever did that.  When we got to my house, I didn't go. I never went home directly from school. I always to went to some places that kept me from forgetting my memories, of..us. We walked all the way to Headwaters, Safee said if I wanted to go to Kelvin's house with him. I said I didn't know him and it would be rude if I did. I said I had to walk him there because of kidnappers, then he said that I should be the one worried about kidnappers. We got to Kelvin's and I was on my way to leave. But that wasn't it again. He said to wait for him because he was going to walk me home. I said no, obviously. That's just plain rude if you say, okay walk me home. I walked away and he asked me if I wanted him to again. I said it was okay. Does it mean a yes or no? I said no quietly, but really I did want him too. He didn't argue. When I said bye, I also wanted to say "congratulations.." and walk away, but I couldn't.  Congrats to you and her, now I don't see the sad you, but who you really are..  I walked home alone. I didn't even know why I thought this for a split second, but I thought he was going to run after me, stupid huh? I guess so. I was just planning to go to the pond, but I didn't.  I just walked home alone..
