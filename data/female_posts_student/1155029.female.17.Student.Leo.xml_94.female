There's something extremely rewarding about telling that man exactly what a jackass he is.  One more day of school, and then it's one week of sweet summer before summer school kicks in.  The well awaited  Search for Johnny  starts filming mid-June.  Rumor has it, the directors like cream-filled doughnuts. wink wink.
