Yes, it's a real aquarium. While the fishies won't actually be sharing a tank with the toilet, I think I'd still feel embarassed using it- "erm sorry fish, I drank a lot of water today, please don't look at me..."  If you're not quite as shy as I am, then you can have yours custom made to order, for $1100.
