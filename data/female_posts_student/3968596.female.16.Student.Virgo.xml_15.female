Going clockwise: Carissa, Pejmon (in the blue), my little brother Kevin sitting in the other chair, my little sister Valerie, and that dork in the front is Ryan.       Anica , this is the little 3 yr old terror herself.       Pej trying to be an alcoholic ...lol actually it's just a too-gross-for-words energy drink. But we're saying it's beer, lol.       Maji's Cake --ube flavored, wasn't so bad until I discover the icing turned lips blue.      Here's  Kevin w/ Anica and Jordan the poodle ---poor pooch got dragged around A LOT. That's animal abuse ::sigh:: when will those crazy kids learn... -_-       Valerie  actually turned green. She got sick from the car ride over. It was funny. I never thought you could actually turn that color.      It's a  rose and cute lolly!  I picked it up from one of the vases as a souvenir. Nabbed the last one too.
