I hurt very badly right now. Like I could die within 5 minutes. I have trouble coping with pain. I'm sorry if I hurt you Sarah. She tried to cheer me up, but it didn't work very well. I only made her hurt. I feel like such an inadequate partner when I'm like this. I can't take care of myself and I can't take care of her all at the same time. It's such a terrible feeling. I love you Sarah, remember that. Well I don't really feel like writing much more. Chemistry test was easy. I hope everyone had a great day! Tomorrow's friday. That's always good. *kiss and hug* to Sarah. bye bye
