I was going to give her the finger as I said before but I just gave her hug instead.  It will be so cool to see her in Texas on the 2nd. Next contract is going to be so different from this contract - just all new people, well with the exception of a few familiar faces. Daniel, Chief Conceirge will be there - he was here earlier in my contract. Nice guy from UK. Hmm, who else.... I guess I will be surprised when I get there. Hehehe.  It was beautiful day in San Fran today.  A little chilly but nothing compared to weather I will feel in a few days as we sail through icebergs in Alaska.  We arrive in Vancouver on Friday morning and the begin sailing the inside passage of Alaska. I am so excited to take lots of photos.   Nothing new here - just getting excited. I am sure these last few weeks are going to go by so slow ismply because I am looking forward to leaving so badly.  I am just looking forward to sleep in general! And not having to worry about a pager going off in the middle of the night for a medical emergency (like last night at 4:30am).  I had just fallen asleep a little after midnight when I was awoken at 4:30 with my pager scremaing "starcode: stateroom 9018".  I have never put my uniform on so fast. Fortunately, the woman was fine after suffering a major diabetic shock. The doctor gave her some insulin or sugar or whatever through IV and she was good again. Pretty scary though. You know they say these things come in sets of three so you can imagine my worries about the next two. Ughhhhh.  Well, I should run - gotta head up to the bridge shortly to visit with the Captain. Hope all is well and I send a thousand kisses to all of you.   Love, Shell
