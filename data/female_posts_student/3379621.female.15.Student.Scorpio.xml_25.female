( you can all check it out) it has the same manurisums as the 'hurtful' post....and another thing...if he didnt write it the first time....how did he get my journal? i post back, anonyous again( so i cant be traced lol..im sneaky) and said i still thought it was him. and told him i posted under anonymous and i dont care but i think he should think twice about saying stuff like that to somebody. it hurt. and i also said a real man would step up and admit his fault...i know i know im mean lol. but i hope all can be forgiven. i just am like a secret detctive...so WATCH OUT...dun dun da da dunnn..bum bum. lol. ANYWAYS  so my day was pretty boring....i baby-sat from 10:30-4:30. egh..so boring. nothing to do there. came home and ate potatoes. lol. i hope i can come ROCK with jozette this weekend. that would be sooo much fun. i think im gonna make a scedule for my mom. so she can make sure everythings okay. im such a nerd but my moms like that. i dunno. i CANNOT wait CANNOT wait till i move out. it will be the best day of my life. im serious. ooo. anyways. lol. im gonna learn to felt because its cool. and i wanna make a poop person. yep. lol. so jozette im gonna call you tonight if i can maybe to see whats going on. okay? okay :) im gonna go though tootles...
