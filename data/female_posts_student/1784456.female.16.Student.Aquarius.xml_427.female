So any hoo in my last non-existant post I was talking about how scary Neighbours is, what's with the credits? It's really freaky! And what's Rosie doing in the credits? She's been in it like three times! Laura said she might have a fling with Lou! Geez that would be scary! Is it Geez or Geeze? Hmm... Neighbours is light compared to Eastenders, in Neighbours some one gets hit by a car and gets mild concusion but in Eastenders if some one gets hit by a car, even the slightest bumb they drop down dead. Aparantly no one in Australia likes it... Ooh, and Flick's gonna leave I think! But Marc isn't in the credits so will he mary Steph? I could talk about Neighbours all day... oook... I'll leave! :( :( :( Oh, and Thank Bob it's Friday! Oh, Have I got News for You is on tonight at 9pm, so is Father Ted, but Have I got News for You is soooo much better than Father Ted plus it's new! *tapes Lynne and Laura up with tape and throws them in a swimming pool so they can't say any thing!* Hehe... still wierd and kicking! Woohooo!
