Just thought you folks should know, it might be on Jeorpardy or the History final, you never know. I would actually like to go back to Price tomorrow (if I am not doing stuff with Cortland, John, Jay, and Benton).  I would like to see old teachers and whatnot.  So, yeah, count me in!  and remember, YOU AIN'T SHIT WITH OUT THE OVERSOUL, YOU MODA FUCKAS!
