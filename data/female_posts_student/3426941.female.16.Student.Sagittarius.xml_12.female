First off, I was in Georgia for a couple of days for my fam's annual vacation after school is out. We always go to the same hotel, The Cloister's in Sea Island, but this year it was a bit discombobulated.  First off, the hotel is currently undergoing reconstruction to build a new main building in order to get their five stars back. They lost their fifth one a couple of years ago and are pissed. From the looks of the grounds and the re-working they are doing, they want it back pretty bad.  Secondly, the G-8 conference was occuring at the exact same time as we were going there, so our hotel room was transfered to the other hotel on the same premises until the president and the other world leaders dispersed from the main grounds. Needless to say, the people of the town were a bit disrupted and most of the stores/restaurants lost tuns of business due to the high levels of security, but o well.  After the kerfuffle of the conference it was finally time to relax even though I couldn't not workout b/c of the recital I have in two days. I did however take in some long hours on the beach reading and tanning.  To find out how the whole tanning thing went, read the title of this post.   You see, I'm of Irish and English desent.Therefore, I am pale skinned with freckles. So, I fell asleep while by the ocean and wasn't aware that I was scorching my skin off of my shoulders untl I woke up an hour later and I could barely move. Talk to me in five years when I have skin cancer. Happy times.  Erik is in Salt Lake right now and I'm upset that he got disqualified from the nationals for the debate team. He was rather distraught when I talked to him and I was sad. Anyway, I hope he feels better later, and I told him to call. We kind of have calling system set up on a "need to know" basis. That works considering he is many miles away. I'm glad we kept in touch, though, because he is a good friend to have around. Even if he isn't always around.  So, my earlier post where I was talking about the fucked up phone message I left on Ryan's machine? Well, Mrs. Sextro, as I suspected was thoroughly entertained and therefore laughed much. She was confused as to why my mom needed to use the phone so urgently and I simply explained that everything is an emergency to my mom. Tis tru.  Then, I talked to Ryan online for a long time which was good. I needed to catch up anyway because we hadn't talked at all after I came back from Michigan and I was sad. Anyway, that was cool.   Tomorrow I get to sleep in and so tonight I have decided not to go to bed early as I normally would.   I know that was a random comment but o well.  I was just thinking about the Diary of Anne Frank. Well, in those times, the computer wasn't invented, so obviously blogging wasn't an option for her, and anyway, if it were, the Nazis would have been able to trace her over the internet anyway.... What I was getting at was that, fifty or so years from now, I wonder if there will be famous bloggers. You know, and like everyone will want to read their thoughts. But at the time, they really never thought of them as particularly inspiring anyway. I wonder if ever there was a person who realized their greatness when they were actually alive.  Food for thougt.  Be careful though.  I don't suggest trying to masticate with the computer.
