I can't believe it....it's gonna be a blast...BUT unfortunately, my sister can't go cuz she's working..that's too bad...and my father will meet us there at 4:00p.m cuz HE ALSO HAS TO WORK!!! Why can't they just leave the WORKING PART alone and come to the godamn outing.... urlLink    It's like to them it doesn't matter whether they went to an outing or not....its totally  urlLink    FAIR!!!! For once i thought it's gonna be great with my sister and my father around but it's as if i'm jinx....everytime something great happens to me, something bad would also happen... I totally feel  urlLink    shattered.....It's ok, i'll get over it...  urlLink
