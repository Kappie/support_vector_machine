The car ride was pretty boring. It was boring in the sense that I was two-dimensional.  Jing’s cousin Madel was a med student and Mel, of course, is a nurse so they had plenty to talk about, along with Madel’s classmate Jera who tagged along.  Jing and Raisa (who drove the car) talked about boyfriends and this Aga-Kristine chick flick “It Might Be You” (or was it “All My Life”? I don’t really give a shit), something a loveless bisexual like me cannot relate to. We arrived towards the end of the band’s first set but I got to hear them play  No Woman, No Cry, Jammin’, Waiting in Vain, King of Pain, Light My Fire , among others and some of their original songs.    I began to be bored again during intermission and was seriously contemplating going to Gweilos.  I texted Mario, the bar owner and Gweilos Hour host but he didn’t text back.  He was probably busy entertaining call center kids on a Thursday night.  I was also thinking of getting picked up. Too bad my black  “hot chick”  top failed to do the trick.  No one really gets picked up from a group; at least, that’s how I understand how the whole “picking up” thing works.  I don’t really go out much, sowee. But there were lots of beautiful people, I felt really sorry for myself that I wasn’t cute enough or that next to the med students I looked either fat or geeky (still don’t use contact lenses yet, can’t afford it) or old.  “Nope, I will not get laid tonight, poor me” , that’s how bored I felt.  I was already thinking of all the places I would rather be, I couldn’t really follow what they were talking about.  Not that I’m slow or anything, I just didn’t feel comfortable. I also thought there wasn’t gonna be a second set anymore.  Good thing I thought wrong.   A stand-up comic, Tuesday Vargas, was also there (I think she’s going out with the band’s guitarist). She sang and did the rap part of  urlLink No Doubt’s   Underneath It All  as they started the second set.  The “kids” stayed at the table outside the bar while Jing and I went back in and danced (or swayed, or gyrated, you pick the term. I just had fun; this was my type of music we were gyrating to). They also covered  urlLink 311’s  version of  urlLink The Cure’s   Love Song (Jing got a bit emotional especially when it got to the  part, ”However far away, I will always love you” ),   Santeria  by  urlLink Sublime ,  Should I Stay or Should I Go  by  urlLink The Clash ,  Dyer Maker , the  urlLink Sheryl Crow  version and a lot of other songs I can’t remember right now.  They also did some original songs but my favorite was  Suntok sa Buwan ,  which is also the design of the t-shirts they were selling. They ended their set with  Elevation  by  urlLink U2 .    we didn’t stay for the credits anymore, which is the best part about watching a live band perform after you’ve yelled and jumped all you can to their music.  I felt bad that I didn’t get to finish watching all the band members strut their stuff ‘coz the vocalist is always the last.  Hannah Romawac rocks!!!! I was falling in love with her and I wasn’t fucking able to get her to sign any of my law books. SHIT.  she connected with me  sobra ! I wanted to strangle myself with the braids of her hair.     at first i really felt bad about going.  i felt stupid for letting them drag my big neurotic ass there.  i usually go with my friends chris, beth or tina for gigs like that so i didn't expect to enjoy, but i did. i had such an adrenaline rush i kept saying that that feeling was better that sex.  maybe i'll let them drag my ass again next time  para ma-out of place uli sila sa'kin  :)
