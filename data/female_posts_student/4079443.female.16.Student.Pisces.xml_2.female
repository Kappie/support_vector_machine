MSN not that i have the willpower to stop signing on. just poeple are WIERD on msn there all shifty adn distorted if that makes any sense. plus its next to impossible to figure out weither their joking or not. i cant count number of conversations i've had that turnedinto unpleasant things becasue of misinterpretation. or maybe my friends jsut dont knwo me adn i dont know them... hmm nah i blame msn ANYWAYS yes teh amazing thing thast really been making me smile for the past week, more then any plans wiht friends at all, is.... (corny drum role pleasse) my new mic and acid music cd! HAHAHAHHA oh the joy. this is teh part wehre i go a bit psycho out of antisipation. see the mic is a mic(wich i proudly installed myself even with my computer illiteracy(is that a word?)heh i jsut put bracekts in brackets... yeah um yeah before i sound ireversibly stupid wich i think is ahrd ot avoid at the moment(even if i ahve a backspace key!) ahh enough with teh brackets... ok breathe calm. ok what im trying to say in my many fumbled words is that i can now record guitar playing on the computer and make a cd. wich is amazingly exciting becasue i LOVE guitar. now im jsut waiting for one day of empty house ness and i can start. hurray for me yeah i think ill rethink the whole going psycho next to a computer thing next time casue i dont think the majority of that made sense, but oh well!
