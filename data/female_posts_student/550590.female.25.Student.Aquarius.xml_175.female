Let that be a lesson to you kids...don't sniff inhalants or you could die...of course, you only get SDS if you die the first time you use inhalants. So if you make it past the first use, you're okay. :)  Went on a road trip with Mom, Dad, Zoe and Frank this weekend for Pop Pop Bill's 90th birthday. I took so many great pictures that they warranted their own  urlLink site .   urlLink      Two weeks from now I'll be in Russia...if the plane doesn't crash and I make it through customs, and no one attacks me...Alright, back to work.  ~D~
