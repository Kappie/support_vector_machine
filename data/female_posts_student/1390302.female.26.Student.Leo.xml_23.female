Why is it that when we are little girls we are told that Prince Charming does exist, that life is what you make of it, and that everything will turn out happy and shiny in you want it to?  I got to thinking about this question and wondered if this was a malicious ploy on the part of our mothers to give us false hope about how adulthood, life, and love would really be.  Or perhaps it was a loving, sheltering plot on he part of our mothers to protect us from the truth until it was absolutely necessary to let us in on the real truth. The real truth that life is not all peaches’n’cream, shit does happen, and not matter how badly you want that fairytale you read about in Sleeping Beauty as a child and eventually bride magazines when your older- nothing is ever so simple!  I have grown to understand this one defining factor, when you grow up, life is not all never never land anymore and you can never go back, you can never make the choices you made again so choose carefully.  You can never go back and change the fact that you married the wrong guy the first time, or that you ate an entire box of twinkies.  Life is what you make of it, but only to a certain extent.  Isn’t it true that if you are one half of a relationship, it is not completely your decision how your life will turn out?  When you get shacked-up, engaged, married, etc. with a person they will inevitably choose what your life will be like and you will choose what theirs will be.  So I say, careful who you marry they’re not that easy to get rid of once the ring is sealed with an, I do and a kiss.    Then there’s the question of what is important.  If you can not live with your significant –and sometimes not so significant- other’s quirks, then don’t try.  If you’re the cleanest person in the entire universe and your hubby is a slob and doesn’t care, then think about that before you get married.  No matter what the propaganda machine has told you, you CAN NOT live on LOVE ALONE!  Its just a viscous lie made up by those who could never actually find love the hard way and want to trick someone into their trap before it too late.  For me, I think that it was a matter of outweighing the bad shit with what was really important.  When I got married the first time I married a guy who was somewhat neat –especially since I cleaned up after him, Ironed his clothes, cooked his meals, etc.- and tidy, somewhat responsible –always getting the bills paid on time- and somewhat caring –at least in the beginning.  He turned out to be a cold, mean, jerk who treated me like a slave and didn’t give two shits weather I was happy.  My first husband was somewhat intelligent –he graduated High School with honors and since I divorced him he has graduated college with 2 Bachelor’s degrees.  Still all that pomp’n’circumstance didn’t make him smart.  He was overall, not the right guy for me.    So when I divorced his sorry ass, I decided I would NEVER marry again, yeah right!  Now I am married for the second time and when considering weather I should marry him or not, it pretty much came down to what was important to me.  I want a guy who is truly smart –not one how fakes it like my ex, Mike.  I wanted a guy who was sweet –not a cold fish who only cared about himself; again like my ex, Mike.  I wanted someone I could talk to and share myself with, someone who would support my every whim as if it were a life changing occurrence (you never know when they will be with me) –still very unlike my selfish, ME ME ME, ex-husband.  I wanted to be with someone who could put up with my attitude (believe me when I say that was important) with a passing interest and not get offended –so unlike my ex it wasn’t funny!  When I found all of those things in one guy, when I found all of those things in Matt, I realized that in order to have all that good, sometimes you have to decide if it was worth the bad quirks.  I realized that most of the bad quirks were just that, quirks, superficial quirks and not something that I would nit-pick at.  Other than his need to never pick up after himself and not care, and his smoking, there wasn’t much else I saw that was bad.  So I went to the altar, got married and I have never regretted it a day.  Now don’t get me wrong its no fairytale, what ever are these days.  But it’s about as close to perfect as I ever want to come.  Sometime you have to find the fairytale in life; they don’t always come to you.  Sometime you have to do some looking to find that one rose in a bed of thorns bushes.  In my case I can honestly say that my prince charming has come, perhaps in disguise, but has come none the less.    ~Kristyn
