At this point I believe that I have subconsciously turned it into a rant board, because my mood seems to change the moment I begin writing.  Within moments of posting my mood reverses...I'm not really that depressed (at least I hope not!).  Anyway enough of this...  Amusing conversation about those stupid English semester plans (well that's where it started....) lisliasm: well i have to get English signed lisliasm: but chitchat201: i don't want to do that! chitchat201: i maintain an A simply because i read the books on time lisliasm: lol chitchat201: if i did the study guides and studied for vocab i might have a 96 instead of a 93 but whats the difference in the long run? lisliasm: NONE!! chitchat201: exactly chitchat201: its like my mom suggested i go to wake tech until i figure out what it is i want to do lisliasm: lol chitchat201: and its like why did i work my ass off for 3-4 years to go to some half assed community college lisliasm: exactly chitchat201: its not like high school does anything aside from getting you into collegre lisliasm: some people learn how to spell and type chitchat201: let me rephrase that working hard in high school does nothing lisliasm: ill second that lisliasm: and yet...look at us chitchat201: lol chitchat201: it for the good college lisliasm: ah but what does college get you lisliasm: ...just a job you'll hate anyway lisliasm: But im not pessimistic  chitchat201: exactly lets drop out now and move into a refrigerator box together lisliasm: OK! lisliasm: could we maybe each have our own lisliasm: it would be kinda tight chitchat201: hmm chitchat201: that might be too expensive lisliasm: maybe in the winter we could live in one...more body heat lisliasm: but you know in the summer... lisliasm: thats true lisliasm: you know those fridge boxes
