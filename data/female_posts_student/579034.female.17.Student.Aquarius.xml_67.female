You were always the one to come up and say hello to me first and you were never the last to crack a joke at my dad or at Mike. You were an awesome grandma, always ready to have fun. Mario will miss you. I know hes little and won't fully understand death till he is a little older but I can understand enough for both of us. I promise I'll take care of him and be the best big cousin I can be. You will be missed tremesly, especially at Christmas and New Years when your antics were always the biggest hit of the night. God wanted you close to him, and so he took you away from us but I know that one day, when it's my time to face St. Peter, you'll be there to open the gates for me. If you see Grandpa Roger, Grandpa Mario, Uncle Victor, Uncle Ronnie, Uncle Joe, Grandpa Ray and Grandpa Gene up there tell them I said hi and I miss them very, very much. You will always be in my prayers. God speed, and straight to heaven with you... Lauren
