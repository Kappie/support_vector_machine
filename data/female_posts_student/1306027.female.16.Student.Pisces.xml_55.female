Here are the results:   First off we have who I'm going to marry *wink wink*     You are going to Marry orlando Bloom. He will always treat you right and is very romantic. He will do anything for you. He is very polite and has deep brown eyes and is very good looking (which is another plus!). He can make anythind cheesy look really good (like sliding down stairs on a shield shooting arrows or wearing pointy ears for example). Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (10 results that have pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Next is my LOTR Personality Problem     Congratulations!
