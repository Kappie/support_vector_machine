I suppose he wasn't much older than I was, and he was just a misguided youth in a shitpot of a Kansas town, but I can't help feeling sick when I see him.  He knew me, for sure.  I guess he would.  I neglected to mention this to my man, which was cunning in a bad way.  I just didn't want to bring it up.  I didn't want him to storm back into the gas station and knock that guy upside his head.  I didn't want to explain what happened and how.  It's been a good eight years, and it doesn't matter anymore.  And even though the sight of him makes me sick, I feel like he's written his own ticket and he can go for the ride alone, without a push from me.  I hope he feels like an asshole.  So anyway, it was dark, and I 've been sick anyway so I was all strung out on cough medicine, so it was easy enough to play it off.  The rest of the night was good, but I kept getting visited by memories that made me cringe and it was hard to pay attention to the moment.    But life is still good.  I just can't wait to stop being so ill because there are a million things I want to do.  My man's running for State Representative, on the Republican ticket, of course.  (Once again I must ask myself how I happened to get here.)  Anyway, he doesn't want to do it and it's a bad move altogether, but his dad's pressuring him.  Pressuring with good intentions, of course, but it still has all the negative effects of any run-of-the-mill manipulation.  His family's probably the most important element of his life, and I can tell he's going to do his dad's bidding no matter how much he feels like it's a mistake.  I am trying to be supportive and not say what I think, which is, Let your dad run for office himself if he's so into it and finish your goddamn degree!  So far, so good in that department.  I don't want to have a say in it one way or the other because that's just bad form for a new girlfriend.  Anyway, I might be free again come August.     I don't mind being free, but it's so easy to get used to having someone.
