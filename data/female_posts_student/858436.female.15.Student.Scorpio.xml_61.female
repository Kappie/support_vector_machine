Sara never answered her cell, Sarah was babysitting, Allie couldn't come back to cape, Kaci was babysitting, Claire B. was babysitting, Cort and Lindz had to stay home, and Caro was out with her parents doing stuff. So that was gay. But I am DEFINITELY DOING SOMETHING NEXT WEEKEND, DANGIT!  Yeah and my dad wants me to have a party. Probably because I don't have a social life haha. But yeah, maybe I'll do that during spring break. Living in Sikeston is not fun. That would mean everyone's parents would have to haul ass down here and drop people off. Things will be different when everyone is 16. Mhm.  Well, that's it.
