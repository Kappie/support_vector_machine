See, my mom will more than likely come with me and Kiera, and if my mom brings her cousin Janie then we'll drive, but if not we'll fly. I hope that she brings Janie, because that way me and Kiera will have the freedom to do more stuff, hehe. And I know that it's going to be kinda hard to explain David, so either he's going to be Bryan or I'll just tell my mom the truth, that he's my boyfriend. So yeah, I don't know yet, but I have 2 months to think about it.  Early today I kept thinking about us being together last week. I don't know whether it was the first night he was here or the second, but I remember him kissing my forehead before we went to bed, awww butterfly kisses, they're so sweet. I miss all that so much. Lol I get all teary eyed just thinking about that moment...I think this song will explain it all:  Touch~Seal  Without your touch I've been lost without the things I love Without your kiss I've been dreaming of the things I miss Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touch Your eyes, your mouth, your face, your touch Who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  Each day we miss I remember times I used to kiss Your mouth, your eyes, your face, your touch But who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  (Still, I need to know What time excel will really show Still, I need to know What time excel will really show)  And I say Who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be well (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  Who am I (Who am I) I'm not to tell (I'm not to tell) Of what would be well (of what would be) No one knows (Still) Who am I (I need to know) I'm not to tell (What time excel) What would be well (will really show) Let it be  Your mouth, your eyes, your face, your touch Your touch Your touch Your touch Your touch
