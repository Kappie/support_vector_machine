How often do i really spend just reflecting? thinking back on past decisions? too much i think, too many minutes tick by, only half paying attention myself. Am the only person who has seriously thought about giving up? i highly doubt it, once, i nearly did. i consider myself very lucky to be here today to be honest, to just be able to type is a miracle. Not many people know.  i dont talk about myself very often, its always about someone else. When i do fall, its bad, i fall as deep as a person can get, and somehow, i still manage to dig deeper. my thoughts run together, never-stopping, ever flowing, perpetual....how long is perpetual? forever, but how long is forever really? Where do we go after it's all played out? Everyday is different, i dont like planning ahead, i dont like feeling committed, attatched to a previous agreement, what if something happens? What if when i wake up the next morning, i cant bear to face the world, cant stand the thought of having to put on a fake smile and pretend. Remember the song "Barbie Girl" (the one the seeped into Your mind, and played over and over again?) How true is that song. How many of us are walking around, molded plastic of stereotypes and media images of what is correct, what is beautiful. How many of us hide behind pretty clothes, and expensive cars. Credit cards and plastic smiles. If You were to walk down the street, how many people do You think You could actually say was being genuinely themselves? i think i could count them on merely one hand. i'll leave it at that tonight, i tend to ramble, what i say may be some pretty meaningful stuff, but You have to sift through the nonsense first. michelle
