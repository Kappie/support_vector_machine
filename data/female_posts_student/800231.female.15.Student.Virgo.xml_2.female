Oh well, suppose I'll survive...  I knew it, Mr. F is even more tragic then I thought. Steph, Casey, and I were all there together. Steph was downloading ringtones for her phone and was trying to ignore Mr. F's introductory speech. Anyway, she started signing the "Inspector Gadget" theme song and he had a bit of a spaz attack: Mr. F: Put that phone away! I-I'm pretty, I'm pretty l-" Steph: "You're Pretty?" F: "Lenient! I'm pretty lenient!" All three of us: "OH!"  The class is truly beginner though. Halfway though the class came a sudden scream of "What the hell is that?!" Mr. F: "That would be a computer, Peter." "Oh..."  Lucia and I spent the entirety of lunch convincing Helen that tutoring at our old middle school was a bad idea by telling her about last year. Now, our school was great, actually one of the best in Seattle, but it definitely had its problems. Most of them involved my little group though... Anyway, Lucia and I spent the last three months of school taping random notes to teachers cars. Mostly things like "May the fleas of a thousand camels infest you armpits!" but we thought it was funny.
