It felt so good outside to camp out well it wasnt really camping out but it was sleeping in a tent.  Which was pretty cool  I love the whole outdoor camping thing.  I was so glad to have amber and sarah over at the same time that was GREAT.  I know Sarah prolly thinks that I have been treating her like crap I dont think I have but who knows I might have I usually just got caught up in the moment and I feel bad b/c she is one of my best friends who I absolutely love like a sister it is just we spend so much time together and I always feel like I dont give her and pt enough time to spend together so that is why I was hanging out with other ppl.  Sorry if I hurt you in anyway Sarah......Love ya'    Amber and I have been kind of hanging out a little lately it is pretty cool she makes me laugh so much......glad we started hanging out again and you are welcome to come spend the night at my house anytime you dont want to be home at curfew....Love ya'   I was so glad to see Lauren b/c she always can make me laugh like how we sat at that  GREEN    light b/c we werent paying any attention to the lights and I didnt realize I oculd go......lmao that was a blast we work as a good team when we are trying to write on Stevens car........by the way he is a great guy who is kind of going in the wrong direction b/c he talks to Shaunda and I think anyone who talks to her is pretty much just asking for trouble b/c she is just a bad kid........her boyfriend by the way (Zac) is pretty cool and I feel sorry for him b/c I think he feels obligated to be with her she treats him like crap and if she cheats on him again I will be severly PISSED.......So tomorrow is my last day of summer and I think I will go out with a BOOM...:)   I am going to go out to eat with all my friends and I really hope like some ppl dont go like Shaunda and Lin and patty other than that I will be absolutely happy.  I really hope no I will make tomorrow be a night I wont forget b/c I dont ever want summer to be over but I know I have to end up going to school and that sucks b/c I dont really care for school or the B*S* that goes with it but this year if ppl want to screw with me I will screw with you and I dont care who you are.......:)   I hope everyone else had a great summer b/c mine will never be fogotten.......:)  Well I guess I will head to bed or at least to go watch t.v. till Sarah or Amber get online....and I still cant tell you how glad I am that they are friends again and I know it is kind of weird still I mena at some moments there is still kind of silence but hopefully we all will get everything back to normal.......Love you all    Mess
