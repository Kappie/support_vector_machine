A couple of friends are coming up early to help me decorate my ENTIRE backyard in white christmas lights,  it'll be so pretty. Then a bunch of people are going to come up there will be a barbeque, swimming - speaking of the swimming, I wrote on my invitations, "There will be a barbeque and the pool will be open so come hungry and bring a towel!" (I know, corny, so sue me) So all of my guy friends say they are coming to my party with JUST a towel. And you laugh, but see, my guy friends are the kind of people who will actaully do it. SO I AM TERRIFIED! The neighbors are gunna get pissed because I told people that they could leave whenever they got sick of me, it doesn't end at any particualr time.  So that should be fun to deal with in the morning.  But yeah, that's what my friday consists of, getting ready for the party.  Now tomorrow I'm going shopping with a friend of mine because his girlfriends birthday is also on friday, and he needs help buying her a present. I went shopping with her when she got him his birtday present and now I'm going shopping with him, for her. It's great being the friend. And I think people are coming over tomorrow night, but I'm not sure, I don't remember.., guess I'll find out tomorrow!
