It was really busy in the changing rooms and I was rushed out, the moment I was out the fitting room lady came in and did her sweep I guess becasue I remembered that I had leftv my purse in there about twenty secoundss later went to the door knocked asking the lady if there was a pusrde in there. she said no, then I asked the lady who took every thing out, she said no, I asked her if there was anything in with the clothes, no. Although I didn't see her check so now I'm really ticked off because it was one of my favourite purses. my purses are like my children I love them. The fact that they are gone kind of makes me want to cry. That and I had ten bucks in that purse!
