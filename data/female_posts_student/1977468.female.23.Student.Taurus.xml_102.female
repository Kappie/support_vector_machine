These last few weeks, little pieces of my toddler precessor have been finding their way back into my life- like slain demons rising from their ashes to screw me over socially.  It started innocently enough, I began to have allergies... which developed into a sinus infection. I'd wake up in the morning, and my nose would be full of dried blood. Isn't that disgusting? But you must understand this, before I can continue. It was horrible. My nose was cracked and itchy. So I cleaned it. You know.....  This happened everyday, and I knew it had to stop but it was always "tomorrow", "tomorrow". First I just needed a pick at my nose when it hurt, when it itched. Soon enough, I needed to pick my nose to do just about anything; to get a soda, to answer the telephone, to check my email, to brush my teeth... just to get out of bed in the morning. I am ashamed of who I have become. Now, I pick my nose constantly, unless someone is looking at me- but forgive me sometimes that doesn't stop me!  My last 3 weekends have dissolved into me and Eric with some friends, sitting in my car by ourselves and talking about how girls don't like us while we all pick our noses, wondering. Then I yell "Oh sweet mother of pearl no!" as I realize I'm sinking deeper into my addiction. Perhaps this is some symptom of my waning hope that I will find ever true love.   Its as if I watch as a force inhabits my body involuntarily. I know its wrong, but my hands don't... my hands just go towards my nose and I don't think to stop them until someone in the other lane at a stoplight looks over and glares, or I see a child in a minivan picking his nose and I think "That's discusting" and I dawns on my MY FINGER IS IN MY NOSE.   Help me...
