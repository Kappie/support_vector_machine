There's 2 posts about it, 'cuz there was 2 IM conversations, so yeah. Read the first one ((which is beneath the one at the top)), and then read the most recent one. here's the address:  http://www.livejournal.com/users/waste_my_days  And yeah..I'm not as angry now...still shaking with rage, but I'm calmer...just really frustrated.
