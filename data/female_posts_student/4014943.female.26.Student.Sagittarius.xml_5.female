I do not always edit my work as i write from passion how i feel at the moment and I feel sometimes if i go back and look at it i will erase things fearing people will judge. Welcome to Erin's ride please keep hands and feet in at all times as there are sharp turns and panic attacks. K i am having a shitty day already..I know what a way ti start out my blog. I am also getting used to the fact that people maybe able to read my thoughts. I find guys hard to read when you are in a relationship. It is just like i am a little different in a relationship then i am with freinds but yeah i am a hornball. I am going through a down time for several reasons i am emotional (when am i not:P), and i haven't worked out properly for a month(missing a whole week this week). As of tmw i start my workout regime again. I am going to try and run 10k or more every sunday and do my other stuff that i had a lady make for me. I slept over at Shawns last night i didn't sleep well as i had to pee every 10 min:@ freakin bladder. But i also gave him head and i love doing that but it felt so mechanical like no foreplay no anything i mean our sex life is great but i want to do more exciting things. I just want to explore and NO not with a chick or guy i have been offered a threesome with two guys i wasn't all for it. I turned it down. But it is like i am only there for his pleasure and it kinda makes me feel like i am on the outside i tried to kiss him and he was like NO. i don't know it hurts to get shot down.  It is like it is on his tearms plus latley i am feeling alone again inside like the person who shares this body is not willing to participate. My mind and body are goign in a million directions and it won't go together....but that has alot to do with no running. I fear i am losing shawn in a way because i am not exciting enough but little does he know how exciting i could be.... to a point. I am scared it is like no one around me can see how sa i am and lonley. I am also gettign scared i might become bulimic again i ahave had urges to vomit..... But i will never give into that. My fear of being fat though is so strong i could do alot of damage. my daughter is my world but i don't want this extreme obbssesion to wear off on her. Well anayways on a lighter note i will be writing poetry and hoping this can bring out my song writing again we will see. This blog is all about me my thoughts feelings wishes AND YES i really do want to be a centerfold. I love sexuality and everything it reperesents and even the fact of the plesuarble feelings you can enjoy from it. It is not shawns fault i feel like this either but it is something i have to undestand he is not extremly romantic knock me off my feet and he is very subtle he isn't one to lay it lall out on the table in a movie manner he is very much a guys guy and that iss omething i will have to accept. Damn wishful thinking. so please feel free to say something and i may post again today. I feel a bit better and my cat is cuddiling with me i will give you more info about me at a later date.... and btw when this moves pages ALL the names wil be changed for security reasons. Protecting myself and my daughter from her dad potentially finding the site with my pics on it:$ cause yes i will b e posting pics;)   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/rhodeszxc/index.html   from our freind matt you may not see me completly nude but i will be nude;)
