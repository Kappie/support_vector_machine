[insert screen wavering and turning white and the 'dream sequence' harp noise.]                        In second grade, for whatever reason, I decided I had a HUGE crush on some kid.    So of course, what do silly second grade girls do? They write love notes. And boy, did I write love notes. I'd sign them as anonymous and stick them in his desk at recess. For a few weeks, people were none the wiser.     Eventually, though, it got out that I liked this kid. For some reason, I wasn't made fun of for it, though I think the poor boy was. :( At the time, it seemed utterly hilarious to chase him around trying to kiss him at recess. The whole school lolled and for a while I was quite popular.    Of course, I realized it wasn't working. He wasn't falling for me like the way I thought he would! So my second-grade brain spins around a bit and finds a perfect solution!    At the end of recess, all the kids would have to stand in a line outside the classrooms before they could be let in by a teacher. One fateful day, while we were all standing in line, I ran up to the kid, kissed him on the cheek, and raced back to the end of the line.     Looking back, I probably could have gotten in trouble for sexual harassment, but our teacher was young and had a good sense of humor and found it hilarious. Score one for me.    That wasn't the end of it, though. A little background: in second grade, I was in a 'split class'- that is, we were one half second graders and one half third graders. It worked out better than it sounds.    The third graders in the class often volunteered to clean up the classroom and clean out people's desks for them. One day, they're cleaning garbage out of the desks, and they get to the boy I liked.    "Ohmygawd, what's this?" One of them pulls out a massive ball of crumpled binder paper scraps. The two gently pull it apart and start reading the scraps- and start lolling their asses off. "They're LOVE NOTES!"    In retrospect, I probably got made fun of to hell for it, but at the time, I thought I was pretty damn cool. :(    I still go to the same school as him. From what I hear, we have a lot in common, but I can see it now- the second I open my mouth, he says "Hey, aren't you that girl that kissed me in second grade?"
