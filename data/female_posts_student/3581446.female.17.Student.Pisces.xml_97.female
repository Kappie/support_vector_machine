(let's get the altruistic crap out of the way first)  A  urlLink Mini-Moog Voyager ,  urlLink Reason  and the  urlLink Mr. Gelatine  albumn off of  urlLink Magnatune  would be all I need, musically speaking.   As for transportation, a  urlLink Vespa , a  urlLink Suzuki GSX 1300R  or a  urlLink Mini-Cooper  would do the trick.   In terms of apparel,  urlLink this ,  urlLink this  or  urlLink that  would be tr?s chic.   And as far as girls go, a date with either  urlLink Cat Schwartz  or one of those punk rock girls would be fine.   -Ian
