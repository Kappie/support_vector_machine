Mallory's in photography so now I have no one to talk to. *pout* Wow Dentine is officially a very good gum. I've been chewing this same piece since I left my house this morning and it still hasn't lost flavor. Yay. Oh god I'm talking about gum. How sad. That signifies true boredom. Last night I stayed up till 2 doing my psychology project and surprisingly I'm not tired at all. I wasn't last night either. Maybe it's some kind of chemical imbalance. Oh vell.
