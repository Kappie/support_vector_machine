The only class that I truly dislike is math, it's so boring, I listen to the first sentence or two Mr. Jury says..and then I go off thinking about something else, then I catch the answer of a problem he had been doing and have no idea how he got there. But that's ok, I'm not going to get myself worried about that right now (even though there is a quiz tomorrow...whoops).  I really like peace project, the people there seem much more...open minded i guess, more accepting.  There is only one person in the whole group of 30 or so that truly gets on my nerves, but I won't make  too  much of it.  But she sits there playing with her...cowboy hat, or her iPod  or whatever else she happens to have that's EXTREMELY distracting while others are talking about how we need to listen to each other and respect everyone, and then she gets very annoyed if she's talking and someone isn't completely paying attention..she'll repeat a word over and over until everyone is listening and then go on with her story. But that's ok, nothing big.  But other than that I'm looking forward to peace this year, I only wish I had joined sooner...*sigh*...but anyways, the people are fun and nice, i like acting, and i like the message we are trying to get out and the things we need to get people aware of.
