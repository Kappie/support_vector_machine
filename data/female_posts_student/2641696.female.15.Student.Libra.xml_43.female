I've also got to start working on those 10 research entries due Monday for Civics... ack! I haven't even started o_O Little ol' procrastinating me. That's okay though. I got four done in two hours... that means 10 done in five. Not that much of a sacrifice. Plus I don't need paragraph-long ideas for each one ^^;   And! Thank God I'm Female ^^; For all of you who are clever enough to figure out who PB is (although if you write his name anywhere on this site or yours I'll take ya to the knacker's (thank you Mrs W!)), he is just insanely hot right now. *sigh* I have bad taste in guys, I know. But he's  so  hot! How can you resist such hotness? Aiee!! *goes insane* It's just absolute craziness. And he doesn't even really fit my 'perfect guy' forward! Just shows to go ya that those things never turn out the way you want them to.   Mmmmmmm though seksyseksyseksy ^^;    *falls off chair*   I'm all alone right now, which always scares me just a little bit. This house is too big for just one person. Honestly, when I own a house of my own, it will be tiny cottage-sized way out in the country. I don't actually know what sort of career other than park ranger lends itself to that sort of lifestyle, but that's just kind of like my dream situation. I could probably deal with an apartment near a nice park. Just not way in a city with all the smog and materialism. ^^; I am slightly (*ahem* another understatement of the year) finicky when it comes to those things.   I am a hippie, really, I am. Just a  high-tech  one. And that doesn't mean I'm always on acid, either, despite what Mr M believes. SohCahToa! That's what it is, right?   Oh, and for all who are wondering: A's s/n "the people at kinko's can" is a reference to my hilariously not funny joke made in Boston. Ask for further details. C and A won't shut up about it, sooo... ah, well. I don't mind flattery too much.   Now, excuse me while I see if I have any accidental shots of PB in my pictures from Boston... ^^;;;;;;;; *g*
