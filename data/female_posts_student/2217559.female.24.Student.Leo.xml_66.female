I was very calm and collected but very starstruck after I left his side. He has my mobile number on the ship and calls me for everything. I am his personal assistant onbard. How cool is that??? I have met and spoken with him for about 2 hours this evening, arranging for his private access to the dining room, onboard bodyguard, priority disembark etc.  So as if that isn't enough, we have a slew of celebrities onboard including, Dennis Haskins (Mr. Belding from Saved by The Bell) and Richard Roundtree (Shaft!!).  Pretty cool as they all contact me for everything they need. We have a famous screenwriter onboard as well, Mr.  Mrs. Trepp.  They invited 70, yes 70! of their closest friends for a free cruise. They paid for it.  Pretty neato.  I am having a great time but working my ass off this cruise for these people. I can't wait to get my Dirty Dancing DVD autographed by the MAN!!! Hehehehe.  So exciting.  Anyway, he's calling me in just a few minutes to help him with some suite issues and thenlater tonight I will give him and his wife a private vessel tour.  Pretty exciting. Okay, enough for now I just had to write immediately tell everyone. Smooches, shelly.
