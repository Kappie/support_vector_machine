       
      It all began innocently enough.  I was going to the Emerald Club for the first time.  Ever.  It's been the scene of many a fabled story for years and I finally had enough I don't know what to leave Mom in the hotel room at 10 and make my way to the drinking establishment alone, looking for a story and maybe a familiar face.  As I walked in, I quickly scanned the faces for one I recognized.  When I found none, I wanted to leave; but, I wanted to go back to the room even less.  The thing is, this place has always been described as this hip-happenin' dance club where all the young things go to be their gay-fabulous-selves.  It's actually just a step up from Charley's.  It reminded me a bit of  urlLink Woody's , though, and that kept me from gulping my Heffy and bolting.   People watching is one of my favorite past-times.  Folks started trickling in around 1030, which kept my attention busy between watching the door, bartender, regulars and the pool game happening over my shoulder.  After such a sweep over the premises and reach back for my beer, I noticed a missed call on the cell phone.    "Viscious' Cell"  How appropriate.  The weekend she knows I'm out of town on assignment with the family and immediately after I've posted my "It's over (even though it never began) and I'm okay with that" entry.  I celebrated the absolute lack of desire, will, pull, etc. to return the call with a swig and gaze at the slop-shot happening to my right.    But I knew I'd have to listen to the message.  Just wanted to let me know she's alive, that her hibernation had nothing to do with me and she wants to talk to me about the conclusions she's reached in her self-imposed isolation.  Deciding I was having too good a time at my post and too close to talking to the girl who reminded me too much of another crush, I left the bathroom knowing V. would wait until Sunday to tell me (or hear) what I've known for a month.  Before long, I was recruited to join the pool party and couldn't help but think of how proud the Boy would be of me for being so social and charming.  I followed Chip (honest to god, that's the woman's name), the center of the group, to the table where I met her pregnant wife, Jen (aka Stands with Arms Folded), their friend (the one who reminds me of a young library worker of old), Christine, and the father of their child, Monte.  Away the next two hours flew with game after game and the arrival of more of my hosts' friends.  It was so nice to play with amateurs again, make impossible shots without trying, winning close games and laughing with faggy strangers.  Small talk was surprisingly easy and comfortable.  The more I was around this gang, the more I realized I could have become the newest member, if only I lived in town.  But for the moment, they cooed over my use of "concur" and "innocuous" and Yay-ed my bank shots.    By 1230, Chip turned to me from a conversation with her spent wife and said, "You up for some pork fried rice?"  "Absolutely."  Rode over with Monte in his big Cadillac and loved that I told Mom I'd be back by midnight.  Once we congregated at the Twin Dragon, the ladies chastised me about getting into a car with a stranger and Emmett...I mean, Monte joined in:  "I couldn't believe she got in just like that!  But I thought I better not say anything about it while we drove around."  Seriously, the guy is big and smart like  urlLink Ben , has  urlLink Emmett's  voice, mannerisms and stunningly sharp wit, and  urlLink Michael's  adorable "I'm going to be a Dad" thing.    "Really," Chip got serious.  "It's great that you're so trusting, but..."  "You guys, if I'd had any inkling that it wasn't absolutely okay, I wouldn't have come with you.  Honestly.  Besides, I had my cell phone. I could have snuck a call to 911 if it came to that."  "Good call," my peeps for a night agreed.  "So, what are we all getting?"  And so, while we passed around pork and seeds, fried rice and pot-stickers, I listened to Chip rattle off the common sayings she's writing about for an English class (since she's been with Jen, she's cleaning up her act) and watched Monte's eyes dance as he told the stories behind many of them.    "Water-logged" really does originate from logging operations on rivers.  "Stealing from Peter to pay Paul" is a British cathedral thing.  We laughed about Chip's germ-phobia and how, as a result, Stands With Arms Folded gets hosed when it comes to oral sex.    Gave the ladies equal time by letting them drive me to the hotel.  "I'm glad you played pool with us." Chip said.  "I'm glad you asked me."  "I hung out at bars by myself when I lived in California and it was really hard, so I try to include people I see..."  "That's really great of you, but I honestly expected to people-watch for a couple of hours."  "I commend you for that...it's really brave."  "But I'm still glad you invited me to play with you."  Ended up getting her business card out of the deal (she's a real estate agent).  Not to mention a few great memories and a lot of story fodder.  And thus concludes the first leg of the weekend.  I thought it would be the one gay night of the trip and the ultimate opening act for Pride.  We'll get to the business of proving me wrong on both counts after I've had some chicken noodle soup.
