Neither was his drinking problem. I don't know why I drove him away with my nagging. He was all that I had.      Now I'm stuck in this run down motel, trying not to get felt up by the regulars at the "juice" bar.       I wonder what he would do now..      Maybe he'd be mad at me for giving up. Or maybe, he's still wishing I would come back.      Boy, you sure are romanctic when you're tired. He doesn't want you, Cheryl. You know that.      Half of Manhattan knows that. Especially after that night...
