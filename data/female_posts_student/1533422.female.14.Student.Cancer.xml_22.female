I really should've got waterproof stuff ... oh well, I don't exactly cry at school, so it doesn't matter what happens when I'm at home.  Although, I could imagine that happening now, if everything carries on ...  Mel and Charlo are being so horrible about everything.  They were pranking me and Pooj today.  They stopped pranking me when my mum picked up, but I wish they'd rung again so Katherine could have yelled at them.  It's so awful thinking that they have my mobile  and  my home number.  Oh God.  I just thought.  If they're all round Mel's house (which they are, I just found out from Pooj) they're probably sleeping over.  So at one in the morning ... oh God, it's too horrible to think about.  But my mum brought it up when my dad came home for dinner, and so she goes, "Ju got pranked today, by people who used to be her friends," and my dad goes, "Well, she probably deserved it."  I just left the room crying, cuz this whole thing since like, 1st April has been absolutely horrible.  (Yes I know, horrible is the word of 2004.)  I don't know what I've done, I certainly don't think I've deserved any of it, and my dad just says that when I was crying my eyes out earlier, while they were ringing me.  I had to go retrieve my phone from the kitchen, and my mum goes, "I think you need to say something to her," and he goes, "I didn't mean to upset you ..." but I just walked out.  I can't be bothered with it anymore.  He's always so horrible to me.  He constantly calls me evil, a show off, a fashion victim, a social butterfly ... why do I have to put up with it?  I got all this crap from Dan first of all (early November to mid-February), then everyone falls out with me and Pooj (beginning of April to present) and all the way through my dad's getting on my case.  My mum does it too, but she hasn't done it so much since I asked her why she was always trying to bring me down.  On a happier note, well, actually, there is no happier note.  I can understand why Pooj doesn't mind that much (*grins knowingly* get in there, Pooj!) but what is there left for me? TV?  Joy, I can just see the rest of my life in front of me.  I become like the 44 stone woman in Texas, eating fast food crap and watching the skinny people on Instant Abs and Windsor Pilates and Lose Weight With Cathy and all the other exercise infomercials.  God, I hope not.  I wouldn't be able to afford all that anyhoo, with no job.  Seriously, I can see no bright star on the horizon right now.  I suppose summer holidays ... but that's a month away, and I have to bear Le Fousseau with the Prankers and everyone else who hates me and wants to kick me and my best friend out of the dormitory.  Yeah, like that's going to help our friendship bucket loads.  At least if we were in the dormitory, then they wouldn't be able to bitch about us openly.  So it would all burn up inside them, and they'd get sooo annoyed.  But really, I don't get what we've actually done.  Apparently we always run away from them, every time we see them.  Hell- o , I walk in the formroom, they walk out.  We see Clare, she sees us, they turn and walk in the opposite direction.    I guess I'll just not talk to them when school starts again.  But that could get me in worse trouble.  I really don't know what to do ... and there's nothing really happy going on in my life at all right now.  I mean, there are some fun things, like I'm going to Pooj's mum's school tomorrow to live life as a toddler, and there's all the new clothes and things ... (two pairs of jeans and a new top today, cotton candy flavoured lip gloss yesterday, a bag and these gorgeous shoes on Monday) but the prospect of school on Monday is horrible.  I never want to see the place again.  There are no fifth years, and if they've reached the stage of pranking us, they  really  hate us now.  School will be dreadful.  I hate it only being me and a couple of other people against the world.  I mean, I love our friendship and everything, cuz now it's really close, but still ... I'd feel better if I had a giant army of dragons to squish Mel, Lucy and Clare - but especially Charlo.  She's such a bitch!!  All I do is spend ages trying to make peace with someone I hate, then what?  She throws it back in my face.  Gotta go.  I hope I don't run into my dad.  I don't think I can cry much more.  Much lovings, *~Jools~*
