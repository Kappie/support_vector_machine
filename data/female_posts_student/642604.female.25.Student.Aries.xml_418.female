So it starts with this from Jeff after I asked him how he could translate this German text I sent him: "Deal is a German name.  However, the original spelling was Deihl but when the Deal clan came over to the U.S. in 1789, there was a split within the family. Those going up north to New York and Massachusetts kept the original spelling those who stayed in Georgia and Texas changed the spelling to the more contemporary D-E-A-L."  Then I have nothing to say really so I write: "Your dad's hot. :)"  And he writes: "You're disgusting. "  And I write: "Haha!  But the remark was effective.  Don't worry, I'll leave him be, after all he's much too old for me, not that I know his age but you know since you're like a million years older than me yourself he's got to be ANCIENT!"  And he writes: "Im in my 20s."  And I write: "What is up with you today?  Are you upset?  Should I just leave you alone today?  No digs at me, no witty retorts, no sarcasm..."  And he writes: "Why would you think I am upset? I give you a piece of American history with the division of the Deal/Deihl family and you come back with a need for sarcasm.  I don't get you Trost! Here I am trying to educate you and all you can do is demand some sort of witty response.  I'm not some droll whore who just spits out witty remarks anytime it is demanded or paid for.  Humor is an art form my dear, and I will not prostitute my art for the amusement of those who do not respect it!"  And I write: "I am so sorry.  I am such a bitch to assume you were in a bad mood because I keep getting short one liners that aren't even funny.  I think I've been listening to Pandy too much when she says you are boring and quiet now :)  I felt sad at the idea that the only person who could match my wit other than Mr. Jutras had died somewhere on the inside. Here you were trying to share you've become, the mature older adult with adult responsibilities who's looking onward to marriage and kids, and I felt the need to make you feel bad for it.  It was very wrong of me. Perhaps now we should be discussing things such as genealogy and maybe it would be a good time to begin discussion such literary works as Goethe's Faust and how it has effected the world of modern day medicine? What did you think of Anna Karenina really?  I would love to know your theory on whether an odd perfect number actually exists.  It is fascinating all the adult conversation we could have.  Again I sincerely apologize from looking beyond the fact that I could learn so much from you.  I hope you will look past mistakes made and help me to grow into the kind of wise philosophers you now associate with."  And then he responds with: "I might be old but I am not deaf....even though you wrote that and didn't say it... but I'm sure you said it out loud first, but I'm not blind either(just senile) and I am pickin up on your sarcasm here.  #1 Pandy is blinded by my beauty and doesn't initiate many conversations"... "I don't know why but for some reason I prefer to stay out of the conversations she has with herself. #2  Anyone who doesn't find my genealogy interesting obviously has never learned anything of the rival was of 1814 when the family was at all out war and incest was at an all-time high. #3   Who is this bitch Anna Karenina? #4   Does an odd perfect number exist? Why yes it does.   #5  I can still at least count to 5, and hasn't lost all of me breain cellz yet. Lastly,  name anyone in this office that produces any stimulating conversations for more than 2 minutes.  The closest thing we have is your girl Pandy but she always puts a perverted spin on everything and you know I am a delicate flower."  (Edited to save the feelings of others who might read this...)  Oh and I am still laughing.  That Anna Karenina comment killed me!
