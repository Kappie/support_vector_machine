First off it was an extreme whether change for me, like suddendly I had woken up  it was spring again. Instead of being in the midst of one hot ass humid summer in Memphis, Tn.  Second, I was informed of a presentation that I was supposed to give @ 9 am the next day. I had nothing prepared...I was crazy nervous...hows that for a bad dream?  Enough of the boring shit. So I have learned so much in Boston, a lot about myself  a lot about my friends. For a while in Grad school I have really been doubting myself. Wondering if I truly belonged. The ABA conference gave me clarity. Suddenly I began to see my friends  mentors for what  who they really were, just people. I guess once I let everyone get down from their pedestal, I also got down from mine. It was a little less scary  I began to realize that no one REALLY has it all together. Everyone gets nervous  doubts themselves. I was walking around a poster session  suddenly it hit me. These people aren't smart, they're just people dressed up in suits trying to impress themselves  others. THats ok, as long as they are still trying to teach  don't get overly wrapped up in their ego. I got into a fight w/ chantey the first night we were there  it was extremely liberating. She said some really messed up things to  about me "you don't care about your school work or the type of grades you get". I asked her, why do you CARE????  then I began to realize, who gives a fuck? Is this what I am really worth? To her it might be. She is just a miserable person who can't find a moments rest. Who feels compelled to hurt people because she is hurting. I forgive her for that  I forgive myself for hating her at the same time. Another moment of realization. Earlier in the year I was cruel to another girl b/c I felt as though she had come  taken my place in the lab. I felt threatened by her, as though people would start forgetting about me. After talking to her (she was extremely drunk  upset) I realized how much I had hurt her. I started to see myself from the outside  realize that my actions do have an impact on others, I saw myself from a new perspective  I didn't like it. I don't want to be driven by my insecurities.  So I have taken away a couple of morals from this trip: (isn't that the point of life?) 1. Your way of life, dreams  ideas are important but they should never be exclusive of, overshadow or supersede anyone else or their dreams. 2. Friendship comes from unexpected places, you can find joy in your moments of terror. 3. Perspective is everything, two people can witness the same moment or event  come away with two totally different experiences. 4. My life  who I am/ or will be is entirely up to me.
