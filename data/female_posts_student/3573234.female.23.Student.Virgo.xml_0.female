As far as my life goes beyond him, well, I am still jobless :( sucks because I really am trying over here and no places are calling me back, it's starting to piss me off royally bah, I'm a good damned worker, and have only been laid of once, so I don't know what their problem is, they don't know what they are missing! haha
