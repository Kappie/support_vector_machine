Whether it was something or someone, would you hold onto it for dear life, or would you loose interest now that the challange is no longer there?  Would you ever realize how important it truly was to you or would you loose it's importance in the glory of finally getting what you wanted.?  Would you ever be able to view it the same way again?  But despite all that... Is the only way to learn something or someone's true value to you, to loose it?  It's the whole bird scenario.  If you love it, let it go -- If it comes back, it's meant to be.  Do you really need to let it go though?  Why can't you just realize how precious it is before you loose it.  I know from experience that you really do learn someone's true value once they are lost to you, but why couldn't I have realized that earlier when I could have actually done something about it.      -areyoulistening?-we'reontheair-
