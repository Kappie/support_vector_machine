Everyone except for those obsessed with school are just kind of trying to finish everything as fast as possible without failing, or at least that's how it works at my school where we're all slackers! Tee hee! Anyways...my life's good. I've been doing a lot of sleeping and sugar eating this weekend so i'm actully very, very, very happy right now! *contented sigh* I think I'll go write a book!
