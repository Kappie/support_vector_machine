And I've already dished to my own blog today, and I don't feel like lacing it with too much... content.  Moving right along.  I went to herr doktor today.  Found out I don't have nerd-monia, which is splendid.  He perscribed me magical bean pills, so hopefully I'll be capable of breathing without an oxygen tank come competition this weekend.  This competition is always interesting.  Example... last year I placed 1st in a category that I got 4th in two weeks earlier.  Then I placed 5th in a category that I got first in the week before... so I could either do really well or not so well.  We'll see how it goes.  Only two more competitions, three weeks and then the Ice Show.  And then it's Softball season... woo, scary.  But anywho, periodic properties await me.  Oh why oh why can't I submerse myself in work that doesn't require being here?  14-Karat Yacht, Manda
