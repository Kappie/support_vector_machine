[i'm hesitant towards guys. it's not that i'm scared of what'll happen, it's just that i'm fine without, so why bother wrecking it. i'm hesitant. ha ha ha, that's the word i've been looking for. and i'm unhesitant at all the wrong times. like right AFTER i talk to a guy. then it'll clue into me that i shouldhave done something but just didn't think of it at the time. stupid stuff like that. and for the fifth, sixth and seventh person who'll ask me if i still like him, yea, i do. (four in one day gets a little repeditive). i guess we'll see in a month if i am still infact 'hesitant' towards him.   [arielle. i love you, good luck with him. remember, you are samantha. kick ass.
