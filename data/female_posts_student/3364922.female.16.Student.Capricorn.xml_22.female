Thursday I had my human biology exam, I think that went well. One of those exams where it was really easy in some parts, and a bit difficult in others.  I think I passed, I hope anyway.  I have another day off today. yay.  I wanted to go for a walk, but awoke to find a piece of paper stuck on the cupboard door "keet can you please do the dishes and vacuuming for me today, and hang the clothes out. ta luv MUM" tsk. she likes keeping me at home.  damn her to hell.  looks like I have a busy day. If I get it all done by one, I can have a little walk....'till two...
