I blame my mother for keeping it real. 4. I blame lovely boy for everything. 5. I blame love for treating me like shit. 6.I blame The Cure for keeping me depressed. (Not really, seeeing as how I lOVE them) 7. I blame fate for cursing me. 8. I blame my boss for my bad work ethics. 9. I blame my car for needing an oil change. 10. I blame the sun for not enough Raineydays. 11. I blame Non-Girlfriend for her wonderful site, and inspiring me to start my own. 12. I blame blogging for my compulsiveness. 13. I blame hope, fear, love for the person that I am today. 14. I blame my bro for non-stop drinking. 15. I blame Notrious DES for my rowdy behavior while drunk. 16. I blame Jenn for my thoughts on contemplating my own death. (Ha!) 17. I blame society for allowing me to grow up in a cruel, cruel world. 18. I blame boredom for browsing blogs every 10 mins. 19. I blame money for making me work. 20. I blame Mexican food for keeping small love handles on my waist line.   I will so definitely have more to blame in upcoming posts.
