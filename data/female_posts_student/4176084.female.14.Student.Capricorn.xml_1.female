The best part was laughing at a fat poser girl in the pool. Well, practiced start tommorrow which are everyday except for sundays, from 8am-noon. We mostly run and swim. I had to get new running shoes tonight. They're orange and gray. On Friday we're biking, which I can't wait for. At least it's not just swimming like modified was. Oh yeah, all the seniors are really funny, but all the sophmores are poser assholes.  Oh yeah, I found my "No Need To Argue" CD for The Cranberries. My dad took it to work and forgot about it. WOOHOO! Now I don't have to listen to their other CD I have which sucks old man hair!  I gotta go to bed now, I wanna have time to shower before i go to practice.
