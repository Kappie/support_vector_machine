The second number that Rosie gave me and Lindsey confirmed...I dunno, but the party therein said I had the wrong number. And I tried calling Abby but her phone is off as usual...not much reception to be had in Fumbuck anywayz...  Agh.  Agh.   How is all of this happening...    "kablam" says my head
