It won't be tooooo bad, just two 17  18 year old guy cousins. I get back on the 15th, then working on the 16th. Then I'm working in Nyon hospital for work experience the 17th and 18th, and then I'm babysitting for Cathy for four days. And then  urlLink school  starts on the 2nd september!!! (And I STILL need to do tons of work...how did I get into this mess? )  The summer has disappeared...:(  See you guys soon :)
