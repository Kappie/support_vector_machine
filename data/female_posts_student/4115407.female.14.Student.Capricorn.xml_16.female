Now the next year the secret had spread like a nuclear bomb over some stupid little juice. And I had made some enemies and which I still don't really know why. Anyway I found out and to be real I didn't know what to do, so when he asked me out as a clueless person would do I said no, i didn't even know we never talked at all, so its like the boy down the street who u have never met before coming up to you and saying I like you a lot would you go out with me? So I started talking to him, I started to get to know him a little better, he asked again and I said no, then he told it was because I was afraid of a commitment and a relationship and now that I think about it I was because I have never had a real boyfriend before. So we continued to talk he still continued to like me and I had no control over that. Then there was a last time that he he asked me, I was like no im srry and I know I really pissed him off that time, (im not gonna go into details cause this person doesn't even know im writing about him). So we contiued to talk and I continued to convince myself that I didn't like him, but after a while when ur hangin out with sum one u cant help it. So the eighth grade dance came up and I convinced myself that I wasn't going with him, but then I thought its the least I can do so we went. Then we went to the movies the movie was whack so I fell asleep tthen i woke up and he was on my shoulder i guess it was ok cause he was sleep so i left him alone. Then the next we went to the movies again, and like right in the middle of the movie he just like asked me out. So i guess something persuaded him that i kinda felt sumthing for him cause he dont it again, and if i felt like i said no that i would be acting really stupid, so i said yea, after months and months pf saying i didnt feel for him, i found out that i did, i said hey i never gave him a try so let me. So i was a big girl and said yes and stopped being afraid of a commitment, and nuthin's wrong with me im still alive and now i have a boyfriend. (who better still like or im gonna kick his a** , lol, jp) Even though we are not goin to the same school we will be fine i have to get my friend to watch in case he gets any ideas cause i know have girl's boyfriends get when they are not around.
