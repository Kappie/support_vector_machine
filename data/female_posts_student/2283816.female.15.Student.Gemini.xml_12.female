If he's done anything good for this country it'll be ignored because, "Oh, look what else he DIDN'T do?"   Did anyone hear a damn thing about Hillary Clinton's supposedly racist remark? Nope. If Bush had said it, they would be ALL OVER him. He opposes everything the morons love! Guess they just need a scapegoat - might as well blame Bush. He's a Republican, he's a cautious speaker, let's bash every damn word that comes out of his mouth! Let's devote copious amounts of paper from the trees and environment we SO DEARLY WANT TO SAVE and waste em on a man we hate and what comes out of his mouth!   You know what? If you hate someone (and I know this from experience) don't waste your time on them. If you hate Bush, make an effort for him to go down in history as the Millard Fillmore type, the one that nobody remembers.   There are plenty of things our conspiracy-seeking public cannot and will not ever know about. Perhaps Bush had other, more covert reasons going on, intel that will NEVER reach public ears... about why to invade Iraq. WE DON'T KNOW. I am not suggesting that we blindly trust our government, I'm saying -   "Give them a chance and give them a rest! They work their ASSES off for America every day, and in your hindsight, everything looks crystal clear. The fact is that 9-11 may have been one of those things that are destined to be, possibly a wake-up call to the rest of the world. Everything happens for a reason. 9-11 happened for a reason. If you would rather waste your time on a circle of endless blame game than the issues that really matter, like the environment and the economy, perhaps this country would be moving forward. Perhaps Bush would have a CHANCE to make a difference instead of defending his every action every second of his every day."  Please, America, look past this issue. I know you can't hear me, because I'm screaming in the dark.   Do I want a war in Iraq? Do I want my uncle over there risking his life? No. Not really. But if you hate the war, quit picketing outside the White House (because they sure as hell aren't listening to you) and support our troops. Concentrate on something else, something that REALLY matters. This country can only move forward if we are all UNITED, as our name states.   George Washington must have been an intelligent person, opposing political parties like he did. Talk about some unity. Hah.   I cannot ever see John Kerry as the leader of this country. He sounds like he hasn't got much of a backbone, bashing Bush as much as the next Democrat. Screw bashing him, screw bashing each other! I'm sick of the bashing! Respect and tolerate each other! Isn't THAT what this nation stands for? Unity, tolerance, liberty and justice for all?  Oh, and another thing. The Pledge. If you don't want your child saying two simple little words, just teach them not to say it, and be tolerant of a tradition in our country, and be tolerant of the majority of America that believes in a deity.   America today portrays itself as being such an atheist country, at least in our media, and I'm tired of that, too. Christians need to step forward as well, re-establish themselves as a strong, united people. And it's really simple, too. Teens can do it - don't give in to peer pressure. That's all.   Some quick political rant...
