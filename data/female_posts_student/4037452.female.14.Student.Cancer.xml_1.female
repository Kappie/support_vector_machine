I think I've just officially entered hormone overdrive.  I think that if I were a psychologist/therapist (is there a difference?), I would diagnose myself the following way...  Psychotherapist Amelia: (clears throat) So I see in your medical records that your hormone levels are very high. Unusually so... Amelia: Well, yes, ahem, you see... PA: However, no matter how high these levels are, it shouldn't affect you in such an untoward way. I mean, COME ON! YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON TEN GUYS! YOU'RE BORDERING ON INSANITY! WHAT AM I SAYING?! YOU ARE INSANE!! A: (breaking down in tears) I'm so sorry! I can't help it! Stupid hormones! Stupid hormones! (starts hitting brain or wherever hormones are produced with a shoe)  Sigh. Maybe I really should enlist some professional help. Know any good psychiatrists? Before I end, can someone please explain the difference between psychologists, therapists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists?  PA: Oh, and before I go, Amelia, I'd like to reprimand you for not knowing the obvious difference between the four professions! Tsk tsk. A: I'm sorry!!! I said I was sorry!!!  Amelia PS: Maybe I should also enlist some medical help.
