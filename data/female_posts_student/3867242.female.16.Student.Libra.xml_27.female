Anyways I got my haircut today and I feel and look so much better! I don't have anymore bulk at the bottom and I got highlights. Of course you might not care..my hair is important to me. Guys..it's a girl thing..kay? haha..I'm such a loser but anyways..yeah..that was the "highlight" of my day. Yeah..so much excitment. I went to Kyle's soccer game..nothing exciting..I did want to stay and watch Mike's game..but my parents said "no". Then I watched "I love the 90s" a little bit. I can't get nothing of that show. I love Mo Rocca (loved him on the "Daily Show"), and John Mayer was quite funny too (Countdown to the big concert is like only 8 days! yeah!) So yeah..today was quite boring except my getting my haircut. I also found out Heather (the girl who cuts my hair) is going to the concert too. So much randomness but whatever..it's my blog. Anyways as I was saying..today was boring..tomorrow will be boring..the next day will and I have to work (unless it's crappy like the forecast said it would.)..so yeah that's all I have to say for now. blah blah blah..good bye :)
