The universe has a sense of humor, but it is warped and not at all human, thus it difficult to interpret.  Often this is because we are the butt of the joke.  Its true.  I have the story to prove it.  There is a reading journal for one of my classes.  One had to write a summary, a response, questions (for each reading) and weekly journal prompts.  I had been diligent.  Don't let yourself get behind, this is easy, if you do it as it comes.  I had been good.  Very.  It had been collected once, and would be once more.  When I got it back after the second collection I buckled down and wrote for a few hours to catch up.  I was proud of it, of my focus and preparation.  Then it was gone.    The second half was due last Thursday (could that have something to do with my less then upbeat entries?) and I had not found my journal.  It was in a gutter somewhere, I was sure.  It was Rotting after some coffee boy had thrown it in the trash while clearing tables.  It was smudged and blurred and not coming home.  After I rewrote the entries, about 7 single spaced pages, I resigned myself to its goneness.  I said, universe, fine, I have rewritten it, as I knew I would have to, but I would be happy if you could give it back to me, just so I can use it in the future...  Saturday evening I got it back.  My friend, whose house I hadn't visited for about three weeks, handed it too me as if it was nothing.  He just handed it over as if it wasn't a miracle, and a sick joke.  He did not realize that he had played a role in the divine's mockery of my stress.  He was just perplexed as I stared at the book, then him, then the book, then him.  Damn.  You have to believe in the personal interaction of god when you see such minutely constructed sceneries.  I called it, but I almost wish I hadn't.   Research... yes.  Funny that.  I think that research is a relative term.  Am I doing research right now?  Can one be a participant who is observing their own participation?  I think that I just realized why academia likes people to be separate from their research subjects- its not because you get better data, its because its damn tough to interpret your own actions.  Think of all the things we do all the time that are reflex.  To be self conscious all the time would easily be maddening.  We breath, we think, we move, we listen to this wonderful song and sing along, and we do not pay much attention really.  Odd that.  How is it possible?  Moving with out knowing?  How are we compartmentalized, and why?  What is the point to that?  I have long thought that humans have limited perception, that we mistake for reality.  If we could sense everything, we could do nothing.  However, I do think that there are people with more.  Cant discount it, not once I know that I can't perceive everything, and that memory and perception are so faulty.  Where was I.... Anyway, research is coming in faltering jumps.  My other two papers are falling into blended outline, coming together like meaning of a memory.  Knowledge is being extracted.  This one... is still in its baby thought stage...   Possibly I will post it once it is complete.  Maybe it is being written as I go, following the form of a blog.  That's an interesting idea...
