I got to school, sans computer, yes, but unfortunately also sans syllabus, so I was unable to do any of my reading because I did not know what to read.  So I'm back, Con Law book in tow, back in pain from having to lug it back with me.  And I had to deal with the crowds.  I guess I'm not usually out and about on a Sunday afternoon, but there did seem to be an awfully large number of people out, and all in groups too.  Oh, well.  Perhaps it is just Superbowl mania hitting the streets of New York.  In that spirit, GO PATS!  As I go back to work...
