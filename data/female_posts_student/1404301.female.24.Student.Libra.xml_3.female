Dylan told me that this book is the best of the author's collection and I thought I would give it a go. It is a 2000 pages book, so I'm not looking forward to finish it tomorrow but I enjoy it, especially before going to bed. It helps me to fall asleep.   If you haven't a book to read and you are looking for one, try  The Stand , you will enjoy it!  Thank you Dylan!
