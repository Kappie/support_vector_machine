THe part-ay would be saturday evening, about 4:30-5 at my house, we'd eat dinner and then all  pile into the fewest number of cars and drive to the game.  Seeing as i have to buy tickets ahead of time, i need to know who's coming.  SO far i think jason, beth, jessie, ryan and mandy have said they can come.  THanks!
