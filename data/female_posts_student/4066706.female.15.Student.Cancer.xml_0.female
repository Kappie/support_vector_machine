Happy. I was alone. Happy.      Happy!!      But now, depressed/sad/angry/annoyed/joyfilled?!      I have NO idea as to were the last one comes in, no how it fits with the others O___o; Which is weird      Anyway, I guess its because I can't wait to see the Zone today on YTV. According to a friend, voice actors from Beyblade are gonna be one O_o; So I must watch, for MGH =3 (Marlowe Gardiner-Heslin)      Nyeh...Today I really wanted to be left alone o.O; I dunno, its just one of those days, where I just want to be...alone. Just me and my computer. Yep. Alone...      I went to TyKamara today O__o; That place kinda scares me. I only went to go look at some posts that someone told me to. I have an account there, but i have like, what, 36 posts DX!!      I like Tamashii no Kaze more.      Anyway gotta go, maybe I'll post about my happyness or dissapointment after the Zone.      Oh Yea, by the way, I didnt get to play .Hack yesterday       ~Phoenix         (wow, Small entry today o.o;;)
