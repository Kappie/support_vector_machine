In other news, one of my favourite bands, the Unicorns, came to my hometown this week and i had a "unicorn party" to celebrate the occasion. it was complete with a "pin the horn on the unicorn" and unicorn piñata. i invited the band. hahaha. they actually came (or jaime and nick did, to be exact) and i was fuh-reaked out over this fact. they ate some carrots and drank some sangria and then were pleased to smash my piñata to bits on stage with their guitar. so fun, so strange, what a week.
