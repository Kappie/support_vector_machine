I discovered the meaning of immortality, and found out some interesting things about time, but other then that it was mundane. Everyday can't be ground breaking I suppose. Now I am writing to put off other things, like cleaning and eating and getting more sleep. Writing is good for that. Apparently, if I am ever going to be a writer, I must have a whole bank of unfun things to do in order to write consistently.   Today feels like a turning day. It is the point in which you can really feel the year dipping down. We aren't done yet, but its coming. When I feel the year it is like a Ferris wheel, with midsummer crowning the highest point, when you are in the sun, and everything feels far away and you see forever. Midwinter is the darkest time, when you are forced to look closely at the carnie who is running the ride, controlling the speed and flow of the whole thing. Today is the turning point when we are beginning to understand that we are no longer moving up. Today is one of those days that I need to get organized. prepare for the coming shifts in space time, company, and ways of thinking. I need to tune my guitar. I need to fold my clothes. I need to do some art and get ready.   These are crazy years for us. Strange times of discovery that are floating in and out, when we are risking and making space within our minds for the improbable. In this life, that we are living in the richest country of the world, at the beginning of a century that promises to be the most catastrophically interesting hundred years for a long while, we are forced to still attend to our inner worlds. We are moving back and forward. Time is folding in, and we are gaining an understanding that we have not had time to grow roots. This leaves us free to move and shift in the upcoming storm, but also will leave us to our own devices. Maybe it's evolution. Maybe its fate. Maybe its a rather interesting coincidence. None of us has the perspective to really tell. We are on a tiny Ferris wheel, one cog in something much larger, and in a similar way, reaching into an eternity of tiny parts. In every direction we move, be it out or in, we are confronted with the same patterns, and are forced to understand that we will never get it. But then, maybe there is nothing to get. Maybe we are so centered in seeing, and understanding, that we are not feeling? Maybe the feeling of the world carries more information than the petty observations of the senses, contains more richness then the words we have to express it. Technology is moving faster and faster, and humans are consuming more and more; we are becoming the height of the roman empire a thousand times over. We are walking a thin line. We are all of us razor balanced. We are killing people right and left to stay on this ride, to feed the machine, to cope with the backlash. We are burning brighter then we ever thought possible, trying to glow brighter then the stars, the moon, the sun. We are exploding out with recycled concepts and old ideas made new by the possibility of reality. We are creating a magic play ground. We are gripping something that we don't understand.   Its going to be a fun ride I think. For those that can keep their eyes open, and watch, it will blind into true seeing. On the windowof the office, strangely glowing in the current indirect light, it looks like there is a drop of blood. Funny that I never really saw it before. Is that my lack of vision, or that it never existed before I found it? that's the question with it all I suppose. Focus, food, folding, finding, and biking and playing cards with my sister and taking her a treat at work. I think that will be the day, and I bet it will feel good.
