Well its my first post, and i just got done talking to eric. Neither of us can seem to let go... so i guess we're going to hold on for awhile still. I'm hoping that in time his parents will trust him and i more, so we can actually have a relationship and not have to "sneak around." He really means a lot to me and i cant stand the thought of losing him. It brings tears to my eyes just to think about it. Well on a different note, i am going to kayt's house tonite, so i can shower AND eat, lol. And hopefully tomorrow will go by really fast so then it'll be tuesday and i can get my license :D! Oh my... i cant wait, the car's just about ready for me to go and yea, i just cant wait! Well thas all for now..
