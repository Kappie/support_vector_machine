He spoke to me in a deep and dark tone for a midget.  "DEAR GOD what is that smell son, smells like you spent 24 hours in a horses ass or something!!"  he was close actaully it was more like 5 minutes and a cows ass i explained that to him.  He then told me to carry on and his army continued their march into the night...............
