The last two nights, I have been reading one of my favorite books, Memoirs of a Geisha, written by Arthur Golden. It is a fabulous book and I love it.  Recently, I found out that they (as in Hollywood) are making a movie based on this novel. This film is being produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Rob Marshall. Hopefully, they won't ruin it. But, i am excited to see how the novel will be played out on screen. Rumor has it that Zhang Ziyi the star from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" has snaggedthe title role. The movie starts filming in September of this year and will be released in 2005. Can't wait to see it!
