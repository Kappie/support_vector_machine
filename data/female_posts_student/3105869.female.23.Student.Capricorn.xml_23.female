The night before I had to try to get a cab ordered for the next day to take me down to the train station at 6:15 am.  I should have figured out then that something was awry.  I asked the evil Russian front desk lady and she was like blah blah no, blah blah, I'll call, then in Spanish she asked if a cab could get me at 6:30 knowing full well the dude she called already had another booked at that time and that I had said 6:15 am.  Yeah bitchy huh.  Anyway so she was like go ask at the cab stand outside.  So I treked down with my buddies in tail and asked hte guy he was like no blah blah blah, and finally came to the conclusion to call his friend another cab driver and the guy he called could get me.  Then I found out the details.  At 6:15 I was to be waiting in the doorway ready to sprint to the car, which would be a gray, unmarked, personal vehicle of a short man wearing "low sunglasses" named Perfecto.  I know I shouldn't have, but before 6:15 I was waiting, or there was no way I would have made it.  So I get to the train 1 and train 2, and finally much later and exhausted get to Valladolid only to find out that sadly I was missing seeing Tordecillas, which was apparently near Valladolid where Juana la Loca was held.  SAD.  So the talkative cabbie went on and on, and took me to the airport.  I get there only to realize, retarded me the flight was for the next day, so I call the tourism office to ask about where to stay cheaply and they named all these expensive places, so I  went outside to the cab stand all my bags in tow, and find my cabbie and tell him my story and ask where to stay, so he puts me in a cab with a quiet dirver and I end up at Hostal Residencia Colon.  This was a surprisingly lovely and sweet little town so yesterday I had a day long vacation except I read for Sandra Day O'Connor;s class out of sheer fear.  I loved the city everyone wqas so nice to me and liked americans, and there were huge cafes and wide tree lined streets and I got to watch the news and relax , and all the local old people kept trying to buy me drinks.  Then today the same cabbie came back to pick me up and carried my stuff and talked, finally, and was so sweet, it left me with a renewed feeling about Spain.  Then I fought my way onto my ryanair flight and arrived early in London to find out that stansted is 45 minutes away on the high speed train, so 32 euros later I had bought my round trip train ticket.  Yuck.  Then I get to Liverpool station, after in a stroke of genius having checked my computer bag into left luggage for my stay in London, yeah one less thing.  So I try to go onto to Tube, only to find out they ARE ON STRIKE.  Bastards.  So I found this awful line to get onto a bus, and I realize every single person around me is better dressed than everyone I have ever seen in my life.  THEY ALL HAD ON SUITS.  So I finally, 2 hrs. later make it through strike-worthy traffic to Piccadilly, then ask everyone how to follow my supposedly clear directions and I realize british people are not especially nice, they sneer entirely to often, so I did it right back in my little burberry outfit and all.  So I wander with 50 lbs on my back for 45 minutes and accidentally run into my street.  I find my hostel, which is HUGE and see the people outside and almost run away, thinking they were too shady, but then I get inside and other americans talk me down off the ledge and my bunkmates seem really nice.  So then I drop my junk, make my bed, and wander more.  Accidentally I wandered onto the street off piccadilly circus with theaters, and in the distance what do I see..... "Do you hear the people sing.... Hint....."singing a song of angry men...."  YES LES MISERABLES IS PLAYING TWO BLOCKS FROM MY HOSTEL AT QUEENS THEATER, SO I RUN IN LINE AND BOUGHT MY TICKET FOR TOMORROW.  I guess london's not so bad, even though the people can be snotty.
