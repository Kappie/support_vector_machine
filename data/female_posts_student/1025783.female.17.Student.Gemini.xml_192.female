Just got back from dinner with Grandmere (my grandmother) which entailed her opening the door, looking me up and down, taking notice I'm sure of my lime green running shorts and messy ponytail, and leading me in, shaking her head and muttering in German...oh I don't need to speak German to know what she was saying. Translation: Ohhhh Diane will never marry, for who would want to marry this tall, headstrong girl who wears shorts the color of LIMES?! Why can't she be more like her sister, the good, dependable, Stanford Grad who marries a computer engineer????  I'll tell you why, Grandma.....because I'm different and crazy and yes dramatic, and that's how I am and will always be :)  ::Yes I know I'm different I know it's true Behind hushed doors I'm talked about A mere controvesery sparked by intolerance Yes I know I'm not different Yes, I know it's true But in the end love I'm just glad I'm not like you And you And you...::
