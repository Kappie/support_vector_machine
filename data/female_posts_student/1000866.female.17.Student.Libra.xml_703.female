Then we all went to Meadow Glens and just...hung out for a while. :) Good times. Not much to say about it. It was just a fun night. We all sat in the back of Jeremy's van too so, that was fun.   Anyway, I shall finish my, rather short entry, for me, with a song...I think you all should know it...  Big wheels keep on turning Carry me home to see my kin Singing songs about the Southland I miss Alabamy once again And I think its a sin, yes  Well, I heard mister Young sing about her Well, I heard ole Neil put her down Well, I hope Neil Young will remember A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you  In Birmingham they love the governor Now we all did what we could do Now Watergate does not bother me Does your conscience bother you? Tell the truth  Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you Here I come Alabama  Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers And they've been known to pick a song or two Lord they get me off so much They pick me up when I'm feeling blue Now how about you?  Sweet home Alabama Where the skies are so blue Sweet Home Alabama Lord, I'm coming home to you  Sweet home Alabama Oh sweet home baby Where the skies are so blue And the governor's true Sweet Home Alabama Lordy Lord, I'm coming home to you Yea, yea Montgomery's got the answer  This is definitely in my head after tonight.  Also, Mary Clare...nice job keeping up your blog!!! You're the coolest. Sitting in Jeremy's trunk with you was terrific. ;) (That's supposed to be a wink.)
