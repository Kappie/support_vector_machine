Mia's a shroomie anyway but it freaked her out because she wasn't expecting it at all. She was sitting in 1st block when everything started to slow down and the wall started to drip colors. She got so scared she ran out of class and went to find me. Lucky for her I wasn't in class, I was out in the west corridor trying to pass the time until my next class. Anyway she ran up and hugged me and wouldn't let go. I ended up skipping my next block too, I took Mia down to the park to help her out. She was really fucked up for a while but she was having a pretty good time. God I love Mia...  I wonder if I'll ever meet a normal person? I swear, I never have met anyone in the slightest bit normal. This afternoon I met a kid who looks like he's 16 going on 35. He's got millions waiting for him in trust funds, he only ended up at our crap little school because he got kicked out of some posh private school. The thing is, he's convinced he can just cruise though school and never have to work a day in is life. I really don't think that's going to work out for him. Anyway, he's very nice, he bought me a drink and everything.   I've been feeling really depressed lately and I don't know why. It's really weird, sometimes I just feel like something needs to change. Like everything has been exactly the same for way to long. It doesn't make any sense because things have changed a lot recently.   I've got a whole assload of end-of-the-year work to do. Bunch of essays and shit. I hate homework. Unfortunately it's ALL due next week and I have to get my ass in gear. So I'm off to do... something.
