I thought of you and how much you like that song. What did you think?  JoAnn   My response:  Oddly enough my heart wasn't in the grammys. I didn't watch them. I did, however, go back and take a look at all the winners. I was thrilled Norah won for everything, sad that Dave Matthews lost to No Doubt and thrilled that Eminem won another grammy, I love it when he wins cause I feel like these people who claim that he is nothing but trash have to stand up and say that musically he is an amazing talent, whether you actually listen to him or not is a different story. It gives me hope that these people who are running the music industry out there are trying not to be biased just because they don't like a certain artist's views or type of music. The funny part is, off of Norah's album, the song that she kept winning for is my least favorite off of it, but I was glad that her album kept winning, it's so good. I had the chance to see her this past summer and she was just captivating...   Erin   [ Mon Feb 24, 10:31:28 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] I love this song. I think maybe because it's not often you don't hear things from this perspective:   Breakable  Fisher   Do you always have to tell him  everything on your mind?  You know that too much  honesty can be so unkind.   Everytime you throw him to the floor,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?   You always try to find  what´s holding him away from you.  But do you ever see your anger  standing there right between you?   And everytime you throw him to the wall,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?   Tell the world that he´s breaking your heart.  Go tell the world,  nothing´s ever your fault.  Go tell them all....   And every time you throw him to the floor,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?  And every time you push him to the wall,  Why are you surprised to see  He´s breakable?   Breakable... breakable....    [ Mon Feb 24, 09:56:14 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] So I officially applied for college again... now comes the anxiety... I applied for Spring semester of 2004 and so I have no idea how long it will actually be before I hear but I must admit that suddenly what I was confident about without a doubt has completely changed to a underlying fear that something will go wrong and I won't get in. I hate this part.
