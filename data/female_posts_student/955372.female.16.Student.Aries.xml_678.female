I wanted to know what was going on but i couldn't get a good view. also walking back from the bus stop, these people in a car like honked and waved at me. Not in a hitting on me kinda way though. In a "hey i know you and i'm gonna wave hello" kinda way. I only saw one of the people cuz they were driving pretty fast and like i didn't recognize him at all so i was like.. maybe there was someone in the car i was supposed to know. It's been bothering me all day.
