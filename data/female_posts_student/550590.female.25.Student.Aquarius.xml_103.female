Ahhh procrastination at its finest.  Actually, it's been kind of a hectic week.  My dad is in the hospital for stomach problems.  Mom and I have decided that he didn't get enough tools for Father's Day, so he's craving some extra attention.  We're still waiting to find out whether or not he has to have surgery.  The waiting game is the most frustrating part of life.  I would rather just know.  Sigh.  Thankfully I have a wonderful boyfriend who is being super supportive and attentive.  It's nice to have someone to keep me in line.  :)  I finally went to Rotator for the first time last night.  It was an interesting combination of people.  Amy, Jason, Providence and her boyfriend (whose name I still haven't learned) and of course Bruce were there from work, and then there were a ton of Rehab folk--Christie, Brooke, Dan, Jeremy and a bunch of their friends I don't know.  The biggest lesson gleaned from last night's experience may be that I'm getting too old for sweaty, loud, crowded Gainesville nightclubs.  Also, I've apparently become a drink nurser, according to Christie.  Both Christie and Brooke were highly disappointed in my lack of binging.  Christie rocks and is my favorite person right now (other than Bruce, of course) because she will be babysitting for us this weekend when we go to St. Pete for the other Christy and Jason's housewarming party.  I don't know when I'm going to get the chance to sleep at this point.  Sheesh.  Speaking of Rehab folk, I talked to Thomas last night for the first time in FOREVER.  He was out of town for a cruise and now he's moving.  Apparently he shaved his cat to look like a lion and has gotten into the habit of growling at it so that it meows loudly.  Poor cat.  Thomas needs to get some so bad it's not even funny.  He's moving to Charlotte soon, where the hoochies are more often single, without children and generally have more teeth.  Of course this means it will be even LONGER until I get to see him.  Hufff.  This weekend is going to be tons of fun.  More news to come!  d
