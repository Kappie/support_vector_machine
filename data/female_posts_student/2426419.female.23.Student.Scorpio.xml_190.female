They played outside, sweating guitars in the sun, and were very very good. We were impressed. He even said the mic, after a song, "There's my cousin."   Then we went downtown to meet Mike and Becky (I haven't seen them for so long - of course, they had moved to California for a year or two) and ate at Zio's outside on the patio. More pictures around the canal, then Delisa and I went back to my place.   Now I'm eating yogurt and my hair is in a towel, but I'm supposed to be at Josh's garage sale, helping put out and sell my stuff. . . really just walking around and watching people break my stuff and not pay for it (Yeah, I saw you, Lady). SO that means I need to dry my hair and wake up Delisa and be off. *takes last bite of yogurt and one more swig of Ozarka botled water* We had the funniest waiter at Zio's. He was Robin Williams in Joe Peche's body.
