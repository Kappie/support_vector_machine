Just being, just existing, just standing next to them always is more than anyone could ever ask for.  Never speak carelessly to those who care about you.  What if you say something that truly offends them?  I myself know that i am so happy and fit to burst with joy when i am surrounded by my friends and loved ones, who, i know, love me very much as well...     You might think of yourself as nobody who cant do anything but you can.  You might be blind to your talent but others can see it so clearly because your talent is on you back.  You cant see it but others can.  Don't think of yourself as a nobody.  Everyone is a somebody to someone and perhaps the whole world to others.
