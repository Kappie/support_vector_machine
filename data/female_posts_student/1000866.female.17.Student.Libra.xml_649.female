I ended up going shopping, which I was going to do anyway, but yeah...it was cool. Fun times. Then, I studied like crazy for my psych final last night. That's the first final I've ever really studied for in high school. I'm hoping I did well. I felt good about it today but...who knows. There were a few things I was unsure on because I didn't know they were going to be on the final.   Hah. I was the only one at commencement rehearsal this morning....well, the only trumpet. Nathan and Zach aren't even doing it. Things are going to suck next year without Matt, Peter, and Dave. Ick. Heh, speaking of which, we got our yearbooks today and Peter wrote this super super nice message in mine. It made me really really happy when I read it.  I'm going to miss him a ton. He's one of the seniors I'm going to miss most. I've gotten to be pretty good friends with him the past year and, I don't know, it'll just be weird without him around. Oh well. I guess that's what happens.   And, for some reason, I'm extremely tired tonight so, I think I'm going to try to go to sleep really soon. Night.
