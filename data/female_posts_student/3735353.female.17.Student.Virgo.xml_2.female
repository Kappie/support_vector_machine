I can really understand Emily being mad because she THOUGHT I was talking crap about her, but then I can't understand why on earth she would go say the stuff she said, even if I HAD been talking about her. Which I wasn't.  Yes yes yes, it was my fault for telling her and Christy, and I know it was wrong. But I can honestly say that I the only reason that I told them was because I never, in a million and one years, thought that it would leave Emily's kitchen.  Which just sucks now because I know I can't trust anyone.   Atleast anyone that gets drunk and then talks about stuff they shouldn't be.  UGH!  And this whole summer I have been constantly dealing with the whole "I know that what Christian is doing isn't right, but I really love him and so I'll over look it." And its kinda to the point now where I dont think about it as much.  But you know what the funny thing is? Christian is so much more funny, so much sweeter, and more attractive, and more sexy to me when he's completely sober. And when he calls me at God knows what time of night, and he's drunk hanging out with his friends, well good for him. But I don't have to pretend that I like talking to him like that.  Cause I don't.  And as much as it kills me to say it, I'm getting so tired of it.  It's like ALL him and his friends do. Like when do they ever get together and just hang out and not get drunk? NEVER!   Maybe I'm the werido who can hang out with my friends and not have to be drinking (or smoking weed for that matter) and still have fun. But it seems to me that most of the drama associated with mine and Christian's relationship revolves around whom he was getting drunk with and what happened while they were drunk.  As was the case with him and jackie when he cheated on me.  As was the case when Emily told jackie all that stuff she shouldn't have.  UGH! Maybe I'm like the odd ball. Cause when i get drunk, I never start drama. Its always about having fun and hanging out. Never about talking shit about people, or making out with random people...  Whatever.   Tomorrow, me and Melanie are going shopping (thank God for finally getting paid), and then I have to pack and what-not for the family vacation.  Oddly enough I'm kidna excited.  For one thing it'll be kinda cool to see everyone again. Two Nick will be there, WITHOUT Kristina which, these days, is pretty amazing. Three we havn't had a vacation in over a year.  So it should prove to be fun.  Today was pretty boring. I got up (finally) at like 1 and Christian came over and then at like 3 we went to lunch. I had to be at work at 5 and then after work (like 1045) me and Theo and Christy and Sam went to Chilli's and then to Walmart.  OK WEIRD.  In wal-mart, me and christy are walking to the bathroom and she goes "Hey whit isn't that Danny V. from work?" and I'm like NO WAY and so we walk over all non-chalant pretending to go to the "bathroom" and walk right by him. AND IT'S HIM.   This wouldn't be that weird if him and Christian weren't like all close and stuff.   Anyways, so 1. I see one of Christian's friends.  Then we're walking to the restroom for real this time, and I do a double take cause I thought (might not have bene though I was pretty sure) I saw Christian's brother's wife. WERID!!!!!  THEN (OH THERE'S MORE) Me and Theo and Christy are over in the CD's and we're walking down the middle isle and I look over and walking out of one of the side isles is CHRISTIANS MOM!!  AHHHH!!!!  It was like they were all out to get me. hahaha!!  So yeah that was weird.  I was kinda angry tonight cause Christian said that me and him were gonna hang out after i got done at work, and then at like 8 he called Old Navy and told me that his friend marc was leaving to go back to school (naval Academy) on Saturday so his friend Jorge was having a party for him at his house. So Christian went there.  Which in reality was fine cause I know that he could see me any day of the week and Marc is leaving so it made sense for him to hang out with them.  I dunno, i was just being stupid.  Anyways so I was kinda mad and so i didn't call him when i got outa work and then he called me at like midnight and the radio in my car was up too loud and i didnt hear it. So when i got home i called him back and he was over at the partay with his friends. He sounded drunk (typical) and it just annoyed me.  So he was being gay talking about how they were all gonna call Jackie and make her feel bad and stuff. Whatever. It was kinda stupid cause he was just drunk-talking. Lame.  He said he call me back, which was fine casue anything that he was saying to me at this point was just bullshit and in-sincere. And I didnt really feel like dealing with it. Or listening to it for that matter.  Well, he just called me and I didn't answer. I don't wanna listen to him say stupid stuff like "Baby I love you.", "Baby I miss you so much.", "baby I wish I was with you right now.". It's all just so lame when he says it when he's drunk. cause it's not even like he's saying it cause he means it. He's saying it because he's drunk.   UGH.  Why can't I just have a normal relationship where I don't have to worry about anything?  But I guess I dont really want that because....well I dont know why exactly.  Well I guess I'm gonna go to sleep now. But tomorrow should be fun.   I'll keep you posted.  *whitney*
