Well, my mom and I went early but I noticed that after a while the cars in the parking lot kept leaving. And as opening time approached, there was no long line that extended the side of the DMV complex. Huh...then I looked down at the papers I printed and I discovered that the DMV didn't open on the Mondays before their Saturday sessions -_-  Anywayz, we just left for the school afterwards. The guy who took my id picture was stupid or just very inattentive. Couldn't tell really. It wasn't a bad picture, just that you can see a large gap between the top of my head and the top of the pic that's blue, courtesy of the background. I look short. Then  another  picture for the school's filing system. This guy was cute. And nice. Not at all like that previous dummy for brains. But he took the photo right when I decided to take my gum out... *^^* Oops. I asked for a retake and told him that I promised I wouldn't do it again. He just smiled and laughed but he did take my retake. Why can't guys in my school be like that nice photographer...  Then I placed a deposit on a nice, sparkly class ring.Grabbed my schedule, got my books, and waiting in a line to pay for my yearbook, asb sticker, and grad nite. Not cheap, quite pricy for $130. AND I had all five of my books w/ me in the line...my arms were shaky after I put them down in the car. (yeah...no upper body strength, not much anywayz). I  was  standing in that line for probably around 10 minutes or so. Afterwards, I finally turned in my BR application. And got a cookies-N-cream shake. ^_^
