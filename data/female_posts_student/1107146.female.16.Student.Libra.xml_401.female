Now if Rosie could just take lessons from you... 2)  Cody Blonder is in my homeroom...you've done some stupid things.  3)  I miss Abby, but I'm gonna be killed.  4) Kentucky is a cool state, except that everyone smokes, and caves are REALLY cool.  4) Rosie, what the HELL is going on?  But whatever it is, I'm sorry.  5) Liz, I love your livejournal, cause of the "song o'day" and the little thing that tells what mood you're in, especially.  6) Don't make fun of John Lennon's death.  It was a national tragedy.  I refuse to this day to read Catcher in the Rye.  7)  What does h4x4ur$ mean?  8)  Justine was actually there?  Does she have nothing better to do?  8)  Did you just say dawgs?  9) Jared just e-mailed me.  He's a sweet guy, slightly ADHD, but a good guy, all the same. 9) 1 month and 19 days till my b-day, but 1 month 21 days till I get my license.  I'm such a loozer.
