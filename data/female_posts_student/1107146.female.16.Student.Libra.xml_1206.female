"Visit the frozen depths of Cocytus, see the Eternal Freeze TODAY!" Have a picnic amidst the Fields of Purgation, what a lovely time.  I can help you with those links later if you would like. As to everyone elses' posts...this thing has one percent battery left, so I'll have to read these later.  Woo.
