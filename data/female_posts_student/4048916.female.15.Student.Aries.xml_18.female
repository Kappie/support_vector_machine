I'm pretty confident though.  Had a maths test today. I didn't study, but I'm feeling pretty confident. Lizz said that Mrs Kettle told her it was easier than the investigation, which I got A+ (and I think 100%) for. So I figured I'd be right.  I felt really confident during the test - I might have stumbled over one or 2 questions I'm not 100% sure about, but I got the same answer at the end as Vicki did, which is really good - because she's in the top maths group.  If I get 100% on this test, then I'll be really happy. I should get the results tomorrow, and don't worry - I'll post them!!!  And good news for me - Mr Hetchler has given us a little longer to complete French part A assignment because some of us find it hard to find French movies to watch. I'm so relieved, because it means I can watch Rove tonight (after I finish my English persuasive essay).  Ms Roberts wasn't here today. So I didn't get to mention anything about being in her camp group to her ... I wanted to say something, and just see what she said.  Mrs Mason wants to name her baby Ella if it's a girl. And it's due just before Miss Pope's birthday too. It'd be kind of cute to have 2 Ellas born on the same day. But Mrs Mason should know better than to name her child after a student. It's a pretty silly thing to do - your kid's going to remind you of a student - and what if you end up hating that student ... you never know what might happen. That's why I don't want to name my kids after anyone who I actually know (but celebrities and TV/book characters are okay).  I've got some names picked out already.  Girls:  Jacynta Harriet Mallory Prudence Freya (I haven't got her middle name worked out yet ... does anyone know Freya Stafford's middle name?)   Boys:  Zye Jackson Brody Asher   urlLink Click here to email Mrs Mason some baby name suggestions ... (she won't mind)
