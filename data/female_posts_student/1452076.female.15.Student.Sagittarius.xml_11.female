My 4 year old cousin initiated a conversation with me - on potties. In case you didn't know, a potty is the toddlers' version of a toilet bowl.  "It's pink. Pink is my favourite colour." (Very innocent)  The conversation was mainly one sided while I just nodded my head.  With my 7 year old cousin, the conversation was mainly one sided too. Only, it was very much made up of four lettered expletives.  "You ugly butt! You idiot! You ass!" (I have omitted the more offensive ones)  And I just sat there and watched him exhaust his vocabulary of profanities before he'd start all over again. I couldn't get in a word edgewise.  Isn't it amazing how fast we mature in terms of speech? Okay, maybe this big difference is also owing to their difference in gender. What will I be hearing next?
