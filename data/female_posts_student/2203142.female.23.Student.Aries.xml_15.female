Yesterday, I checked it out and it's kind of interesting. It's Jamal Khan aka Musibat Khan from NCA. Though, the art doesn't have relevance to us as the people of Pakistan but seen from a global perspective, I find it in a way, enduring. The attention he gives to details is really admirable and I must say a lot lies in those details. I loved the anime and the cover for his illustrated book "Wahid". It's funny that his lone wolf hero shares his first name with my last.  All in all, it's a wonderful collection. Pop art at one time, anime at another and comic book art at another time. I would give him 7/10 (if I may be allowed that).
