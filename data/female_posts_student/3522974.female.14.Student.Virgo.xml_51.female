We all were trying to get to the gallery without Mrs. Jarret seeing so we could watch Han and Beff's dance in the hall. We started our voyage by crawling under the wall (so she couldn't see us) and then resting by a nearby curtin. We then had two choices. 1) We could make a run for it-to the next curtin, or 2) we could get down on our bellies and slide along the ground like in the army trenches. We decided to run for it, coz by that time our Yr 7 and 8 groupies/followers were copying our style, and we didn't wanna look like complete loonies. Just as we got to the next curtain, Mrs. Jarret turned around, to find heaps of yr 8's running. She ordered them all bak to the start (the sports noticeboard). Game Over. Breathing deeply, us clever yr 9s, ran up the stairs and hid behind the chairs. The lower years had started crawling again way back at level 1. We had now made it to level 3 and were watching the dance. They were pretty good, except for the blinding costume. Just then, Mrs. Jarret caght us off guard as she turned around to see us laughing. She sent us way back to where the yr 7's had just set off. A while later, us yr 9s, the yr7s and the yr 8s were all retiring behind the curtin. We were all watching Kelly and Sian's dance (which was great) when some1 yelled "Code 3, Code 3, Code 3 Alert!!" (not really but uno me) . Just then, every single person in the gallery stood up and ran to the stairs at the opposite side. I lukily enough, was alreadi sitting crouched there. I wasn't expecting this big mob of aroung 60 girls to come trampeding over me. Through legs, i spotted Mrs. Jarret walking up the stairs at the front of the hall, coming towards the gallery. "Ahhh!!!" i screamed as i was kicked numerous times, and crawling (more like rolling) down the stairs on all fours, with another 30 yr 8s screaming and running behind me. When i landed "thump" at the bottom (everyone tripping over me. It was kinda like on Jackass where Wee Man had the witches hat thing on him and he stood at the bottom of the escalator. ) i quickly got up and ran with the rest of the students. With one big push, about 10 people (including me) squeezed out the back door frame, with many following. Afraid to look bak, i kept running, untill i saw Jacki a couple of rampaging yr 8s ahead. As i reached her, we stopped running, and she asked "What's happening?", i answered shortly "Jarret." She nodded and we laughed. Apart from being bashed down the stairs and tumbling with yr 8s kicking at my backside (as if i wasnt in enough pain!!) it was funny. Plus-i got rewarded with a savoury on my way bak to the central skool building-the canteen was giving them out 4 free coz it was the end of lunch. Well i am gonna go get ready for the OC, an hour in advanced. Ehxcellent! Im excited...pplz out there...WATCH IT!
