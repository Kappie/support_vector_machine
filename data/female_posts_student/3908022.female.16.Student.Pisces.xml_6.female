So I packed my bag and went to Yorda's apartment to celebrate her birhtday. I know I've already done that, but her mother has this thing every year where she bakes   a lot    of cookies and makes    a lot    of food. And Amanda, Matilda and I were invited to come. So we ate as much as we could and then we were all high on sugar and really funny. Or, we were just really easy to entertain... I'm actually going with the latter.    So, then we bought some pizza andwent to Amanda's home. She lives kind ofin thecountryside.There are cows anda really bad smell.  Anyhow, so when we got there, there was this group of friends of Amanda's. Martin, Justus, Andreas and Ida. They all seemed nice andwe hung out with them and we had fun and so on.  But, suddenly, late,late,late at night. When we were all hanging outin the room where we were going to sleep.  Thebizarreness started.  They started to touch eachother, in not friendy ways. And say really offending things to eachother, involving lots and lots of words involving sexual organs. So tospeak. And then I realized, theyhad known eachother forever. And instead of forming a mental closeness, they had formedsome form of an extremephysical closeness instead. I just thought it was grotesque. When they had gone,Amanda, Yorda, Matilda and Ihad a lotof fun though.It's notas if I'm suddenly disgusted with Amanda, because she's notdisgustingwhen she's with us.But I'm not sure if I ever want to meet those people again. The morning after, when wewere on the bus home, me, Matildaand Yorda,we discussedit all. And they'd thought it was disturbing also.  When I got in tothecity, I went by bus directlyto the next friend. Linn! She'd been in Holland for 10 days,and I had really missed her. Because I was in Italy before and the day I camehome she wentaway. So I hadn't seen her in more than 3 weeks. Which is very unusual for us. So we hung out, talked and shebrought me some candy and bath pearls.  After that, we decided with our parents that she was going tosleep at my house for the next two nights.   And she did... hehe. There's not much to tell. We talked, walked and watched TV... and slept... a little. And my grandmother came by, and she's giving me a pearl necklace, so we went to the goldsmith to fix that. As it turns out, she decided to give me another necklace too. I'm guessing she was in a giving mood or something. I like it. So today she went home and I've been kicking back and relaxing ever since. It's good to be alone sometimes... no matter how muchI love her.   Freedoom.
