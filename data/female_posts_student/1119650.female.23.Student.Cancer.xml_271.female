I did a seriously brisk walk for 1 mile, I did my whole old weight regimen AND I swam 1/2 a mile.  When I came home I chatted online for a bit and then did my 20 minute pilates work out as well!  Honestly I am feeling G R E A T today and hopefully I'll be looking slimmer before I know it.  They gym was hard work, but I know it will be worth it.  I'm just hoping I actually stick with it this time.  The bane of my existance is the fact that I am quite possibly the laziest human being alive.  Ask Jon, he used to be my gym partner.    This is gonna be my year though, finally at 22 I  WILL  get my act together.  I've started reading a book at least one a week, I've started working out again, I'm being more social, my room has been clean for over 2 weeks, I will get out of debt and I will move out on my own.  Its a full plate, but deep down I know I can do it.  I guess the only way to combat laziness is to get up off your couch potato ass and do something!  4 more days til my birthday and little did I know that  urlLink Mister Malone  is also a June baby...his birthday is tomorrow.    All this energy and I'm not even 1/4 through my coffee....scary.
