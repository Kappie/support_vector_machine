I AINT AFRAID TO SAY THAT I LIKE BUTLINS! i like butlins cuz there is loads to do and nobody asks why you do it. that sounds weird doesnt it, but just think about it and really it isnt. Think about words and really they sound weird so dont think about them, but think about those words. so goodbye........I'll update later XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx
