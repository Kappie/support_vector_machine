Got all excited because the comptroller told me I'd be getting an almost $1000 refund from my financial aid... and then realized that they had not factored in room  board. So I'll end up paying a couple thousand, spread out over nine months.  I am seriously trying to figure out how I can establish residency in MS and save myself an out-of-state fee next year. Then I really would be getting a refund.  Moving on:  I can tell you two things I know for certain in this world:   1. The best way to get over your issues is to write them all out (case in point- the entry I previously entered here that I deleted because I no longer felt mad).      2. There is nothing like a good cry to detox your system from all the bad stuff you sometimes have to hold inside.   But I digress.  I still have so much left to do, including packing and fixing my car. The butterflies are still there. I can't stop being excited.  I'm off to clean and then to finish my cheesy romance novel in the bathtub. Sometimes I thank the Lord for Harlequin romance. Sometimes I just need to get away. At least in spirit, if not in actuality.
