I actually don't know the difference and I frankly don't care.  They can both sting me and that signals only bad news to me.  It's fucking big.  I'm tempted to wake up my roommate 'cause he always kills them for me.  I think I may cry if I have to kill it myself.  Or freak out.  It's not that I'm afraid of bugs, it's that I'm afraid of stinging bugs.  Stinging, flying bugs.  I have never been stung before and so...yeah, so I don't want to be.  Crrrrraaaaap.  P just IMed me.  Must go.
