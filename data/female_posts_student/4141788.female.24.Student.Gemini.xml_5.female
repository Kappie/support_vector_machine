Nothing much going on here, I'm just sort of chilling. Waiting until it's 8:00 tomorrow so we can go cooking up for our Greek Festival in September.  Herr Bruce, meinen ausgezeichneter Lehrer ist bleiben mit uns fuer ein paar Tage. Es ist wirklick toll weil er zuruek Illinois gehen ist. Sorry about that....my German grammar has gone downhill since I stopped taking German regularly at school. Good thing he's coming because he always helps me with my Deutsch. And my aunt's boyfriend is German, so he likes to talk to me in German, so I get tips from him.  Hey Kenny, if you have IM. If not, then...oops.  TAG HERR BRUCE!!! WAS GIBT'S?  I'm in the dance group Eleftheria at Prophet Elias, I'm Greek Orthodox and I'm 15.  Hey people I met at Band Camp!! What goes on with your band selves??? See you next year!!  I love you Adrastos!! (a.k.a. Tim...a.k.a. Niko....a.k.a. kouklamou) I can hear you talking to me....  This is probably THE MOST RANDOM BLOG  EVER  so I'll talk to you tomorrow.  Bis spaeter....Kali Nixta....Good night.....Guten Nacht....Bis Morgen....  FINE!! Bye!
