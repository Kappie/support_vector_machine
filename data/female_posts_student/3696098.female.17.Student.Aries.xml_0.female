Arn't guys the cause for everything? I'd say so. And one thing about guys is...they never EVER know the right things to say.  Today has been well crap. I have spent most of my day pondering, moaping, crying over Tom. Well not really crying, just a few tears. The fact is he will never know how much i love him, and how i would do anything for him. The truth is he just doesnt care. Well why should he? I have a boyfriend now. The fact is i will never be able to get over him. I could never love anyone like him. Of course i cant exactly tell him that. I try but i think he gets a little freaked out. Which is understandable. I'm like pouring my heart out to him. I wonder if he ever loved me. That's something that is always gonna play on my mind.  I don't really talk to him anymore. I always want to, but i dont cos i know how it will upset me, what with him being in England, and me now in f'in canada. Aww it's like one of those tradgic love novels you read. Heh. Well kinda... Anyway back to my point. He starts a conversation with me every now and again. It starts off fine then memories come back. Gahh i hate them. I think the worst thing for me though is seeing how much he has changed. I told him i will never love anyone as much as him. Yeh great move kelly he's already not good at commitment. But well i can't have commitment with him anyway. *sulks* he called our love 'Puppy love'. What the hell is puppy love? I don't want puppy love.  The other problem is AJ. I am realising how much i love him also more and more. I don't want to be in love with two guys!? AJ is so good to me, and im happy, but its the simple fact i will never be able to get over Tom. End of story.  Wow glad i could get that out. I wrote a popem whilst waiting for my damn sister to get off the comp so i could start this. I desperatley needed to pour it out!  Love is a strong word i wish i never had to say, giving my heart away day after day.  Love is a strong word but i said it to you, knowing how i felt, so deep and so true.  Love is a strong word, you once said to me, little did i know it wasn't meant to be.  Love is a strong word, and now i take it back, burn it with my memories and tears i held back.
