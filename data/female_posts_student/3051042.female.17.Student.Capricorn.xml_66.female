I got two tube tops because I must "show my belly" as Michelle so blatantly puts it. I purchased some other things but it was mainly underwear... for the most part.  I then headed to the mall to get my nails done for tomorrow night's performance. There are going to be a bunch of random people there. A really weird mix of people I know, but it'll be fun. My camera is still broken so Michelle is just taking pictures for me. We're going to print out a Press Pass for her... fraud is so much fun. Too much fun. I don't know how tomorrow will be, but it seems to be a load of spontaneity if you were to ask me at the moment.  Seems like I'll be waking up super early to take a shower and get caffeine. Then it's off to sound checks. Back to school for about 2 hours. I don't know if I'll be going to 6th, but I need to call Sue to tell her that I won't be making it into work due to pre-concert preparations.  Lately I've had this urge to build more bridges than I've burned in the past. I'm giving Michelle (Evanoff) a note basically describing what went on in the past. I hope our beef will be sorted out so everyone can get on with their lives. I don't mind if we're just mere acquaintances but I hope a friendship will blossom out of the pile of shit I created in the past. I was such a bitch. And for whoever thinks I still am, damn, you should have seen me 2-5 years ago... it was pretty bad.  I'm off to homework and bed. I'll probably just pass out in front of the TV, but all is good.  Must write note....
