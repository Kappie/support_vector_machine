[[twig n berries]] Talked to Clint for a bit b4 his lessons then swam some laps until my stomach started to growl. Then Chris noticed me from the water and came out and talked for a while. He was on break and we just hung out and laughed @ blake [alli's bf] having to give a swim test to the campers. Then blake came out and talked and complained about work stuff *lol* Finally scott came over while switching in the rotations [stand to stand for lifeguards] and they were all talking about beating up patrick! I was like  GUYS ! Went to food lion with alli to get more 1s and quarters for the register [me in the speedo--haha] Back to Opt, changed, then started working @ 145. Somewhat good day @ work, but also pretty boring cuz we kept closing and since Blake was there Alli was always out! They are such a cute couple. Closed with Katie around 8 then went with my dad to office depot! NEW PLANNER! Okay okay, so i like to decorate, i swear im not TOO much of a dork!  Then this girl showed up at my house in the rain [all axe-murderer like]! *haha* Christine came over! Woohoo! Gotta love fashion shows and random fone calls to Dan. Fell asleep to the rain around 12. Plans for today? Office Depot, ribbons, and carolina ale house...muy divertida.
