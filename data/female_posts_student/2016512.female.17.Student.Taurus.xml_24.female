It would be a lot of fun, but I don't really know if I feel like going to GF for an afternoon, when I'll probably have Pre-Calc and Chemistry to catch up on.  It would be nice to stay home, but then it would be fun to check out two moderately awesome college teams.   And then it would be awesome to chill with my homies.  I enjoy the warmish weather now, but I can't say that I'm a big fan of spring.  It's cold in the morning, so you have to wear a jacket, but by the afternoon it's like 65Â° and I don't have a spring jacket... that I like.  So I broil or I freeze.  Humph.    If the little things get you down, then the little things should bring us up.  I get a lot of enjoyment out of thinking about the little things in life that make my day.  Most of them are on my blog, but some aren't.  Some I don't even realize I enjoy, but I still do.    sinA = (cosA)(tanA) Manda
