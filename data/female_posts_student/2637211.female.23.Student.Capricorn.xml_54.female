Normally they have super fresh stuff, but all the good stuff was gone, it being Friday night. So we went out to Whole Foods in Berkeley... that was meager too... so we decided on tempura and teriyaki up at Sparky burger. Yum, fried food.  I rented the Bicycle Thief at Global, and I'm planning on watching it this weekend. Last night we watched Pirates of the Caribbean, and Johnny Depp is so wonderful. I loved it. Tonight we're gonna watch special features since it's not due back until Tuesday. That's all of my boring life.   So far today, we've eaten breakfast, bathed and had coffee. I did some reading and watched some Saturday morning cartoons, and then caught a little of Weird Science. Classic '80s teen movies. I love it. Now we're planning on running errands so we'll actually leave the house this weekend. Should be fun.
