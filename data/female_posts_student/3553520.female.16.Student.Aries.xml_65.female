Yeah, its okay to want to look nice once-in-a-while, but I dont understand the girls who wear heels everyday with   mini skirts straightened, dyed hair loads of make-up and a perfect tan.  I used to be more like that.  But theres a spectrum, with two extremes.  Where do I lie now? In the middle? Towards one end?  I dont think it matters.  As long as you're happy, as long as you're content why should you need a classifaction?
