Made me happy but I was sad when it ended cuz I missed him soo much. But I lived. Then I went to bed and got up early to leave for Grinnell with Mert and Evie. We drove thru Humboldt around 11:20 that morning and I dont think I ever took a breath...I just held it the whole time. *sigh* So we kept goin along and we stoped at Sonic in Fort Dodge for lunch and then got to Grinnell around 2:30. We got all ready and went to our rooms. I finally got excited then. I got settled in my room then went to Mert and Evies. Then after an hour I decided to go back to see if Kait was there yet and she wasnt so I left her a note and told her to come to Mert n Evies. Around 4:30 she got there and we went off...We found the pop machines and we hung out in a closet. Fun stuff. Then it was supper and then we had church. It was sooo cold in there. I frose. Then we went back to our room. We got thristy so we went back and found Mert and Evie cuz I needed change...and the pop machines wouldnt work. They did earlier but not now...so Mert and Evie were gonna drive us to a gas station but then his van wouldnt work...so we just finally gave up and went and watched TV and ate Mert Mix till 1ish and then we went back to our dorms and sat around. Bout 2:30 we went for a walk. It was soo quite out...it was nice...Then we went to sleep from 4-6. 2 hours. Great stuff. Then we got up n showered and got all my stuff packed into Debs van cuz we planed it all out that I could go stay with Kait and then Mert would pick me up on Sunday afternoon after dropin off Evie at their daughters. So then we had breakfast and then workshops. Thats when she met Noel. I knew him from last year...so we kinda hung out with him for awhile. Then we had another church/meeting goin on and we sat by him during that and he fell asleep. It was pretty funny. Then we had lunch and our second workshop. We went to 2 Mile and planted flowers and sorted thru toys n stuff. It was amusing. I got kinda burnt. So we went back and then we headed off with Deb. We ran into some pretty bad weather...I kinda freaked for awhile there. It stoped once we got to Ft. Dodge. We went to Walmart there and Kait and I bought more shoes. So we got to Humboldt around 6:30ish and went out to eat at Changs. And then after that we went to Ross's house. We got inside and Lexi just jumped all over me and my legs are now all scratced up n stuff. So then we went to Dairy Queen. HE DROVE! lol First time he ever drove me. Woo. And we ate there...I was soo full! Then we cruised around for awhile...and when we got back to his house...he was trying to park in the garage and kinda...hit it. LoL. Yeah....Then we stayed at his house till 11 and he brought us back to Kaits...and he hit the garage again. LoL. *Shakes head* Oh well. Then this morning I got up kinda early cuz my mom called all freaked out she didnt know what happened cuz I didnt call last night. Eh. So we showered n stuff and then went to Church. It was good...Then we went back to Kaits and sat around...had lunch...went to Pamida....had topical sno...and then round 3 or so Ross came over. Yeah...that was....interesting....*sigh* He signed my hand and wrote "Im with stupid" and then atempted to paint my nails...Haha. Fun stuff...so yeah...It was good...If I didn't see him today I know it would of killed me..Just being there all this morning and not hurt me. I felt like I had a huge brick on my heart. Yeah...*sigh* So around 6 Mert showed up and it was time to leave...I actually didnt cry tho...I coulda but I was with Mert so I held it back...Betcha 20 bucks I'll cry before I go to bed...but yeah. So I got my kiss and hug goodbye...and then we hit the road. I kept my eyes shut just so I wouldnt cry. I called my mom at Pocahontas and then I decided I was just gonna rest my eyes...I didnt even know I was gonna sleep...I didnt think I did...I opened my eyes thinking we were in Algona but we were in Everly. Kinda surprised me. I didnt know I was so tired to go out so hard. So yeah I got home bout 8:30 and got yelled at. Just what I needed....then mom made me go clean the library and now im here writing this...*sigh* Im just soo glad I got to see Ross...And I had a good time this weekend...Even tho...some parts werent so hot it was still alright.....
