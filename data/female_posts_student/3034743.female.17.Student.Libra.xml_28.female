Anyways, today was a typical day. Erin came over and we did psychology homework. That may sound boring, but it was actually fun! We totally did an awesome job on our project! It is kind of sad how excited I am about it, but it really is awesome. We have the coolest eye model, and the coolest story. Juanita Bonita and the Spum-pum! Score!! We are creative! Oh yeah. Obviously I'm in a good mood as I type this...haha. Even tho I should prolly be sad since tomorrow is monday morning. Oh well. I think I'm done blogging for tonight. Night!
