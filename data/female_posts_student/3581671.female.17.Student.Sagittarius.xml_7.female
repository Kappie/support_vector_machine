There weren't too many people I didn't know so it did really feel like an ultra-bonding time.  I am very excited for summer training, I really want to get better.  I am also excited because there is a guy I have a crush on and I did something about it, I called him.  He wasn't there but I left a message with his mom.  hmmm... I'll see what happens, probably nothing.  I am jealous because my ex-boyfriend has two girls fighting over him and has had a girlfriend all year.  Nobody's fighting over me and I have remained single.  I hope this year I meet a really nice guy and we just 'click'.  It would be fun to have a boyfriend.  I'm not needy like I have to have a boyfriend, I just think it would be sweet to hang out with someone who gives you butterflies and you could go on dates and stuff...  sigh.  Right now I will concentrate on kicking other people's ass's in running.  Ciao for now!        katie
