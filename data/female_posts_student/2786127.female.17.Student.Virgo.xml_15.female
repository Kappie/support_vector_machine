So I'm sitting here in my half *clean* room dreading tommorow where i "go under the knife" and have a 1% chance of losing all feeling in my lower jaw. Though slim, I HATE that chance...that pesky little 1 damn percent. I will kill you.  My room smells delicious because I've lit candles everywhere not only for the awesome atmosphere but because i need to be surrounded with a nice smell for a change. This past weekend I've been dancing around Tim's apartment, public restrooms, and airports. All smell pretty damn icky.   I have actual things of importance to write, yes, but its late and I just don't feel like talking about them.  Okay. Fine.  So this weekend was, well, tim. We drove up to Moscow so i could hang out with him in his college apartment. Though he usually has his roomate around (Erin) this weekend she was in Boise visiting some peeps, so It ended up just being Tim and I. And no, dirty minded bastards, we didnt do *anything* due to the isolation, thank you. In fact i didnt even really feel like cuddling with Tim while watching a movie...Its strange because lately I've been very...just personal bubbly. Especially with boys. I think I'm finding out that I just really don't want one right now...theres to many to think about and choose and I dont want to share affection with just one... This sucks. I remember getting pissed at Nate for talking about how the morman religion used to encourage a man to marry many women. He said that he would totally do that, and i got really pissed about it. He said" but jessica, I'd love every wife just as much as the other." yeah, that pissed me off too.  But now i Guess i see what he means a bit.   I care about Tim, still. I do...but he's the hardest to deal with, because if i give my heart to him then it needs to be all the way, i mean, i can't have any regrets or doubts. He's called me "the one" and his mom was talking about marrage the other day witch WAAAYY freaks me out.    Nate and I spent a full 7 hours the other night walking around my neighborhood and talking on my front steps. We both miss each other and have decided to start hanging out again to see what happens. Lately I've missed him the most...but i think it just might be because he was my most recent boyfriend. I dont think he's the one for me. meh.    Ben, of all people, is trying to hang out with me again. Intentions? unclear.   Matt? wants to date me, tried to cuddle with me and kiss me tonight at Mark's house. NOt feeling that...ugh.    BAH! I dont want to waste my spring break eating apple sauce, sitting in bed in pain and feeling sorry for myself. I like my wisdom teeth right where they are thank you. They never hurt anyone... why don't you just back off crazy ass dentist...  I had a great day today. I always feel fulfilled when i hang out with alot of people. Genie and I went to the zoo earlier today. Lame, but meh something to do. After lunch she took me home and I called up ashley to see what was going on. We called up staci, got together with her and played in the park a bit and hung out. Then we took ash home, picked up chris and matt, and I danced around with them for awhile. But...sadly i didnt want to hot tub with matt tonight, because of the bad mood about fondlige...(  mmm...maybe i should sleep.  yeah. I think I'll go do that.
