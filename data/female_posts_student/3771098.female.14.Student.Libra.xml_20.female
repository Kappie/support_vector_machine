We had a massive breakfast this morning too. After that we set up bunk beds. The 1st house smelled so bad taht i thought I was gonna' pass out/throw up. It have no idea how they live there. We had to move the couch in the den so thatthe bunk-bed could go by the door. They didn't even have a room to sleep in. Then after that we went to another house, and I could breathe in that one. After that we went to Bettes Kithcen. We got there an hour before we were supposed to be there, so we just played mrs. mary mack like little kids. It was fun. Then we went back and cleaned up Shetek, and signed everyones shirts. Then we went to a park to eat pizza, but we couldn't say because our leader person Cody thought that the risk of West Nile Virus was too great, so we went back to Shetek, and ate there. Then we listened to a guy named Kelly speak.  It was really cool. Then we all danced around the medicine circle. After that I decided not to take a shower at night like i normally do and to take one in the morning (at 4:30) to be exact instead. So i got to stay out with everyone later and talk and we lsitened to Alex Michael play guitar. He's been playing for about 5 years, and he's absolutely amazing. He can play Jimmy Hendrix, Dave Matthew, anything you name, he can play. It was really inspiring, and since I already know all the chords from piano, I've decided to learn to play guitar. I'm so excited too. Well, then Jesse played some songs, and we sang, and then we went to bed. So adios mis amigos.  Liz
