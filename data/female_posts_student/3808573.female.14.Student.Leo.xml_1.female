He was telling me some stuff, like he had a gun in the house, oh my gosh I was so freaking scared. I didn't kno what to do. But we're all better now, or at least I think we are. Gawd I hope we are! =S wellllllll, ain't got much to say, I wrote more in my main site, and I'm going to put a song on my other one.
