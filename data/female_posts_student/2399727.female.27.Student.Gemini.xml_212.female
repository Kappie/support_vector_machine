A hundred people gathered to watch;the local news had informed the masses where they could stand to watch this historical event at a safe distance.The 50-metre tall SWARU smokestack was coming down.     Environment Canada labelled the incinerator Canada's No. 1 source of toxic dioxins and furans. Itclosed in 2002 five years ahead of schedule, but not before it had made thousands of residents sick.    Just after8a.m., the loneblast shook the bottom of the tower.The cartridges barely made a dent. The blast was supposed to take out the south side, sending it crashing down in that direction. But the spectacle didn't happen; there was a little bangand no boom. Demolition attempt No. 2 is scheduled for this afternoon.     urlLink     SWARUby Ron Pozzer, Hamilton Spectator urlLink       More to come...
