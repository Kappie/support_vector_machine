I was talking to her instead of posting and updating. **Big Hug** ^_^  Anywho....here's an update as to what I've been up to.  I went to a performance by the  urlLink  West Australian Ballet Company  last night. It was outdoors in the cool, (perhaps cold), night air under the Milky Way. And picnics were encouraged. I took along spring rolls which were a big hit with the everyone. It was a terrific night out. Though I do have to admit that I was disappointed by the first act. Some of the dancers were slightly out of time and there was one point I was beginning to wonder whether it was even worth the $15 I had paid. But the rest of the show went wonderfully, enough to make up for the shaky start.
