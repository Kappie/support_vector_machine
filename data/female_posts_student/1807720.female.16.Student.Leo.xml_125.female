Tomorrow we have a Bio quiz which I know I am capable of doing good on.  Also I have an English test but if I prepare enough for it I think I will be ready.  I got like 30 something % on my reading comp test and well I can re-write it but the thing is that I TRIED MY BEST.  I used all the strategies that they have taught and everything.  It's frustrating not being able to successfully do reading comprehension all my life.  This is why I have always thought that I might have a learning problem of some sort.  It's confusing though because sometimes I can score amazing marks, and at other times I put my best effort forward and it is barely apparent.
