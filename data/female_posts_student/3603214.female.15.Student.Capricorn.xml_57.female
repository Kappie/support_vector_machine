So why don't you be my Anti-Valentine?  And then there was darkness  Because you swang or swung. And your parents disowned you 'Cause you were on that VH1 shoooooow About swingas.  You stupid swinga, I should hit ya  'Cause there's no looooooove, No looooooove, No loooooooove. So why don't you be my Anti-Valentine?
