A potential room came to my attention last night in an oh-so-divine way.  God closes a door and opens a window.  Still penniless, but you can't have everything...  Working on that second scenario. ***** Still waiting for the sponsor to call me back.  I hate loose ends. ***** Reading furiously this morning.  I never seem to be in a reading mood when I get back from noon Mass, so I will make up for it this morning.  As soon as I can tear myself away from the blog, of course ... ***** Suite dinner/birthday bash tonight at  Rancho Relaxo .  Don't ask me, I didn't pick it. ***** More to come ...
