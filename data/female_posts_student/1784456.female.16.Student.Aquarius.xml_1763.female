They are playing abba on radio 1, im scared.  O well.  How was your first day at work Katie, I have spent the day revising it has been sooo fun!  Plus to top it off i have a relly sore throat and cant talk, and charz de gal airport has fallen apart, which is where im flying into in just over a month.  WOOOOOOO!!
