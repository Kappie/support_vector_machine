It's kind of cool because even thought she and Elliot seem to be having 'issues' right this moment, they're the kind of thing that I can totally relate to. We bonded even more, if that's even possible. :) Then Monday night I got to sleep in my own bed....oh, it's been almost a month...it was delicious. and then, even more delicious, I got to see Ian tues-weds-thurs. Kickass! I shopped in my mall on Tuesday- i totally had mall withdrawl. I wanted to chill with A-sex-a but she works at EMS until hours where Ian was monopolizing me. He worke din the mornings too. Soon, lexy babe, we'll chiznill. oh, btw, Anchorman = hysterical, go see it. Hmm...oh, and we had delicious sushi. Another thing I missed in ol' St. Louie. Then Wednesday was adventure day. It was raining like CRAZY in the city, I thought we were going to drown! Just kidding. But it was raining.A Lot. But it was the shitty "Fooled you!" kidn that comes and goes, so when it was gorgeous out, we snagged scalped tickets to Ben/Rufus/Guster in the park,  urlLink http://www.livedaily.com/news/6452.html but then the skies opened up and we had to leave, which SUCKED. But it was still an adventure. I love adventures. Oh, and crazy props to random man ont he street who gave us (we were literally dripping and shivering- I 100% am getting pnemonia in a second) his umbrella, as he told Ian, to "Keep his lady dry." How sweet?! I love New Yorkers.
