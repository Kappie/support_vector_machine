They will do almost anything to be in a relationship and to have a guy say "I love you."  Apparently, being insanely jealous is not a sign of unstable insecurity but rather just another way for a guy to show how much he loves a certain girl.  Girls are also way too emotional.  Everything is about being "fair" and "love".  Wrong!  Life is not fair.  Get over it.  Stupid guys and their need to "meet people."  Yeah...how about you get over yourself and your desire to have sex with every girl you see.  While you are at it, pull your pants up and find a girl who knows what clothes are.  Oh yeah, wear a t-shirt...one with sleeves, I have no desire to see you stomach or your armpits.  Guys...I really just don't understand.  I have no desire to do a majority of the "guy" things my friends do.  I have no desire to belch or fart on anyone.  I have no desire to be belched or farted on.  Can someone explain to me how guys think?  I also have no desire to hear your problems.  Well, unless you are willing to listen to advice.  If you are going to be dumb again, then don't talk to me.  Ever.  Also, if you make a girl who is my friend cry, unless she was in a mood at the time, do not expect me to be chummy with you.  I also have no desire to hear about what you and your girlfriend/boyfriend did last night...or ever.  I have no desire to see you and your girlfriend/boyfriend "in action".  Get a room.  If you had a bad relationship experience with someone in high school, which you will, do not go back to them two days later after you spent six hours crying to me about it.  They have not matured.  Obviously, you have not.  I can be mean.  If you are dumb and I say something kind a few times do not expect me to do so indefinitely.  Eventually, I will blow up in your face.  Depending on how dumb the mistake, it may take several months to several years.  Eventually, I will tell you in a less than tactful way how I feel about you and the stupid decisions you repeatedly make.  I make exceptions for those who are unsaved.  That is it.  Otherwise, grow a little.
