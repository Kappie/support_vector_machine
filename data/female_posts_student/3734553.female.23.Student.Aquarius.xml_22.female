Supposedly books for law school will be between $800-$1000 every time.  So after that got my first assignments.  And I haven't really done anything with my day. I'm addicted to my computer, I'm on it constantly. And I keep checking my e-mail, I guess knowing he has e-mail has wrecked my week. I keep getting on and checking, hoping for something. And deep down I know it isn't there, that I just checked five minutes ago. And this makes the day seem way too long. Makes me feel more alone. Loneliness is always the worst when you're waiting on some kind of confirmation. And even though everyone has said I should just walk away- that when someone pushes and pushes and then suddenly stops, he will sit up and take notice- but not until I walk away. I just can't do it. Even though my e-mails to him are pointless and repetitive. I feel better sending them. I like to think he reads them and knows whats going on with me. Just thinking that he knows whats going on with me somehow makes it easier.  So... I've had lots of time and energy to devote to my black book. This is definitely my best one yet. And I can't help but wonder, why do I really make them? Is it some way of preserving myself? Who knows... Vade Mecum  I'm rambling, but my horoscope today was: There's a time and place for everything. Tell your story here and now. You matter.  So I'm getting it all out.  "It seems an age since I've seen you. Countdown as the weeks trickle into days. I hope that time hasn't changed you. All I really wanted was for you to stay." Powderfinger
