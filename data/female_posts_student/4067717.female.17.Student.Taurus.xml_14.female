Work was super boring last night. Did you know it's fun to look through bridal magazines? It is. They have gorgeous dresses in there.  Alice and Michelle were talking about the effects that Alzheimer's and strokes can have on the elderly, which made me sad. Memo to me: find out how grandpa is doing.  Aaand...work again today. But that's good, cause the sooner today is over, the sooner we go SHOPPING in Wichita on Monday!!! And then get to see Jonathan and Kara and maybe Jennifer either Monday night or Tuesday night. Par-tay!
