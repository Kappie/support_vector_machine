The past few weeks have been a little out there, but in a good way.  I am so smart- I have a perfect 4.0 GPA this semester (now, if only I could get money for that!) and I love that all of my grades are A for Annie!!!  I guess that all those hours spent NOT sleeping paid off!!!  Christmas was wonderful!  I actually got a talking Eeyore- one who others can hear, not just me hearing the voices in my head.  His brothers are so excited!  I LOVE that thing!  I even got a little bling-bling from the boy (who is being wonderfuller and wonderfuller, even if he is too practical sometimes).  I think this Christmas was one of the best I've had so far.  When I came to NYC (and Queens-for those of you who are keeping track) I got a letter in the mail saying that I was invited on an educational expedition in AUSTRALIA!!!  It's some place called International Mission on Education and they select like 80 college students from the U.S. (or so they say) to go to Australia and check out all the cool stuff they do in the educational field there.  Totally a once in a lifetime opportunity- but it costs way more than this future educator can afford.    If anyone knows if this company is legit please, please let me know.  I wanna go so bad!!!  Unfortunately, short of selling my soul on eBay or doing some other morally reprehensible act, I'm not sure if this trip is feasible.  I really can't think of many ways to raise $4000 in two months that don't involve run-ins with the law!  Now that that's off my mind, I can rest a little easier.  I just want 2004 to be an awesome year for me (I secretly think it will be).  The new Harry Potter comes out in June- how bad can it be?!  :oD  Okay- I will talk to you all next year (I know that was corny, but it had to be done).    Peace All, and Happy New Year!!!   Don't get too drunk (or at least don't puke- yuck)!!!    ttfn,  *me*
