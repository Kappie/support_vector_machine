Once again on a mornign when i was looking forward to sleeping in i get woekn up my my 2nd youngest sister yelling/asking me where her scungies for netball were...i was just liek  FUCK OFF ....but after being woken up like 6 times, so i got up in a pissed off mood but quickly snapped out of it...i dont remeber why i think it had to do with the fact that my sister and mum left and i was lying infront of a warm heater ...i wish i was back there now... i lazed around a little more and then got up and went on msn where i made a new hotmailaccount  urlLink  trexsdinoworld@hotmail.com   so incase u didnt know thats me as well as my  urlLink  t_rex_bites@hotmail.com   one lol... i will still be using them both. Eventually i got ready to go to netball and had to like an hour and half earlier and go to hurstville. i only found out why wen we got there...was to go bra shopping for my sister....and as all my girl friends would know that would be a  "  BIG"  job especally for her...it was hahaha...lol...anyway we then ate lunch where i got the best roll ever ...YUM and i saw jen and my cleaner friend, bryan...and its a first  HE WAS ACTUALLY CLEANING ...i know it seams weird he is a cleaner but that was the first time we have ever actually seen him clean anything!...bloody asian bludger haha jksjks...well after lunch i went to get jenny from work but she had already left so i went round trying to find her but ended up meeting her at our usual spot casue she is sneaky and got out of work really quickly...i swear watch those asians they are like flys...hang around wen u dont want them but wen u do they cant be found! We drove to netball and then had to get changed...it was  FUCKEN FREEZING .....soooo cold...and btw winds and netball skirts dont mix really well. the game was funny...out of control really..there was a chick on the other team who i think had a secret..kinda like a miriam style secret but yeh anyway she was really rough and kept swiping at ppl and she tried to do it at me and i full shouted at her " YEAH RIGHT " and well evryone was like WTF...haha jenny and i started crying with laughter....poor jenny had her as her partner tho and well everytime jenny touched the ball she would get hurt..in the end jen was scared and would serisouly flinch everytime she had the ball....stupid fucken bitch, try and hurt my friends....but it was ok...we won 26 - 13...YEAH thats right.... "OATLEY # 1 ".... far from it really..but i can dream hahaha. After netball we drove jenny home and then mum and i went to hurzy..AGAIN to go food shopping..i scored wat i wanted but so it was ok....my mum was even trying to buy me alcohol and asking me what spirits i drank even though she thinks i have only drunk once....confusing...the conversation proceeded with her telling me about how she so wanted some guy the other day...and im like wellll okkk then..the convo can stop right here lol..nah it was pretty funny i think...if hse gets a boyfriend at least she will leave me alone! plus she kept going on about that stupid santa joke again and clearly it wasnt that funny......if at all!... tonight i was supposed to go out with friends but we couldnt make up our minds so yeh we went nowhere....how shit is that...that has inspired me to right about   [+] things that bug me    friends -  as much as i love you all so much, sometimes u get on my nerves....its not ur faults just trying to organise stuff but there is always something wrong or confusing and its not simple anymore...i guess people just change...see what oatley has done...Also other friends that dog others and expect us to be fine with it, even thouhg we will always be there for when something goes wrong but it is made hard when we feel like we are just second best....but hey thats only one moment in time..for every 1 time somehting is wrong there is 100more tiems that u make my life sooo much better.   people obbsesing over parties -  as much as they can be fun why do people only feel like they can have the most fun when they are pissed off their brains. like i will admit wen i do drink its fun and i have a mad time but its not the only thing to do like things can be so much better wen we are all just together in our usual hypo moods terrorising the streets hahaha   the truth -  not knowing the truth really. HAving to be unceratain about people and if they are trustworthy or not or if they are telling you the whole truth. Sometimes it is best not to know the truth but if its gonna come out sometime, there is no time like the present.   not knowing the reason for thigns -  like not just simple things like why chewing gum always seems to get stuck to shoes hahah but things like why are certain people here and others arent, why can people see things that others can't, is there a reason why some people have to see things they wish they didnt becasue it will stick with them for life....sorry just rambeling on..i dont think anyone else gets what i mean but yeh....my twisted head lol.   [+] Guys on my mind    Marcel -  you are just so hot lol i cant get u off my brain...nah nah jksjks....u are da bomb "this is too primary school for me" hahaha...marcel is the coolest, known him since i was 7...gees thats a long time ...lol..woohoo....love ya..mwa   Matty -  he is probably the shortest guy my age that i know, but hes still coo and is such a mad b-boy lol...(is that even what i should call ya...hahahi woudlnt know)..u wanted to be mentioned and all i can think about is how when we are together its like that add for tooheys "what mates do" casue well think of it this way...matt comes up to my tits and well he is always wanting hugs....should i be concerned....doesnt matter if he starts to annoy me too much i can always suffocate u...hahah...nah i still love ya matsta =>   Guys in general -  all so confusing, but couldnt live without u all hahaha...its like a curse i swear...soppp unfair   Ralph -  thinking how mad it is that i have ur phone at the moment casue i can actually see the whole screen, even tho i have no credit to write msgs at the moment, its still cool but.......= )thanks ....MWA   Nathaniel -  HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOY!!!!!....ur 17 now woohoo time to get ur P's, u can drive me places hahaha YAY lol....hope u had a great day...love ya kid...mwa  ANYWAY....i got to have the chinese i wanted for dinner tonight...it was soooo YUMMY.... oh yeh also i was listening to the u2 song "with or without u" in car today and i have heard it sooo many tiems but yeh i just realised how much i love it..its hte best...hahaha... i think this is the end of my blog for tongiht..im sure there is alot i have forgotten about during the day but if its important i can always write another one hahaha  i thought i would end with a quote...tongiths is from Shannon Nolls learn to fly hahaha (only cause it was aon the radio and make sense     "....When you feel the dream is over,Feel the world is on your shoulders,and you've lost the strength to carry on.Even though the walls may crumble,And you find you always stumble through,Remember never to surrender to the dark.Cos if you turn another page,You will see that's not the way, The story has to end......."
