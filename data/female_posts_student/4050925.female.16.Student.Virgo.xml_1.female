Becca smsed me today to inform me abt the swim suits sale at royale sporting house. haha..i told her to get a pink bikini=P. i think becca needs security and she's someone you'll want to protect cos she gets hurt pretty easily. seriously i think she has not gotten over him. in reality, time dun heal the emotional pain but people who r escaping from reality keep telling themselves time will heal the pain. it's useless..really.  lastly, i hope everyone around me will be happy and tml's competition will go smooothly for nyjc.  Good nite=)
