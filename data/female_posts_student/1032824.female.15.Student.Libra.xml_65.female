I met up with Jeremy and Jason(weihoong) at school this morning to ask Miss Halizah questions on the holiday homework. she re-taught the entire chapter on moles and it helped us quite a bit. the problem with jeremy and i is that, we are  able  to memorise the fomula, BUT, we're not sure how to apply them to the questions. =\ so sucky right? hehe. ah well. anyhow! she went really slow and i managed to catch what she was explaining. not many people know the patient and soft side of Miss Halizah i guess. i myself was surprised! =)  After attempting the questions, we just sat there and chilled with her. talked crap and also watched the graduates strutting their stuffs hahaa! many of them dressed up really elegantly and formally. but like what miss halizah had mentioned, Singapore's proms can't be compared to the ones in the states/west where guys pick the girls up in their dad's car! haha! which is so true. anyways, they're still underage, and that kinda' stinks. my sister from crescent girls will be attending her prom night in several hours time. she bought this beautiful tube gown, dyed her hair, permed it and i don't know what else is she gonna do to herself, but i believe she'll look awesome tonight!! i'm so happy for her! she'll be staying over at The Oriental with her NCC mates too. all squeeze into 1 room. i bet it's gonna be one helluva' slumber party! teehee. i wouldn't mind getting drunk with my mates there if i were her.  I pity our graduates though. i pity myself too! graduation in school is rather..pathetic! yes, that's zee perfect word to describe the occasion and venue. hmm. we were discussing about how their make-up's gonna melt due to the uber hot weather. i saw almost everyone ambling into the school gate. mr hang dressed up for the occasion. mss koh too. miss shelley low especially! woah! she was, "radiant"! hehe. here is my pick for the best dressed! (dress+make up+attitude)   BEST DRESSED MALE:   Melvin Tan    BEST DRESSED FEMALE:  The tanned, slim, tall netballer with straight long hair. a pity i don't know her name!  It was so cool. huishan was standing near the gate with a camera crew (MRL). somewhat like the Star Awards!
