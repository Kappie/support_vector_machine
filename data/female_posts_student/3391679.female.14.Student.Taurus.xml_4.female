The food was satisfactory. Let me just complain one bit.........I am home alone a lot lately......but i like to be home alone.......i have this strange thing happening where i have been listening to country music A LOT lately like when i was 10. I think it is because I miss the south and the country way of life. That left me wen i moved to colorado. I miss Louisiana soooo much it is like in my bloood. Something i need to live. I can almost promis you i will live in the south when i am older and buying my own house..... unless something doesn't go according to plan...... ne ways.......love michelle
