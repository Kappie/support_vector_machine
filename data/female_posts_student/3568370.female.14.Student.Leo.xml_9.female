But why the hell won't my parents let me go out alot.. argh.. they even got me a valleyfair pass.. so that means going out alot.. to go to the park.. oh and everytime i ask... they go.. go talk to your mom.. than you go back to your mom and your mom says go talk to your dad..than by the time you have to go.. you cant go.. that really pisses me off... gawsh and you know most parents wouldn't mind sending their child out to hang out with friends... gawsh and teenagers at the age of 14 now want to start going out alot... what will parents do when they turn 16.. HELLO? drivers licence? they'll be going out more than lots of people. how will they stop em? gawsh... pisses me off!
