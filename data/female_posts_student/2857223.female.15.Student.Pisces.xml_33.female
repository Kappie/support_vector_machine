The first onehad this 50-something, poker-playing, surfer-dude dad named John S. from Brookyln. He was getting ready to have his monthly poker night, and so the guys (girls?) wanted to clean him up and make his poker night a "real" guy's night out.   So anyway, this guy really did look like a beach bum, or "beach homeless" as Carson put it, and so did his house, so they started like they always do by tearing apart everything. This guy's house wasn't  that  bad, thanks to his wife I think, so they got that done pretty quick, and then headed down to HUGO something er other to get him some non-beachy-bummy clothes. They picked out mostly "earth" toned pants and dressy flip-flops, and some pin-striped shirts and (again Carson) "Ocean's Eleven" jackets. They topped all the outfits off with some casino-ee looking sunglasses.  After the clothes they go and give this guy a MUCH NEEDED haircut. I mean, this guys hair was preeeety awesome, but he looked waaay better with a good trim. Before the cut, his hair was  atleast  down to his shoulders and REALLY messy. The hair stylist cut it back to a nice little wavy style, and it looked really good for John S. ;) Anway, after the haircut, Kyan got him and gave him some hair stuff and some sunscreen, lol, because John never wore any, and he playeda lot of beach volleyball...way to go John.   Before the day was out, Ted took him to the Brooklyn Brewery to see how beer is made! What a trip. They got to tast the diff. b/t fermented and unfermented beer, mmmmm, and then they made there way to the Official Brooklyn Brewery Bar, where they tasted some fresh beer right off the assembly line, haha. Then they went back to John's totally redecorated and fabulous looking house (Kudos to Thom) and Ted showed John how to make a club sandwich, and showed John how the new drawer handles in his kitchen worked as  beer bottle openers!  Yay! Actually, no, bad mistake Ted. After the group had left, John drank about 6 or7 beers before the guys even showed up for the poker game.  After making the sandwiches, John went up and changed into his "Ocean's Eleven" look, with only  one  flaw. He put on the nice shirt, the nice pants, the nice jacket, but then put on his "nice" flip-flops, much to the dismay of Carson. It was funny too, before he got dressed, he'd just gotten out of the shower and was going to put the gel stuff in his hair. So he squirts some into his hand, and just as Kyan was telling him to spread it in his hands, John takes the whole mound of it on his hands and plops it into his hair and spreads it around - I thought Kyan was going to cry :P  So then we make it to the final Queer moment - the Poker game. When the doorbell finally rang, it was a bunch "EY OWYA DOOIN?!" like in the Sopranos when all the guys walked in (all wearing nice suit jackets, so John wasn't left out). One of the goals for John was to actually not get drunk and  win  the poker game - the boys even got him a nice poker table to go on his dining room table. So John, already having those 5 or 6 beers  before  hand, didn't do too well. He did ok, I guess, but didn't win it - and he was bummed.   He even told all his pals that he wanted to win the game, just for the guys :( Poor John.  However, John actually  was  a winner, because  he  looked better, his  house  looked better, and his very lovely wife  felt  better when she got home from her "girls night out" with her daughter, arranged by Jai (what a sweety).  Anyway, this guy sort of reminded my of  my  dad (actually just the hair), so I was thinking I should see if the Fab 5'll come down to Hooterville and give my dad a makeover...haha! He would most likely kill himself, or better yet,  me.
