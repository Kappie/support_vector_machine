I am reading an amazing book called, The Five People You Meet In Heaven. I can hardly put it down, but I don't want to finish it yet because it is soooo good. I put Nick in our Baby Bjorn front carrier and walked around our apartment to get in some reading time this afternoon.  Nick's room is almost complete!!! We decided to put carpet in his room closer to fall because we don't need it yet. We will need carpet in our living room soon so Nick has more opportunities for tummy*time.-Even though he hates tummy*time with a passion. Shawn  I decided to go with a "Finding Nemo" fish theme. It looks great and Nick stared at all the pictures in his swing today for 45 minutes! I think he likes it, too.  Grandma Lu bought "Christian" Nick his first pair of carhart pants today! I can't wait to see Nick in them =) He is going to look adorable.  Only eight days until Shawn begins his internship in the cities. Nick  I are in search of some sort of play group.
