Today, me and dylan laid around all morning, and then we went down to the boardwalk and the lost boys bridge, we went and climbed under it and sat on this pipe thing for a while, which was really pretty and awesome. and then we walked all the way up the beach and back, and then all the way down this wharf (the thing stupid canadians call a dock...hahahaha) and then we walked around the boardwalk again. fun stuff.  i love dylan. like. I cant even explain it. theres nothing in my life that i have ever experienced quite like it. i love all the little things about him, and i love being with him, and i just... i dont know. he is amazing.  oh- to everyone hes mean to... he says hes just mean to you cause he thinks its funny.  cheyennes hair isnt purple! i wonder what color it is...  mmm... pizza is ready. im going to go eat it ALL UP and then go stuff myself full of mariannes ice cream.  ~abby
