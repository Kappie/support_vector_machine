Greg is such a dick... he found out about Vin and now we're just not talking any more.. not like it matters... all we ever did was fight any ways.... but see, he didn't take it too well... again: not that it matters. He has no right to tell me what to do anymore. He was just being a totaly baby about it... when we broke up all the other times and I found he was hooking up with other girls I let it be... I didn't IM him and start fights. I just wanted me and him to be friends like we always were when there wasn't any room for convo's about how much he misses me and how I was so bad to him and then me yelling back about how he mad me that way. I miss when me and him could just talk on the phone about nothign.. but I don't even want that after tonight... I don't... So I blocked him cause I didn't want to deal with him anymore. We'll talk again eventaually but I don't know when that will be. I'm just mad nervuos hes going to try and do something to Vin... I'd rather me get beat up, as Claire had threatend, then him. He hasn't done anything... Greg is just so fucking messed up... SO messed up... the only thing that's really comforting me right now is my Dashboard CD (many a thanks to Deb) and the thought that theres only 2 more years left till I get to leave this place... 2 more years and I'll get to leave him (Greg) behind... I know I just said that we'll talk eventually but... I don't know tonights fight was pretty intense... if we stop being friends then I guess I would be able to deal with it but... I don't know I don't like people hating me cause I'm trying to make myself happy... everyone always says I think of other people too much and focus less on myself... and that's all I'm doing, thinking about myself for once.. I could have EASILY said yes to going back with Greg out of pitty for him but I wasn't going to do that for a few reasons, 1. I don't want a boyfriend and 2. that's mean and disrespectful and would have resulted in a worse breakup later.... this whole summer has been filled with ups and downs and I can't wait for school to start when things will get easier and I won't have all this free space in my head to think about stupid things... I just wanna have fun... be happy.. and I have been lately up until tonight... I just need for tomrrow to come when I see my friends I guess... yea... alright.. I'll see you all tomorrow... much love XOXOXOXOXOXOXOX
