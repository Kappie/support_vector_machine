He looked over my new proposal and, to my surprise, didn't have me wad it up and throw it in the trash.  I asked, "is it reasonable, plausible?"  He replied, "it's more than reasonable and plausible.  It's actually good."  Good news there.  But...even if my application does pass the 2nd round (New York), there is no necessary guarantee that Brazil will approve of it.  We'll just have to keep our fingers crossed.  If Fulbright doesn't work out, there's always Grad School, and of course--Cuba.  I have so many damn things to do between now and December, it's not even funny.   I should get working on one of those many things, instead of procrastinating like an ass.
