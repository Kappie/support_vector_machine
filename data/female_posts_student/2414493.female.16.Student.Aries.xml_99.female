But it's so true! Playing on that nine-foot Steinway that I missed playing on that one time because I had to do something--mock trial two years ago, I think it was. And afterwards, we snuck into the kitchen and had a dinner--giggles again. I don't know, I'm an old soul and it's probably annoying to other people, but I don't find what's so funny about tiramisu and blueberries.  My brother: "Hem, I can almost do the worm!" I bet he read some online instructional manual, that kid.  Why am I so high on all the good things in life? and why now?
