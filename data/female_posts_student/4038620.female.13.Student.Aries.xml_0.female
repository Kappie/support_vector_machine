But when i wanted to take a picture of him he took my handphone and ran away. finally i caught up with him but he did not let me have it back until the cover dropped. after a while beverley came and played my handphone and also wanted to take a picture of him but he ended up taking it away again. so i chased him until i managed to get it back and he said(u take back i still can tell teacher) so i quicky put it in my bag.at 10.30am i went to gate b to wait for the teacher.she never told us to do anything so we juz stand around at 11.00am we(huisi and i) were getting restless so we asked the teacher if we could walk around the school .she said ok so we went round the school and bought a bookmark for samantha(sam) and huisi's sister.after that i went to the hall to see my brother make the castle(lego)and den to the ava room to see the live auction.after that i went to eat a little in the canteen and den i had to go for my ballet lesson 2.00 in order to be early. den i came back home.
