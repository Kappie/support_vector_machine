So yesterday was the ultimately worst day of my life. Beside my computer being for shit, my dad heard the whole, "Ashley does Ectasy" story and we talked. Madeline's mom saw me smoking on my way to the Secretary of State. Ran a red light in front of her too. I worked about 2 hours. Donald and Mark bitched me out about how I'm not a "Product of the 80s" as my t-shirt proclaimed. So I was hyped up on caffine all day, and so when I got home I spent about an hour cleaning my car. I didn't realize until afterward how impulsive the Overkleeft family is. Paranoid that my parents were going to find out that I smoke, the interior of my Escape is now spotless. I looked like I was cleaning a murder crime scene or something. Blasting classical music while on top of my car, scrubbing the shit out of my moon/sun roof.  I've gotta do homework tonight. Get my hair done tomorrow and start my pill again so I can have some wild and crazy sex. Pah... yeah... riiiight.  Kellman reminds me of Red Green only without the crazy suspenders.  I started the Alize painting for Nick. I'm insane. It looks good though. I hope it's the right kind. If not, I'll drink it. ;-)  Tiki is feeling upset and empty. I bought her a card and I've been having everyone sign it. I hope it cheers her up.  Michelle and I are going up to Flint together this Friday. We'll get drunk and stoned the  party and whore it up. It'll be a blast.  My brother is off the hook with the whole dog fire situation. The Dean came back and was pissed at the Assistant Dean for suspending the pledges. It's all good, but the frat is punishing them with community service and possibly chores. Merry X-mas Henk.  I'm done writing for now... more to come later.
