Except for all the church people. But they don't matter.  I decided to get the clear braces and from far away you cant even tell I have braces. But then if your, at most, 3 feet away you can totally see them. Oh well.  I can't wiat till I get them off. I h ave two years. I decided I am going to do EVERYTHING they tell me. I am sure everyone says that but then stops doing it after they have had their braces for awhile. But, I am gonna do it!  I will update you on how it goes. :)
