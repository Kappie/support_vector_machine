I failed my last AP chem test...and I'm so scared for this one, I studied a lot though but it probably won't do any fucking good. Ah well. I can't wait until Tessmer is my teacher again...hopefully he can get some of the information to stay in my head. Lately it seems like everything I know just kind of...falls out.  I don't think there's any room left up there.  At least there's no school the rest of the week after tomorrow...I don't think I would be able to handle that.  Orange juice is quite tasty.
