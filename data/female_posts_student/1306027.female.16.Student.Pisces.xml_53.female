I tried not to make eye contact- I'm slightly shy... plus I didn't want to look like I was watching his fine body trying to dunk the basketball, er, I mean, stalking him with my eyes. He's really cute! He has this awesomely curly hair that's brown with goldish highlights. My dad cracked a joke about it, he's like, "How would you like to see me in that hair!". Thanks dad- way to score points for me! Anyways, I think the dude is on a basketball team. Maybe the local highschool team.. Idk. I tried to make out his eye color but he never was close enough for me to actually determine. But I think they are brown? My mom claims he is German... *coughs*    So anyways  He totally was showing off, but that's beside the point. We almost made eye contact as I was walking to the bathroom. *Magic* ahh... He probably has a girlfriend. Scratch probably- does. *sigh* WHERE'S MY PERFECT DUDE?! Arg.. *Plays enchanting music so all the fine guys migrate her way*    And Finally  Watch- I'll probably end up in some relationship like Beatrice and Benedict in Much Ado About Nothing. We're mortal enemies, exchange a fair amount of insults, then fall in love without even thinking about it in the first place. That would be just my luck.     Erg Da Jerg(slur for Erk the Jerk)
