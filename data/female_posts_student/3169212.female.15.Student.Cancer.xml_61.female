And why must you use the term Baka, idiot will suffice.  Also, demon boy - i would love to help you work out any anger issues you have.  Which, you must have because you got angry at someone typing your name wrong, savvy? Rum works wonders!!            Well for those of you who do not know me, I am The infamous Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you forget the CAPTAIN i might just send Elizabeth Swann after you and that IS something to be afraid of, mates.   adieu, avidosay, aloha, and all those other good-by things
