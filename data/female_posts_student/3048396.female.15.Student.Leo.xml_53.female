Everything went great...Hes in good shape. So thats good. Only the kidney was contained and its gone and he bled very little so everythings lookin up. We had a family reunion in there I swear! We had Grandma, Phyllis, Donnie, Leslie, Merna Rae, and my mom and I. Howard and Jean also showed up. So yeah. After we heard the good news we all went out shopping for a lil while and got lunch and brought it all back. I had a good time with Aunt Merna Rae since I never really spend much time with her...and we both have the shoe love. My mom was lookin all over for us and once we showed up we told her we were in the shoes and my mom just laughed and said that she should of known that. LoL. Yeah. So I've been kinda ticked all last night and today because stupid TCA hasn't been working. Atleast the people who use the server. So right now I'm at my Grandma Hansens. She has TCA but she has dial-up...so it must be different cuz this is working just fine. I was goin crazy at home...I was soo bored. Oh...also today after we left the hospital I went shopping for just a lil while and I got new shorts and a skirt. Heh my moms gonna hate it..."Its to short!" Oh well...Dont care...We're actually getting along in my house for once...amazing. Theres actually been more laughs than yells...We haven't yelled for atleast 3 days! Thats like a record or something...so yeah. Right now all im doing is hoping it doesnt rain tomorrow...Im soooo sick of rain! Its raining right now...eh. I need my sun back! *sigh* Oh well it gave my burn time to heal and turn into tan...I didn't peel so my back looks dark now...so its all good. Im almost darker than my Aunt Leslie who is from the Phillepines (sp?) Eh cant spell..oh well. So yeah...Guess not much else is happening round here...pretty dang boring....
