I was never expecting any of this, I mean seriously about this time last year I was about to give up on guys and the pricks that they turn out to be. But now, I realize that there are some guys out there that are different from the others. They're sensitive, caring, they're perfectly fine just laying with you, looking in your eyes, than trying to get in your pants. They make you feel special, that you're the only girl for them, and how you get all tingly just thinking about them or them touching you. I wish I could have that all back, even if it was just for a moment...Sometimes during class I'll zone out and think about last week, and what all happened, then I get the butterflies in my tummy and this tingly sensation, then as quick as it comes, it's gone...  I know that a year and a half isn't that far off, and I don't mind waiting, because in the end all of it will be worth it. I have never been in this serious of a relationship before, most were short lived, lol my longest being like 4 months, then a few crushes, which that turned out to be disasterous (shut up Ritika). So really all this is new to me too.  I've never felt this way before, it's all new, yet so exciting, like I don't know what's going to happen. It's almost like the rush I get from being on stage.  What hurts the most though, since we can't be together right now, is seeing other people together. I know how that feels now with him, holding hands, kissing, laying on one another, staring in each other's eyes, the scent of his cologne, even today I was remembering rubbing my nose against his...it was so soft...so was his hands. i wish I could have all that back, and I will eventually...hopefully asap, there's always spring break, possibly the summer, I mean if I get a job instead of buying clothes, I'll just save it for plane tickets, lol. I just wish I could tell my parents, I mean it's not that big of a deal anymore, since we've met, but I don't know coming up with how, is another issue.  I know I shouldn't be saying this, I know I'm only 16 (almost 17 bitches!) but I love David so much, I want to be with him forever...he makes me so happy, he's helped me in so many ways he could hardly imagine. Just knowing I have someone there who cares for me and will be there whenever, I couldn't ask for anything else...   Without your touch I've been lost without the things I love Without your kiss I've been dreaming of the things I miss Your eyes, your mouth, your lips, your touch
