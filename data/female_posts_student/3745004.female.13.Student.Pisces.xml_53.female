A link to where I got it from is coming, don't worry), so I went back to the site I got it from for two reasons. 1, I needed to find out if he was from a story or anime. (Point of interest: He's just a created character namd Alex, apparently) 2, I wanted to see what else the site had, because I was just scanning the place when I found the first picture. So, I was off to the  urlLink art gallery  of  urlLink BakaNeko  to see what I could find.  And I wasn't disappointed!  I stumbled across a  urlLink very interesting picture . (Again: Not my art) The character on the left caught my eye. It was promising, but there were two problems. The colors, and the other person in the picture. But he had the right shape to his face, and his clothes were right as well. Big problem? Well, I could always try and rely on the general populace of short-attention span roleplayers to read my profile once it came. But.. you know, people don't  do  that these days. They just look at the picture. So, it was steadily becoming more of a problem. But I can be  stubborn  when I want to be.  So what I did was dragged the picture into my trusty version of Photoshop. Short while later I came out with what I wanted.  urlLink Success!  It's still awaiting the final 'OK' from the owner of the character Sasuke, but.. I dunno.. I think it's better than the one I had in the beginning. Much more 'Sasuke' to it.  But pretty much all I'm trying to say here is that Photoshop Is God.
