Wil, what have we set the boys from tripod this morning after last week’s tour-de-force? WIL: We want them to reveal their DJ names; we want a blatant cross promotion to their Comedy Festival show –  ADAM: They’ve got to fit it in like that “My Restaurant Rules” meets “Popstars” advertorial the other night. WIL: Exactly. We want um a mention of the fact that it was revealed today by an Australian scientist that it’s actually healthy to pick your nose and eat it. ADAM: Okay WIL: We want the slogan that was on the Westco T-shirts that they were trying to make their staff wear which said, “stop pretending you don’t want me”; and we want a mention of our favourite man of the moment, Craig Stevens, the guy denying Thorpie his gold medal.
