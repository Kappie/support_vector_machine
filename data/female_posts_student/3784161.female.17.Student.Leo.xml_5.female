New kid- Nathan- very awesome guy. cept that he doesn't vote, that will have to be remedied, but for real,I think he'll fit well with the rest of us.       I wish here was someone to be all excited for me about today. I can drive! woo hoo.    Dr. Dillaman, if something bad is happening to the animals, we've got to tell the Wizard. That's why we have a wizard.
