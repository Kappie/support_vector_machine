Beautiful love your such a mystery Will I be cursed forever like this Or will I be with Jeramie soon How can you be this cruel?  Beautiful love what have you done to me I'm in love with some one we'll never be How can you do this to me like this I am with out love  Beautiful love your such a mystery you give me one I can only see I can't touch , kiss, hug, love know Because of you This is all your fault
