In your relationship with God, He may let you make a wrong decision. Then the Spirit of God causes you to recognize that it is not God's will. He guides you back to the right path. He will clarify what He wants. He will even take the circumstances of your disobedience and work that together for good (Rom. 8:28) as He corrects you and teaches you His ways." -Henry Blackaby  "Tension is to be loved when it is like a passing note  to a beautiful, beautiful chord..." -Sixpence None the Richer  "You always were the one To make us stand out in the crowd Though every once upon a while Your head was in a cloud There's nothing you could never do To ever let me down And remember that I'll always love you..." -Badly Drawn Boy, "A Minor Incident"
