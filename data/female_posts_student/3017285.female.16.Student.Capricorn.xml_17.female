How can the  students  not know of there is a  student  life comittee?!?! And why do we not get input? Our parents get a questionaire, send one to us too! I mean, I know most of the students are imature, but we deserve an input!!! Or, better yet, representation! There's a proper job for the student council, represent the students in front of the Student Life Comittee. They can give questionaires to homeroom representatives, who'll get opinions from their homeroom and then get them back to the comitee. I can't believe that there is a Student Life Comittee. I can't believe they don't tell us that there's a Student Life Comittee. I shall complain to someone as soon as i find out who to complain to. Maybe I'll write an article about it for the school newspaper (*snort* and watch it be discarded in favour of some random piece of news about the golf team)
