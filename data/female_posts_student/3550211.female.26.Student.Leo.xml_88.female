Bowie, 57, had emergency angioplasty surgery for a blocked artery at a hospital in Germany after seeking treatment for a pinched nerve during a concert tour, publicist Mitch Schneider said in a statement on Thursday.   In his own words: "I'm so pissed off because the last 10 months of this tour have been so f---ing fantastic," Bowie said in a statement. "Can't wait to be fully recovered and get back to work again. I tell you what, though, I won't be writing a song about this one."
