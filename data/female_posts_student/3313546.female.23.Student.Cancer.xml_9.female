Boring, dull, admittedly limited geographics, limited venues, cheap consumers and cheap products, chain restaurants, upscale dining, law abiding bars and clubs that play 80s classics, (safe, stale politics, nothing too challenging for the tourists). Some local music. On the Hill, sunny and shady alternating, the heat rises from pavement, there are few points to consider: 1. Location, on the Hill, 2. Season, summer so it is empty as a small town, 3. old slimy or grungy hippies, homeless people, and flower children, as well as barefoot guitar strumming singers, and crazy redneck 40 something divorcees. Uber conservatives, neoconservatives in democratic disguise, ambition creates yuppies. Everything divorced of ideas, alienated from my life, I am walking through a city that dislikes intellect, shuns the real practice of it, writing, and reading, an∂ høpefully talking, we can only imagine what it was like for poets and writers in the 1960s, but now, this place stinks of sell outs. Often, almost everyday I walk through this same low down quiet neighborhood, surrounded by centenarian trees, Victorian remodels, rebuit monstrosities, and cute English manor style homes, along Mapleton, etc... until I reach Pearl St, where the cute quiet neighborhood gives off onto cute little shops, a cute bakery, a cute wine shop, a cute Grocery, a cute pizzeria, a cute paper factory and stationary shop, two antique shops; one expensive the other quaint,  an Indian restaurant, the headquarters for Sky Chairs, a White Apartment house, right next to the new age medicinal and skin product store, then across the street the bike shop, we proceed downtown, past the boring center of town. Nothing is more likely to create confusion and disillusionment than seeing the same people, the same faces, the same "cute" town everday, and no part of Boulder is more unbearable than the Pearl St. Mall, don't be fooled. If I was satisfied with irony, I would stop here. ..  I have given in to my lifestyle, which is also cute. Enough cute already, it makes me nervous, and sick.   I live with my grandpa in a cute little white house, with a cute little black dog, with cute little sayings and proverbs, moderately humorous, very humble on white placards, etc...  I carry blueberries, strawberries, and 1 navel orange in my backpack. When I describe it it feels less horrifying, but really I didn't like being put into this law abiding community. I need a community more wild, less restricted, with a feeling a sophisticated and difficult intelligence, and not this easy freethinking, open forum, a little more conflict makes life interesting.  Don't you agree?
