       
      Starring at the floor on my ceiling Starring at the rugs on my walls Wondering if I'm Really there at all  Seeing you walk through my closet door Seeing things I've never seen before Wondering if  You're really there at all  Seeing the snow fall  off my hair Before it bursts into tiny flames Wondering why I don't feel it Burn at all  And I don't know
