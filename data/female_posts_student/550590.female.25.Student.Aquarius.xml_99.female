The fact that Bruce has gotten me into a habit of napping even more often than I have in the past (yes, it is possible) isn't a good thing...well, it's kind of a good thing.  :)  Tomorrow it's fun with kiddies and amusement parks.  We're taking our volunteers on a trip to Wild Adventures in Valdosta, GA.  Gotta love getting paid to ride rollercoasters.  The best part is that I get to drive an unmarked Sheriff's Office vehicle, complete with lights and sirens and a radio.  Heheheh...mui malo.  ()=)  Zoe has embarked on a mission to destroy my house.  In the past 2 weeks I've lost: my angel wings, a pair of heels, two rolls of paper towels, the cover of my day planner, a couple bags of garbage, a loaf of bread, and she almost got her grubby paws on Butros Butros Galli while I was showering this morning.  The dog is on a rampage.  My parents and Bruce have come to the conclusion that she's not getting enough attention.  Shit, I thought I was the attention whore around here.  Sheesh.  So next weekend, I'm shipping her off to Grampa Boot Camp so Dad can re-teach her to bite feet and mom can feed her toast and she can hate me even more than she already does.  Well, I basically did nothing but nap all afternoon, and I'm still exhausted and since I have to be up at the crack of dawn, I'm off to bed.
