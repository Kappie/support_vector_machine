We're waiting for trent to get here and take us to a party. Justin got in another wreck. This time it was minor but a nigg bumped into him. Nigga what! How rude. Nothing exciting is happening at all. It's raining but it used to be all hot and sunny. I got a tan! Yay it gets darker every day but i'm still caucasian like whoa. My mom and sister are gone so let's rejoice and be glad. Daddy is the fun shit. Well i guess i'm bouncin, gonna get ready. Later hos i looove you.      -You wanted the best...it wasn't me      Will you give it back? Now i'll take the lead      When there's no more room to make it grow.      I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive.      Is this what you want? Is this what you need?      How you end up, let me know.-
