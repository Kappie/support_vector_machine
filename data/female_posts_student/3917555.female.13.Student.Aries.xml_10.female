I forgot the password, and my email wasn't working so I was like screw this S! neways, it's the morning and I'm just about to go babysitting-Joy! ;-) This has been the suckiest summer yet I have to admit, the only things I have done was Canobie, Maine, Softball Camp, and Feild Hockey Camp (coming up soon.) I really really wanted to do FH but I can't cause its the same season as XC and lordie I wont miss out on XC!!! (Even tho i sucked last year haha.)  Nothing else to say right now...I will 'blog' *lol that sounds funni* after I get home!  P.S.-All the times are wrong on the thing on the bottom where it says POSTED AT: this one says like 6 something but its realy 9 something! So if I dont fix it, just remember that its 3 hours  before  the actual time! OK! :-)         "On the way down, i saw you  and you saved me from my self.  And i won't forget the way you loved me.  On the way down i almost fell right through  But i held on to You.'   .::: Sam :::.
