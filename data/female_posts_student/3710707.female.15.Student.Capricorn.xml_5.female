But ive so gotta have my shower, i'm such a lazy lil bitch, but oh well... if u dun like it, u can go fart on a tree!  Hmm... so...  I dun think neone wants to hear about my fabulous day with Chris, but I saw Stepford Wives, which was ok. I dun really recommend it though.  Anyone wanna go c I-Robot (or something else.. depends whats best out) next weekend cause i'm planning it. I'll probably make it Sunday.  In dun really have much to write in here... my life is pretty much unwavering at the moment...  So ill just go...  Cya peoples  ~Shadow~
