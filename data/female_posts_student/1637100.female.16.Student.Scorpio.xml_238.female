No matter if knock-knock jokes, sarcasm, or slapstick get you going, it's clear that you've got more than a couple funny bones in your body.  Getting a laugh out of people isn't always easy, but it seems second nature to you. You're not one to take life too seriously, and you know firsthand that laughter really is the best medicine. It's no wonder people know to look no further than you when they want to have a laugh. Late-night TV had better look out. A hilarious new comic could be on the rise!     guess what?? im not even started my ppt presentation project thing. i am screwed. its 11:00. yup. i am so screwed.
