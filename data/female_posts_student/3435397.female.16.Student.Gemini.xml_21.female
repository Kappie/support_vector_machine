It didn't hurt at all after it kind stung and was hot but that's it and it only hurts when I touch it so if I don't touch it, it feels like an ear! LOL After that Ashley and I were walking towards the school and there was NEIL! He was taking us to Value Village where he spent a shit load of money and I bought all of two shirts! They were so cool! One said Fat Cat on the sleeve and had paw prints all the way across the front of it and the other said "Lumsdon Duck derby" and it had a duck that was bright colors on it! I had lots of fun today!   My math final was really good.  It wasn't easy but it wasn't hard it was a math test! LOL the best way to explain it! Tonight when Ashley was over we went bike riding/I roller bladed and we got a real work out well I did(stupid freakin hills!)  When we got home Candace(older sister) was here and we talked a bit, took Ashley to her grandparents and then I went to my sister softball game.  Her boyfriend showed up so she hung out with him for a bit.  I don't think he is getting any play the because she was kind of I don't know more buddy buddy with him! BUT MEH! All the better! When I got home from the softball game I thought I should return some of the phone calls I got when Ashley and I were out including my sister-in-law Jody called! So I called her back and I talked to my brother and Jody for a long time! It was really good because I missed them so much and my brother actually told me he loved me and I usually have to say it so he can keep his other brother coolness it was really sweet how he was like "Anyways I hope you had a cool birthday*pauses for a long second* I love you!!"  I was really happy him and I haven't been on the best terms LOL! The best thing is that in sept.  My brother and his family are all commons out to Regina for a week and if I talk my parents into it maybe missing a few days of school may be in order.   I want to thank everyone for wishing me a happy birthday and say sorry for being kind of ITS MY BIRTHDAY SO LET ME HEAR IT!!! Kind of Erin today LOL! Today is My day and My NATIONAL HOLIDAY!!! Love you all very much I hope you had a very good Erin's Birthday as well. Oh yea!
