The College of William and Mary was pretty nice, there were alot of old buildings and literally no one walking around.  The historical district had some cool stuff like a place where you could buy handmade colonial soap.  I bought a shirt and some pants from the College of W store and then got some gifts for people from the Cheese Store.  No, the gifts i got were not cheese.  They had Ritter Sport chocolate at this one store!!!!  I bought a few bars because that is THE BEST chocolate EVER.  mmmmm minty ritter sport, i can't wait until marni sends me more from germany.  They also have these things called "Hangover Drops" which i hear from the locals that really work when you encounter a hangover.  I actually bought a box, just in case, lol.  Not that i'll use it often or anything..... :)  Yeah my mom already signed us up for these activities in the historical district.  I'm sure it'll be interesting at some parts but painfully boring in others.  I can't wait until we get to DC, it'll be tight with the Smithsonian and all.    alright i gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S.- good luck to my coppell cowboys at their colorado tourney!
