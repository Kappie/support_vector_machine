Till then all downloads are at a halt. Could you believe that at this VERY moment I could bepreparing to watch the 2nd Inuyasha movie??? or the 152 episode? or i could be watching bomberman. I'm gonna go look for my song, iris to put it on this thingy.        days till school: 27 days till birthday: 42
