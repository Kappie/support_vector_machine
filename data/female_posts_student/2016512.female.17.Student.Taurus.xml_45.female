A LOT OF RAGE. who knew? i didn't even know till i was crying so fricking much.  (i'm kind of spacey so i may jump in blogs) i went to manda's. that made me feel a lot better. it's kinda relaxing just to be out of the house and not for a specific reason or to do your homework at someone elses house. horray for good friends. "tank you britney"   i wasn't the one who stuck a marble up my nose, -Betso
