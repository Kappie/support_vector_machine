I feel your hate whenever i am near  no more "i love yous" in cards  i never was your little princess  you are the reason i hate myself .. and everything a family stands for.   You physically destroyed me when i was small  You emotionally scarred me when i got bigger  I got bigger and started to fight back with grades,  To change things and make you proud of me.   Grades, boyfriends, friends - I was never good enough for you  You found a reason to put me down for everything i did  Now in my final year of high school you say "fuck your grades"  Do something productive and get a fucking job.   When i was younger you gave me nightmares  I dreamt of hereos saving me from the beast that you are  They never came and i tried to kill myself  You blamed me for your medication and problems that i caused.   I dont want to be involved in your problems  I dont even care anymore that you dont give a shit about me  Leave me alone for a year is all i'm asking  And i'll be out of your goddamned hair.   One more push and i'll explode  One more harassment and you'll see  The dark side of me that's begging.  For a chance to break free.
