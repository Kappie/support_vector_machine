Just smothered by the counselors that did). First of all... I am floating on a cloud because of this wonderful news. It seems my life isn't as aimless as I thought... I improved my ACT score by 2 points.. Giving me a 30... My SAT by almost 100.. So now I have a 1380... And I just opened my AP scores. I'm a qualifying College Board AP Scholar...I got a 4 on all three tests.    I SCREAMED... And then my next thought was... I have to tell someone. This is not a bragging thing of course but an... "If I don't share my excitement with someone else it just might kill me" type of thing. And then I realized there is only one person to tell... And then I remembered that they're not around anymore. That they don't seem interested anymore. At least I don't think... B/c I don't know what they think.. B/c they won't tell me... And they're not here. And when something horrible/wonderful/ exciting/ breathtaking/earth shattering happens to you, you want to tell your closest friend in the whole world right? But I can't b/c he's not my friend anymore. He's Kennen's boyfriend... Not Lizzie's best friend. So then instead of jumping up and down I felt like crying. Because the one person in the whole world that held true to "I'll never leave you, I will always be here for you,"isn't here when all I want is someone to smile with.   Tears aside... It has been an interesting week. I'm always nervous about how people will react to my decisions on dating. People close to me, that know my history, are easier to explain to. But the people that say "ha, that'll never work. whatever" are the ones that almost make me want to cave.. Just so I don't set unreachable goals. Then I remember WHY I've made the decision I have and for whom I've made them. Then they stay standing.    So... I think I'll post some pictures now and then go to bed and start my "I've been at camp for two weeks straight I need a week of recuperation before my head falls off" day. That's all Folks. Goodnight. God Bless, I love you (yes... That means you)
