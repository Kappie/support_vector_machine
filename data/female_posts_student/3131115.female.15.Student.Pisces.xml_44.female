(Im not saying Im fat..just fatter)All of my pants are 1's and all the buttons and shit have broken off of them and I dont fit into them anymore. It's not that I want new clothes, I need new clothes. My mom doesnt want to spend all the money that you have to at Hot Topic anymore..so I dont know what the fuck I'm going to do. This fucking sucks. I have no clothes to wear, I have one set of jeans and one set of shorts..That's all..and I'm not exaggerating. *sigh*..Oh well, too bad for me I guess. Whatever..
