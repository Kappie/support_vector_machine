Now, I will be the master when I get pictures or a link to a picture page...See you later.  Oh write a comment, I want to see how that works.  Did anyone see the rainbow today? I was GORGEOUS!  Not only was it a double rainbow (most rainbows are double, one clear and one really faded) you could see BOTH sides at the SAME TIME!  It was great, a lot of my neighors were looking at it when I got home, fun fun, if I figure out the PICTURE thing, I'll post pics.  Well I have a personal computing test tomorrow, blah.  I have VBS in the morning and American History in the afternoon, double blah.  But then I'm going swing dancing with Brian, YAY!.  fun stuff.  Yes, we are together again (June First!) and no things aren't perfect but we're working on it.    I'm going shopping with my little sis on Friday hopefully, it'll be fun unless we get in to a little dispute.  Yeah, our shopping disputes get ugly and now that she has her own phone I can't make her stay with me when she gets mad because I'm such an uncool older sister.  I'm not very cool... not at cool as Stefi.   HARRY POTTER  Did anyone find that disappointing?  The hippograph (spelling?) thing was really cool.  Hermoine was a little player!  Brian thinks she and Harry should end up together at the end, but for now I think she did quite a bit of leaning on both, not that that's criminal or anything.  The two guys behind Stephanie and I were absolutely hilarious.  They made the most random comments and one guy kept snorting everytime he laughed.  No shame, no shame.     MEAN GIRLS  So cute!  I love it!  It's one of those chick flicks you drag some guy to and he survives it.  I liked it personally, but I don't think everyone will.  I think what you find funny depends on your personality, as is the case with a lot of humor   SHREK 2  Funny funny funny!  It reminded me of when Megan, Amelia and I went and sow the first one.  We were still laughing half an hour after the movie.  It's a good sequel targeting movies outside of Disney and stories outside of Fairy Tales.
