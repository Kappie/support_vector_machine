There was an ALCO 'meeting' at the Hastings coffee shop after work, which was fun, because Beth was there and I hardly ever get to see her. So Kari, Beth, AJ, Derek and I all sat around for almost two hours talking about nothing. It was a lot of fun. Kari and I are lobbying to make it a friday or saturday night tradition (even though yesterday was Thursday, but oh well).  Then I came home, got online, and read fanfiction till 1:30 am while eating homemade salsa. Yum! And best of all, I wasn't tired today!!! Maybe I have found the magic number: five hours of sleep is the right amount for me? Four is too little, and anything more than that (if it's less than about ten) is too much? Hmm...makes you wonder.  I just finished watching the TTT EE Cast Commentary. I can't believe I haven't listened to it before now! It's very interesting throughout. Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and of course Dom and Billy were the best though. Sean Astin was a bit annoying, but that's nothing unusual.  Now I really need to go do some reading or writing. Or maybe I'll take a nap. Whatever :)        I AM 20% WHITE TRASH!
