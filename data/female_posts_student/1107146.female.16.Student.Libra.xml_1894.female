But I'm not in that class anymore, so I like to forget everything I learned in there because Mr. Climer needs to go away.  Not that I learned cuss words in French class...oh, wait.  I did, but thats besides the point.  My sister taught my them and I don't like to have anything to do with French anymore cause I never have to take it again in my life.  Maybe.  There's always college.  Yuck.  I don't really want to go to college.  Because after college, there's work.  Lots of it.  And then you die.  Yeh, ok, sure there's retirement in between the work and dying but, not much because to be able to retire comfortably, you have to retire old, like mid-70's/80's.  Which assumes I'll even be alive then.  I'll probably die from like a heart attack or something during the Master Chef competition.  Talk about rambling.
