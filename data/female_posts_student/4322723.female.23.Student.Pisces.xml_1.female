I hadn’t realised that I was like that. It had just happened over the years that I never brought my son a plastic water gun or light up battery operated machine gun. I feel really good. My son has now gone to Pre School and passed on this bit of little mummy wisdom to his friends. " I’m not allowed to play with guns, because they kill people and it’s not fun to pretend to kill people, my Mum said so" Wow. I’m so FREAKING chuffed. It really has made me wonder at the power us parents have to mould our children into the people we want them to be. I want my son to value the earth, understand his and others rights, be tolerant of differences and above all, respect all human life. And today my little guy has learnt that not even pretending to kill is acceptable in our home. Guns in reality are awful things designed to end life and maim. There was no other purpose for the invention of guns and there is no other reason why they are still manufactured and sold around the world. They are made to murder. Just ask my 4-year-old.
