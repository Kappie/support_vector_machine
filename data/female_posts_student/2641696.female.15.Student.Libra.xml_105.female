We don't know exactly what did it, but we figure she ate a decomposing animal or a good number of toads (because toads are poisonous). She's not allowed to eat more than a handful of gastro-intestinal food every two hours, she's not allowed to go outside without someone with her (for fear of her getting into whatever it was again -- she's an 'out-patient,' and isn't fully recovered), and she has to take 3 huge pills every night rolled up in a meatball... it's gross, yes. Her forelegs both have these shaved parts on them, from the IVs they had connected to her... 3 IVs! That's more than I had when I broke my arm!! It was really serious, apparently... *cries* but it's okay now. She's going back to the vet tomorrow for a check-up. She's still pretty dopey and it's easy to see she's not feeling herself, but at least she's walking around again... before we took her to the vet the first time, she refused to move :S   YAY IVY! And good luck everyone in the math exam tomorrow!
