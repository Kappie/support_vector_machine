I'm not sure he's comfortable with the idea of me writing massive papers in one day, and of course, he can't mind his own business. Not that I would mention the fact that he's been unemployed since August of 2002, and only just now has started to apply for jobs. If we're going to compare procrastination, I think he's got me beat. He's such a know-it-all busy-body.  But despite his nagging (or perhaps because of it) I'm trying to get to work. Lame, I know. It'll probably be something about the memory of world war II, probably something involving war movies and novels, and how they change depending on the era they were created in. While I was typing, Jerm called, and I may go ahead with the movie theme, and spend tonight and tomorrow watching movies, and tomorrow night and wednesday writing my paper. I hate to cut class, but I suppose this is the time to do it. I need to think hard about that. Any comments about my impending truancy?
