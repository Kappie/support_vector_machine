I found that Jackie actually left, so I am not sure if she is ever going to post on the website again or what is going on. Abby will start posting as soon as she get's back to Pennsylvania, which will actually be next Wednesday. She didn't want to leave right when Jackie left, because she still had things to talk to me about. So I will say to Jackie, that she completely over reacted, and we could of hung out one last time before she left. But, being the little drama queen that she is, she left with a big fight. Abby says she has been that way her whole life, an I didn't see it until now. Anyway, with the loss of one member, we gain a new one. And another new one might be coming around, Michelle dropped a little hint that a friend of mine, Sarah, was asking to join the website. She is heading off to college soon and she doesn't want to be left in the dark. I am thinking about it, but, there seems to be a lot of women on this website these days.
