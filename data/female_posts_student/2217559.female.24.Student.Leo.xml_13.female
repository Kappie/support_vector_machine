We ate too much though and I had to force Jennifer to take Rollaids. It was funny. I enjoyed spending time with Dannielle and Christina. They are just the sweetest people in the world and they have such an incredible relationship. I just love it! Thanks guys for spending some time with me before leaving.  I haven't seen AJ since Sunday but he calls me today and tells me he broke his toe yesterday morning. Bummer!  He's having xrays but the doctor doesn't think it is broken. Thank goodness- he may still be able to danc ein the Nutcracker this fall. Oh I am going to miss the ballet season this year - :-( Oh well, I maybe I can see some water ballet or something. Hahaha.  Everything is packed and ready to go. I got my apartment leased and someone is moving in this weekend. I am so relieved to get this information.  Otherwise I was going to be paying for an apartment that I didn't live in. Ugh, that would suck!  Sorry it's been so long since I have written. It's been very busy preparing for my leave. I have my new hire checklist meeting on Friday afternoon and I will get my travel arrangements then! I am excited- Saturday is approaching fast.   Tata titi, more soon.  Shelly
