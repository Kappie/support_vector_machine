I've been busy...playing DMC, finishing DMC twice, getting told I should become a forensics expert because of my uncanny interest in death and killing people...etc. My friend got Devil May Cry (second-hand) and the game manual smells like tea. So I got to borrow it, and finished it twice in a single weekend. Yay for Easy Automatic mode! I did try Normal mode...but I missed the rapid-fire you get to use in EA mode.
