Esp my favourite Civic driver GARY!! And the ever puny lil' lan jiao face ex-boyfriend Vinny... *laughs* Bed of Cyn.... Muahahahhahahaha! And Char.... *smoochies and lovies* to ya babe! I would have never made my way back to Melbourne if not for you... Oh yah... and Spencer!! Heh... the driver! Damn it! How could I forget the driver? Then again... with you beside me Char, I tend to lose all track of time and ... people! And Tristan... my favourite psycho! I am thinking of hooking you up with a really good friend of mine.

I'll grow out of it eventually! But anyway...Andrew's lovely ex-girlfriend Hannah wrote him a testimonial about changing his picture cos the one he had on was taken by her ages ago.

Just to make my point, I'm gonna show you a BEFORE AND AFTER PIC ok? No photoshopping, no additives and no airbrushing... just Absolute Andrew. *GASP* Just when I was about to put up that old pic of Andrew, Friendster kindly told me that:
