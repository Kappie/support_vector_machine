My dad came in Thurs for the weekend but he spent the whole day at Ben and Melissas place and part of the day with my mom.  And well  I got part of my homework done but that darn ole' procrastination ya know has to kick in sometime and boy did it even kick in.  And well I tried to finish my math homework but well I am really confused but she never finished the lesson and well luckily we get a work day on monday.  And oh man does this pic ever remind of worried I can be at times about Chem.  LOL.
