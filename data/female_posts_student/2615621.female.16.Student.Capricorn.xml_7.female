I went next door to my neighbors, she's soooo crazy and we hang out a lot now, but anyways, she's 28 and lives with her dad (who has been takin my mom out on dates) and i babysit her 3 year old son. haha yeah, crazy story. Well, anyways, i go over there and she's always drinking or on something (shes also on probation so she cant leave her house after 6pm for another 8 weeks) and when i'm over there she always offers me a sip or something of her drinks, but this time..she had like 3 6 packs of this orange beer called Hootch Hard..lmao and well, i drank my own 6 pack..yeah...hey it was good stuff!! I didnt plan on it, but yeah i got a buzz. I then had 4 shots of something, i dont remember what it was, and 2 puckers, which is this really sour stuff wtih a ZAP POW to it. By 1am my mom and her dad had gotten home and i got my ass outta there after eating toothpaste (so my mom wouldnt smell it) and before she caught on. I went home and then to bed...after peeing WAY 2 MUCH i swear, i've never peed so much. Anyways, this morning i woke up and my eyes were still dialiated to like the max and my throat stung soo bad. I get on and i tell jordan all about my nite and he's so proud of me cuz this is what he does like every weekend, but anyways, he tells me that im way too dehydrated and need to drink a glass of water slowly every 15mins. So i drink one glass of water...and still my throat stings. As of right this second, my throat still doesnt feel the same, but oh well. I remember looking through those drunk goggles at school, but nothing seemed the way they do in those stupid goggles..haha I did throw up, twice actually. I drank 2 bottles in 30seconds going against Roberta in our own little contest and i won..and had to pee like amost instantly. We then talked about doing Whipetts (the whip cream can thing) next time we hang out. haha fun stuff, she knew exactly what to do and i thought it was funny people actually do that kinda stuff. I usually dont run around and drink and do things seriously to "get a buzz" but i gotta admitt, i can see why people do it, it's fun. Ok, so maybe my 28 yr old friend is a bad influence, but oh well! haha I dont think i'll ever drink that much again, until this summer when i go to Hondoras!! haha
