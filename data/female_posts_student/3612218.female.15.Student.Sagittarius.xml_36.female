Im having cold like half the time. Im not joking.. I think Im dying soon. Mwahaha..  To all who hadn't watched   The Village  , PLEASE DO NOT WATCH! IT SUX BIG TIME! It's such a disappointment.  -paused for very long-  Thought of lots of things just now.. I miss you. I hate to see things that I dont want to see. I hate the way you stand beside me while I can't hold your hand. I hate the feeling whereby you are just there but you seem so far away. My head is spinning. Cant u care a little bit more about me?  I need you.  Just tell me you will be there. I'll be contented.. Do u know how much I care? Do you know how many times I wanted to pick up my phone and give u a ring, even just to say hi?  I have done so much. I did my best. I really did. I have done everything but you are not giving me a chance. This is all I'm asking for. Do i deserve this? Do i deserve this? Do I? Why am i always the one with all those shit? My heart aches every single min. I want you, I dont want anyone else. All I want is you. God, am I asking too much? Tell me.. Am I such a lousy person? I guess I'll never be good enough for you. Why is this happening to me? People say, give ur best; your heart and your soul, and success will come to you. I doubt the existence of success.  Guess you have your row of suitors waiting for you. I can never outwit them for the simplest reason that Im not a ... ...  I really don't know what have I done wrong? Will someone please enlighten me.. If this is not love, then tell me what is. Seriously, tell me..  Sometimes I think to myself, Im such a loser.  If one day I die.. Will you ever tell me I was being loved by you?  Why does Love hurt so bad? U hurt me. U broke my heart. U shatttered my dreams. You tore me apart.  As I walk towards you, And you towards me. I want to hug u tight, and things are gonna be so right. If only.. If only..  -God knows what am i typing in this entry? too emotional.. fuck myself. This isn't my nature. Im so not this type.  I wasn't like this, till I met you. Why? -  Give me some time to get over it.  Will i ever?
