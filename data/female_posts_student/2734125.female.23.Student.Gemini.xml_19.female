Warm days in the middle of winter make me glow, feel blood moving, sap running.  I sat out as long as I could, watching the warmth leach out of the day, like feeling the warm space left by a lover cool on the sheets.  I want to wear summer skirts that flow around my legs, and curl my toes into grass, smell bark and run laughing under the moon.  But I suppose winter must be lovely too... I yearn for cold (not nearly so consistently as I ache for warmth) when the sun is cruel and nights too hot to sleep in.  Still, I cant wait for summer nights when sweat still seeps out of pores and runs down my moons.  I'll laugh for joy for being in that sweet hot hot moment... Now I'll just smile at brief memories and be glad for the contrast of freezing.
