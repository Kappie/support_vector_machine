I've got a bad cold. :( And instead of going in and spreading it, I thought I might stay at home. (Aww, aren't I nice) Yup, that would also explaint he weird lack of mood I'm in... you know... where you don't really know what your feeling? Angry and sad are easy emotions to know, they camp out at my house  sometimes. Mmm... I really want an ice cream cone covered in chocolate... anyone offering to get me one?
