Now usually hate is a very strong word and I dont like using it, but when you have to stay up until midnight to wait for your brother to record a skill that you forgot to do, I make acceptions. And now I have to wake up early tomarrow to put on a skirt and look happy that Im in band.  Alright, Im gonna stop complaining now, because of whats happening after the band photo thinger. School is a mere 6 hours long :S and then off to see Grade 10 Girls at Peakes!   Now, those of you that dont know what/who Grade 10 Girls are, they are the most amazing band in all of.. err.. charlottetown! Maybe even PEI. [Actually Im just saying this to suck up and to score a free tshirt, but its really Tyler, Cory, Matt, and some other Cory] But anyway it should be fun. Those of you that arent doing anything tomarrow at 6pm should check it out. Anyway Im going to bed.
