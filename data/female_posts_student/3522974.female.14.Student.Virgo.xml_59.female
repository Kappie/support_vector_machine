You spend time together, feelings grow deeper, and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're in love. Time stops, And it feels like the whole world's made for you two, and you two alone, until the day one of you leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow, mockery of the human condition. hehe, just a random line in Buffy Season 4. (she had just broken up with Oz and Riley wanted help asking Buffy out. I hate Riley, and the stupid whole initiative!)
