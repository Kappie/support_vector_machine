Like when I was trying to ask her something she told me to "Shut the fuck up and go away" even though I hadn't been mean to her or anything, I was just saying we should go dance or something (can't quite remember)...and she thinks Shiva is immature. ¬_¬ Jemy n them had to leave early because Jemy was "tired" but they ended up cruising around Bruns or something. Hmm. Anyway *sigh* I'm going to the movies tonight with Aki and Kerry to see "The Day After Tomorrow"  I'll review it on here afterwards.  The lunch with my grandmother on Sunday was fun, I just hung out with Billy and Oden (my cousins) and Zoe (my other cousin, 26, pregnant.) is SOOO  big now! She is due in mid August, I bet it's gonna be a girl! After it was over I drove home from Bruns, which was fun.
