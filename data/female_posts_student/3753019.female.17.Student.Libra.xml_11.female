RiDEtheL1GHTN1NG: and youre a nigger so you should get the job easy  oh yes. michael speaks the truth on all matters.  i wonder if eddie and aj are still gunna come see me. they'd better! they have a week after aj gets outta summer school before i have to go back to school. thats plenty of time. jessie will kick some ass if they back out. hmph. i love my boys.   i had a friend ask me last night how life was, and without hesitation i responded "life is... slow and complicated." which is exactly how i feel. nothing gets accomplished. things just... fade away. that doesnt seem right. the last feeling of accomplishment that i had was when i straightened the panty table at work. and even then i didnt really feel accomplished. i could just say i did because its such an avoided task. pathetic.life is so empty. i know what im missing. im just so worn out, i dont want to do anything that takes a lot of work and thinking. especially if its spiritual. ughh.  problems problems problems.  "i am flawed, but i am cleaning up so well." - dashboard
