Although I don't think I did exceptionally well (it has never taken me the full exam time to complete a test before this one), I am fairly certain that I at least passed.  In other news, I began to unwind from this horrible week by going to tonight's Bruins and Rangers game.  It was, as usual, a lot of fun!   urlLink Gonchar  scored his first goal as a Bruin, and good old Joe got the other two red lights tonight.  The people watching was at its prime- there are so many entertaining imbeciles there to pass the time (and the nachos aren't terrible, either).  Hockey seems to make me feel better- Vinnie's proposal includes one hockey game a week to relieve stress.  If he finances this method of treatment, I won't be too opposed!  I can begin collecting the souvenir cups- you can never have too many!  Hopefully spring break will make me feel better.  I got approval to stay in my dorm for the week.  I figured the office of residence life and housing might as well approve something, since I didn't get the RA position.  No big deal, I can have more time to myself and less time detracted from my studies and other such ventures.  Spring break has commenced and I am, once again, free!  The man can't hold me down anymore!!!  Okay, gotta go to bed- work tomorrow morning at 8!  Later.  *me*
