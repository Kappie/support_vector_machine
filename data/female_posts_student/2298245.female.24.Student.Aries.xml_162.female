I think some of the reviews I've read missed the point - which isn't surprising, as I'll explain in a second - when they described it as an assault, because that is exactly what it is meant to be.  Never have I felt so confronted by my faith, with my faith - largely as I believe it to be - and I mean this in the best possible way.  It was a profoundly moving and evocative and...well, profound experience for me, and one I will not likely soon be rid of from my conscience.  Many times I have tried to motivate myself to get back in touch - more accurately, more in touch - with my faith, i.e. finding a church, reading the bible more frequently and in depth.  But now I feel like it is something that I will actually do.  I know it sounds silly, but there is something about seeing a visual representation of something that makes it very hard to ignore - the images and sounds will be long planted in my brain.  I have not been able to get it out of my mind.  Luckily, I saw it with friends, or else I might have literally sobbed all the way home.  It was nice to have a buffer, and even now it's hard to talk about.  The experience, while moving, was also very internal, and it feels strange writing this now, as if none of these words are going to be adequate to explain what it was like.    Aside from all of this, it was a very well made film, and I was surprised by the technique and artistry of it all.  It is a spectacularly beautiful film, and I found myself at times - being so familiar with the story and the passages from the Bible - not reading the subtitles just to take in the wonder of the images.  I think the film is worth seeing from this perspective alone.  Yet, if you are not a Christian, I am not sure that you will be able to get anything more out of it.  I think that this is largely why there have been so many problems with the film, because if you are not Christian, you will likely miss all of the things I've described above in the first paragraph and this is because the film, while exploring the pain suffered by Jesus, doesn't really focus on his message.  This, of course, is the entire point of the passion play - they were largely Catholic exercises, made for believers already.  This is no different, though I'd expand "Catholic" to include any Christian sect.  This film is not likely to convert anyone, or even all that likely to move those "Sunday morning" Christians who are not all that serious about their faith.  This is, to me, a film made for Christians - to expose them to what they believe (not in all its particulars, because there are things in the film not directly derived from the Gospels, but just in the general, basic sense) and to confront them with it, and yes, even to assault them, in the hopes of getting them to take it more seriously.  I think every Christian should see this movie.  But I'd be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone else as anything more than a fine piece of filmmaking in the visual sense (as well as the performances, which I feel are all top-notch) and certainly not as a tool to convert people or educate them more about the Christian faith.  For that, you should read the Bible, and perhaps some C.S. Lewis.    As for the anti-Semitism charges that have plagued the film, I saw very little to complain about - but then, maybe I am once again being colored by my faith.  But I think the film makes fairly clear that God was in control and that it was His decision to sacrifice His Son, and to make Him suffer as much as He did.  This is the entire point of Christianity, and I do not think the film glossed over this aspect in any way.  I'm not saying it was perfect in this respect, but I think the anti-Semitism we are seeing now (like people posting signs saying "The Jews killed Jesus" - I saw one today in the 96th Street station for the 6 train) is not as a result of people seeing the film and lashing out, but is because of all the charges people are making about the film, which in turn has inspired all the nut-jobs to come out of the woodwork.    But I am very glad I saw it.  It was something that I very much needed to see, and I do commend Mel Gibson for making this film and making it as well as he did, if not for all his efforts (or lack thereof) in promoting it and in helping to alleviate concerns of certain groups before the film came out.
