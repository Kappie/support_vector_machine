Got to talk to my girl last night. She is such a tease!(By my girl, I am not referring to my daughter). She has been going through a lot, and I am glad she decided to call me and let me know what was happening. Before the phone call ended, we were laughing hysterically because I misheard something she said. I think her man thinks we are insane, lol...if you are reading this hun..ROWWWWRRRR!lol!       Got the apartment we wanted so badly in Burnsville, I am SO happy! This place is freaking awesome, and I know we are going to be VERY happy living there. Got the Uhaul all arranged and everything, so that will not be a problem , and told the manager that we will be up there next week to sign the paperwork on the place, and they are going to prorate the rent since we are not moving in till midmonth. We are also gonna be putting in apps all over the place and trying to find employment before we get moved up there, because it will make things SO much easier on us if we are already employed. Plus I got a card from the school about their program for finding employment through the school's connections, so I have that option as well.       You know, I bet most people don't realize how many different things they become experienced at when they consider taking a job. I have noticed that a lot of people look at their former job titles and that is how they decide what it is they want to apply for. I have a new system: I take each job that was different, and I make a list(yes, lists again) of everything I did at that job. I mean EVERYTHING, no matter how mundane it seemed at the time. Turns out that I am more experienced than I thought I was, lol. Comes in handy when you have to tell an employer what you can do.       Crashed really hard last night, that makes two nights in a row. THERE IS AN END TO INSOMNIA! YAY! Such a relief to be able to sleep. The only problem is that I have the weirdest dreams after I have had a bout with insomnia. I can never fully remember them about five minutes after waking up, though, lol. I just know they are weird, very strange dreams.       Well, I need to go and get some more coffee and finish waking up, and then pack some more stuff up. Goddess, it never ends...
