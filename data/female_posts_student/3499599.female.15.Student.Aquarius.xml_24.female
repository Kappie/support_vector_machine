NOW.      ^_^  I had to go get new batteries for my digital camera today, since I felt like taking pictures then realized it was dead.   Wal-mart on a Sunday?  Biiiig mistake.  Everyone was dressed up in..their..church-clothes finery. it was scary.  I had to constantly take the scenic routes through different departments because I kept seeing people I knew and  did not  want to talk to. o.-; enh.  Ok I'm gonna go take pictures of stupid stuff and call it art.  Song: Meant to Live by Switchfoot have totally fallen in love with this song..neh.
