Her own content world, far outside of reality, obviously, because contention is something she always finds so unattainable and out of reach. But she just goes on living behind a smile and distant eyes that always seem to be looking off somewhere else. Looking admirably at the past and longingly toward the future, impatient with the present.   Maybe this time around things will be different.   Circumstances are very different this time. Giving me hope that I can have the storybook resolution.  Close your eyes, crazies. You look tired.
