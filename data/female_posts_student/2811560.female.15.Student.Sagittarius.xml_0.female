We went to the Cheesecake Factory. The food was really good. I had Godiva chocolate cheesecake for dessert...Oh man, I'll never eat again! Lol, anyways, thats really all that happened today. Tomorrow will be a little more fun because my mom has to go to work, which mean I have partial reign of the house...hopefully my brother will leave. Oh I am so bored its ridiculous. I might have to resort to talking to Chris...oh boy.
