The food there is fantastic! Mmm...lasagna...  I took some photos downtown...so I might put them up later. Stopped into Poor Richard's and bought my summer reading books, The Illiad and Ethan Frome. Should be interesting...  Later I went to rent Big Fish and The Battle of Shaker Heights...I'll have to find some time to watch 'em...looking forward to it. Almost rented The Last Samurai and Down with Love, since I've not seen 'em and people keep telling me I should watch 'em...but I felt like watching the other two.  So later went to the mall with my friend from church, Ciji...we shopped and talked about some really cool stuff. I found stuff I wanted but didn't need :-P So I bought nothing...  Mmm I do need to go back to the bookstore and get some books I've wanted to read for a while...also should try to do a devotion before I go to bed...  I've never realized how random I truly am until now. Or how tired I am.
