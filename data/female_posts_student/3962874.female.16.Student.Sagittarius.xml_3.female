I'm really not to great at sports, especially the ones where you have to handlea ball. I think I am worst at baseball. So when I say that I went to play baseball, what I really mean is that I went to watch. The idiot who is ubsessed with my sister was there, his names Nate. I was going to say something to him about it but I think I am really too nice. And also, I don't think he really meant to be rude to me. Most of the time he is a really nice guy, I don't think I have every seen him actually try to be rude or anything. Anyway, he's not really a baseball guy either, so he went on the swings with me and we just talked. Another guy, Ben hung out with us too. We talked about what guys liked which girls, and who is dating, and how certain people act around other certain people. It was pretty boring so we decided to go sit right next to the field. Smart. Soon after, the ball came flying at me. I'm not the brightest person in the world, so I didn't move, I just ducked and curled up my legs. Amazingly enough, I caught the ball in my leg. Behind my knee. I was facing towards the feild so I really have no idea how it happened but it did. And that wasn't the only time the ball cam flying at me, I also got hit in the knee. Great fun. Oh yeah and I was wearing a skirt sitting in the grass when a red-headed ant crawled under my leg and bit me on the butt. I had no idea it was an ant, I actually thought it was one of those prickle bush things. So I pulled it off, and the ant was really holding on because I actually had to pull it hard. At this time I still had no idea it was an ant, and actually I didn't find out until five minutes later when the stupid thing bit me again. This time I actually saw it and I smached the little thing the smitherines. Oops. Then Nate and I started talking about a guy that my sister dated, that got us talking about my sister and how Nate really likes her. Then he said something about his girlfriend. I had no idea that he had a girlfriend! So I told him that he should tell her how he feels about Amanda and stop leading her on because he doesn't like the girl. To tell you the truth, I don't think he even thought about the fact that he didn't like his girlfriend. He got quiet for a long time and then he told me that I should be a counselor. Because I make him feel like he can talk to me about stuff and that he isn't afraid to admit it to me. Also, he said that me talking badly about drugs and stuff all the time made him want to stop. I think that he is depressed because he doesn't do anything other than go to work. Sometimes he hangs out with freinds, but the people that he considers friends, really would ditch him in a second. They all smoke, and they all do drugs. Nate hangs out with them and he can't help but do it too. To the point, Nate thinks I should be a counselor. Wierd. Oh my gosh. I almost forgot. Daniel hit a grand slam ball! (I didn't even see him hit it. All I saw was the ball go out of sight and him running home. He forgave me.)
