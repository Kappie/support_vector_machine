FS:  Well, hello there!  How are you? me:  wonderful, thank you.  How are you? FS:  getting better.  i just had surgery on my eye.  i had a detached retina. (i already knew that; i was at his church and heard about it the day after it happened) me:  oh, yes.  i heard about that.  i'm glad to hear that you're getting better. FS:  thank you.  (out-of-town boy appears from behind a rack of musical accessories) WHO IS THIS? me:  this is (name).  he's a friend of mine. FS:  (nudges me with his elbow)  Friends?  are you sure about that?  from that point, the conversation went on like that...him trying to squeeze the words "he is my boyfriend"  out of me.  which isn't true...yet.  and then he went on to ask out-of-town boy about where he's from, what he does, etc.    very uncomfortable.  (!)
