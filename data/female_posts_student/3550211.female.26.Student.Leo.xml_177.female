However, the song I wanted to share, is somewhat old, so I thought it would be impossible to find, especially in the limited time that I have. In fact, I thought that there is no way in hell, that I'm going to find the song, Private Eye, on MP3, to link here.   But I did!  Really, you have no idea how excited I am. Heh. Obviously, it doesn't take much to make me happy.  Enjoy,  urlLink Private Eye , by  urlLink Alkaline Trio .       ::PRIVATE EYE::  I dragged this lake looking for corpses Dusted for prints, pried up the floorboards Pieces of planes and black box recorders Don't lie  And I've been preoccupied with these sick, sick senses That sense DNA on barbed wire fences Maybe someday I'll find me a suspect That has no alibi  New Year's Eve was as boring as heaven I watched flies fuck on channel 11 There was no one to kiss, there was nothing to drink Except some old rotten milk someone left in the sink  And there's no ring on the phone anymore  There's no reason to call I passed out on the floor Smoked myself stupid and drank my insides raisin dry    But at the right place at the right time I'll be dead wrong and you'll be just fine And I won't have to quit doing fucked up shit For anyone but me   And at the right place at the right time It will have been worth it to stand in line And you won't have to stop Saying "I love cops" for anyone but me Your private eye
