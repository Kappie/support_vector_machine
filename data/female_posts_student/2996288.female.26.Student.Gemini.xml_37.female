Here's a recap: I love Portland Southern Hospitality is a Myth      and, as a Northerner, I am rude to my friends and nice to strangers  urlLink Powell's Books  is possibly the best place on Earth. Old friends are fabulous I'm going to the Columbia River Gorge and  urlLink Multnomah Falls  today, possibly the most beautiful place on Earth.  I'm sad that the post disappeared.  Norton Antivirus popped up and said something about a "malicious script."  I didn't think my blog was  that  mean...  ;)
