Had a sub in morehead((w00t)), have a 106% in geometry, grew some fantastic bacteria in our agars even if Tyler squished part of it, had the greatest time in 5th hour taking pictures with Bess, had a sub in French, and came home and watched general hospital((majorly exciting stuff going on)), then made up for lost sleep last night with a 10 hour marathon((I actually woke up at 5am and was like "get up get up!" and then I was like, "screw you! Sleep sleep sleep!"  Bess is a foreign exchange student from Hong-Kong and she's fun. She brought her digital camera to school and took pictures with everybody.   So yay yippee ya until I came home and made a smartass comment on nicks blog so he IM'ed me and said "your ego annoys me to no end" so I hung my mouth open for a while and felt really crappy and he said he was only telling the truth and I was majorly upset. But then I asked my grandmother, who always tells the ugly truth, if she thought I had a big ego and she said nope. So I decided nick was waaaay off base and even though he is a great guy I won't be talking to him anymore. I'm not sure if it's because I am angry at him or if I would continue talking to him and thinking "I'm driving him nuts with all my egotistical and sarcastic dribble"  Either way I don't care anymore.  Hanging out with Jean, Jonathan, Sarah, Bess, and all those other people, is definitely the highlight of my school day. Yesterday we couldn't play volleyball because the ROTC kids were using it to drill, so we sat on the bleachers and laughed ourselves silly with... Everything. a man swatted at a moth and it hit the floor and started flopping around, I immediately jumped up and said "oh no he hurt it! I need to put it out of it's misery!" and jean said "you're going to kill it!??!!?!" "it's MISERABLE!!" I said "how would you like it if some giant hand came around and swatted you and left you to flop around in agony? Would you want them to leave you there or stomp on you so you could die quicker?" she started snickering and said "cause of death: fatal swatting to the torso by mysterious giant hand" we laughed and laughed. And by that the time I had turned back to the moth, it had flown away.
