And because I can lol.  Secret option number three is... Random Thoughts of the Idle Mind.  I don't know if that rings a bell w/ neone out there, but it was the title of my young authors thing in 8th grade. I didn't get a prize or anything. Maybe I was too truthful. Hell, my dad even made me censor some things because he didn't believe ppl should know what happens behind the scenes of our family...so much for the censorship now... ................................................................. Dudes...Ginger, my dog, kicks ass. She like follows me everywhere when my mom leaves for work. It's like you can tell her to go away *why would you want her to leave you?!* and she won't. Maybe it's out of stoopudity, but I'd like to think it's because of love.
