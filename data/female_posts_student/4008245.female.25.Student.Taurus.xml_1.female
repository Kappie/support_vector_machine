Thus providing frek design clientele, the most unique and sophisticated design work while not requiring a budget of a mega-sized corporate giant. The main focus of the foundation will be the clientele, Frek design can be utilized in any shape or form by small, medium and large businesses. Frek design will target from existing companies that are looking for design work such as annual reports and also individuals who are looking for small design work such as business cards.  The process begins with self-promotional stickers that display the unique and easily identifiable logo of my self along with a web address. These stickers are to be distributed at networking events and, they will also be placed in frequently visited locations by potential clients: stores bars etc. Frek design is a company that offers graphic design solutions. The products available for sale are logos, layout, corporate identity, annual reports, brochures, and advertising. All of these categories will be tailored specifically for each client. The service provided would become obvious to client at the time they visit my self-promotional site, which contains a portfolio. The ideal would be to establish freelancing jobs and future long-term relations with the clients.    As the CEO of Frek design I recognize the need for small businesses. The Clients experience is improved significantly when they receive great service. Observing large corporations that offer multiple services treat my work carelessly as a student, made me realize how important it is to keep clients happy. The graphic design market is a very competitive one, the assurance of work done well and on time, must be a priority.  The logo of Frek design was created during my senior year at The Art Institute of Washington, the idea for frek design as a company has been growing since the beginning of my career.  The distinctiveness of frek began with the idea of freak, but with a positive approach, creating a new meaning for frek: non-conformist and eccentric design.  The second logo I created is a self-portrait. It is more playful than the typographic oriented frek, I have decided to use the self portrait as an icon along with the frek logo as an accompaniment. Both the logo and the icon have received positive reactions from people, the living dead dolls were a major influence while creating the self-portrait.   One of the alternative procedures, have been to actually distribute my self- promotional package that already exists. It consists on a clear box with a business card, paper clip and work samples in it. I have also decided to create a website because it is essential as part of my self-promotion. The web site will be built in flash. Iâ€™m amply excited about the quarter end project, as I have mentioned before, I plan on actually distributing the stickers and I expect potential clients to visit the site by the end of the quarter,
