Another good day, but I have to say it wasn't as "woo hoo" as yesterday. But I laughed a lot, and it feels good to laugh to the point where you can't stop.(of course you  eventually  stop, so you really can stop...but you know what I mean)  I don't have to go to any of my classes tomorrow!! Woo Hoo yay for me! Go AP chem magic show! It's really dumb, but it's fun. Hopefully we won't screw it up too much for the little children. And we won't burn them to death or anything...we have so many piromaniacs in that class.   well uh, yeah.
