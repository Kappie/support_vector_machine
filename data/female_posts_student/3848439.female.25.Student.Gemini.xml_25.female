Thus the 8-week class will cost me ::drumroll:: a whopping $5.40!  Score!  I'm really looking forward to it.  Heck, I'd look forward to anything that only costs me $5.40 for 8-weeks of fun.  And if you're in the Chicagoland area and looking for a guitar, banjo, djembe, etc. - check out the Old Town Different Strummer Music Store's  urlLink 7th Annual Garage Sale next weekend.   I hear there are some seriously slashed prices there.
