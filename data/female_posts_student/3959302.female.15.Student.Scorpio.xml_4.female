He never promises me so I can never blame what he'll do  I hope the scent of forget me not will make him really uptight tu tul tu tu tul tu tu tu... Under the bed I hid forget me not everywhere he can smell forget me not forget me not  Takenote peepol: I only posted it heh... not for any reason... peace ^_^
