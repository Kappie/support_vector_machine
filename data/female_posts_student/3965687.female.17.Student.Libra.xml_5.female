For about a year now, I've been attempting to write a semi-accurate (how accurate can fiction be, anyway, and especially on such a disputed subject?) novel on vampires. I have been looking for something completely nouveau and interesting, a theory/idea/reality (phrased as such to satisfy all parties) totally unheard of. I have found that (and a little more...add a quick wit and a dash of nihilism) in a man, referred to herein as A*. Thus far he has answered every question that I've asked with honesty and some humor, and I have never heard anything on the subject as interesting and plausible as what he tells me. Everything else I have gotten from every other source has been crap: i.e., the subject knows how to fly, has been in the same body for hundreds of years, subsists on nothing but blood, knows Dracula, has real fangs, is telekenetic, can read thoughts....but when asked for proof or a demonstration on any of the above, gives an answer along the lines of "It isn't allowed/it would drive you insane/this is the wrong time or place," etc, etc, etc. You see why I'm so joyous now...In addition, this A* has an engaging personality, and does not put on airs; he is genuinely intelligent, and it always refreshes me to see another sentient being on earth, human or no.
