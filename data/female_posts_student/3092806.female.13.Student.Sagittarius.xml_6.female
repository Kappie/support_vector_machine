Sure, it's terrible 'cause all I ever do is embarass myself in front of my peers but hey, at least it gives me something to do for six or so hoursa day... I mean, sure, I hate talking to people but that doesn't necessarily mean that I hate to be around them. Well, actually, I hate being around people but, uh, at school I'm able to tolerate it. Besides, school isn't all that bad. Going to school and getting good grades really affects my future... Itdepends what type of college I get into when I'm older, and my college degrees open up my options for what type of job I get, and what type of job Iget couldmake me meet all sorts of different people and one that I might eventually settle down with and start a family with... Okay, I'm going a little over the top with this, aren't I?  Well, believe it or not, I've got to go. Sorry for such the short entry. I wasn't going to write to you at all today but I decided that I just COULDN'T do that.  Austa!
