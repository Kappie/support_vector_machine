I've got a pretty good guitar class! Nathan, Caleb, Timothy, and Joseph. Hmm, Nathan and Caleb are the only half-decent looking guys there. Haha! Zoe would love to be in my guitar class! Oh... Erica just called. Asked about why I wasn't at vball and why Nima wasn't. I don't know why Nima wasn't there... but yeah... Weird. Blah... He knows he's always welcome to vball so yeah... maybe his parents didn't let him go this time. Blah... Anyways... soo hungry. Need to eat dinner~~~! Blah... Gotta run... washing my hair before dinner~ Peace. Je t'aime~ (you know who you are)
