He already owns a Tux, but he wants to spice prom up. His date (Brandy) is cool with it.   Over the weekend I went to the beach with Brandon and Joe A, we got Brandon's retainer. Had fun talking and stuff... I'm trying to stay on this upswing, but im hitting walls here and there. I'm having to deal with the things I've been avoiding, the things that gave me problems in the first place.  Here's another song by that band. It's beautiful in form, soulful in meaning.  Crooked Fingers: Under Sad Stars  Set me on fire white liquor girl Come burning down my throat pristine and pure We have been slaving all day long Among these neon lit half slums Toasting our false hurray The late night favors drinking itself numb  Come out tonight white liquor girl One million stars can't heat such a cold cold world One million distant vacant lights All glaring down on you tonight Lighting a distant vacant sky One million distant vacant lies  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  So turn out the light white liquor girl One shot could set you free from your troubled coil You have been burning bright in vain Here underneath the sad sad rain Painting the town as black as sin Begging to get done wrong again  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  Under sad stars in dingy bars We turn away we tear apart One drop of grace distant and safe They cannot touch you where you are Cold shafts of rain falling dark gray Falling so far they can't be saved They cannot hurt you anymore Here underneath these sad sad stars  Copyright © 2000 Red Pig Publishing
