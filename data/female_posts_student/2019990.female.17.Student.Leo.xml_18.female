I went to Great Spoons today and bought the rest of my prom jewelry.  I'm going for simple, and cheap this year.  Next year I will be going for cheap.  I found a really BIG ring.  It's awesome, so I definitly don't need a bracelet.     I also bought a villa in tuscany this week.  it's really pretty. And it has a gigantic garden, witha wall!! Abner said he's moving in with me, if he can bring Xiang, and Lila and Mahinda claimed rooms too.  It's exciting.  The boat leaves tomorrow.  See you all there.
