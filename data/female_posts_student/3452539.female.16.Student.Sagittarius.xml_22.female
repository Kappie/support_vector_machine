Going to IHOP at midnight is an acceptable dinner.   Usually Denny's, but yes it would be   2. Your neighbor, their best friend, and their mother in law all drive Jetta’s.   One of my best friends does and my brother lol   3. 90 percent of the population between 15 and 19 own a car.  Yeah, that is about right   4. And 80 percent are SUV’s.  Ouch, not really. Honda Civics...    5. You must order DMB tickets 6 months ahead of time even though they’re doing three shows.  Most definitely!   6. The “meadows” doesn’t mean a field-type place.

I live in Windsor Locks, what isn't big compared to that?!   14. It amazes you each and every time you see how small CT looks on a map.  Pretty much, but then I look at Rhode Island and say, "HA HA" in a Nelson-like manner.     15. And then you look at Rhode Island and laugh.  Oops, I should have read ahead...I suppose that further proves that this one is certainly true...that is creepy...I need to move lol   16. The entire goal of summer is to get a tan that will last through November, at least.  Agreed   17. The most exciting thing to do is go to the movies, and you even have to go out of town for that.  Sadly enough, it is out-of-town...    18. UCONN basketball rules and nobody can tell you elsewise.   Damn straight   19. You think bars are only for those 21 and over.

You wonder why everyone calls CT the “rich state.”  Kinda...I am not rich!   27. You complain about the minimum wage being only $6.90 when most states barely break $5 (honest, CT is highest minimum wage in country besides DC).  Actually we are over $7.00 now I think...   28. Timbs are meant for both men and women.  Yeah, they are boots...honestly   29. “word” is an acceptable response.   lol, not from me   30. Your home ec./foods teacher is male.   Nope, ha!
