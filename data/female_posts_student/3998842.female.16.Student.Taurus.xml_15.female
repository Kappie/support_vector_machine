Why can’t you just leave me alone?  Just get out.  You linger longer than asked.  Your presence hangs about me.  A no longer sweet aroma.  Spoiled.  Insipid.  You’re no longer welcome.  Tore me up.  Ripped.  Walked away.  But refuse to leave.  You cannot.  You will not.  Played your games and  lost.  Lost more than I thought  I possessed to lose.  Get away.  Stay away.  You’re filthy.  Hands tainted with  My own blood  reach out to caress me.  I run but you follow.  Why are you still running after me  you’ve asked before.  Still puzzled.  Still chasing.  Scratching and clawing.  Reopening my wounds.  My back, my throat.  Most vulnerable.  Torn like a whipping boy.  But now there’s someone  to lick my wounds for me.  Don’t want me healed?  Then you shouldn’t have left.  Keep your regrets to yourself.  I’ve got my own past to burn.  My own secrets to keep.  My own interests to protect,  to protect me.  So just stay away.  Don’t call.  Don’t write.  Speak every now and then.  Let me know you’re alive.  But don’t tell me how you’re feeling.  Don’t tell me how you’ve been.  Don’t tell me you miss me.  Don’t talk about our past.  If you refuse,  Then don’t talk to me at all.  It’s not that I really hate you.  It’s just that I don’t care.      ~fin~
