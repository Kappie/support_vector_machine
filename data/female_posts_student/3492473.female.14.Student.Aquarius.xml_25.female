Some of my friends want me to go to Lacy's (one of my friends) but I just don't feel good. So when I tell them that they're all like, "Well, Chris is going...you should too..." Okay, I understand my boyfriend will be there but that doesn't change how I feel. And plus, no offense, I don't wanna go to a party where the hostess will be all over every single guy. I think I'm just in a crappy mood.  PMS maybe?  A bowl of  ice cream  might fix it! Last night I went to Chris' and there were a bunch of people there. We were outside and stuff, blah blah blah... Then it starts like storming and for awhile it's only thundering (no rain or lightning) then it starts to drizzle and soon it's pouring. So Chris and I went into the garage and slowly everyone in there left. We just sat there talking and stuff and then we're like, "Everyone's probly out front." Wrong! Everyone went to the park down the street and was like soaking wet! Then Chris was like, "Let's jump on the trampoline!" Remember, this is when it's still storming and not so warm anymore. Yeah so by the end of the night we were soaked! And I had white shorts on so they were  see through  after behind pushed down/pinned to the trampoline by several people!  At least Chris was happy...  It was fun! Well, I don't feel good so I'm gonna go lay down and watch a movie! Muah~
