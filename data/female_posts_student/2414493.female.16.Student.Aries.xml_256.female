Why does it really matter so much? Maybe because if I do well in math, I'm done. All done. But who cares?  Another piano day. I'm going to have to get going. It's cloudy again. I did the wash, I don't know if it's going to dry in this weather. If luck holds up, I'm driving myself to the beach tomorrow morning. Mom filled the 4runner up, so now I don't have to do it. Yay.  Today's piano pieces: (for you have to map them all out, don't you?) John Harbison's On an Unwritten Letter. I was supposed to go through Mr. Francis's Milennium Piano Book and find something and this was it. At least it didn't require strange percussionistic noises from the depths of the piano. I thought it appropriate, I think in letters too. But it's annoying to play. Completely atonal, and I always want to pretend that I have a key signature. I also can't read ledger lines after...10 years? That, and the Beethoven on page 370. I don't know how I'm going to stay sitting down.
