CNN Top Stories:   Five Amish Children Killed in House Fire    FAA: United Airlines Used Tape to Repair Wings    Science: Mice and Men of the Same Genes   Now, is it just me, or is CNN in desperate need for some serious shit to write about?  Well, now we know what goes on in THIS country.  Gosh darn, am I proud to be an American.
