ARGH! ACK! DAMN! anyhoo, after talking to ra-ool on the phone, i basically gave my parents a lecture for 45 minutes. i made some good points like i usually do in those situations. however, i think its gonna take more than talking to them to get the point across to them that i wanta have a stupid life. for crying out loud, i have only one year left to have a  life. after i graduate its hardcore university and after that its working my ass off from 9-5 every day earning a frickin living. they dont get it. oh well. sorry that i couldnt come out ra-ool n all. i wish i could.... my parents said that you guys sould come over so they can "get to know yoU" then maybe after that, we can chill. however, i said that "what would we do at my house??" mehh you guys shoudl come over then we'll rent movies n get pizza or sum crap like that. then after they've known y'all we'll do sum'n more else. anyhoo.... my plans for the rest of this lovely rainy evening are to once im finished on the computer, go upstairs to my room, set up the VCR, get some food and then watch Lord of the rings 1 n 2........ that'll keep me busy for a while =D anywaiz, i think im gonna do that soon... sum fun....... yay. laterz...............
