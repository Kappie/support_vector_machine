I was able to talk to him about anything over the internet..but in person, i felt totally dif. i liked him, i was nervous and didn't know what to sayyyyy...or how to act. So that gave him the impression that i didn't like him..so he moved on. And that was the end of that. he didn't like me like that .. i screwed it up by the way i acted at school... how dumb can i get??    Yeah..what a screw up i am..
