Yup...wahoo.  Fun times, fun times.    I'm glad to hear all the lively conversation on the BLog.  You know, very fasinating.    My mother loves burned popcorn, in fact thats the only type of popcorn she'll eat and she also will only drink caffeine-free diet and ROOM TEMPERATURE coke.  Talk about disgusting.  I, myself, as many of you know, am a hardcore Sprite drinker.  Talk to you guys later!!
