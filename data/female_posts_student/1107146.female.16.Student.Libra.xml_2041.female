It would be a party school with school-sanctioned parties, and everyone would learn stuff because it would just be so damned...novel. Even if they were shit-faced they wouldn't be able to resist the wonder of this really cool stuff they were...well...being forced to see, I guess. It's like regular school with more, less "stuck out like a sore thumb" psychology. I would be a sneaky little monkey about being Freudian.  Hmm...so between this, and the Biltmore, I'd say I'm going to need that recording contract pretty soon. It's going to be tight, but I think I can manage.
