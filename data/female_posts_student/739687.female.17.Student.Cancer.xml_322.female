And I couldn't think of a damn thing.  Because I don't have a damn thing to cry about. And once I realized that, I stopped, and cheered up.  Oh, I have like a week until Europe. It's so exciting. Just gotta make it through this final stretch of school...final stretch of studying and saving the grades I've practically killed.  I know why too.  No more of that. No more ruining my mind.  Well...just not so much.  On another note...still can't wait till summer. I love summer.  It makes me alive.  Especially those days when you can just lay outside, close your eyes, and slow everything down.  Those are my kind of days.  And the days when you feel completely spontaneous, like you can do anything, and you do...those are my kind of days too.  I'm just going to make the best of every world.  Maybe somewhere between now and the end of high school I'll decide where I want to stand. But I doubt it.  Well...I'd say that's pretty much that.  I don't have anything important to say.  And if I do...I don't know if I can find a way to say it.  I'm wearing an A on the inside, and I'm afraid and ashamed to bring it out.  That pretty much sums it up.  Later. crazies.
