Wed I had to go to work at 9 in the morning so I go there at like 6:50 and I put my pajamas back on and fell right back asleep in his arms I woke up looked at him and smiled. Thinking damn I'm about to spend the rest of my life with this man he's so beautiful. I don't know I think he's absolutely drop dead sexy. hehe you thought i was going to say sexy huh? But I think that he's amazing, then again I see him in a different light then most I"m the on that he complains and talks to as well as it should be. But Laying there with him was so fufilling and I get to do it for the rest of my life YAY. Spending this much time with him is absolutely heaven. I haven't really done too much else and thats fine with me. I can't wait to create all the memories with this guy. Hehe it's all good.
