Someone that won't judge me on my past and won't form misconceptions of who I really am. Wow, what to say? I'm at a complete loss for words right now.   I hate the way some people see me. They don't even get to know me before they form a negative opinion on me. If you got to know me, who knows, maybe you would actually like me.
