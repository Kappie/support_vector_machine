"drew and i are by your house." she says. so they come to my house. we go to david's, where the posse is (sean, eli, david, dana, yulia, and dan. i haven't talked to dan since freshman year. it was CRAZY.) and play cards. sooooo much fun. i usually hate cards, but man, when you play pimps and hos with that gang, or do anything with that gang when ren's not there, it's like wicked sick. i love karen, but she's hell around eli.      12:00-get home right on time. posse's gonna call me tomorrow to see if i want to hang out after my rehearsal. lawrence just got back in town, and i haven't seen him since the end of school. and i'm home just in time to watch family guy and futurama. SCORE!!!      12:46-finish this blog so i won't have to take a break for boy meets world. it's sooo soooo soooo close to the finale, man. i can  feel  it. muahahahahaha.
