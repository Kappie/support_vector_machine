Daughter Laurie (Did Conn) wants to leave the weirdness behind and become an actress, but finds that she's particularly good at accountant jokes, and gets a career in vaudeville instead.  Things return to weird, though, when Dad comes to see her show, and is recognized by a dancer as one of her "clients".  Hi Yasmin!  Ching, you're the writer and the talent.  We just lurk in your shadow.  I just seem to have more time on my hands - I'm scheduled to the hilt, but work is real slow.  I'll probably get my Music History essay written today - not due for another week.
