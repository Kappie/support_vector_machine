My parents found out about my relationship with wm, my mum sounds rather calm when she talked to me about this and told me to get my priorities right at this point of time.. (lol... sounds familiar)... haha... i told her not to worry...   Starting to feel that sharing a computer with someone else isn't safe at all. The thought of my parents going through my things makes me feel sad. Even though what they did show that they cared about me... but i really hope that i can still have a little privacy in my life... i feel so insecured... it's like standing nude in front of the sea of audience... haha... maybe i m too sensitive... still, i feel happy that i can have such loving parents who are always there by my side when i thought that i couldn't manage my things well... haha... i m so glad that i have such nice parents... ^__^   enough typing liaoz.... too hungry to type... dayima!!! stop tempting me with food!!!! wm: u shouldn't have invited him to eat cake yesterday...    ~Light without life is a candle in a tomb, life without love is a garden without bloom...~
