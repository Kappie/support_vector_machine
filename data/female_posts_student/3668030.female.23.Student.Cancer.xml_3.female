Although jews accepted this, palestinians did not because they felt as if the land was theirs and giving 57% of it to jews would be equivalent to giving 57% of your house to the dude who stoll your car last week. yeah so anyway The South was because it was a three part movie based on geography (which I though was a really cool way to do it) it went through the south, north and center of Israel and the unrecognized territory of the gaza strip and west bank giving personal interviews to basically anyone they came into contact with that would talk to them. it was very interesting because you got a feel of how israelis and palestinians think. unfortunately i did not get a chance to see the center or the north but apparently its on dvd and im going to buy it. the south of israel is predominately israeli and therefore the movie was predominately of one opinion. being palestinian i understood where they were going with the movie. an important fact is that there was two directors of the movie a palestinian and an israeli. so its almost like a joke really. "a palestinian and a jew decided to take a road trip through israel, the west bank and gaza and take interviews.." anyway in the south they interviewed an eldery israeli man who worked for the israeli water museum. although they didnt discuss politics in the begining they did discuss water in israel. they asked questions hinted at the fact that israelis have all the water they could possibly ever need while palestinians were living in ghettos without water supplies. once any political talk about the oppresion of palestinians came up the elderly man freaked the fuck out no joke like he turned red and screamed it was kind of scary. anyhow even though i havent seen the other movied i know that when they go to the poor palestinian areas they will touch on the fact that they have no water. i might be saying this confusing but i just think its super cool. i cant wait to buy and finish it. unfortunately the movie can be very very boring i wish they could have made it in one movie instead of 3 but i am assuming it is virtually impossible to film the entire country in one movie. part of the movie is landscape because you watch them physically drive while they film outside from inside a car. you never see the interviewers only the interviewed and the landscape of the country through their eyes.  I feel this method of filming the opinions of the poeple of such a controversial area can be the most unbiased. Although there it still can show a biased view based on the questions asked by the interviewers it also shows random people with all different opinions. I also believe that the questions weren't very biased but I do feel the directors have an opinion.  When i buy the movie i hope that everyone will watch it.
