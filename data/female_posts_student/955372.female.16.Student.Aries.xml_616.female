So after about six times of me asking her and she ignoring me i rip her book out of her hands and throw it across the room, then she's all "ALLIE!!!!!! GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!!!!" i'm like "WELL IF YOU WOULD STOP BEING A FUCKING BITCH MAYBE I WOULDN'T BE SO GODDAMN MEAN TO YOU" luckily mother or father were not home, so i didn't get in trouble for that.
