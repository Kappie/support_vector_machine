Or maybe it's just the fact that i'm really horny when i'm drunk and this weekend me n brit drank without any guys around...? anyway it doesn't matter cuz i don't wanna do it again. The best part abotu getting drunk is makign out with guys :) it's even better when u get to do MORE than make out;) if your catching my drift. ahah see how my dirty mind works? thats all i ever think about. anyway. why do ppl get horny when they drink? i've never thought of that b4. But everyone does. unless maybe ur a hermit and well... that woudl suck to be a hermit.    Drinking is fun. i wish i always had some moeny or a drink around with me :P then i coudl be drunk 24/7 :D hell yes. wow, that woudl be awesome. Except 4 the HUGE hang over you woudl have after :p lol hangovers suck. i've only actulyl ahd one really bad one, i was almot pukign in the returant... then again the night b4 i was the most pissed i've ever been. yea, i never wanna get drunk like that again. Even tho i know at some point i will. i can't even drink vodka anymore. i had this little sip of some vodka and sour apple shit and it was jsut rank, then mom let me try her martini and it had vanilla vodka in it and it;s all i could taste outta the whole thing. ick.
