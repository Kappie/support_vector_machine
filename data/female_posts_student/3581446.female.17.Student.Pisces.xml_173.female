     
      Kind of a slow day today; spent most of my time re-working one of my poems ( The Scholar's Love ; I'm thinking about entering it into a Slam and I want a better sound out of it), and I'm embarassed to say I'm just now getting done with my App for Starbuck's...   Was looking at an Arabic book today. The alphabet ('Alifbet') shags nasty, but most of the grammar is interesting.   -Theo
