That was soooo awesome!!!  3-0 win over San Jose.....they made them look like a terrible team.  it was funny, everyone i told today had the same reaction to the Stars' win.  i'd say "Stars won 3-0 last night" and they'd say "Really? Who'd they play?" and i'd say "San Jose" and they'd be all surprised and say "WHAT!?!?!  WE BEAT THEM!?!?!"  It was amusing.  Yes, the Stars actually won and did not lose the win in overtime or just flat out lose.  Niko was rocking the house and so was everyone else!!!  Rob DiMaio had to leave with an ankle sprain in early 2nd period and i dunno if he's going to be back for tomorrow's game.  It was greatness.    Today during lunch, Me and Lauren....well actually it was more like me......were all talking about/staring at this attractive blonde guy a person in line behind us.....it was fun.  he was the same guy that i saw when i accidently walked into my 3rd period class when it was mentor period.  That whole mentor accident was embarassing...but yeah anyways.  I made eye contact a few times with this guy.....but meh, he's short and no offense to short guys but i like tall-ness.  And his hair is wavy blonde and not straight blonde like Niko's....so yeah, kinda turn-off-ish.  Then we discovered that this girl that is the blah girlfriend of this guy that we think is really hot.....lives across from Lauren!!!!!!  So now we made up plans of some how to catch her hot boyfriend on tape, LOL jk! We're probably not really going to do that, but it was really amusing at the time to joke around about.  Oh guess what!!!!!  I may not be going to Lubbock anymore!!!!!!!!!!  YAAAAAAAAY!!!!  Thank you God!!!!  I REALLY did not want to go!  Coppell plays Highland Park tomorrow at 9:30.....bound to be a win because we ALWAYS beat them.  The Brittanys and my friend Emily (from the Platinum Club seats at the Stars game) are all coming!!!!  It'll be tons of fun!!!  if you want to go but don't have anyone to really go with, call me/IM me and you can sit with us!!!  Can i just say that the coverage for the Coppell vs. Duncanville game was TERRIBLE.  Brittany, i know you warned me, but i didn't think it was going to be that bad!!!  And to any Coppell Hockey players that might be reading this, seriously guys, step it up.  Every night, especially against people like Duncanville, it should be 9-0.  I know you guys have it in you, lets go!   Wish you all the best over your 4-day weekend, ~~~Taylor~~~
