I was bitching and whinning throughout the journey because it was getting late and I'm Miss Punctual.  I arrived 20 minutes before 2. There was no one around Salomah theatre. I was skeptical. I asked around - everyone was wondering what the fuck I was talking about.   There was no show there. There was nothing there. It was so fucking empty.   They changed the venue. To Bukit Bintang. I didn't go.  I couldn't go. It was too late.  I had the official flyer. It stated INDIE ROCK FEST :: SALOMAH THEATRE :: 24th JULY 2004 :: RM 15. At 3PM, frustrated, depleted and goddamn smashed, I checked KLUE's website. It was being held in Bukit Bintang instead. Some Soul Star Lounge or some bullshit like that. RM 25.  The only thing same was the goddamn time. 2PM.  So fucking stupid. So so fucking stupid. Stupid Organizers. Stupid Venues.   All hopes lost like that.
