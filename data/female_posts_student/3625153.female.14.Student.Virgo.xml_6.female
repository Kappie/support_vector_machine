That's why I'm making this journal.. for you guys.   ~~>yeah. so enough of the mushy crap and the typing right thing. screw it all. i wanna be myself on this journal. hell yeah. lol.   ~~>ok so this is my first night on the blog. i created a journal on AOL about 8 months ago and wrote in it like 4 times (lol), but im gonna transfer the entries and the comments over here anyways cuz they do mean something to me.   ~~>lets see.. well.. last summer sucked, but at least it was more eventful than this one. even though there was a lot of drama and shit goin on. dont wanna remind myself of it.. but anyway, this summer has been all right. (i finally spelled it right..) i met this really great guy named josh (one of my "peoplez", haha..). oh man. this guy. what can i say about josh. hes just, the best thing thats come into my life in such a very long time. i honestly dont know what i would do without this guy. id prolly be like karate chopping everyone. =Ãž no but really, i can see that he loves me and really truly cares about me, and i really care about him. ::sighs:: we meet in a few weeks. =) im soo happy about that. i need this right now, something to get me going, get my hopes up, something to look forward to. mmm.. i love you joshua.   ~~>now on to ameena. ameena.. you and i have been best friends for so long. i know at times i can be annoying and do things you might not agree with, but i know no matter what youll always be here for me. and i just wanna let you know that ill always be here for you too. =) no matter what. i love ya.   ~~>hmm.. im starting high school soon. im still gonna be at a school without ameena =( but hopefully she can get a transfer for tenth grade. that would be awesome goin to school w/ her again. ah. high school. the joy. actually, im not really worried about it. the only thing im really worried about is possibly having to take showers with the other girls. UGH. im almost crying just thinking about it. i have like this social anxiety thing, and it was hard enough for me just changing in front of the other girls, hard enough just to try to make it through the whole gym period without getting sick. i think it would be much worse having to take all of my clothes off in front of people ive never seen in my whole freakin life before. i could just do what bryan said.. sue for child pornography! hehe. evilness. ^_^  -->lil1punk8guy2 (2:17:25 AM): sue them for child pornography ha  -->ymcm8 (2:17:43 AM): lol  -->ymcm8 (2:17:59 AM): hmm  -->ymcm8 (2:18:04 AM): you just gave me an idea  -->lil1punk8guy2 (2:18:06 AM): sexual harrassment the teacher told me to do it and i wasn't willing to take my clothes off in front of her!  -->ymcm8 (2:18:20 AM): hell yeah  -->ymcm8 (2:18:21 AM): i would  -->ymcm8 (2:18:43 AM): take em to court and get money for "psychological damage"  -->lil1punk8guy2 (2:18:55 AM): exactly  =D   ~~>but anyway. i think im pretty much done for tonight. if i think of something else ill post again later. this entry is pretty damn long already. nighty tighty whities.
