Everytime I go out its like a major fashion statement. Good or Bad..i dunno. Probley bad. Yesterday, i think it was, I went to Walmart with durb and my mom to get Colored Pencils to put through my hair..ya know..like asians do with chopsticks? something like that. it looks real neat. ha. who would have thought. Today I went to Durbs band practice. they  WOW  me. if wow is a verb. They just rock hard. totally original.;-) cant wait till their next show. They did excellant at the Pirate Fest. D u r b went mad with his guitar. hes fun to watch. on or off stage.;-) lets see. So is anyone else taking Clothing and Textiles this year? I'm hoping im gonna get to make stuff. i like rippin up clothes and then putting them back together. wow im gay. okay about my guitar. I'm basically giving up on that. I just want to play drums. I'll probley end up selling my guitar. so if you want to buy it..maybe you can completly talk me into it. i like playing music.But i think i make a better groupie...well not groupie..but fan..Oh, so I'm a vegetarian. I am just so against animal cruelty. I should join PETA. haha...My dad thinks I am turning Liberal on him. But I am not. I Believe you should be able to carry guns. I dont think you should HAVE to wear your seatbelt. Abortions arent right. ANd I belive in the Death Penalty. so there you go. NOT LIBERAL. I hate government. The slaugher house that kills the chicken for KFC beats them.(the chickens). they throw them up against walls and stomp on them. its not right. oh geez. im so sure you wanted to hear about all that. anyways i should really go. i  love  durb. I mean that.-KC
