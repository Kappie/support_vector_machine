AND the phenomenauts. crazy space rock with men dressed in crazy duds who shoot silly string and throw toilet paper at the audience when they play. hella hella good times. there is no way you could not like this show. skankin' good time.  sunday: suburban legends. basically what laura said, seven crazy kids doing crazy flips and dances everywhere while still playing their instruments! wuh-oh. plus, the asian one is hecka cool too. yee-ah. AND moonlife. ok well, moonlife isn't a necessarily good thing, but you go for the humor of it. bad dance music with cheesy lyrics and people dressed in tight silver shiny outfits. and they shake their tushies.   .....yes, laura and i and the gang spend a lot of time at these functions, seriously. hella bomb.
