Well, as you know, I can't really go on any nice trips with you all (sad face)  buuuut... while we have free days on weekends and such, we need to start thinking about the stuff we want to do, cuase I know ideas have been brought up, but we better get thinking about it before everyone is gone!!    So here are some of the ideas people have been talking about doing and some random new ones that may nto be well-liked but im trying to think of everything i can:    -SF Zoo  -Art Museums  -Shopping days (Haight, gilroy outlets, wherever)  -Sonic + neighbooring shops (okay i know you who are going on the trip will prolly do this, but I know for sure Laura and I were going to go back, so if anyone wants to come with us, that'd be even cooler!!)  -That lake on Hicks everyone jumps off of  -A night we dress up all fancy and go out to dinner  -Figure out how to make an actual good-looking un-lame pomp. (as in hair. as in probably a girl thing. maybe not an event, more of an activity)  -Uhhh i have a free ticket to Bonfante Gardens, so if anyone wants to go.. yea  -we can have a sleepover in my SC Condo sometime, too probably maybe yea  -OH and if anyone wants to come to CURIOSA (The Cure, etc, lots of other AWESOME bands... umm Maggie and I are going sooo yea! It will be good times!! check it out!)  -Lazer tagging -AlmadenPark (paddleboating, etc.) -Home movies night! (our old videos, like from camping,"The Pearl", that time Billy flashed Mr. Fernandez, etc.)     UHH i have to go home from work now, but add ideas, yall!!!    (yes i said YALL)  -
