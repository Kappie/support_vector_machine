Would you like to have the time to swim, gaze at the heavens and paint a post-modern gem?  Here's your chance, well... maybe only through the crazy technological box known as Kiki's computer, but it should be amuzing none-the-less... Let me know if you'd like to move into my new Sim house... become part of a demented family, and I will post updates on my blog about your doings regularly.
