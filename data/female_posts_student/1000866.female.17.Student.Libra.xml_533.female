I'm not sure what I'm doing tomorrow but now...I'm DEFINITELY going to take a shower. Bowling alleys always make me feel so gross and smelly. They always smell so much like smoke and beer. Grody.   Oh, there was this really creepy guy at the bowling alley in this..umm...sort of santa costume handing out stuff, and he gave me this elf thing and...yeah, scary. Haha.   I tried calling Chris earlier. He was busy with something. I was supposed to call him back, but then I was invited bowling. I'm not sure he even really cares. I don't know anymore. I just don't know. People tell me one thing, then...I think the complete opposite.
