My aunty used to give me umbongo cartoons cos I loved the advert on the Tv and i can still remember the pictures, but I can't remember the words! Aww. Just been looking at all our family photos from when we were really young and stuff, quite funny cos I was the fattest little child with the most awful hair ever, and i was always covered in food! lol, not much's changed then! Well work today was fun, Tina bought her daughter Kinnou in who is three, and she is sooo sweet! She's got cerebal palsy which means she is quite backward (being brain damaged), she is very very tiny and she can't talk properly, but she is such a happy and cheeky child it is soo funny! She was driving Tina beserk today cos she was tripping up all the customers cos she's so small and doesn't register what's going on around her, and then having sung happy birthday to herself and been told off by a customer for making too much noise (jokinlgy), she ran round and round the shop screaming it at him, following him everywhere, and then stood in the doorway and screamed it a t him as he walked off up the road, then turned around and burst out laughing- she is soo cheeky cos she knows she's been naughty! Anyway, to keep her out of the customers' way I tried to get her to help me dust the shelves, by giving her all the products and getting her to line them up on the floor. This was fine for a while until she decided she wanted to help me take stuff off the shelves too, so I gave her the small stuff to do because she can't managed anything else. She was taking the little liquid ant killer tubes off the shelf, and dropping them down onto the floor, and then she stepped forawrd to try and rech the ones at the back, and trood on the reast of the ant liquid tubes, and they exploded everywhere, covering the floor, my trousers and her ickly feet in sticky ant killer stuff. Yuck. And what does she say? "oopsey" and smiles cheekily at me. Kids eh??!
