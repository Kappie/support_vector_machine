Will you fall for me, I need to know, the way I'd like you to, Baby, will you fall for me, The way I've fallen for you.    Im not like myself, And I'm playing the role of someone else, And my hearts beating so fast, I can't stop it. And Im so unsure, So unfamiliar, Am I wrong to think that something could happen?    Will you fall for me, The way I'd like you to, Will you fall for me, The way I've fallen for you.    Fallen for, fallen for you  For you...
