I suppose so."  i was like holy crap, make up your mind. i just want to go out with him so something will have happened that will be the product of MONTHS of "will they, won't they"...it's terrible, but it's what i'm really thinking, so what? and besides, everyone knows that deep down everyone prefers "they will" instead of "they won't". i should share this piece of information with frankie and see what he thinks.   well, constantly on nate patrol. that boy is gorgeous and fine. add a comment if you agree! (cough, cough, meike, cough) tomorrow i leave for kansas city. i am all packed, and though i haven't left yet, i still have that horrible feeling that i've forgotten something that if vital and terribly important to the outcome of the trip.   i'm listening to a mised CD with songs such as:  edwin mccain: i'll be  relient k: sadie hawkins dance (gag for those of you who know what went down @ sadie hawkins...hehe)  someone: building a mystery  dashboard confessional: screaming infedelities  someone: rain (the song for the integris hospital commercial about the babies or woman with cancer...sheree chamberlin sang it @ BALTO assembly)  someone: California, here we come  someone else: title unknown   sorry to be so specific and sarcastic.   VERY, VERY SAD LYRICS:   It's hard to listen to a hard, hard heart  Beating close to mine.  Pounding up against the stone and steel;  Walls that i won't climb   Sometimes the hurt is so deep, deep, deep  that you think you're gonna drown.  Sometimes all i can do is weep, weep, wepp  with all this rain pouring down.   {chorus}  And it's strange how hard it rains now,  Miles and miles of big, black clouds.  But i'm holding on underneath this shrowd.  Rain.   It's hard to know when to give up the fight,  Some things you want will just never be right,  It's never rained like it has tonight before.  now i don't want to beg you, baby, with something you cannot give,  I'm not looking for the rest of your life, i just want another chance to live.   chorus   and it's strange how hard it rains now,  miles and miles of big black clouds,  but i'm still alive underneath this shrowd.  Rain.
