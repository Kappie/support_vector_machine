All ive had to nibble on was some fancy crackers and applesauce. The medicine just makes me drosy. Well i hope everyone else had a better monday than i did. At least my weekend was fun. Saturday i went to this Afr. Amer. Picnic with my brother and his to male cousins. It was so much fun. They ran around chasin girls while i embarsed them. I still cant believe school is in two weeks. *sighs* Well *yawn* this medicine is kickin in i guess...ima let yall go...holla back at me and dont for get my webpage is now finished.
