And if you talk to me, well it just may depend on the angle that the sun is shining. Freaked out yet? ^_~  The truth is, I do need kitty litter. I have just recently become the proud owner of hermit crabs. Yup, it only took two weeks before I took in some critters to call pets. It must be some new record. We'll just ignore the fact that I went into a home that had two dogs and existing hermit crab.  My best buddy keeps them in a Television Terranium. She was down to one lonely crab and they need to live in a community. So anyhow, I figured that I could buy some buddies for this lonesome crab. Somehow, I too ended up with hermit crabs in a tank of their own. Oh, and why am I buying them? Well, I've never noticed hermit crabs on the beach in Perth. And need I remind you of the nasty weather condition called Winter that is affecting Perth?  They're all set up on my desk and well, they don't do a heck of a lot. They dig, eat, sit in their pool of water, walk, climb and a whole lot of sitting. But on the upside, they're quieter than three cats playing "The Fields of the Serengeti" at 3:00AM in the morning. ^_^  *Sigh* I just wanna cuddle a cat, maybe two or three. ^_^
