Idk when I'll get around to those, I have so many. I take too many. It's like a disease.  Oh, so far the C.S. Lewis book is pretty interesting, for those who care to know. All about the temptation of man, a very good read.  I've decided to take a trip after graduation next year. Dunno where. Any suggestions? Know that's a way off, but still...  I have a lot of stuff to do, a lot of things to think about. I think too much sometimes, which makes it seem like I don't think at all.  Enough for now. See ya.
