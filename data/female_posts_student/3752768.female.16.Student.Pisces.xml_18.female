So anyways... today we went and dropped Ryan off at home and then we went to my house. Becky left and I stayed. That is when Calzones called! I was so happy! Then Ryan was happy for me so he went and got $20 and invited me and my dad and becky to go eat. So he came back to my dads.   We all went to eat at Chili's and then we went back home. Renee invited a whole lot of the youth from to stay the night. So when everyone showed up they wanted Ryan to spend the night. Ryan's mom had told him not to call and ask soo .... I took the phone and Icalled and asked.   Linda got really upset. Lets just say it was bad. I was really upset and I was crying. I finally calmed down and took Ryan home.   Then I came home and fell asleep. It was all better.
