Yesterday was supposed to be the day when the teachers went over the finals with us and tell us what to study but that never happened. Nitro High was closed down yesturday after an hour of it started due to 2/3 of the school not having power and the flood on the second floor. I think it is about time that we do something about it.  Bad news is we still have to take the finals today. I hope I study for everything that will be on the test. I five minute we got to go to mentor groups and file up some more papers before going to 2nd block and taking the final. Hey, that is more study time for me at least. Any way I better get ready for this killer Final and then go find Jenny and compliant about it. Bye ya'll
