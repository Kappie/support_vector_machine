She skipped class and came with me. The park is always such a strange place, the trails are filled with little kids and old people walking their dogs but even step a few feet off the path and you run into stoners smoking right out in the open. Toward the end of our visit Alice and I had moved from the top of the hill we had spent most of our time on, to the other side of the park by the creek. We were sitting under the wood bridge that leads back to the road when some random kids from our school walked down the path. They stopped and stared at us, they were obviously high and we knew them. Alice asked one of them, (incidentally an ex of Steph's) if he had been smoking. Instantly they all started talking, "Nah, but look what you guys are doing! You're skipping school!." He turned to look at me "Like, stay in school, don't take drugs and.... OH MY GOD! I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT COLOR BEFORE!" It was fucking priceless, I just gave him a thumbs up, he winked and they ran off to find other new colors or something.   Speaking of drugs, when I got back to campus I met up with Mia. Through some mutual friend she had found out about how depressed I've been lately. She seemed pretty worried and decided she was going to cheer me up. So we're going to leave during lunch tomorrow and go to her house. We're going to spend some good, quality bonding time together for a few hours, obviously with the help of some weed. Maybe some shrooms or ecstasy if she can get a hold of it by tomorrow. So I'm looking forward to it. All I want is to be happy... I don't even care what it takes anymore, I just want to feel happy again.   On the plus side, I do have something to look forward to. My dad is picking up his newest motorcycle tomorrow afternoon and I get to ride it home! I have to borrow T's helmet though, that oughta be interesting. Or we could just bring him with us. I fucking love that guy. Cheers, here's to hoping its mutual! Suppose I'll see soon enough.
