We ran the whole show (The Pirates of Penzance) which went okay. The show is supposed to be able to be completed in 90 minutes but it takes us over two hours. Not good. Then one of the little kids that I have taken under my wing comes up to me and tells me that her cousin commited suicide and started crying. I felt really bad for her, and I didn't really know what to say to her except to explain to her my situation with my brother.. if you don't know about that, you can ask. She is just so young though so it is really hard for her to comprehend. She is only like 11 or 12. Poor girl. Oh, and I have also come to the conclusion that I hate some people that can't say anything nice about people. You know, the ones that like you when their friends aren't around and when their friends are there they act like you are a piece of shit. You know who you are. You suck. Anyway, I am sitting at my wonderful boyfriend Josh's house. He has to be bored out of his mind. Poor lad, poor lad. So yea, everyone should come and see *The Pirates of Penzance* on aug 4th-7th. I'm not sure how much it costs but any price will make it worth it. There is action, and love, and really cheesy opera singing. All will enjoy. If you want to know more about it, there will be an article in the local magazine *Interlude* and there will also be an article in the Bay City Times. It WILL be awesome.  Well I am going to go, I love you all
