Well I did go shopping yesterday and walked around the store while waiting for mom but I've finally realized that isn't the same as actually working out and moving these joints.  However, I've done a half a mile of walking this morning.  I'm gonna try to do another mile later today.  I know I can do it because I was up to a mile in half last week!  Anyways, I have about 3 weeks till I go to Michigan.  I need to get more active, so I can show those size 0, smart ass, no-it-all cousins of mine to shut the hell up! Okay, I probably won't actually say that but I'll be thinking it.    I need to learn not to be so shy!
