"thank you!"-me, after my mum bought me lunch. "no no, thank  you ."-mum. "for what? the pleasure of my company?"-me. "uh...no."-mum.  then after all that jazz in cambridge, i went on msn and watched tv for like the whole afternoon...then i had dinner avec ma famille. it was sweet, because they're cool.   oh my god.  i hate my brother. k, here's the story. my dad has a friend in australia (in canberra, to be exact), and he works at the business school. my brother, who's going back to high school for one semester in september, got an offer from my dad's friend to go work at the business school in canberra for the second semester next year,
