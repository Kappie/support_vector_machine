I think I'll get the hang of it, I just need some time.   Only one full day left of school...yay! The last day I will have to eat at school, not saying that I won't anymore, because I most likely will, but I'm just saying, now I won't get in trouble for skipping! Yahoo! Not like I have gotten in trouble for it, I'm just sneaky. Sneaky, sneaky, sir.  I picked up my medal today from Awards Ceremony that I couldn't go to.  I'm glad they spelled my name right since they didn't on the sign. I was wondering...  I hope I have all A's this term. I should. This is as follows:  Bus Comp 2: 99% Geometry: 97% Orch/Vocal: ??? Health: 99%  I really hope I have an A in Orch/Vocal. That would just plain suck if I didn't have an A in that class and it ruined my 4.0, and my chance to be a Valedictorian.  Especially since that class is a total Mickey.   Get this...yesterday Dad called Mom, and talked to her for awhile, and guess what he actually told her. "Tell Jordan that she needs to start looking at colleges." WTF!!! Does he think that I'm a complete idiot or something? If he tells me that, I'm going to look him square in the eye and say "Okay Dad, because I'm not on about 10 college mailing lists, I don't subscribe to College and University Magazine, and I haven't taken a Pre-ACT and Pre-SAT tests this year. I so need your guidance on this."  Jeeze Louise.   I'm going to Dad's house this weekend. Alice and Rob are going to be here before they go to Iraq.  I hope they stay safe over there.  Cheesy* and Coca-Cola* are back. I'm glad. Its ridiculous they  suspended them from school for showing the tape of the guy getting his head cut off from Iraqis.  Cheesy gave the choice to watch it or not, and Coca-Cola hadn't planned to show it to the class anyway. It's a total ludicrous. If you didn't feel you were "emotionally or psychologically" ready to watch it, don't watch. Step out of the room. You were given the choice.  Stupid, stupid. I'm glad they're back though. I signed a petition to get them back.  Well, I'm done with my complaining for the day.
