Although time goes in one direction, it is truly elastic, expanding to too much when it is not needed (say in a dentist's chair, or worse, in a meeting), and contracting to too little when you really want it (when was that report due?).  Time for me is a rubberband, and occasionaly it ricochets out of control off the floor, the ceiling, and the nearest human body (the cats have the common sense to get out of the way).  To sum up in a hopefully painless way, work has kept me busy, my mother has kept me busy, and my cats have made it clear that the bed I sleep in is actually theirs, and that I'm just borrowing space they'd rather not give up.  Working at the YMCA has been enjoyable, interesting, and far from boring. Between phones, the computer, and checking in members while handing out towels, I'm learning to multi-task like a five-ring circus with the occasional rampant lion or elephant. You see, if there's one thing I've learned is that people on the whole, or at least those at the Y, are genrally good, patient, and if they've got a problem or a complaint then they say so in a civil manner and that's that. Then there's the occasional lion-elephant, and even then those creatures are more docile than thesetwo members whose tempers exploded this past week.  Let me start by saying that at the front desk of the YMCA, the people who work there are pretty much the communication center of the building, but they are not the ones who make the decisions in regards to how the building and programs are run. That is for the administration to do, simple as that. So when there's a problem with the placement of the equipment in the fitness center, or some machine isn't working right, then we pass the information on to the appropriate person and they address those particular issues. Almost all the members at the Y seem to understand this, except for a couple, who if they do understand it, completly ignore it and rant like ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing a temper-tantrum because they can't get what they want.  Interestingly enough, those ill-mannered three-year-olds throwing temper tantrums of late have beengrown adult men, of which only one I have faced, and thankfully someone else was there to intercept him.  Look, it is one thing to air ones grievences, to say that there's a problem and give suggestions as to how you'd like it fixed, especially asking if there is a particular person you need to talk to about it.It is another thing to rant, rave, and attack people who aren't even there, let alone a whole body of people. It's even worse when it's done to people who have no control over the situation let alone any say.  Just last Wednesday (and I was thankfully not there for this) a man came in at 6 p.m. wanting a basketball. One of the ladies behind the service counter informed him that the gym was currently in use by the Wednesday Basketball League, and that the entire court was being used until 10 p.m. that night. And so she warned him as she went to get him a basketballthat he might not get a chance to play. Oh, the man threw a fit spouting that he was a doctor and a member and that he knew the head of the company whose name graced our building(which, although it's the name of our building, it only means that they sponsored the building of it), and that he wanted a basketball, that we weren't giving him one, and he kept repeating that he was a doctor and a memeber like it would get him special treatment or that he was far more intelligent than the people behind the desk. After about twenty minutes of this tirade, he went on down to the gym, and as one of the managers (and administrator) put it shot off a couple of "granny-shots" for a few minutes until the league nudge him off. And it didn't stop there, he called up to the desk from the lockerroom demanding to speak to the manager, as that the manager, a woman, had answered, she said that she was indeed the manager. No, he said, he wanted to speak to the manager, he wanted to speak to the man. The only man on duty that night, a really laid-back guy by the name of "Tom," was handed the phone, the poor guy, and heard a whole rant on how the doctor had been fond of basketball and playing basketball since he was a small child, and how just holding the basketball would allow him to learn things and that the women up at the front desk were loathe to give him a basketball. As the doctor left, he grabbed a piece of paper, wrote down everyone's name including the manager (whose first name he kept mispronouncing), and even asked Tom's name, who looked at the guy and asked "What did I do?" since he had not been in the middle of all of this. Then the doctor stormed out.  Well, Dr. Pang has no doubt already received his letter from the head of Membership Services saying that although we are there to serve his needs and help him, we are not there to take that kind of behaviour, and that such abuse is unacceptable. Oh, yes, and there were witnesses to his tirade to say the least. One fellow was sitting at a table in the lobby just shaking with quiet laughter, while a newly married couple asked the doctor's name (after he had gone down to the locker rooms) so that they knew who they absolutely didn't want as their physician in any aspect.  Yesterday, and I thank heavens for having the co-workers I have, a fellow came in at 9 a.m. asking why there couldn't be any pool lanes open at that hour (there are swim lessons and water aerobics at that hour attended by our senior citizens and our youngest members with their parents), and he went on ranting about how he spent so much money for a family membership and that his son couldn't go down to play basketball during the day because the day-camp took over the gym until 6 p.m. To leave it at that would have been one thing, but then he added something rather intolerable. He went on to rant, "What is theYMCA doing, trying to squeeze out every last dollar possible? They're turning this building into a nursery. Meanwhile, his son was out playing basketball in the 100 degree heat." At that point he wasn't there to rant or complain, he was there saying "Me! Me! Me! I want! I want! I want!" andhe was getting absolutely no sympathy or understanding from me. Frankly, I was about ready to tell him that if he felt that the membership was not suiting his needs that he could cancel his membership, and if he had bought the full year package we would gladly refund the balance.  As I said before, thankfully my more experienced co-worker was there as that she partially placated the man, as if he could be placated, as he walked through the doors into the main part of the facility (where he was going, I don't know, as that he felt he couldn't swim). We were going to have him speak to the manager on duty, but I don't know if this ever happened as that we were supposed to snag him on the way out. Hopefully my co-worker saw him leave and got him as that I didn't.  Other than that, I really enjoy seeing members come in. The children of all ages are an absolute hoot, lots of energy and lots of fun. Our senior citizens, whom I enjoy calling "silver foxes" are people I greatly admire. They have so much energy, so much spunk, even our 90-somethings! A few of them look so frail, but they are up and moving, and getting out to socialize and all that, things that my grandfather didn't do.  A side note here as I write, if I seem to be meandering off it's only because I'm being talked at by my significant other who has a gift of rambling like a brooke in flood. I love him, but he doesn't quite understand that I can't hold a discussion very well while I'm trying to write (which gets rather infuriating if I'm trying to do another entry for the story/novel/series/tome I'm co-writing).  Right, so, my mother's now moved into her new (to her) home out in the "country," nearly half-way between St. Louis and Hannibal (or at least somewhere on the way). I spent days earlier this month packing, and got off work early to help out with the movers to take stuff from the house and put it into one of the four storage lockers she had rented; she had to move out by the 12th, but the new house wasn't ready until the 20th. And again, I helped her, the eight movers with the four vans, move from the four lockers to her new home on the 21st.  I've got to say this, I'm already nestling comfortably into the thought that the new house in Moscow Mills is now the family home, and some place I can live should the need arise.   Now I've just finished being told the events for the entire last episode of  Stargate: Atlantis , although I never asked for the information.  Anyhow, back to my mother's new home. It's a 10 acre plot of land with a two-storey house with a finished basement making it a total of five bedrooms, three baths, an office area, a large kitchen, dining room, living room/sunroom, family room, and a storage room. There's an above-ground pool in the backyard, a playhouse for the kids, and two small storage sheds. There's also sotrage space in the attic which is sorely needed considering all of the stuff moved. Note: this is a combination of my things, my mother's things, and things inherited/received after my grandparents' deaths. The neighbor on the left has two horses, the neighbor through the woods on the right breeds and raises dogs, and my mother's going to raise alpaca's and use their wool.  Oh, yes, and there's a small cemetary at the back of the property. Unfortunately, the grove that its in has become overgrown, and I can only see one pillar-type burial marker, but only from a distance at which I can't read it. Although some folks would possibly get creeped-out by this, for me (and my mother too, I think) and my sister it's a sign that this is a good land, and that we're blessed to have the privilage to care for the burial ground. Yes, while some would think of ghosts as being bad things, we consider it good. And a small cemetary means that whomever was buried there had lived there, and that they were so well loved that they were buried close to home. That's the important word "home."   Speaking of which, I need to get myself together and head out that way with Lloyd. Although my mother's sleeping at the moment (she works night shift as a nurse at a local hospital), I had told her that I'd be coming out this weekend to mow the property because it needs it badly! That and I'm kind of hoping that I can get a picture of the cemetary, andstart making plans on how to clear it out enough undergrowth to tend to it properly, and keep the wildflowers!  I know it sounds strange, but when my mother told me about the cemetary, I went straight out to see it (of course! I am the curious one after all). She said it was fenced in, but I found that the fence was only on one side, and that there was a cut pathway around the back (someone had mowed a path for the surveyors a couple of weeks ago). Aside from seeing the single-pillar stone (kind of like an obelisk), I saw a number of wildflowers and a huge black and gold butterfly. It also struck me as to how sweet the air smelled. It was absolutely delightful.  Now, if only I can keep journalling daily. I shall endevour to make it my goal to do so.
