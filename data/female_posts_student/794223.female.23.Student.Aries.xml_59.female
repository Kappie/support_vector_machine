Also, she can look at an object-- like a pair of scissors--and know what they are, but not be able to say the word "scissors".  You know that feeling you'll have occasionally when you just know you know something, and it's on the tip of your tongue?  Well, that's the sensation she has, except all the time.  Her neurosurgeon has assured her that with several months of speech and reading therapy, she'll be able to return to teaching in the fall.  Which is fantastic news.  So she'll probably be going in to MD Anderson 2 times a week for that, and about 2 months from now they are going to evaluate whether or not she should have radiation therapy to remove the remaining 10% of the tumor.  As soon as Aunt Rite goes back to work, I plan on going down to East Bernard and staying with her the first week or so, just so she won't be so frustrated and alone.  We're still all in a state of shock, but we thank God every day for the miracle that He's given us.  It is obvious that He wants her here on earth for a greater purpose.  Trials like these make you realize how ephemeral and fleeting life truly is.
