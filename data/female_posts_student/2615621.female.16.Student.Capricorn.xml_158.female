Dannys cousin just got on and i was like "omg omg omg do i talk to her?! omg omg omg what do i say?! omg..what if i say the wrong thing?!" so i told myself to shut up and said "hey" to her she instantly knew my name and heard all about me..whew...and we're now talking. All she tells me about is danny this danny that...dream come true right? no i dont want her to feel like im being buddy buddy with her cuz of danny. WELL, i did find out dannys birthday, may 30th, the day after i left for tenn. haha brianna told me that one. wow..for meeting this chick just now im pretty comfy talking to her..hmm thats good. she'll tell danny im awesome LMAO. She surfs..wow how kickass is that? and she wants to learn how to play the drums. Now we're talking about music..yay...i did something bad, when she asked me my fave bands i picked out the bands i do really like, but that were also dannys faves LMAO is that bad?! WELL...she asked me if i was doing anything this friday nite and i told her i was outta town and when i was coming back. lol Apparently, she wants me and danny to hook up too..dammit, im one of the most self concious people in this WORLD. like, its a never ending battle. and to think they are hyping danny up to meet me and all this pressure is on me to meet him, and YES! i really wanna meet him..but bailey is always like "omg hes soo hot, like he walks by and im like :o " well..REALLY hoy guys date REALLY hot girls like im sure ive said before, but im not REALLY hot..or even the slightest bit hot..so why would i wanna meet danny when i know we're not gonna be anything? its like getting ur hopes up. If you dont expect the world, then you'll never be crushed. Okay, i just turned a blog from everyone being able to see what a hopeless romantic dork i am, into a depressing pitty party...  *much love and parties*
