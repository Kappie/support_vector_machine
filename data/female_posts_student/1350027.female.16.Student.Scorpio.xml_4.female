There is no objective answer to how we are like or how we're meant to be or how we really are. Everything's so colorful that, I have a great feeling that the study of psychology, which has tried so hard to get us under an objective description, have secretly given up and labelled all of us under the file, "IMPOSSIBLE".  But yet, like I've started before - we're so easy to understand. So easily unravelled. So obvious. Plain black and white.   I've thought alot of all the people I have met.  And whether I like to admit it or not - everyone of them has mould me into who I am today. My thinkings, my emotions, my ways and my antics. Everything about me is actually little pieces of everybody stuck together. And it's as simple as that.  I've met amazing people.  People who have given me such a huge mark on my heart I doubt I'll ever forget or stop thinking about what they have said or done when something sparks up a memory. I've met people who are like passing wind. Just a temporary satiety. Something so short and yet dropped with happiness. But yet, it was temporary. These people are forgotten. I've met people who are just in a world of their own. May it be people drenched in pure immaturity, pure jealousy, pure immaturity or pure weakness, they're usually the ones which have a huge impact on my thoughts. And I feel sorry for people who are stuck in their cruel worlds. I'm hoping one day they'll step out the box and realize that there's more to everything they wish and dream off. Shallowness does not lead you to anything but down.  But I don't know. People are who they want and wish to be. At the end of the day, it is you who takes those pieces and fix it and make yourself, sprinkled with a little bit of individuality. It really depends how well you sort of the pieces and sprinkle yourself. Some people cover everything perfectly. Others run out of sprinkle-me dust and just end up with patches. Others don't have nice color pieces and end up with old, broken and rugged ones whilst others get everything beautiful but yet lose their sprinkle-me dust.  It's really these little things that make us..well, US. And I wish people took it seriously. I've noticed people have been back-slidding.  I've always thought that as I age, I'd meet more reasonable people. But, it's been the same. I guess it was always a fake picture, thinking that the color sun glass would take a diffent light be in a different set of shade of colors. Things never do change. People, regardless of their ages, still are the people they once worked themselves up to be when they were 12. And it's a sad story, it really is.  You have people who like to make other people feel good. You have people who give their support in everything you do. You have people who are cynics. You have people whose only aim in life is to make everyone better than them feel like shit so they'd be king of the world. You have people whose only priority is ME, MYSELF and I. And you have people who are swimming in the sea of oblivion.  Which one do we plan to be?
