You know what I'm talking about? Ya I was really mad. Well today, I came home for the first time in about 3 days and I asked my mom if I got any mail, so she said "Ya, but its not fan mail" I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about. I wasn't expecting the ticket to come for at least a month! She gave me my ticket things when my friend was hear, and we opened up my envelope thing and it had all the pic. It took. Very bad pic. may I add. I was so mad. And to top it all of the ticket is really expensive. Its 400 bucks! Can you believe that? $400!!!!!!!!!! The light wasn't even legal red. It was pink! Pink I tell ya. That's so not fare. I'm a careful driver. I've seen so many people on the road that shouldn't be on there. Don't you see those people driving around? I see them all the time. I think That damn camera should take a few pic. of them driven'. Better yet, I'll just take some pic. and send then in. If anybodies gotten a ticket like this, then you know what I mean. I'm the only one of my friends that has gotten a ticket. But I've also been driving a lot longer then my friends. People these days. I think they should spend more time doing other things, then just thinking of some contraption to get people in trouble for running a pink light. There were no Johnny Law's there at the time. So if the police didn't see them, then it doesn't count, right? That's my opinion! I'm just a bitter teen! So, I'll talk to you guys later. I got to go to work in 6 or 7 hours, and I'm tired. So, ill talk to you. Bye.
