We're getting a pool table!!! HA! SO stoked! Supposedly its for my dad, fathers day...mmhhmm...no one else may care- but when ya can't get a-hold of me- that's where I'll be!!! so summer school- I despise my teacher. DE-SPIZE!! shrunken 300 LB man rubbing his nipples in front of us telling us to go out and have multiple boyfriends, but don't love any of them, do what you like, just don't get caught, and go out party hard while we're young ( as safely as possible, of course). Sure, I can't even get a boyfriend, have no one to go out late with anyway, and just forget about the vandalism. And the class is painful. "oh hey!- did you pass!?" "up- no- not this time!" "Ah- too bad, I got a 78!"   and could you please learn how to READ!!!!!  susceptible! irrevocable! psychiatrist! not hard people!!! I've been reduced to superficial antics and characteristic 'antisocial tendancies'. Its been proved- i have low self-esteem.  "Sound the alarms! Get out of bed!"...who'da thunk. i have a headache- and i doubt i can go out tomorrow night and drink more caffine...i feel sick as it is. i have a headache- and everytime i get in a car, i get horribly car sick. haven't finished drivers ed. I'm actually longing to get out of here and go to Massachusettes. scary thing. sigh. well, when god shuts a door, he opens a window for us to jump out of
