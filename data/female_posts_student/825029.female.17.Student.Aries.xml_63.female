Carter is officially the only other child in my family since my moms generation.  thank god. so, im still considering changing my name when i turn 18.  i know u prob think thats stupid cause its  my name  but its a name from my asshole father's family, and i dont really want to be a part of that...  hm not sure.  so give me your input i guess... not that it will make much difference hehe.  lets see.... so we leave tuesday morning, drive 5 hours or so and thanksgiving yay!!! i CAN NOT WAIT ONCE AGAIN FOR THE FOOD OMG.  and then i get back friday liiiike 2ish im guessing.  oh also helpin out at the bh on monday so thats fun!  i guess!  hope i make region band!!  and then go to state!  after three damn years...!  dododo yeps.1!  this week has been pretty ok.  school blows but actually the work load is slight.  i desperately need to finish applications.  holy crap.  then we had the game..... sucked.  but we dont have any others so i guess thats good...  and now the break.  man, im really sweating christmas presents as always because i suck at getting gifts.  i can never shop for myself let alone someone else.  i can never find something thats good enough cause i always find something wrong with it or something... so then shopping for someone else is 238 times worse since im that much more worried about what they will think... **sigh**  yep so i guess im done with this update, not much else to write.  hm i need to figure out how to center things in the blogger template and what numbers different colors are so i can make this template not suck, and make my blog not look like crap because there are only like 7 different ones to choose from now....  so if u know lemme know.  yeah.  ok SWHWIOEAP(FU$(PUWJIASF:LDSVM::SDVMP$AS(TJUAKSDFJ!!!!!!  well good luck being alive! hope it goes well for you.  YEAH! thu end.
