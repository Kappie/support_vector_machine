Actually, they somehow missed a digit in the phone number and my cell phone didn't ring (I have no idea what that's about). The first question: So. Let's just get to it. Why aren't you still working with the last organization you worked with? A: Well, my contract ended.  HR: Oh, let's be real here (he really said this). You know what I mean. Why aren't you still working with them? Weren't there other opportunities? Did something happen?  Me: There weren't any opportunities that would utilize my experience in monitoring, evaluation and research, actually. I am only looking for some short-term opportunities before I start my work on my doctorate.  HR: Oh, okay. Fair enough.  Anyway, after a few leading - and rushed - questions by the HR person ("so I know I asked you this already, but I want to know what your *sector* is. In other words, I'm asking if you would consider yourself a generalist or someone with a single sector of experience...") You know what the answer is.  He was in such a rush to get off the phone -- our interview started about 45 minutes late -- that I had to ask him, "Hey hold up, Tex. Is this still supposed to be a two-month assignment with the same terms of reference or what? 'Cause I do have to start school in September (as I noted in my cover letter, which I am not convinced that he read...)"  "Funny that you should mention that. That WHOOOLE thing has changed. Now, there is going to be this senior level person writing the reports at HQ and then some junior folks who'll be out in the field collecting the data that the senior person needs. Is that something you'd be interested in? Collecting some data for someone else who sits in an air-conditioned office in Big City, USA?" Yes, HR Director, I'll do anything... Sadly, I will, because I want to work somewhere different and do something different and possibly make a small difference, while getting paid the piddling UN rate.  Obviously I am embellishing a bit, but you know what I'm talkin' 'bout.    So - pop culture critic time. Drums puh-leeze. Today's topic: OPRAH .    Though I find myself sucked into the  urlLink Oprah  charisma from time to time (alas, I'm a sucker for that aw, shucks Clinton charm too), I do bristle at the show's topics, especially when I am not in the US. I've probably watched more Oprah in Africa than I have in America, really (and you, digital satellite television, I love you most of all). In these settings, I wonder about her relevance - American women on her shows will battle with their issues of control and power in ways that seem unimaginable in say,  urlLink rural Sierra Leone . For instance, women cope with life and lack of control by binge eating, sexual addiction, binge shopping, and being overly controlling in their homes... I am not sure what the equivalent is in the typical (i.e. not wealthy) household in the "developing world", if there is any at all.  Interestingly, a dear friend from Hausaland -  urlLink Kano, Nigeria  - approached me once with his theories about African American women. His research had been based upon cultural analysis of the  urlLink Cosby Show  and Oprah - he said, "Here, we think black women are the heads of households in America. Look at  urlLink Claire Huxtable . And Oprah... she lives with Steadman and he is the house-husband. Now those are some empowered black women. What was your household like?" This friend is a gender specialist, so I just said to him, "Yeah, that's how we run thangs in the US of A. Rock on." Ladies, gentleman, we know that these are idealized gender roles, the ones that are represented on television, but they are interesting representations, no? They do, however, make us look like the bizarro world that we are not.  My friend atlblingbling would be pleased to hear that today's Oprah featured  urlLink George Michael , who is, undoubtedly [giggle] making his comeback. After putting his hand in the air (and waving it as if he truly did not care) he yelled, "Go on, get nostalgic." Same rhythm as "go oprah, it's your birthday..." And he rocked "Father Figure". Yes, girls, he rocked it, with requisite Rubenesque black lady back-up singers. Atlblingbling performed this song at a karaoke bar in a quaint coastal town a few weeks ago. She gave an excellent and inspired performance. I wanted so badly to be her not-so-rubenesque back-up singer. Maybe next time.  So, Thursday's episode will feature Oprah doing some bargain shopping ("And on the next Oprah, my first trip to urlLink  Costcoooooooo ..."). Isaac Mizrahi will be performing ambush makeovers at  urlLink Target  (how else will Mizrahi make HIS comeback?) Some amusing visual images that I'll probably miss - Oprah wearing sunglasses (as if we can't tell that it's her?) and piling up on the 80-pack toilet paper. Mizrahi scaring some woman shitless as he crashes into her Target dressing room with a striped turtleneck. And, the best of all: Oprah being forced to undergo check verification - because  we know  the filthy rich *never* carry cash...
