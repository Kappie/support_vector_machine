Dont you find it uncomfortable when you are somewhere with your long time ago ex but now is just your friend and then your more recent ex shows up with his new girlfriend but your two exs are friends so they are all hangin out?? uh i got myself in that position and it was fuckin uncomfortble... the "girlfriend" really doesnt like me because her boyfriend well has a histiry with me... and the funny part is... they use to date and then i took him away from her and then after awhile i broke it up with him and now hes back to her.. shes afraid i might take him away again.. but why the Fuck would i do that.... it isnt worth the drama... haha.. single life is great anyways... im just lookin for a guy that will commit and knowing that ill be goin to college in a year.. no point in committing when distance will tear you apart... some can get through it but i dont think i can.. i mean a little distance is ok.. an hour or two hour drive.. thats ok.. but a plane ride.. thats way to much!!! well i have nothing more to point out ot talk about! inspiration will hit me maybe tonight and ill come write!
