"im going to go feed the homeless"-alright. go, feed the homeless. thats good. but why are you feeding the homeless? isnt it ultimately because you enjoy helping other people? because it makes you happy? and would you still help them if you didnt get any satisfaction out of it? and what if you, like me, look to love as an answer to that question-what am i living for? love is a respectable answer. "all you need is love..." but, in the end, why do we want love? because it makes us feel good! and when i was thinking about all this it kinda bothered me...because it made me think about humans as so selfish...that no matter how hard you want to do things for other people and be a good person-youre still really only doing everything for yourself. but then...i dunno...thats crazy. for one thing, God wants people to be happy, right? theres nothing wrong with being happy at all! do what makes you happy. but...you know...do that while still abiding by your principles and what not. though the subjectivity of morals is another discussion topic entirely. (perhaps i should start my own disucssion forum. who would disucss though? i would. pang? maybe? olivia? maybe? i wonder if people would...hmmm...) i dunno... i basically decided that it wasnt wrong to want to be happy, to be truly, comfortably happy. and that kind of happiness, im positive, only comes from leading a good life...thats the love kind of happiness and the helping others kind of happiness. much more real than the drug happiness and the sex happiness. but anyway, i still digress...i was thinking about that, right? but then i still disagre that the meaning of life is just to do what makes you happy...at least not in the way most people mean it. because you need more in life than just happy feelings. you need real happiness...which is not just happy feelings...but feeling that your life has meaning and that you matter and that youve made a difference..a.nd..i dunno, its hard to describe what i mean, but theres more to life than just feeling happy. even though, by my deffinition real, true happiness is an okay thing to live for, because, even though its contradictory, real, true happiness isnt soley happiness...its happiness and other things. sort of.  but...well...anyway. to those who say that the meaning of life is to do what makes you happy, i have a question for you: If you could plug yourself into a machine that would make yourself happy, would you? (if it hypothetically existed?) Would you be satisfied, at the end of your life, knowing you had lived entirely for this feeling? would you feel your life was worthwile? would you, ultimately, be happy? would that make life everything you wanted?
