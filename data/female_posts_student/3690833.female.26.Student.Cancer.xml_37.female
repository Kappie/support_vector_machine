PLEASE find a service that actually provided the service it offers.  (Pretty reasonable right?)  and they reply:  Hi there,(hi there???? not even personalized!)  Unfortunately, we do not provide support for Hello. Please visit http://blahblahblah.plp for further assistance with this  matter.  Sincerely,            etc etc  So to which i replied:    no  shit ? so then offer me another option. (please note that i had already mention i had contacted hello support..)  i go through this computer generated crap all day, everyday lately. i need a computer to make sure my bank isnt screwing me, seriously. my bank withdrew 60 bucks of "courtesy fees" last week. no i didnt overdraft, i called, indignant like, it seems their mainframe had a slight "glitch" creepy. i wonder how often this happened  before  the internet... then i went to my employer's bank to cash my paycheck, and not only am i fingerprinted, but they charged me five bucks to cash a check drawn on the same bank! am i the only person who hasnt quite gotten used to paying money to get your OWN money??? i could have gone to cash my check for 70 cents at a gas station for god's sake! And the ATMs are just as bad. the bank charges me a buck and the ATM (MAC to the northerners) charges me a buck fifty. so to take out 20 bucks may as well count as 25. with the seven cents a year i get for interest, it is better to bury money in a coffee can in the yard! if you have alot of money then bank savings, iras', CD's-it's all you. but if you are me? banks are just places you go to cash your checks...if that.  going on with the computer generated annoyance... i hate talking to the fake person when you call somewhere: "hi im irene, your automated assistant!- Please say if you want billing, service, or new orders!" i say, oh forget it.
