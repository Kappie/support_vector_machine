I've take then rest of the school day off, only because it WAS supposed to be a pro-d day... so yeh, I have permission.  uhm, I'm home right now,... Luanne walked me most of the way here ( THANKS miss santos! =) ) And yeh, I've been here for a about an hour or so... and, in about 20 minutes, I'm going to leave to go see my baybie.  He stayed home today =P... but yeh, I'm gonna go see him, and then I'll see what happens from there!  (= ~!Happy One Month Roxie!~ =)
