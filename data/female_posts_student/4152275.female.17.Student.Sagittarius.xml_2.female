You've got no arms left"          no no, that was not a completely random quote.. read on.. you'll see  Arg, I remember why I liked geocities... for its simple, copy and edit routine.. Didn't have to go through the agony of HTML codes there... nope! oh well, I guess its worth it. Its gonna take me a while to figure it out... A wanna change my damn title.. its so boring!  So anyhow.. enough about the codes. what's been up lately? hmmm, not too much, Scott and Josh picked me up at 6am.. [yea, thats right...  6am! ] Saturday morning to try and go swimming again.. but the stupid winter club pool doesn't open till 9am on weekends So we went back to Scotts house and watched Pulp Fiction. It was a good movie, I just think I might have to rent it again because I missed most of it due to the fact I kept falling asleep. Hmmm, watch other movies were seen.. oh! Josh brought over Monty Python and The Holy Grail. Holy mother, its better than Army of Darkness, in the humor sense. hahahaha, it was great, completely random, really stupid and no plot what so ever. knowing me i'll probally go and buy it sooner or later, but ah.. i loved it! lol And I finally got to see Bowling for Columbine on Sat. night (or early Sunday morning i guess) . Awesome movie. Thats all that needs to be said. I  heart  Michael Moore. Still wanting to see Farenheit 9/11 though..  Work was a bore today.. it went by quickly though *thumbs up* Talked with Larissa alot, it only took a year for us to really talk.. haha, so today's topic was how guys are complete jerks, [this got started b/c some guy was playing her and this other girl] so it was interesting.. made work go by realllllyyyy fast.. so i guess it balances it out.  arg, im so tired.. i'm just waiting around for my whole system to crash one of these days.. oh well, there are so many better things to do than sleep.. like talk on..    MSN!!     haha.. yeah im a junkie and i know it. ah well, what can u do? haha thats right, absolutely nothing! muhahaha, Later! --Chellbee
