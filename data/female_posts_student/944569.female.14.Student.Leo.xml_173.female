The name that made you soft as clay?  And, how about the voice that drived you crazy.  Would you remember?  And, if you happened to meet that person one day, probably 35 years from now, would you recognise them?  Love and life are both short.  Enjoy them while you can because once you've lost someone you love, they're lost forever.
