Now she is glowing out the window of the study, white and grey on black nothing.  I can't see stars tonight, she is alone, lounging in a moth wing glow.  It was a strange weekend, filled with drunken ramblings, of other people, and tired anger.  I was furious for a while, and laughed till I cried at one point, smiled till my cheeks hurt and then curled up in my smoke draped mind to sleep through a day.  I laid in the sun today.  Thinking about the universe as I laid on a green brown carpet under the tree, I imagined our small reality.  Maybe long ago we climbed up a huge tree.  It was a massive tree, so large and complex that we ended up calling it world.  By the time we reached the top we had forgotten what we labored towards, and we looked around and saw nothing but air, and we were afraid.  We tried to get down, to find the roots, the truth, but we had moved up so long, we had forgotten the down, we became lost.  People traveled in different directions, all seeking the trunk, all looking for the answers, the one path that would lead to the earth.  Ideas became branches, off shooting here and there, those paths walked most often grew strong to carry the weight, but it always ended in empty space.  Some claimed to have found the trunk, some took leaps and bounds to other branches, all forgot the language that they came with, maybe the one that the directions are written in.  Wars happened.  Fights over branch space, fights over leaves, fights over the fruit of the tree.  We cut into its wood, mining for nothing that we truly needed, finding the blood of life, tapping it and sucking it out, and weakening the branches.  There were some that found a path down.  They made their way up the thoughts to a root of sorts, but it was larger, and went down farther then the eye could see.  If they walked around it they found that there were many branches leading to this one place, many paths leading to the place where the root could be found.  They travel down, and there are no thoughts, beliefs or ideas anymore.  It is smooth here, and there is little to cling to.  There is comfort in branches of thought, complex leaf society, knowing the familiar places.  The trunk is exposed, and cold wind can blow here, and it is tempting to go back, or climb off.  Both climbing down and falling are a type of letting go.  There is a lust smell of Eden wafting up from the bottom of the world, secret cricket angels singing, and soft iris beds...
