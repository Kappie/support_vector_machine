I already have a blog and that was easy for me to set up but I have found that the LiveJournal account is a little bit trickier to set up. I have no idea how to put pictures up and I'm not too thrilled with the layout but this is a free account so I'll deal with it. The one thing that is bothering me is that the font for my first two posts are way too large.    Crystal e-mailed me today. Apparently her mom won't be able to take her to registration because she'll be too busy with Melonie and Heather. The way her mom treats her compared to her sisters makes me glad that I'm an only child. Crystal always comes second to her sisters which is quite odd figuring she's the oldest. Anyways, my mom said Crystal can come with us which I'm slightly relieved about. For some reason I wouldn't want to go alone. I'm just nervous that my mom will see how many friends she has compared to me. I'm also worried about seeing Dustin. I wouldn't be surprised if he makes some smart ass comment on how I wrote Logan a "love letter" and he never wrote back. What a way to start a school year by confirming that the guy I love is no longer interested in me. Here I am worrying about these hypothetical situations when I'm just scared shitless about going back to school in general. Last year started off so well but just dove deeper and deeper into the deep end. Registration is just the beginning. Oh shit, what if I close my eyes when I get my picture taken? I always worry about this though it never happens.    I'm also biting my nails about homecoming. I had the most amazing time last year. I met my first boyfriend there, I loved my dress, all of my friends got on real well. I have this horrible feeling that I don't belong. I'm considering sitting this one out. It's not as though anyone will ask me. If I had not screwed things up back in January I could be talking limos and restaurants with Logan right now. But alas, things never turn out the way you think. I feel as though if I went people would look down on me. Even if I were asked to the dance by some great guy, I've put Logan on such a pedestal that no one would even come close to him. I guess I'll just have to wait until mid-October to find out.    Nothing interesting happened today. My mom wanted to go grocery shopping but I still feel like such a fat-ass after gaining ten pounds (Yeah, I know, it could be worse). We stayed in and watched a few episodes of Queer as Folk on InDemand until my dad came in from the garage and said it was his turn to watch tv. I know that a lot of straight guys are uncomfortable watching gay men kiss and all that but I get the feeling that he's slightly threatened by that show. I know it would be fair to allow him to watch except for the fact that he works midnights and sleeps during the day. it was 3 pm, he is usually sleeping. After I handed the remote over to him he just put it on the InDemand thing for a good twenty minutes before he decided on anything to watch. I'd cut him some slack if it weren't for the fact that he's a lazy slob who, when he's awake doesn't clean up after himself and doesn't even clean himself for that matter. He hasn't even finished the kitchen which he started nearly a year ago. All he has to do is put the molding up. He also needs to replace the tiling in the basement because of the flooding.   Well, I've ranted and whined enough at this moment.
