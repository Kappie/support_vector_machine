Me and Kayla have known each other since we were about 6, but she moved to a different school and I didnt see her again until 8th grade.  We became best friends our Freshman year, and we've been driving people crazy since.  Me and Angelina just became close this past school year.  Oh the times we had in Health/Gym. ;)  I dont know what I would do without Angelina, she is my guardian "Angel" :)  I would be lost without either of these people in my life!!!  I love you guys!!!!!!
