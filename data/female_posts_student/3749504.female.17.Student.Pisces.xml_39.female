If I don't find a suitable internet cafe (scoff, cough and more scoffing) then a detailed entry will be on the order when I get back.  Ack. Hotels cost too much there. Here, in this stupid town (and in most of Oregon) the prices per room for a single are around $29-35. The cheapest hotel ("Berkeley Budget Inn") was about $63/night. And the prices increased exponentially from that; think Hotel 6 costing $200+ a night. Wow. That's my last paycheck - I worked for  two weeks .  And, luckily, I still have most of it (actually it was $256 but after taxes...so sad) and can spend it on crap in San Francisco. Who would have thought, MY stepdad taking me down there. He's practically the most racist guy I know. Although I think it's all for show...  We leave in the morning at 7:00 a.m. Brilliant. I will wake up at 5:30, quick shower, and finish packing (contacts, hair brush, shampoo, razor, hair stuff, etc). So...bye! Til some day a few days from now. Wheeee.
