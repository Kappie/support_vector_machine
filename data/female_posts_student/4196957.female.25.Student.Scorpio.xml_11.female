It's not that I have a problem with smiling while I praise God. It's just that this was the song used to prepare our minds for communion, I was about to turn to Isaiah 53 to meditate during the Lord's Supper and I was on the verge of giggling. I admit, I was a little distracted, but children are such wonderful distractions. After all, the congregation that worships quietly without the sounds of children occasionally interrupting is likely a congregation without children present, and that's just sad. Also, I remember the numerous times I was slapped around for being a distraction and I realize that I  deserve  to be tested by distraction in church. There were the times I made faces at various people in the building (at least until my parents or my Mi-mommy caught me) and my brother and I did once fumble the communion tray (the juice, no less) in a way that was not only distracting, it almost made us run short of juice. I started thinking about my most distracting (not to mention embarrassing) moments during worship services and to be honest, they aren't memories from my early childhood, when it is natural to do embarrassing things. One occurred when I was in junior high, while the other two occurred in college. Yikes!     When I was growing up, I would sit next to my great-grandmother on the second row on Sunday mornings. She needed to sit there as they had hearing aids that were wired into the sound system available on the second row. I would find the song numbers for she and one of her friends, as they had trouble hearing them clearly (the hearing aid thingies were way overrated) and I would also grab their hands occasionally to let them know the song a song was over and they could quit holding the note. ;-) This just happened to be right in front of the preacher and his family. I had really long hair and loved to play with it. I was flipping it back and swinging it, just like any prissy preteen. When the preacher stood up to do his sermon, he started walking and I felt tremendous pain! I yelped out loudly. He couldn’t walk any further because something was holding him back. That something would have been my hair. It was all tangled and entwined in his clip-on microphone. I managed to get it tangled in there pretty good. He started working it out, and when he realized it would be a while, the song leader got up and led a few songs. I think there was more laughing going on than singing, though.  My junior year at Abilene Christian, I was walking in late for chapel. If you’ve ever been to Moody Coliseum you know that it is circular and you can pretty much see anyone in any section. There were probably about 3,000 people in the coliseum that day. They had already started singing and everyone was already seated. I saw my friends up in section F on about the 12th row and headed up that way. . Once I saw my friends, they started laughing because I was late and people were staring. I sort of laughed a bit too, then I started running up the steps. I was really going quick and high kneeing it up the steps. I guess my knee didn’t come up high enough because I sure enough tripped and fell facedown, fully sprawled, spread eagle on the steps. All of section F started laughing and there were chuckles coming from other areas, as well. For the rest of the day, people from sections C, J, K, L, you name it, were coming up to me and telling me they saw it.  Another chapel story... My last spring semester at ACU, I walked into chapel and I was, once again, late. I was wearing a really cute sun dress that came just to the knee. It was floral and I had bought it at the Gap the day before. I really thought I looked good! I was also wearing a new pair of flip flops that matched it. Anyway, off of the fashion trip. My friends had saved me a seat in the middle of the row and there were strangers on both ends. I didn’t want to crawl over a bunch of people, so I did a pretty common thing and just stepped on the seat below and was going to step up to the row where they were sitting. Well, the seats are staduim/theatre seats that flip up and when I stepped up the seat, my right flip flop fell off and slipped down into the fold of the seat. I shifted my weight and the seat folded up. My foot fell down in it and my dress flipped up, which exposed a good bitt of flesh. It was extremely embarrassing. My friends were laughing, I was laughing and my flip flop was missing. It is also really hard to get your foot unstuck from a fold up seat, but even harder when you can’t stop laughing. I finally got up and found my flip flop after chapel.
