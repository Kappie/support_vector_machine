I was trying to ask you to check out my  urlLink TQM  It's a project I made for the school. Teachers here are required to submit a project (whatever it may be e.g. a book, modules, etc) that would benefit the students. I thought of creating a site for Chinese subject coz that I is one thing I can make in one day. I crammed (as usual) coz I started it the day before the submission.
