A really old one, and it's in really bad shape too. Yeah so I went with them to Nicks house to wash it. Exciting. Now I'm eating Reeses Ice Cream. Yum it is very delicous. Dad, Ann and the boys are watching Moulin Rouge and the tv room is right next to the computer room so I get to hear all the music. Awesome huh? Yeah, I get to do more shopping soon. Oh and on Thursday there is Artwalk in Tacoma and you can get into the Tacoma Art Museum and the Glass Museum free so I'm making Daniel go with me. I love the Glass Museum it is so awesome. They have a "Hot Shop" where you watch them blow glass and I think it is the coolest. Today I found out that the Van Gogh paintings were visiting the Seattle Art Museum and I totally didn't know that. I seriously am in love with him and a bunch of other artists that are exibiting there. There is even work by Pablo Picasso, Piet Mondrian, and Georges Seurat. I love art. Hopefully I will get to go, the exibit is there until September 13th. Anyway, I'm going to watch Moulin Rouge and sing all the songs. It's on the part where they are in the elephant and Satine is supposed to have sex with the duke but he isn't really the duke. Then Ewan McGregor sings and he's so hot!
