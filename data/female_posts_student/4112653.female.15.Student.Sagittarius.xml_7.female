     
      Our Father in Heaven,   Thank you for the trials and tribulations in life. Strengthen us; encourage us; and give us the ability to endure. Let our faith remain strong through every challenge. Generous and gracious God, we ask that when we need help, we will not hesitate to come to you in prayer.       Lord, remove every doubt in our minds, and let us be certain and decided. Do not let us become like a wave in the sea that is blown about by the wind. We pray all these things that we might better serve You, mighty God.      In Jesus' most precious name, Amen         [Read James 1:2-8 for encouragement in hard times ^-^]
