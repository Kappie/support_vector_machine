I wasn't even complaining about school...I was reporting since Linds has been sick. I could have told her to shove it...I didn't. I really do like Abby but people that attack me and think that I'm wrong EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T KNOW ME just irk me a tiny bit. Yes I know I antagonized Linds...hell you would have too last year. I've stopped but she's the one bringing him to the surface lately...even before the zabeth's b-day. Linds doesn't expect me to be for michael so if I suddenly stopped...A check and make sure I'm alive and B if I'm rational. I've stopped antagonizing her and yes I know I was wrong. I even think I told her sorry...if I didn't Lind I'm sorry. I'm NOT saying I like him but if you like him...ok but God help him if he pisses you off in anyway. Josh...I don't talk to you alot lately but I thought we were friends so calling me an ass and basically telling me that I can't even defend myself is alittle bit off. Sorry but for some reason your gf doesn't like me and i thought I could kinda fix that. Apparently not.
