The scars I gave are still there. Lethargically it bent its branches  When pushed by the wind In the cold autumn seasons But it would never break It was so strongâ€¦so reliable... And it hurt me so bad when  That metal hit the trunk And beat it like a drunken father   i cried   andthose memories flowed like my tears   its blood   my blood   my heart   would never be the same
