When I smell coffee, I remember Tchibo, this fantastic shop that sells everything coffee. When I go to the bank, I remember the bank in Travemunde,when I look at my diamond ring, I remember that my dad bought it for me at Christ, a jewelry store in Travemunde. Imiss the milkshakes in that little cafe... God, I haven't been to Germany for 2 years. Last year because I had to take summer classes, and this year because I had togo for interviews in UST and enrollment. Next year though, i'm coming back!!!!! I miss our little house, and wonderful Steak Tartar.
