So anyway I came home today and like did nothing..I got to blow up balloons tho! that was pretty fun. Then I talked to people on the internet..and i was like listening to music...joy...Um I didnt do much today but tomorrow my sister graduates and Ryan and Emily are coming over and were gonna like watch movies and stuff like that! It'll be a joy..I'm not to psyched about the ceremony...boring...But oh well...Um I suppose thats like about it!!!! I love Ryan!!!
