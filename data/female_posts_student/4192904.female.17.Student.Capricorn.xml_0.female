When we reached this highway bridge, I saw Han's in front. I wanted to go after him, But suddenly a war just broke out, I was hit by a laser gun. Then i just slowly collasped. My soul was still around, but i can't find Han, my friends or any of my families..      Hmm... Wonder what dreams will i get tonight..? I have a very bad feeling about it... gd night everyone.. Sweet dreams...
