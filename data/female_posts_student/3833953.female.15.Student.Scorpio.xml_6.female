As far as the rest of yesterday went, just after i got off here my firend woke up and called her mom who told her she was going to be out of town, so my friend could either go home or stay over here. she decided to go home so i was bored for the majority of the day. im quite jealous (please excuse my bad spelling) at her. she gets to go with her b/f to cedar point..gerr. she said that her and her mom and stuff were planning on going and inviting me to come with them, but her b/f invited her to go with him so now her mom basically said there is no point in going twice...thus no cedar point for me..pooo. anyway, i spent about 2 hours stripping down the remains of the party from previous night yesterday after she went home. after that i spent the rest of the day doing mainly what im doing now...nothing..  well i must be off..my mom has assigned me some chores and whatnot to keep me busy..see ya later.  ~Rachel, aka Phoenix
