Im probably going to watch movies and talk on the iternet all day. I have nothing better to do. Tomorrow is church. Danny, a guy that I met thru a website, talked to Mark last night. It was so sweet. He stuck up for me like no one else has. I feel so special... I cant post it b/c it is too long. Danny is sooo awesome! School orientation is Friday night. So that should be fun. I think I am going to spend the night with my mom on Thursday and Friday night. I dont want to see my aunt and uncle, who are coming down on saturday, so she is my escape route. *lol* Thats about it going on here... Myabe I will post later... if it lets me.  And I don't want to fall to pieces I just want to sit and stare at you I don't want to talk about it And I don't want a conversation I just want to cry in front of you I don't want to talk about it 'Cause I'm in love with you
