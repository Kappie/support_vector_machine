Too bad that I'm too stupid to get in there. Oh well, I'll go to some low-quality public school with my intelligence and GPA level near her. There's sure to be some artsy people there.  So i got home, was kind of tired. I turned on the tv, and wrote to you guys. After that, I laid in my bed and watched TLC, The Last Chapter- VH1 Behind The Music. I started crying for some reason. Over nothing. After that, I started watching VH1 No Doubt (the complete history) or something like that. I knew Sarah would like that.   After I finished making my brain turn into liquid with all of the TV, i went to my brother's Sports Banquet, because my parents wanted to make it a "Family Event". Yeah those are almost always pretty crappy evenings. Jeff kicked and yelled at me and hurt my feelings so incredibly much. I was doing him a favor of letting him go out into the car. I can't believe he did that. IHe kept stopping and not following my directions. I just had to finally pick him up.  know I shouldn't take it personally, but when you're looked at by everyone around you holding a screaming child because HE wanted to go to the car, you feel a little bit sh*tty. I did. After that, I thought my dad didn't see Jennifer Moser and her friend crossing the road, so i yelled my dad to stop with this horrible agony in my voice, and my dad just threw it in my face. I'm sorry, but i was so terribly distraught already, that it didn't help. I cried all the way back home. Fortunately, my dad didn't ask what was wrong until i got home. I just said nothing and go away. That's all for now. I love you sarah. bye
