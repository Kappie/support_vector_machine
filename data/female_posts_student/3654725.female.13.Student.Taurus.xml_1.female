All of us have our own ambition to fulfill but it's juxz up to us whether we will make it... Juz like as though there's somebody out there who might be willing to read this blog of mind...        Have you ever wonder wat is life? Life is full of choices... Life is a filled with obstacles that you can't even think of... But the people around us can help... it's juz that matter of the choice on whether they want to help or not... Sometimes we feel as though we can fly to the moon... we can spread our wings and soar above the sky... it's just the matter of time...        I had never thought of how tomorrow is going to be without fulfilling of what i'm going to do today... sometimes it's better not to look into the future if we are not completed with our present...       Have you ever tried to kill yourself but was being stopped by others? Have you ever thought you were useless? Have you ever thought that you're alone?
