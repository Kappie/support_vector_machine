I read the feature in The Sun TV Guide aswell and I'm liking the sound of it. It's a love story about two people who meet, but are from different sides of the world. Long distance relationships eh... "If you feel you can't be with anyone else, you  make  it work." commented the female lead... Sounds familiar... Anyway, I at least recognised 2 of the actors; Sooz from As If and the bloke from Teachers. So tomorrow night at 10, Channel 4, I think I'll see if its worth my while...    The  urlLink Olympics  is becoming slightly boring now, what with it just being the track and field events. I personally enjoyed the swimming, and more unusual-type sports. Table tennis. Wow, now that's a game :p I am impressed by that grey-haired bloke though... Jonathan Edwards. Have you seen that guy jump? It's a shame he's retired. He was a great athlete... Just like our very own Paula Radcliffe.   Although I despise running (unlike Gordy...) I really feel for her. In all the interviews I've seen she's broken down in tears. I guess she feels she's let the whole country down :( I don't think she has though. She's still the world record holder and a woman of remarkable endurance who I really admire.  Well my musical listening has stepped down a notch from  urlLink LaunchCast  radio, to the video station they have, as my skips have run out :( Well I guess I could listen to my CDs... It would make sense :p Although I like the randomness that Launch offers. It's changed from  urlLink Linkin Park  - Breaking the Habit to  urlLink The Vines  - Ride. Two pretty good songs. Although I'm sure Gordy wouldn't agree with the first one, even though he's never heard it *rollseyes* :p Keaton Simons now... Who? *skips* ah  urlLink Nickelback  - Figured you out. That's a good song.  Anyway enough about music... I'm really starting to like this blogging malarky and getting the hang of it too :D I might even write again tonight... But we'll see about that.
