The next day on Sunday, we're driving to St. Mary's City and checking in at John Hopkin's CTY for camp for 3 weeks.  I'm taking a Cryptology course there.  Yay!  Lol.  But I'm pretty sure I won't have internet access, *tear*.  The reason that we're going a day early is so we won't be too rushed on Sunday.  Good idea, huh?  So since I'm like leaving tomorrow, I should probably be packing today, shouldn't I?  My first attempt to pack, I put my sheets in the bag, and then I went over to my next door neighbor's and hung out with Jamie, Evan (Jamie's friend), and Mia for a few hours until Jamie and Mia left for camp.  Evan was like flirting with Mia the entire morning.  Ick.  Then Liz and I walked to the Hair cuttery to get haircuts.  I got two inches off and got it angled in the front.  It looks like exactly the same.  Eh, whatever.  The second attempt at packing, Liz was just about to go to work, and she asked me to go get some film developed for her.  So being the nice sister that I am, I walked up to Rite Aid and got it developed.  Then I kind of decided that I didn't feel like going to Britta's party, cause I really need to pack, and because I'm rather lethargic today.  So blah, now I'm here, writing this, and I should be packing.  Third time's the charm.  Oh yeah, and tomorrow morning, right before I leave, Liz is leaving for the airport to fly to Los Angelos for 6 weeks to take summer courses at USC (University of Southern California).  So basically, until my dad gets back from Salt Lake City, my mother will be home alone.  How sad.  I'LL MISS YOU GUYS!!!  And I'm sure that you'll miss me too.  ;)  ...la Gu
