I like to talk about because i like to know more info about it. I knew someone who's parents lived in DC not far from where the plane had crashed. I was in my computer class when i found out. Bailey and I went out to lunch and listened to the radio. Then we left class and went to my house to watch it on TV. The famous question was where were you when you found out?
