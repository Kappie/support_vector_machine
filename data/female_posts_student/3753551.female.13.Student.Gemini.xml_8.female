That is, of course, after my fame of being a fmous rock-star fizzles out. So... when im about 99... and not for my retirement... for fun... yeah... for money for cookies... yahuh well anyway. Im 13 and want to learn some stuff about it before i start the class in year 9 im sure tons of uz out there are good at pic making and photo editing and shit. look down on me..... please...  Auf Weidersehn  ~Mimo
