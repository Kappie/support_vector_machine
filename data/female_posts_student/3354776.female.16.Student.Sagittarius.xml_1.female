I was like..holy fuck..scared to my pants. Ten like 3 minutes later, a not so loud one strikes again, but it was loud enough. I ran to my moms room and I asked her to sleep with me. But I stayed over there. My dad was in the other room. God it was scarrry. It boom-banged  all  night.   This morning I woke up to see that is was beautiful and sunny outside! what the hell!! My dad told my mom that he was scared too. haha   Hey I may be 16 but I'm a scaredy cat!
