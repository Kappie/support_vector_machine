So today working 10 til 4.30. The word gah springs to mind but as it is such a nice day hopefully most folk will be at home sun bathing or something and won't have the energy to enter a store like ours which has no air conditioning so we all boil every day. Last summer it was so hot the chocolate melted. As in you could pick up a packet and it would literally be liquid form. I brought Rolocoaster Tycoon 2 yesterday. If anyone has it do you know how to delete a scenario you create? Lol. Any other news for you all? Um. Not at the moment. Oh yea schol play is in a couple weeks so come see! I am going on the Thursday with Matt W so if any of you wanna come please do. (Paul, Charlene, Becky, Helen, Pennie etc.. are in it)  Other than that have a nice day.
