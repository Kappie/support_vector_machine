I can't helpt it, i'm lost, i'm completely submerged by the feelings that come with it, i can't help the way i feel and i can't help being this way, feeling that, doing what i do, it hurts, it pains me to think of it, i take on selfish, cruel ways, i forget, i forgive, i get hurt, i hurt, thats what happens.  But, he is my everything, he was my everything and 75% of the time it still feels like that, still feels like i am completely covered in this warm feeling, getting close to him isn't sex its making love, and it feels so damn right, feels like we both want it, we look each other in the eye as he slides into me and it just feels so damn right, that could be the randyness taking over but hey, he makes me work, he makes me tick, he makes me breath, without him i die, i fall, i feel even more shit that i do with this god damn chest infection, knowing he is in his room, with her, that hell bitch, most probably sleeping with her, doing things he did to me with her,  it can never be as special as us, can never be as right, or feel so perfect, he knows it, i know he does, we share that something, that makes us work, makes us click, makes us fit, and he knows it, we had always wanted each other, always liked, disliked, loved, its there, and i refuse to forget as the moment i do, will be the moment he realises.  I can't even pretend to forget, maybe i need to talk to someone who knows what they are talking about? I need to get it all out, leave him behind me, but i can't, i keep clinging on...
