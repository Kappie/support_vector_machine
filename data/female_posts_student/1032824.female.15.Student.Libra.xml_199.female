There are so many kick-butt bands that I like at the mo - The Starting Line, Dashboard Confessionals, Snow Patrol, etc.   I am so bored right now.. watching  The Apprentice  and talking to Jason on the phone at the same time. Dumm dee dumm. I didn't do anything today. * Sigh * I told my Mum and she was like, "It's ok lah it's good to take a break", Haha. Then I went on telling her what I did today, you know the usual woke up, eat, use comp, watch tv, sleep, etc. So so sinful.. I think I will hit the gym and go for a swim on Saturday. I realised that it's actually quite fun hanging out alone! Like think about stuffs and get to know yourself better.. Reflect. I also like grocery shopping. Haha. It's pretty cool actually like ask Mummy for some money, let's say 20 dollars, then you go to the supermarket and grab some chocolates, snack bars, yoghurt, cereal, ice cream, fruits.. YUMMERS! :P  Okay lah, going to watch telly now. Cheerios! :)
