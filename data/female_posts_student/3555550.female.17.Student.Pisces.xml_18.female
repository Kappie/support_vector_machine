Just sit face to face with someone I hardly know and talk. I find conversation...INTELLIGENT conversation....beautiful. I just need that.  This means I will spending MORE time at caffeine dreams reading my book and waiting for Mr. intelligent-conversation.  *sigh*  P.S. I need to stop writing poems. That is my new goal. lol.
