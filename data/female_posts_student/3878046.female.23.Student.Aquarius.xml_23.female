	 
      i'm so frustrated
what do i do?
emotions are taking over
i don't understand myself
what do i want?
there's so much underneath
just waiting to brim over
who am I?
i'm not this shell 
this body that i hate
my heart thumps so violently
beating against a cage of ribs
impatient to be free
something's got to give
to let me be me.
