Yay. :D  I went to Trey's house again on Monday from like 10:30 to like...7. XD We ended up walking over to the mall for a few hours and got some Bawls. ^_^ We stopped by the park on our way back as well and then started walking over to Melissa's since I was gonna stay there for the night.   When we got there, Trey, Melissa, Lauren, Brittany, and I hung out on her front porch for a little while and then walked over to the Greenbelt for a little while. At like 8:30 Melissa's mom drove Trey home and then we got on the compy for a little while and then watched some movies. Wheeeeee. Fun stuff. ^_^  On Tuesday, Melissa, Trey, Joe and I went over to Sunsplash and ended up meeting Marcel and Kohl there as well. Overall, it was pretty damn fun. :D I'd definitely like to do it again.   And then today...I have an eye appointment. I better not need glasses. That would suck ass. -_- I'd look horrible in glasses. XD
