I was actually shocked, though I am sure that his drug history - though he is clean now - took its toll on his body. He's younger than my parents. I think they were going to make some sort of biographical film about him and it would have been interesting to see how his music evolved, how wholesome Motown interacted with the superfreak. For a long time, I actually thought he was Canadian (it was in some movie about Canadians that led me to believe this), but he is actually from Buffalo, NY and fled to Toronto when he went AWOL from the military. He was in a group with Neil Young, y'all. And he's a nephew of Melvin, the deep-voiced Temptation (this explains that weird "Temptations sing!" line in "Super Freak", I think. I always wondered why they signed up to sing the "ooooooooooooooo").  A bit of disturbing information about Sir Rick (can one be knighted posthumously?) from his biographical sketch on his website:   And after bedding by his count "thousands" of women, James,  50, has settled down with dancer Tanya Hijazi, 27 (whom he married in December  1997 after an 11-year relationship), and their 5-year-old son, Tazman. "I'm too  old to do crazy things anymore," says James. "Before, I'd just smoke dope and  have sex. I never knew if it was day or night. Now I go to bed at 11 and get up  at 7. I don't have aluminum foil on my windows anymore."    Did anyone do the math on this "dancer" he was dating?  Talking about Rick reminds me of my friend, Miriam.We pretended that we were Teena Marie and Rick James and belted out their most beloved duet, "Fire and Desire".  We always brought down the classroom with our "You were as cold as iiiiiiiiiice..."  Ho-hum. Going out tonight to do whatever. I hope I get enough sleep to face boy tomorrow. I want to organize my shite so that I can get out of that place. As much as I care about the guy, I really am tired of have to deal with wishywashiness. I hope someone will do a better job with it than I have for the past few years.
