Amber, Brandy, and I went to the movies and it was a good movie I had to tell some hood rats to shut up during the movie they looked at me like they were ready to fight I wasnt scared in fact I thought it was funny.  I saw my cousin there he is pretty coolo and I guess that is good seeing as how he will be a fish this year when school starts.  I cant believe I will finally be a junior cant wait till next year to say goodbye to everybody except my family and the couple of ppl I like in this town.  Well after the movie we ran into clayton it was good to see him he had some facial hair didnt look to shabby...lol  As we were leaving the parking lot I told Brandy to stop so we could write on his windows o what fun that was.  He wasnt too happy but I had fun and that is all that matters.  I liked not caring and I think that is how I am going to be these last two years kinda care less.  After that we went to walmart and that was an adventure itself b/c I mean like amber said three girls in mini skirts yeah we turned a couple of heads, but nothing I am not use to b/c when I am with Sarah we do that crap all the time....lol still miss her...lol   Well we then went to Burger King and won some free food...pretty cool!  After that we kinda called it a night b/c we didnt want Amber getting home too late it was close enough as it is.  So today I took the advice of my very good friend and tried the whole family thing...pretty cool I might add you should try it sometime.  I had fun and I got some school clothes when I was out.  I really hate school clothes shopping b/c of all the dress code and I know ppl think we shouldnt but I dont think uniforms would be that bad I mean I would save money and then could get clothes I really like.  My sister went with us and I was glad b/c now that she is married it kind of sucks not seeing her all the time.  I remember when I was little and my sister my two brothers and I had so much fun, we always made each other laugh.  I miss them.  Tomorrow my uncle comes down I am glad b/c I miss him a whole bunches and his family.  My other uncle is having another kid I guess that is pretty cool but it is weird b/c all the other kids are grown up and now we have like baby cousins and I dunno sometimes babies bug me, but I still love them.  Well I guess that is all b/c I am bored and kinda tired but I dunno if I will be able to go to sleep took a nap earlier.  Goodnight   Love always   Jess
