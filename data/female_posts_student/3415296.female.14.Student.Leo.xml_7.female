He's always there for you no matter what. And I'm really thankful for that. Joey's really lucky. I wanted to get away from everything. I just figured something out yesturday, and I guess I should've expected it from a certain someone. I thought that all this time, things would be different. That being with me was different. But I was wrong. I guess you could say I was expecting too much. Nima said that I'm the one that shouldn't be thinking about all this. He said I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know what to think, but I wish I could take every word he says and tell myself that it's true, but some how I think I did do a lot of things wrong. Now all I can do is regret about it.   Nima says I should give the stars to Safee, because the reason why I made all of them was to give it to him, but I don't know. I think I should, but I don't think I should. I'm just scared that he's going to do nothing with it, but throw it away. I just don't want all of that effort to go to waste. I told Nima that I'd just save it for someone special later on in the future, but he said that I made the stars for one purpose and that was to give it to Safee. I wish I could be as confident as he is, but I'm not. I guess I'll just wait and see if I will or not.   Every second of every day, I just can't get my mind off one thing. I want to really bad, but I just can't. I have too many memories for me to forget, good memories, great memories. Last night, I remember praying to God, that everything would end of great for me. I told Him not to listen to my prayer because there are many children like me that have much worse conditions. I just needed to tell my feelings to someone, and the Lord is who I want to talk to. I don't know why, but tears slid down my face. All I could do was wipe them away. I had no reason to cry. I had a reason to happy. I could say those tears were from happiness, but they weren't. I don't know how to explain everything. I can't believe this, but I'm crying right now. I wish nothing happened, but it did, and I'm taking nothing for granted. I just want to pray to God for everything to be fine for me and my friends.
