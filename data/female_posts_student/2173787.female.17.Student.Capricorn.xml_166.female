When did this happen?  How did this happen?  We've floated along for so long, hanging out, bound by the past, but in reality when have we actually done something as a group.  Pairs, triples, sometimes even four of us do things but seven of us?  Was there ever just seven.  It seems as if all of our linkages have been dying and while we are all individually friends, there is no group.  Is this even a bad thing, or just different?  I don't know.  All I know is that somewhere along the line things changed. Why?  Oddly enough, I don't know how I feel about this.  A nostalgia for the past, a sadness that that chapter seems to have somehow ended and yet can't help but wonder what the future holds.  Will I become closer to each person, as I have these past few weeks, or will I drift off to some other place?  Should I even be writing this?  So many questions, so few answers.
