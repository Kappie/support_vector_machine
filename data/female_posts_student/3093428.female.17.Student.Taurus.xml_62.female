Jesus said to a very rich man "Sell all your belongings and give everything you own to the poor, then you can follow me". The cost of following Jesus to this man was very great. But it is great to everyone, you have to CHOOSE Jesus in everything you do.   What I mean is that you shouldn't feel too discouraged. Find strength in the Lord and remember that He has a great plan. Just remember to put Him first in everything.   To go to Bible college, I sacrificed having a car, my friendships here at home, life living that was normal. Insuring a car is very expensive. Going to Bible college is also very expensive. There is financial aid for one of the two...  Do you remember Annick's words? Embrace them; they were not from her, but from God.
