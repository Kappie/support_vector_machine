I saw Puni Puni Poemy today. It burns real good, like jalapenos. If I were a dude I'd totally whack off to it. But I lack the equipment, so no whacking off for me.  It feels like Friday. It should be. At least MAP blocks are finally over. Ugh, an hour and a half around people I don't like. I took some antihistamine and it made me super-drowsy. I could barely stay awake in class. Sleep is good... But naturally, I'm not tired now. Go figure.   Current Mood:  Frustrated
