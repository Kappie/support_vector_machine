At least I got to read a book that I found to be truly splendid. We didn't get through the whole movie unfortunately, as it is six hours long...without commercials. I think it was meant for a mini series on A However, I did enjoy the first half thoroughly and intend to rent the movie as soon as possible to watch the last half.   Anyway, it was a very nice meeting even if no one else enjoyed the book as much as I. Emily had a wonderful dinner and it was just a lot of fun. We haven't decided on our next book yet.   Things are going alright for the most part right now. There are unfortunate circumstances in certain things, but those wont be talked of in here. Well, I'm off to....I'm not sure what. I'll figure it out once I start doing whatever it is I am to do.
