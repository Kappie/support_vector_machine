To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. Is that all right? I drove all night.  What in this world keeps us from tearing apart? No matter where I go I hear the beating of your heart. I think about you when the night is cold and dark. No-one can move me the way that you do, nothing erases this feeling between me and you.  I drove all night, to get to you, is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room. Woke you from your sleep, to make love to you. I drove all night, is that all right? I drove all night.  To taste your sweet kisses your arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night, to get to you. Is that all right? I drove all night, crept in your room, woke you from your sleep to make love to you.  I drove all night. To taste your sweet kisses you arms open wide, this fever for you is just burning me up inside, I drove all night.   Honey love love, ooh it'd ease my mind. I need to find time, someone to call mine. My mamma said you can't hurry  love, no you';ll just have to wait. She said 'love don't come easy, its a game of give-and-take'.  urgh this one is way too fast for me. Never mind.
