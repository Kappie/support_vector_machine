Elizabeth moves over to Kuronue and kicks him, you know where, he falls.  Jack then falls for there is nobody to hold him up.* I cant hurt you can I, humph!  Jenn: Its been a male massacre! Bad Elizabeth!  Elizabeth: Do you want a piece of this?  Jenn: bring it on long hair  Elizabeth: shut it short one  Will: (one time cameo) ladies, stop it! *both stop and look at Will.  Will looks at the men on the floor*  Elizabeth, what did you do? Never mind, dont answer that!  You are a bad girl.  You know you shouldent do that, Jack helped rescue our daughter and you do this.  I dont know the other two, but they probably didnt deserve it.  You should be ashamed! *Elizabeth looks down* COME! *Elizabeth follows Will with her head down*  Jenn: i thought that she was a better person than that.  Oh well.  * skips over the bodies singing "tra la la la la"*
