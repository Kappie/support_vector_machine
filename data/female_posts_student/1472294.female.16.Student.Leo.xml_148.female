So thin and the mouth likea beak. -_- But I still like to watch the Jap detective series. I mean, it is like the plot is so scary and the murderer is so unexpected. But their reason is very reasonable. And the story behind their revenge is always a sad one. *sob sob* It always leaves me thinking and treasure my family and close ones.... Anyway, we had a new time table AGAIN. I mean, we have already changed twice and this was the 3rd time.... Oh, I almost forgot today is NCC Day. I was like, came out of the class and shocked to see a big group of army guys and suave guys in white. *_* OK, back to reality. And whats more, Upper Sec were shifted and standing in front and the way the NCC (SEA) commander shouted...  Whoa, So Up Close. I do hope to !forget! that GIRLS BRIGADE DAY IS TWO WEEKS FROM NOW... On the 14th July. Haiz... And our school's GB and BB enrolment is NEXT WEEK. I hate memorising the speech and singing the GB and BB Theme Song AND standing UP and DOWN.... At least there is no parade... This year Sec 1's are so DAMN lucky. I have been enduring the heat for 3 years AND I was not even in the G.O.H. -____-
