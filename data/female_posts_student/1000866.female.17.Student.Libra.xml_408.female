I didn't really hang out with him this weekend other than today so it was fun.   He's such a good friend. Like...seriously. I love having him as my best friend. He arranges stuff...heh heh. He's always there when I'm upset and he's really good to talk to. I'm actually really worried about next year when he goes to college. I'm not sure who I'll talk to because he's one of the only people I trust. Ah well, I guess i'll just have to see what happens when that time comes.  I think I'll go finish my laundry and go sleep....
