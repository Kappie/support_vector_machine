No wonder she wears alla those braclets...hides her scars. I've already seen them but she added more today. If your wondering how i've been doing:im okay....i guess. Somethings are still hard and i do still cry and WANT to hurt myself but i don't. We had an NRT..don't ask what it means cuz i don't know. It was boring boring. but back to Friski, she was really mad. This morning me and her were talking about moving to different places and how are parents expect us to make friends real easy. So ya...she did'nt get over it and then her friends pretty much ignored her today. Even i could see she wasn't doing well. But anyway, all i said was "lifes a bitch then you die",,she was like"don't say that to a suicidal person". she laughed but i didn't. I mean...it was a joke but i could REALLy see her commiting suicide. Whats with the word commit?...how can u COMMIT suicide. commiting your life to death?...sounds alil weird. (I've had way too much time on my hands lol)...But...when Friski says she's gonna do something She'll do it. Her and I have alot in common but...i wish we didn't have suicidal thoughts in common..she's gonna call me tonight and we'll talk about it.
