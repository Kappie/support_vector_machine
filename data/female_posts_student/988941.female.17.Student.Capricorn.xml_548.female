I didn't get twhat a box plot was though, only to be told by Dina that it is the same as a box and whisker!! doh!!  That's annoying, but it's only 3 marks and I sholdu have worked that one out anyway, lol! So yyeah, ii am ok with that. Tomorrow I have englsih in the morning and Geography in the afternoon, 3 and a half hours in total of essay writing- not quite my idea of fun!
