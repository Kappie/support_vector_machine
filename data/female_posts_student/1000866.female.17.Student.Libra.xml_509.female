Brandon definitely didn't call me and invite me haha, and I was talking to Peter, and he's like yeah..."Brandon just called and told me to come over." So, I was like...aww...fine, don't invite me. And like...at that moment, my doorbell rang and Katharine and Alex were there to pick me up. It was crazy. But yeah, we went to Brandon's for a while and chilled. We watched a little bit of Office Space. Hilarious movie.  Then, I lost horribly at Tony Hawk to Peter. My favorite was Katharine. "Catie, I think the trick is....stop falling." Haha.   Then we just went bowling. We went to the Tivoli, but yeah...definitely no open bowl. That was dissapointing but we went to lisle lanes after that and whooo, I suck at bowling. Good times, good times. I have a driving lesson at 7:00 tomorrow morning though. Arghhhh. :( So SO early. So, I guess I should go and sleep or something productive like that.   I can't type at ALL tonight. It's annoying.
