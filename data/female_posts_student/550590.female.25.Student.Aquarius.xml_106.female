Sigh.  It seems like a lot was done, but a good majority of it was (1) out of sheer boredom and (2) procrastinating in cleaning/packing my office.    I'm at that point where I don't know what I should leave out or if I'm packing too soon.  A part of me cannot wait to get the hell out of this godforsaken town.  The other part wishes I knew where the hell I was going instead.  "How did I get here, how the hell? Pann left, close on the steeple of the church.  How did I get here?..."  Sorry, a little Rent interlude seemed appropriate for some reason.  On an upnote, my fingernails are red and glittery to match my hair and now my eyebrows match as well. Yay. Apparently with the green contacts and red hair all my kids think I look like Kirsten Dunst..they just wanted me to give them good cases....  Well, tomorrow I swear I will be getting some cleaning and packing done around here...or else I'll have some more not-so-exciting stuff I got done instead to report.  :)
