"its a good thing to do for your neighbors" she says. how do the neighbors receive the "good thing" you ask? well let me just tell you...mom doesnt do it. caroline doesnt do it, henry doesnt do it. the neighbor5s dont come over themselves and get it. i have to trek in the snow/hail/ 5 mph, -3* wind all over the neighborhood. let me just say that i am not shocked to see the confused look on ppl's faces when they see the abominable snowkid show up at their door. more than half the neighborhood has no clue who we are. i dont even explain who we are b/c fortunately ppl act gracious enough to just go with the flow. do i care whether or not ppl eat this stupid soup given to them by complete strangers? no. my face feels so raw right now. my corneas feel so scratched, im surprised im not blind. thanks to the russians, my blood pressure is so high right now. im trying to walk through and they just stand there kicking up snow like they dont even see me coming through and yelling, "get out of the way and go home like normal ppl!!!!"  no. they just stand there kicking the dry snow up into the wind and into my face and eyes.  my heart is hurting so badly right now. im shaking like crazy and my heart is beating so fast i have to keep beating my chest and taking deep breaths to ease the pain. i hope my heart is ok. damn.   the only thing i will admit to liking about this snow day is no geometry test. we were supposed to have one today, but obviously its going to be postponed unitl we get back....if we get back at all if this insanity ceases. im the only person who hates staying home....only b/c my home is a crazy house and i highly doubt anyone else's parents makes them go out into the snow with a possible heart problem.  pardon me if i sound coldhearted (no pun intended), but im just pissed at the world right now. i want to be with friends...not home going around the neighborhood feeding strangers and getting an icy exfoliating facial. not exactly the ideal spa treatment.
