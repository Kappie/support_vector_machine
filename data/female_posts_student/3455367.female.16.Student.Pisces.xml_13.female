See where one is ..prob be one on at Wilsons creek or something...cos i really want to go one. I cant wait til i go to Sydney. It will be really fun ..i dont know where im gonna stay though. Well actually i have this family friend that i know ..she might let me stay with her.otherwise ill have to get a hotelroom or something. I need to start saving up a hell of a lot of money for this trip ..i need to get a plane ticket for the way up there ..but i can get a free train ticket on way back. And i need to save up money to buy stuff when i am there ..U never know, i could come across something hellsome. check!
