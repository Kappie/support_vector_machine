So I'm in a pretty good mood. Yesturday I picked up Brand New's cd along with The Used. I like The Used a bit better than Brand New. Isn't that awesome the "USED" "BRAND NEW" ha ha. I really wanted to get Brand New, new and The Used, used ha ha ha ha but I got em both new since they didn't have the used used. I'm sorry if anyone couldn't follow that. I can be a bit confusin. yea, so uh..... I can't wait until Simple Plan's dvd is out! ohhhhhhhh baby! uhhhhhhh! So I should work on my "School Work" yeah right...... well I'll talk to you awesome guys later! Bye "Question of the day......" Q: Where the hell did they get the name "Banana nut crunch?" seriously, THINK about it??!!
