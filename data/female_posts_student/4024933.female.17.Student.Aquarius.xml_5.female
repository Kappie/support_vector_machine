Wed. night my brother and my 14 yr old neighbor camped out at the Sheraton hotel to so we could get into the morning show the next day. Russ Parr was in towm and some special music guest...like Lil Scrappy...Ok k k, Fo eva i love a atlanta...yall know...then my brother ran into Ciera and didnt even know it...Slum villege was there and i took a pic wit them...actually we followed them to Tower city not to far from the hotel...its like a lil mall..so i could take a pic wit them...and lets see who else...oh yea Lloyd was there...wit his semi-cute self. Well like i was sayin...we were there since 6:30 and this lady wanted to argue with us talkin about we werent on the side walk so we should get to the back of the line...she was talkin mess from like 3am till 5...thats when my brother apoligized...but we still didnt move...but over all it was fun.
