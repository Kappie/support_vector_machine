Here is the first REAL update in forever!!!!  **The 2004 Vans Warped Tour-Jacksonville Fairgrounds, Florida** Okay, so kick ass!! I loved it!!  **Bands I saw/heard (in order):  *billytalent ( I heard one yell and I knew it was them)- I didn't see them perform, but walking around that was the background music  *Tiger Army- not too bad, I've never really gotten into them but the cello was kinda cool. Green and black zebra stripes  *Random bands that I don't know their name- pretty good music, I just wish I knew who they were  *Taking Back Sunday- OMFG. OMFG. What is there to say? Adam Lazzara is extremely... no words can possible describe. I loved it. He is sooooooo........ UGH!!!!! He does the whole shake side-to-side. He swings the mic... which is one of the hottest things I've seen a guy in a band pull off. and he whips it around his throught. They are just incrediblely awesome. The music kicks ass live. There is so much energy in Adam live and they just rock. Oh yeah! and so there's this girl back stage watching the band do their set and she's on the phone. This upsets Adam and he looks over at her and goes "Are you kidding me!? Your on the phone?" and the girl says something that the crowd can't hear. and he goes "Do you know how many people want to be in your position over there and your on the phone? Get off." and I'm not sure if he kicked her off the stage or not, but mid way through playing, at a lull in the song where it's silent he looks behind thye stage and yells "We stopped playing so you can leave a message now!" UGH that was so hot!! And later in between playing songs he askes "Did you get any more calls?" I am now in love with him.  *Melee- Okay I'm walking around and I see this kinda tall skinny guy playing keyboard and having some kinda... I don't know how to explain it. Smooth, soul, but not at all... I really don't know but it's intruiging. So I watch for a while listening to "The War" which is catchy. Then, after hearing that song and seeing them (not more than 17 people were watching them on the Hurly Stage), I knew I had to persue them. After their set, when they were paking up and there was like only 2 other girls off to the side my aunt (who brought me) was like "go talk to them!!" And I'm like "no, I can't!"  But finally I just told myself "just suck it up and go" so I walked over feeling in like another world, and right away the lead singer sees me aproching and walks up to me and I'm like "hi", and he says "What can I do for you?", So I make up a lame ass excuse of "Where is your tent?" and he goes "Ahh, it's REALLY far, all the way across, down yonder, so go straight down there and it's in a corner off to the side." And I politly say "Thank you, you guys are really good" and he says "thank you very much" I know it's hardly anything to brag about. But if you knew me this would be a great start. So back to the orig. topic... they were good go check them out.   I'll write more later I'm afraid the computer is gonna crash soon...
