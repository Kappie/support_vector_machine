It doesn't seem that long ago. It's crazy how things have changed since then.   Well today at 5 I'm going to my cousin Paige's soccer practice to pick her up. Then we are going back to her house to swim in the pool if it's warm out enough.  Tomorrow is one of the last days of school. Hopefully one of the best too. I am getting a sports award tomorrow night! Yay me! I have to remember to bring my camera and then put all of the pics on here the next time I go to my Dad's house. I never have anything to do at my Dad's house because I don't anyone in Yorkville so I'll have all day to post all the pics I have.  So right now I'm talking to Jon. He just invited me to his graduation party next Sunday. Yay I like parties. Hopefully Carol will go with me so I have someone to go with.  Listening to: [The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out by Less Than Jake]  You told me that your 20 years have gone by much too fast And you've been hoping this year will be better than the last You said you've been waging a war against the loneliest of nights With the strongest drinks and longest lines It's not that big of a surprise That you're feeling more dead than alive You're feeling more dead than alive    So I'll let you know If you need, somewhere to go I'll be listening when you call And I'll be there if you fall off If you need someone to believe in you, I'll let you know I will    You said the hole in your head has gotten bigger than the hole that's in your chest And you're stuck between the past and the present tense You said you've been waging a war against so many years of lies With stronger drinks and longer lines It's not that big a surprise That you're feeling more dead than alive You're feeling more dead than alive    So I'll let you know If you need, somewhere to go I'll be listening when you call And I'll be there if you fall off If you need someone to believe in, I'll let you know I will
