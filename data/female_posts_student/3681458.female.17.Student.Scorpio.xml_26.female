Went to practice this morning even though I felt like I was gonna puke as soon as Megan, and Emi jumped on my bed at 7:15 this morning. We all went to practice and ran a whole shit-load.Becca, surprisingly, didn't get on my nerves at all. I had a great time even though I was exhausted. Drew brought two of his lab puppies to practice today too. Emi and I might buy one. They are AKC registered. Man, they're friggin cute. After that, Quinton and Ashley came over. Emi, Quinton and Jared went to go do communtity service at Mrs. Snowden's house. (she's a little old lady down the street) I took a shower and went to go see Jason, and then to work. Jay came in. Interesting that "Evan" is hanging out with him now. Back when I was hanging with Jay, Evan said he didn't like him, that he couldn't stand him. Blah blah blah. But maybe that's because Evan was a fruit and was threatened by Jay, and me watching... I talked to Jay and found that he was dating Katie Dempsey. Okay, that is a little weird. Double weird. I can't imagine Evan hanging out with him. (Explains everything-love how everything comes together afterwards..) Jay also didn't know about the stuff that Evan has done to me, so I just told him to ask him. I hope Evan's embarassed. He needs to be. FUCKHEAD. Jason and I were talking last night about running. He swore taht he would get up and run this morning, but he slept in. I ragged him about it at work, so he drove home and actually ran to the outlet mall. Lol. By then I had a really bad fever and wasn't up for anything. Jason told me he's a carrier of mono last night. I don't think that's what I have though. Just probably exhaustion. So, he hung out at work for two and a half hours. He helped me wash dishes, got me some tylenol. Gosh, he's so sweet. Then, we stayed after I was done closing... won't say what we did. =) But I lose all control with him. Maybe it's because he's constantly telling me I'm gorgeous. I like all the compliments. Let's just say that Ben can't even hold a candle to him. There's absolutely no comparison.
