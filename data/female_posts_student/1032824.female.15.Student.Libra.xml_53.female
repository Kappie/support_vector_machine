     
      Everything is going to be all right, why should I not be glad? to contemplate the clouds clearing beyond the dormer window and a high tide reflecting on the ceiling.  There will be dying, there will be crying,  but there is no need to go into that. The poems will flow from the heart unbidden and the hidden source is the watchful heart. The sun will rise despite everything and the far cities are beautiful and bright. I lie here in a riot of sunlight watching the daybreak and the clouds flying, everything is going to be all right
