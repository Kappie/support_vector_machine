Proabably. Gaah.  I hate being the one with the problem. But that's what I am. the "Antisocial" one.  the dog. To come when called. Or maybe the thug, to only appear when neeeded. invisible when it suits the Brain's purposes.  I hardly know them anymore, they're all so busy and hardworking, I feel like a bum. a mooch. Nothing worth befriending at all......   And there's my little rant. and . . .Sarah? IF and I mean IF you read this, don't. . say anything. Cause it's true. And I know it is.  . . .      Lets see, whats been going on. . . I'm 17 now. Neat huh? but I've already vowed I'd have no sex till 20. My word as a Knott. Hmm . . .I'm struggling in classes, but, *laugh* Nothing new there. Probably going to drop japanese next year. I'm not talented enough to deal with a language on top of all the other crap I'll have to do.  College? *shudders* Ugh! Don't even mention it. *sigh* And thats my life. Nothing much huh?   Go on, have fun! You deserve it! I probably won't post again for a long while. See ya'll later. =^_^=
