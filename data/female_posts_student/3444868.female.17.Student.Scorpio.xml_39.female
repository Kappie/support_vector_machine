The first night we ate out they forgot to put us on the board so no one came to take our order and my uncle found mold in his sour cream. The second time we ate out we had to wait for our food for 1 1/2 hours, and when we got it it was cold. The place wasn't crowded at all though and people around us were getting fed up so they left. When we went into beaufort we ate at a place called clawsons and it was really good. Halfway through my refill of tea I looked down and saw a dead fly on top of the ice. Luckily I was using a straw. The last time we went out it wasn't really a bad thing it was just funny. We had a two hour limit to eat and leave because we were going on a ghost walk. We told the waiter and he said he'd do his best but couldn't make any promises. Well I looked in the menu and it said "This is a leisurely restaurant, so sit back and relax. We're not in a hurry so why should you be." We ended up having plenty of time to eat. After we ate we went on a ghost walk. Now tell me if it's possible for anyone to take ghost stories seriously from a girl named Charlie that wore a mini shirt and boots. She was so ditzy. Everyone was fed up with her, so the ghost walk sucked cause no one could even halfway take it seriously. That was the beach.    Theatre  Veronica and I decided to go see Mitch and Dan in a play they're in, but it started to pour when we got there so it was cancelled. We saw Mitch's car with the trunk open so we thought he might be over there. He wasn't. That was the play.    Walmart  After the play we went to walmart. That is a fun place when you act stupid and relive your childhood, which is exactly what we did. We were gonna get iron on things to make shirts. Thanks to Emilywe came up with two good ideas that were "I'm a different kind of popular. I'm not" (that's so me and veronica because we rule) and then on the back of a shirt we were gonna put "quit following me."They weremorefunny at the time. We went to look at the shoes and I got the coolest orange ones. I alsobought some buttons cause they said cool stuff.Toys are fun at walmart too. Especiallythe dancing Elmo. Anyway that was a brief description of my day.
