I also think that they are progressing well, although I think that the children still need a little more freedom in their projects.  I think that they are far more restricted than any other preschool group I have seen.  I think that for the most part the reason is because it is a home daycare and maybe Nicole just doesn't want her house messed up or too messy.  I don't know exactly what it is.  I guess it is just one of those things you just take in stride.  My sister lost her job, which kind of sucks because no one is in the position to help her out.  I hope that her temp agency is able to find her a decent job.  I know she has all that stuff she needs to pay for.  Losing a job sucks, especially when you really need it.  You know what I mean?  Oh well.  Bailey's appointment went okay, they say that it is just eczema and that it will take awhile for the color of his skin to be uniform again.  I feel bad for him, but I am pretty sure things will work out.  I have faith in most of the military docs we have had to see.  Anyway, I still have to schedule his routine cardiology appointment.  I hope things go well for him.  I have every confidence that everything will turn out okay.  Nalani is still being Nalani, trying to get into everything and touching everything she isn't supposed to.  Emily is okay, kind of moody because she didn't get to nap as much as she wanted to.  I had to ring the doorbell because I don't have a key to the house.  So she woke up and now is cranky and tired.  My mom is stressed because of the finances, but I think after we get everything settled and refinance the house, everything should be better here.  Leila made a comment...I wanted to add that I completely understand that they need their own lives, hello Leila is 24 (even though secretly she thinks she is 23) and Kathleen is 22.  It is just weird when they are not around.  HAHA  You would think I would feel more relieved...but I do miss their company, maybe I miss having random conversations.  I don't know...who really knows.  I am happy though when they are having a good time and taking a break.  Leila has worked her butt of in school and boy is she in need of a break.  Kathleen handles her stuff good with a job and school.  Then there is little ol' me...a semi-job, maybe full time...okay who am I kidding, I HAVE to be full time to keep my scholarships.  Oh the joy.  I hope to be finished soon.  We will see.  Well anyway, I have to try and organize my desk.  It is so messy and it is really starting to affect my mood...lol  Have a nice day, for those of you in CA, enjoy the sun...just don't get too much.
