(note the sarcasm) Carol ditches me for Jamie and talks about their plans right in front of me AND now she won't go to Gavin's or Jon's graduation with me!!! Ugh, thanks a lot. Now I'm going to have to go to both parties alone and not have anyone to hang out with at both.  To top that all off, Carol goes to Brantingham for two weeks right after graduation and I have nothing to do. And my mom just asked me if I wanted to go to Darien Lake during that time and she said I could invite a friend. And since Carol's going to be gone I have noone to invite.  Well, tomorrow I have the last half of the English regents in the morning. Lots o' fun.  I really want ice cream right now but I don't have anyone to go with.  Listening to: [You Own Disaster by Taking Back Sunday]  Just think of this and me  as just a few of many things  to lie around  to clutter up your shelves   And I wish you weren't worth the wait   because there's some thing's  I'd like to say to you...   I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing    I dare you to forget    those marks you left  across my neck from those nights when we were both  found at our best I could make this obvious,  and you, you could deny me all in one breath you could shrug me off  your shoulders...  I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing Cuz I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  Hey, lush, have fun It's the weekend Hey, lush, have fun  I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing I don't think that  you know what  you've been missing  Just forget me it's that simple Just forget me it's that simple
