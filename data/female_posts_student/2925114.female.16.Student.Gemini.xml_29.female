So, I got this email once, I think about...twenty minutes ago, just after my shift at work, and it was an invitation to join this blog that my pal, Vanessa, has. so, I decided to...and I don't know WHY.  well, it's cool.... but I'm confused about it. what is the real reason to have memberS of a blog? notice the plural..  well, i don't know. thats why I'm confused. HELP ME!  anyway, so, I should introduce meself here....  I'm Emily. Not Frodo. But I sort of look like him. which is not a good thing anymore. because I don't want to. But I still use the nickname.  I'm sixteen. going into grade 12 (AHHHHHHHHHHHH!) and... a long time member of the Music Room.  So I'm here....  tell me why  anyway, thats me. don't be surprised, it's just me. Emily. Not Frodo.  HEY!  ....  I forgot.  :D!
