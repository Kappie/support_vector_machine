It's kind of odd..i'm usually complaining that my mom makes me feel stupid and irresponsible...i guess this just proves that I am. Yay for me.  It seems as though some people tend to be around more when they need someone to talk to...and I'm always here to listen, but when I need listening it always seems as though they've gone away, but that's ok...i'll just strike up a conversation with myself.
