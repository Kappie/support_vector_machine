Then after school me and Braun walked to 7-11, I stole some shit then we sat in some grass and talked and ate candy lol. Then I went home. Then after supper Ashley came over and we went to Knoll for this Young Readers Appreciation thing where Lindsay was one of the 16 people (of like, 400) to read her story thinger, which was really good. I think I gave up writing for lent, then times it by like 12. I used to really love writing, but now, I'm too much of a lazy bum and I can't be bothered to write really in-depth and all vocabulary and sophisticated-like. All the people there were either 8, or older than time. I think that's what everyone is. You're either 8, or older than time. Everyone sounded mono-tone and it made me depressed and want to sleep. And I had to sit by Lindsay's fajaa! Which was not very fun because he's creepy and sounds like a STALKER, and the only time I ever met him before (I think) was at the "drug meeting".   God. It is. So bloody hot in my house.  And  we have air conditioning. I'm like the only one who uses it. Christ. Although, part of the reason that I'm melting with heat would probably be because I wear nothing but hoodies, jeans, and sometimes sweatpants. All year round. But I'm quite alright with my choice of apparel. See! I know big words too! I play PICTIONARY! Not really. I don't see how that game has  anything  to do with dictionary. Oh wait. Picture. Dictionary. Picture dictionary. PICTIONARY! I've gone too far down this page. Too lazy to use backspace, so just deal with my mistake. This is basically what all the conversations in my head are like. Wow. I went from how hot it is, to clothes, so pictionary. Who'd a thunk it?! ...What the fuck. :|  Buuuut my time is almost up and my mom wants to play games and have a jolly old time. Erm. Yess. Well. Bye.   -Joebie
