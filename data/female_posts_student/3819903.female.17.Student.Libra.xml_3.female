Reason for my absurd wake up time, was to go and meet my golf teammate from Edgewood at 10:00.  Shes really cool, by the way things look right now, I'm pretty sure there are only gonna be 3 "talkative" people on the team...Gretchen, Ali, and myself.  Wow, hopefully we can convert these introverted people to outgoing, un shy girls.  So we walked around the mall for a while, bought a couple things, then she had to go to the work--where she has an internship--and works with dumbasses.  Not even doing anything that involves her major...which is a little redundant!      Plans were originally to go and golf with Kevin, and Simone, but...We took forever at the mall, and they scheduled the tee time without any consent of mine, of 1:30, which is too late, seeming as though i work at 3:15.  So it was a bummer, but no loss, there is plenty of time left to golf this summer.  But it was kind of cool to hear the Simone was going too, because thats 2 good golfers, I'm used to playing with at the most 1!  So, I guess I will need to plan another outing and tell kevin to invite him, I wanna see what type of game he has!      So that plan failed, now I had all the time in the world to relax before  2.5 Hours of Work  which is a little pointless, all we do is read magazines all day, and watch people we know come into the hospital... pointless.   Worked with Emily, the coolest person to work with, she is so funny, she has the most random things to say!  Work= kaity bored    Then...went home to eat some great Mexican Food...yummy.    Retreated to abby's House to watch Havana Nights--Gay Movie!  So apparently I missed the memo, about bringing the lap top, cause Abby, Nicole, and Amanda all brought theirs!  So I used Abby's Desktop to Chit Chat with the World.  By the end of the night, Kraus, Cal, and Brian showed up, where I bitched out Brian for talking about his dick so much, and that talking about it is definitley not going to get him layed, like he hopes.  As Nicole said, "we like men with confidence Brian, and you obviously don't have any if you're talking about your penis!"  So yeah after we bitched him out for lying so much, and trying to get women to suck his dick...we told him, Brian you're going to have no lady if you are so arrogant!  Damn, I thought that when high school ended--so did the drama?!  Apparently I was incorrect!  So, beside our little mishap with immature boys, we all kinda left, because abby has to get her beauty sleep to get up early tomorrow...$10 says she isn't asleep yet!  But it was fine, the boys were off to play some Halo, and the girls just went home!    So after my, semi-eventful afternoon/evening, I came home to watch some Old School with the Bro, and type at the same time!  Ok..Will Farrell's Buttocks is calling me! Adios Friends
