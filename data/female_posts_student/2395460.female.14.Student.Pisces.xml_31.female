Mongrel dogs who long for poodle trims?   I think the next big thing is   trash  . Of course, Ebay taught us years ago that one person's trash is another person's treasure but now recycling has become an actual art form.  urlLink  Star Trash  , an exhibit in New York City by French photojournalists Pascal Rostain and Bruno Mouron, featured  urlLink Larry King's diapers , Arnold Schwarzenegger's Cuban cigar wrappers, and Lactaid from the Banderas-Griffith household.    urlLink  Mongo: Adventures In Trash  , by Ted Botha, profiles all kinds of mongo seekers from the homeless searching for  food to book lovers hunting for rare first editions. Botha himself furnished his own apartment with things he found discarded on Manhattan streets.  James Scurlock's short documentary film,  urlLink  Parents of the Year  , which just screened at  urlLink AFI Silverdocs , chronicles the lives of Rogelio and Yolanda Garcia, a Mexican immigrant couple living in California, who put their children through college by foraging through dumpsters.  Parents of the Year  will be airing on HBO later this summer.  All of this says a lot about our culture of rampant and easily disposable consumerism (of which I am a huge participant and inciter) and I hope will lead to more than just lurid reality shows, but do be careful about what you throw away because Rostain and Mouron are going after the "regular people" next.
