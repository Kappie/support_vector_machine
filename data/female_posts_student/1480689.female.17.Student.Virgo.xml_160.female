I suppose I could cater to them. I could spend a day without singing, but why stop there? I won't speak, write, sing, or sign. Hell, screw one single day, I'll go for a month… a year. Again, why stop there? I could start a revolution. A rebellion, if you will, for people who share that one desire… the desire of a world basking in an awkward silence. I could find all of them. I'd gather them into one giant room. No invitations will be needed. They'll be inexplicably drawn to it by an inextricable force. Little will be heard as they shuffle through the aisles, only the sound of pins cascading over a balcony. They'll fill up seats by the thousands, countless names on a clipboard. And when my hall is filled to the brim, I'll exit ever so quietly… and I'll blow that fucker to pieces.    "charles" affholder rocks.
