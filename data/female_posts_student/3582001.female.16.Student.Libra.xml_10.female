JACOB  decided, while I was gone (I don't know the whole story...yet), to go back to Kari and  not  tell me. So I had to find out  myself  when I went to band practice last night.  KARI  talks about me during practice, but tries to hide it; I'm smarter than  that , young lady.  JOSH  is being a fucking dumbass, yeah, so he got a job, so what? Doesn't really make me think any higher of him after all, good for him though, glad he's happy. Blah, blah, blah. Yeah, so, guess I'm all by myself again. But that's okay. I've decided, now, that I need some time alone. I think Jake does, too. But, noooooo. He's gotta go back to  her . And if she hurts Jake again, that's just too bad for him. I  know  it will happen. Prove me wrong, Kari. Prove me wrong!
