Now I can look back at it and laugh at myself for being such a doofus brain. But thanks to that incident, she has agreed to make mass dance period a little slacker for Sec. 4s. After talking to her today, I realised thatshe is actually a rather friendly person to get along with, not at all like our stereotyped perception. She was sincerely putting in the effort to understand the problems we're facing. She even took time (half an hour into our Lit. lesson to be exact. --don't be mistaken, I'm thankful for that)explaining to us the rationale behind implementing things the way they are, and gave us the assurance that she'd rectify the problems that we've brought up, likeLizâ€™s cca issue. I think she now knows more about us in that short half an hour session than what Mrs. See knows about us in 2 years. Way to go, they should organise more of such 'talk shows'.
