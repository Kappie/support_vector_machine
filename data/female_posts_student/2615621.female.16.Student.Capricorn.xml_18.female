I then start talkin to lorne and we realized maybe this date which we were both dragged into wouldnt be all that bad. I start freakin out thinkin these things 1- hes gonna he really butt ass ugly and i wont care if he likes me or not (i wish he would have like cuz its fun having people like u) or 2- hes really super ass hot and he wont like me (most guys im into dont like me..lol) well kristen and i go to the mall and theres josiah and lorne. OMG lorne is FREAKIN HOT. and i was like..oh shit, hes not gonna like me what so ever. Josiah is freakin butt ass ugly, but hey, kristen asked for it and she got it. josiah nudegd Lorne and said "there she is..thats julia..go get her boy" and smiled at him and lorne returned with his lil grin. I really didnt know if that was a good thing or bad..but it pissed kristen off. Kristen was really jealous over lorne and hung out with him just as much as i did. We started goin around, me actually quiet for the first time because i froze up. Lorne was really nice and we laughed a lil here and there and maybe exchanged 5 sentences. WHOA!! i know. It was all because of this dude that josiah knew that kept following us around and freakin us out. His name was Hobo Jones. lmao He was sooo stoned it wasnt funny. Now, how bad can it get?? A  hot guy, an ugly guy, and a stoner with 2 lil sweet girls. haha yeah. exactly. so we left. oh and by the way, we stayed there a total of 35mnis exactly. THAT SUCKED. i wanted to hang out with lorne sooo bad even though i figured i didnt have a chance. WELL like every fairytale theres a twist. Kristens cell rang and it was the guys. they were really mad at Hobo (aka HOMO) and felt really bad about him not leaving us alone. We told them we would talk to them later. We got home after runnin around 601 and lorne called askin for me. We talked for about 2 hours on and off so kristen and josiah could talk also. I would talk to joe whenever kris had to go pee or something and he would tell me how much lorne was talkin about me and stuff...yay! i didnt know what to really say. When asked if lorne had a chance with me, i said no duh of course! and well joe then said "well when i asked him if he was intrested in u he said HELL YEA" lol haha ok, for a girl who get few to none guys, that was good, especially one that i liked back. The guys then went to get on the computer and we got on also. We didnt talk for long, but lorne changed the background to the falling hearts and when u buzz it makes a kissin noise and he kept doin it over and over again sayin that he was mad cuz he didnt get a kiss at the mall. Yeah..well...thats kinda weird with Hobo Jones gettin between u whenever u and ur dream guy get close...yeah Hobos suck major ass. The falling hearts were sweet. We then decided the computer was boring and he called again. Kristen was jealous again (letting me know this--she was a real bitch about it by sayin "gosh if it wasnt for me u wouldnt have met lorne") and she said "havent u talked to julia enough for one nite" that kinda pissed me off..but he said all he wanted to do was say goodnite so she basically threw her phone at me and said THERE  SAY GOODNITE!! but this goodnite convo turned into a full out 3hr one with kristens eyes rolling the whole time. She has this thing about puttin me down in front of people i or we like. She wouldnt stop callin me a whore and a bitch and a prep in front of lorne..some friend huh... I finally convinced lorne he needed to go to bed, but only after he asked me if we could do somethign this coming weekend and if i would go with him to his V-day dance. OMG!! lol i was like..thrilled. So i said yeah, i would be happy to. Josiah said he feel asleep with a smile on his face..awww. Well, kris and joe talked for like ever and i was basically asleep through their whole convo. We got off the phone about 4-5am. It was crazy. Then i get a phone call tonite from kristen saying "joe called me askin for ur number cuz lorne was about to kill him if he didnt find out what it was so we gave him ur number and he said he would call when he got home tonite from his cousins" OMG what am i suppose to say on the phone to lorne?! haha like when we talked at kristens, she was always doin something in the background we could laugh about and all..not alone with lorne on the phone! AHH lol Well, sure enough, 30mins later, he called. I programed his number into the caller id so it would show up LORNE when he called just like all my other friends. I pick up and he says.."hey is julia there?" andi  was like..hey! in my very fake happy tryin not to show im nervous voice. We talked about all kinds of things from my pet bird to cars, its always cars--he bulids muscle cars. Then i tell him i have to go finisih my world map and he tells me bye and that he'll get on the computer. Kristen then calls like seconds later and says..I JUST TALKED TO LORNE JULIA!!! and was like gettin details from both of us..ok thanks kris, but no thanks. He had told kris i need to stop be so nervous when he talked to me!! HAHA i wasnt nervous i swear!! yeah right...lol I denied it of course. Then i got online and we talked some more..about cars and stuff. lol he asked me if we were offically "talking" u know the step before dating..wow...lol ive made it this far in less than 2 days. he then tells me he "really really likes" me and how he feels like hes known me all his life because we're so much alike. :D yay! He then tells me im hot...ooookkk...hot, no. not me dammit. lol if u want hot, look at katie mckee, look at star miller, look at all the really pretty girls who get all the guys begging at their feet. Julia=Hot? no. i hate that word. i mean, yeah i was glad to hear he though me of all people was hot..but i would have been a lil better off with "pretty" or something a lil more mild. HOT?! NO. Just because idk..im insecure. Well, he called me hot like 5 times. He tells me hes crazy about me and how we need to go 4wheelin at his house soon and how so i dont mess up my clothes i can wear his old ones and mess up his. lol how sweet. a guy who knows i wont get muddy for nuttin is tryin to get me to go by offering his clothes haha. So i say yeah. Just because it gives us time to be together and its something he enjoys. A friend of mine from central then pops up..its meghan a girl who will always look out for others and tell you the truth. She tells me "a bunch of my friends dated lorne and all the sudden he just broke up with them and they got hurt, so i wouldnt date him" that scared me. I dont want to fall in "love" or totally dig him and he dump me outta the blue. I ask him the longest hes been with a girl and he says 8 months. Thats not too bad, so i decide im still gonna go on with him. He tells me how his last gf cheated on him and all this stuff and how he doesnt really like his girl hanging out with her guy friends alone. i have tons of guy friends...its like me and 2 other girls and then the rest are guys in my lil "group" . He knows that. He gets insanely jealous joe told me and will throw a fit. I can see where hes coming from, but what lorne doesnt know wont hurt his pretty lil face. haha i just wont metion my guy friends to him. He's already mentioned meeting my mom..gosh, couldnt he wait?! lol So, hes comin over friday nite with joe and kris to watch some movies. I thought we could just make other plans because he said he has to work (doin car stuff--he has a business) but then he decided he just wasnt gonna work because he wanted to come over and see me. AWWWW how sweet. So, i figured i would rent like 2 or 3 movies and we woulc hang out..but hes determined to make me watch 2 of his fave movies that ive never seen. lol so there goes my movies. He's bring 2 so i guess i will go pick up Donnie Darko LMAO. That might freak him out. haha It's a really cool movie though. Kris is comin over early to help me go rent a movie and get ready. Then lorne starts talkin about more kissing. lol He brings up that he didnt get his kiss so i send him one :-* and he says u forgot the :p lol yeah ok lorne. he has to have tounge?! umm..hey i thought that came at least after the like..5th kiss...haha at least. I really dont want a full out spit exchange when he comes over friday. So i guess i'll just drop the hint i like the sweet lil kisses. haha he takes hints well, thank god. He then asked if i didnt want him to kiss me. HELLO?! HES FREAKIN HOT. so i say.."haha i dont mind" and he said "ok i will then :D"  hes so cute. haha It's like he knows just what to say and what to do and he shows his emotions well with the admitting he likes me and stuff. Oh, and yeah he has a tattoo. lol its of a knights shield with a helmet (the helmet has his itinals on it MLB) and 2 swords going through the helmet all in front of flames. Now, i havent seen this tattoo..but ok. lol He does have really pretty eyes and WHITE STRAIGHT TEETH!! yay! lol And he works out too!! haha The only thing that bothers me is when i bring him to hang out with my friends..now, knowing lorne, and the type of guy he is (saying looks dont matter, but since im "hot" he gets a "pretty damn good bonus") he prob wont even mention katie..but katie has this way of gettin anything she wants..i dont want him to look at katie and wish i was like that...i dont want him to look at lauren or ne of my friends and think that. I know i know...it may seem stupid, but thats me. Well, i had to finish up my 20%max done world map. It only had the contients outlined..(damn that reminds me i gotta write a pantomine for tomorrow during 2nd period)  and i couldnt finish it while i was talkin to him. When lorne talks to me its not like he'll say one thing and then minimize it and talk to other people..its an on going thing. which is good i guess, but it didnt give me a chance to work. so by 11 i had to tell him goodnite and he told me to call him when i got home from school, i said i would..and i prob will. Nuttin is better than hearing "goodnite hun :-*" from a guy u really like. I do go through phrases where i will like a guy for a week and im over it, but Lorne is different. With lorne its like..its going somewhere. I know we'll date. He told me we would. YAY OOH and his little cousin added me and popped up saying "hey lornes gf" haha it was soo cute. Lorne told me to go invisible haha So we both went invisible, no tellin what he told his lil cousin. haha The word "girlfriend" has come outta his mouth 3 times in the last 2 days about me. So.."talkin" doesnt mean gf/bf..it means almost there...soo maybe we're REALLY almost there!! like really soon i'll be his offical GIRLFRIEND. damn i hope so. lol I'm fuckin tired of being single and hes a really awesome guy. Ok..i've spent exactly 41 minutes writting this and im sure lauren will have fun reading it..haha uh sorry hun!! lol adios!
