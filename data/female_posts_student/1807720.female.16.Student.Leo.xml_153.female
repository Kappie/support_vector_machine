Mr. B told us each time what we could change or do differently.  So we tried it again and did something differently, but then he like took me to a corner and gave me more suggestions.  Then he was like "Vanessa sit in a chair over there and watch."  So I had to watch him do the scene.  It made me feel like he thought I was incapable of it or something like that.  It made me feel bad.  Maybe I just took constructive criticism the wrong way.  I mean I don't think that he thinks I am incapable, so I probably just took it the wrong way.  Bio was ok, except for the fact that I have difficulty reading graphs.  I mean I don't want to seem stupid or dumb, but like when I asked her about it, she explained it and well I still didn't understand.  Thank goodness I finished the assignment, finally!  And that is over.  Not to mention my head was pounding again.  I get headaches all the time now.  It was ok thought after I ate some lunch.  I think my body like needs certain foods or something, and if it doesn't get it, I get sick.  English was actually really good, and I got tons of work done!  Then in active living ALL the guys wanted ME on their team for floor hockey.  ME!  They were arguing over which team gets "Work Horse."  Some of the guys were like "whoa she's good" when we were playing, and another one was like "I commend you for what you can do, cause you're really good."  Another person was like "I can't get passed her, she blocks my shots before I can even get a chance to shoot."  Someone else was like "Hey she switched positions, she's playing offence.  She's got the whole package."  LOL!!!  OMG all those comments made me feel so good.  They made up for a lack of happiness throughout my day.  What started out as a bad day, turned out to be pretty good afterall!  I feel really good right now and I am ready to review some Bio for the quiz tomorrow.  And today I recall myself saying that I wasn't smart.  Well you know what I am a hard worker and I AM SMART.  If I wasn't smart, then I wouldn't be on the honor roll.  I AM SMART, and I should not put myself so low, as to say that I am not.  Cleary I AM.
