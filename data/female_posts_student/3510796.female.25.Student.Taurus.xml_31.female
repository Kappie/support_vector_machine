I got  Fight For Your Mind  from Sap in the mail last week.  What a wonderful CD.  I knew it would be, Ben Harper is amazing.  The only thing about Ben is, he reminds me of this guy I dated last summer.  He got me into Ben and everytime I hear some Harper, I think of this guy.  Not that I want to be with him again, but it just makes me think about how cool he was and how I've met someone almost exactly like him.  The only thing that they don't have in common is their age.  More often then not, music reminds me of good times I've had with good friends, which is why this Friday is what I've been needing the past few weeks.  Even though most of my friends don't even like DMB, each and every song means something to me, not in the 'girlie way', but just that music is music and you either feel it or you don't.    Its either love or hate, I can't find in between  ---------------------------------------------------------------- If you've been reading every post and following my 'blog addiction' comments, you have to hear this.  Recently I came across  urlLink this blog  about this chick teasing her boyfriend, I mean, she blogs about other stuff as well, but the title makes you assume she's all about the teasing.  Now, if I were smart, I would have started a blog about this, but then again, I have no one at the moment I am teasing.  This also makes me think about all the guys who read her blog and what they must be thinking about(not making this up, I've read some of the comments). Then, of course I check back to the  urlLink sexaholics  blog and he posted 20 questions, and if  you answer yes to any of these, you may have a problem.   I will not say how many I answered yes to, if I did at all.  All I know is, if I'm a Lion, I need some meat!   Wish there was something I, could say or do I can resist anything but, the temptation from you   I told Sod I was going to blog about 'that kind of stuff', stuff like the tease blogs about, but I don't think it will help in my 12-step program.  I can already hear the word relapse in my mind.  As of right now, Grey has 0% self control.   ------------------------------------------------------ Rain?!?  This is not good. Kids wanted to go to the water park again today.  I guess it really isnt a 'water park'.  Just a cement circle in the middle of a lawn that has high powered water sprinklers. Yes, I have water babies.  Sophia especially.  She cant stay away from water.  If this means filling up cotton ball bags, giving her barbies a bath, or just sitting in a sandbox/mudbox one Saturday afternoon. It even includes walking  this close  to the edge of the pool.  Keeps me on my toes!      PEACE.LOVE.DMB.   |2 days!|
