Since a train seemed out of the question, the canal was calling me.   I get dressed for it, pack a bag, and make a plan.  As I head out my stepmom was in a very sour mood. She went off on us and I decided to stay in and purge my anger on cleaning every square inch of my bedroom. That did not last long. I could not tolerate being here. So instead, I set off on my walk. As I went on my way I decided that since I got and hour and 45 minutes worth of sleep and had nothing to eat or drink, that I should probably get something. On my way, the stepmom catches up and apologizes so we are all good again. Lunch, la ti da, canal. Walked it. Saw a lot of wildlife:  Cardinals, blue jays, pigeons, snakes, turtles, fishies, ducks, butterflies, dragonflies, people...lol  I was being dumb and decided to poke the snake with a stick. It did nothing so "Hmmm, maybe it is dead," thinks J9...   ::poke::   J9 discovered the snake was, in fact, NOT DEAD. How one may ask? It becomes fairly apparent after it lashes out at you. Yeah, go J9...you are a winner...lol  One of the two highlights of the walk was talking to a very amiable older gentleman who had spent a good amount of time on the canal. According to him (his name is Dick, by the way), I am very serious about my walking lol.   The second, was laying down underneath the train bridge. I waited for the train that I could have potentially been on to pass directly overhead and then stared at the water. I saw a few fish come up to feed which was pretty nifty.   Anyways, after getting home I collapsed feeling very out of shape. My ankles feel as though they are ready to break and the pads of my feet are burning. The worst part...I do not think that I surpassed 15 sit-ups because I was just that wiped.   As soon as I recover a bit I will probably clean a bit more and head out again.   I have no idea if I have plans or not tonight. Oh well. I should probably just finish my room so that I have a place to sleep tonight...assuming that I do that anyways.   Well, I shall end this post right about...  no no no a little more to the right                                                            There you go                                                            Right here.  See y'all later lol
