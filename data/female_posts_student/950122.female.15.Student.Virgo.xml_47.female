My connection is never stable now-a-days. Damn... It pisses me off. >  Today we went to the UFO Church in U.P. I met Janelle there. Then we went to Greenhills and stayed there for 5 hours. 0_o It was so boring. My mom was so overwhelmed by the jewelry she was buying for her business. Ugh. I wonder if she'll ever get tired of looking at things that sparkle. >
