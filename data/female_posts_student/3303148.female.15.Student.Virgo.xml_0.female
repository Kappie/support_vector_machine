So today I am going to Reader's Theater rehearsals for an hour, and then I was thining about just taking the bus over to Bill's from there. I was going to run over to Blockbuster and get a movie for us, but I only have 3 dollars. I hope that they have a few there already.   Spiderman 2 comes out tomorrow at midnight, and Bill and I lus Pat and Leslie (his girlfriend) will all be going. I still haven't really met or been introduced to Leslie, and I guess she told Pat that I glared at her. Eek! I didn't glare at her, and she sounds kind of interesting, so I don't want her to think that I am rude. Oh well, I guess. Back to Spiderman 2. It's going to be so awesome. I mean, it really is the best comic book movie out there. And there are going to be 3 of them. I think that they cast the movie so well, and th special effects are awesome. Bill is even more excited than I am, which is predictable. I mean, he actually reads the comics, and has been for a long time. He is like a little boy that is going to off to camp. He keeps telling me that he can't wait for it to come out, he just can't wait. And then I told him that it is soon and that he is going to have a wait a bit.   So yea, that's really the highlight of my day/week/summer so far.  Oh, except for the fact that I practically got the job as a lifeguard!! I got a call back saying that I had passed the interview process and that they wanted me to come for a swim test. And that I can definitely pass.   Ack... I just heard voices and noises... but I don't know whether it is coming from my house or from out my window...  No one is home but me... ok, I am thouroughly freaked out. Oh god. Hmm... there is probably no one in my house. God damnit. I'm in a towel though... I should probably get dressed.   More later,  VenusPanties
