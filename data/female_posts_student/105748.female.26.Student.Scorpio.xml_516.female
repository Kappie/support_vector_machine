I was stuck at work doing overtime.  GRRRR.  Dot taped the show, but its not the same as being there during the show.  AURGGH.  If my boss will only hire more workers to cover 2nd shift.  Sigh,  My life is like a newspaper stand... IT's got ISSUES!    Ching, I am thinking of moving my website to Goldensushi can your server handle about 2 mb of stuff?    More to come....
