This has got me thinking, though - no one really writes letters anymore.  This was one of the thoughts that ran through my mind last night as I was lying in bed unable to sleep.  I thought about my dear friend Christina, who is probably going to be starting graduate school at Vanderbilt in the Fall - and how I was going to have to harrass her with loads of emails since I won't get to see her on a regular basis anymore, Nashville being a long way from New York City.  I've been called a fairly good email writer by some - it's probably only because I truly enjoy writing and it is how I communicate most effectively, but even though I think email has in some ways revived the writing of letters to a degree, I think that people use it more as a quick way to get information to others rather than a meaningful channel of communication and correspondence.  Unless of course, you're me.    But I fear that all these collections of letters that are constantly being published will one day die out completely, because people don't really do them any more.  I write long emails to keep in touch with friends and acquanitances, but I don't even save any of them.  I think that's why email will never be like letters - there is something very impermanent about all things related to cyberspace:  links die, email addresses change, and since it is an informal and anonymous way of staying in touch, people tend to lose touch easier, especially if there is no connection between them outside in the "real" world.    I think it's sad that people don't write letters any more.  Then again, I'm a bit much on the nostalgia, and often say I was born in the wrong time.  So this may just be a part of that.  But I think that if people wrote more letters, they'd have no other choice than to become better writers.    On a related note, I think I'm going to start writing open letters to various people - people I like, or people I don't, famous people or someone I saw on the subway who interested me - and putting them here for all (if all is the four people who read this blog - and the occasional stragglers who stumble upon it) to read.  No idea when or who...it'll be random I'm sure.  I'd ask for suggestions, but judging how well the epic poem thing went...well, perhaps I'll just handle it on my own.
