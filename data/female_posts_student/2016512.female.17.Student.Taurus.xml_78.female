I find it really ironic that i got a nintendo. ever since i was little i wanted one, but my dad was always so strongly against it. and now i have one and i don't like it. odd.   i think i'm going to Software Etc. or something like that. i'd like to get an X-Box so that i can play dvds and stuff. we'll see what the price comparison is. i have a feeling that the game cube is cheaper.   to top it all off i woke up to Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da this morning and i can't get it out of my head. *wah* it's so annoying. i love the beatles but it definately isn't one of their better songs.   Is losing brain cells really a bad thing, -Betso
