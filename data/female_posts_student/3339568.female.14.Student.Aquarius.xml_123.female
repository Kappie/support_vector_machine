I dont understand. it's totally a church thing If you don't include me Which is kinda hard Because I know exactly what happened so everyone bugs me about telling them! Argh! meh it's funny. And its fun to see people speculating bout what happened, and being sure they know until they figure out they actually don't Like T1 last night. ha. that was funny. i sure changed his mind
