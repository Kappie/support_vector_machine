This brings up the interesting question of whether or not their phone calls are being listened in on as well? I was a little upset that I wasn’t able to say good-bye and I love you to Jesse. I miss him and I guess I am going to have to plan our phone calls a little better from now on and only talk about important things and make sure to start every conversation with my I love you’s and such, just in case our calls get disconnected abruptly. I guess this whole thing is going to take some time getting used to. He is my husband; I shouldn’t have to follow rules and regulations to be able to speak with him. It’s just silly, or at least I think so.   Last night I had a dream. I was at this store looking at new clothes and trying them on for Jesse. It felt so real. I could hear his voice telling me that I looked beautiful. It made me feel good to hear that again. The rest of the details to my dream are blurred but that fact stuck out the most.   I guess one of the things I miss about having Jesse home, is hearing him say how beautiful I am to him. Kuwait is just so far away to begin with. It doesn’t help when you are missing the person who is there.  I am sure the time will go by quick enough, but any time away from Jesse just plain sucks.
