You all have total creative freedom. Write/say whatever you don't mind the rest of the world knowing about you !     We didn't have any money, Net, so my engagement ring cost hardly anything.. I cherish it nonetheless. To me, it's the thought that counts.. Besides, I wasn't even expecting an engagement ring at all.. So it was a pleasant surprise.    Brian used to work at a video store !  That's probably one of the reasons that he enjoyed  Clerks  so much.
