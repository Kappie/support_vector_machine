I think the judges pick the person they're going to like before the show even starts and then they gang up on the others no matter how well they sang. Biatches. Hmm i'm really sick of english with mr. cook he is so frustrating. Nothing is ever good enough. Dammit. Another night spent doing work for that class. Nigga please! School really needs to end cuz summer is the hot shit! Ooo but prom is next friday and that shall be fun to the super mega max with justin! Uh oh i better still have the shiny tickets...! Omg my sister just lost a tooth. She is 14! Whaaat! Ahh guess the tooth fairy will come give her a whole dollar, wooo! She's cool. That's really weird. I found all my teeth under my parents sink when i was like 7. Haha, ok well i'm sick of typing think i'll go listen to some country my new fav thing! byebye love
