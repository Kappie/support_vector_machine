Either way I'm feeling something tingly here. All kinds of new paths are presenting themselves at this very moment, well, maybe not, but I'd sure like to look at it that way. Kinda like earlier today... it was quite boring ya know, all I did was clean my car. But you put a whole new spin on it when you mention that I nearly killed myself with Raid because my car happend to be infested with angry wasps and ugly big nasty spiders, then its an adventure. Made for TV movie I tell ya. But I don't know what the heck I'm talking about, I'm too darn tired. I think some sleep ought to do me some good. So, adios amigos, the village idiot James must run off to bed now.
