I'm not a perfect person As many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears Thats why i need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is You [x4]  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you  basta its great!pakingan nyo sya hehehe and d other one na gusto ko luma nah sya revive lang po ata How Did You Know by Gary V. inlove ulit kyo e2 song 4 u hehhee    How Did You Know Gary V.  How Did You Know   I remember so well  The day that you came into my life  You asked for my name  You had the most beautiful smile    My life started to change  I'd wake up each day feeling alright  With you right by my side  Makes me feel things will work out just fine    How did you know  I needed someone like you in my life  That there's an empty space in my heart  You came at the right time in my life    I'll never forget  How you brought the sun to shine in my life  And took all the worries and fears that I had  I guess what I'm really trying to say  It's not everyday someone like you comes my way  No words can express how much  I love you.
