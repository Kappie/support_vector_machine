But I think that must be where he has gone. Um, nice weather today, sat in the garden and did some revision for about 3 hours, the most I've done yet!! Weather was nice but now it's come over a bit cloudy, hence me being on the PC now! Got to go and pick Nancy up from Guide camp later, so the peace in our house will be broken! aww!  I'm off cos I'm eternally bored. Bye bye!
