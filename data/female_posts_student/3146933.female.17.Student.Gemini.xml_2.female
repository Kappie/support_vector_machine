I was so scared to go up to him at the memory day thing and so I was like right behind him and I looked at Adrienne and I was like "i can't" and she tapped him on the back and pointed at me! lmao! omg! and he hugged me...i cried so much that day. I started cryin  SO  bad when Matt's pictures came up on the screen..that was the first time I cried...then I finally got calmed down after a few minutes and then Monica's pictures came up and I didn't expect to see my pawpaw but she had a pic of her and him on there and omg i broke down again..ugh so sad. then a pic of me and her when we were little :D we were so cute. and holdin hands in our lil dresses. but anyways, ok..yeah it was terrible. It was too sad..I wouldn't go thru it again. But at least Matt hugged me, it made my day. Anyways so I get home and I talk to Matt and we're not doin anything so we do somethin together. It's like we were never even apart...well ok kinda. We talked a lot. He's crazy. I love him with all of my heart, still. I'm out of school. Today was my last day. English exam? freakin hard. Math exam? freakin hard. I hate exams. But anyways, so I'm a senior now. One more year. It's sure gonna fly. My birthday's Monday *excited* I hope I see *matt*
