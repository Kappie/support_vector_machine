So my dad was like wow they are having alot of school supply sales ...I was like your point. So next thing I notice we are at the store..Wahoo ...I dont want to think about school! Anyways we got all my stuff. Binder, Folders,pens,pencils whatever. But it was cool because I didnt have to find stuff that was picked over. But its wierd is summer over ..or is there still sum left? Yeah know I am going into 8th exciting ..but before ya know it ..HIGHSCHOOL! Why when you hit 5th/6th grade the year is like gone. These days memories seem so limited. I donno I am just a kid but I feel like I am being pushed into adulthood to quickly!. Choose, good and bad. I donno Life  tears ya apart! But ya always have friends! I am so happy I have such great friends to help me though school and this rough time that we call the teenage years!
