Visually-speaking, most of the sites are distressingly dull.  Where's the color?  The marketing savvy?  What's the point of making my commercial site usable if the site isn't the least bit sticky?    I'm dismayed by this.  We've all labored through sites that are visually pleasing at the cost of functionality and vice-versa.  But I expected more from folks who make their living by being usability prophets.  Perhaps some could use a crash-course in marketing. Frumpiness is not necessitated by usability.  Surely there's middle ground between usability and style.    Style is subjective and, though to a lesser extent, so is usability.  Logic tells me there's room for improvement, and, yes, that there is a common ground... now only to find it.
