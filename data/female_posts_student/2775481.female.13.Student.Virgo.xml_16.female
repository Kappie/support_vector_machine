Way to many to count lol! Omg its a miracle marissa remembered her purse lol   Any way in English class that was madd fun when we were supposed to be reading we all were passing notes and marissa was stupid enough to pass her money I can't believe tamrah gave it back to her lol.   In science it smelt soooooooooo bad like fish in there and we looked at the table and there was a note and it said Ryan I told you to keep your legs closed!! eewww --- turns out there was an octopus in the sink or what ever and I had to help clean up a sink I'll tell you rubbing alcohol and fish don't smell good at all I like gagged to death omg how could Ms marioenze deal with that smell all day!   Well I have nothing else to write so come back lata bye
