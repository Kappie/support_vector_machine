We get a weekly schedule on Saturdays.  Considering we had one meeting, this week goes as follows: Mon- 20 min, Tues- 15 min, Wed-rest, Thurs- 20 min, Fri-rest.  The thing I don't like about this weekly schedule thing, is that you don't know how long the long run is.  I am assuming since we did 2 miles on Saturday we will be adding a mile a week, so this week we will probably run 3 miles.    For tonight 3.3 miles I went running with Shania Twain.  I usually don't like running with music, but thought I'd give it a try to see how it went.  My running partner didn't call me back so I did a solo run.  It was a nice night it was pretty clear and a little breezy.  I went running with a early 90's portable CD player, the size of an 8 Trak. It was a bit bulky to run with and it skipped quite a bit, but I stayed on pace, and seemed to have ran faster than normal.  I did like running with music but in order for me to continue with it I need an new updated version of an 8 trak.  If anyone has any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in Advanced.   Quote:  The only person that can push yourself, is YOU!
