I found out that I am going to have surgery and I am scared about it. All of my friends are at home and my sisters just don't understnad. My youngest sister is pregnant and has been really hard to live with she thinks that the world owes her and doesn't let anyoone get close to her. She has some real anger issues and has a bad attitude about everything. My other sister is really lazy and selfish and lies all the time. She refuses to get a job because she can stay at home and live off of my parents. They are both mad at me for coming home for six weeks because I love the lord and have a better way of looking at what life has to offer instead of being angry that I have been sick for a year and have to have surgery. God is so amazing and has so much to offer and it hurts to see my sisters rresist him when I know that he can make them so much happier. I have never met two such unhappy people.
