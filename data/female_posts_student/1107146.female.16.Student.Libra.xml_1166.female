Anyway, Lindsey, if you want to come to the play, or anyone else for that matter, its at FRA, in the middle school, which is the first building you see at the main enterence.  It shows Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  The first three dates, the show time is at 7:00 PM, and Sunday is a matinee at 3:00.  So, if anyone wants to come, I don't know what date I'm going.  You guys can work that out and I'll get tickets and stuff.  Just tell me the date and I can do it.  Choir is a stupid thing.  I hate it.  I've never had good choir expiriences, which is why, Lindsey, I am not joining Sonshine.  And latin, well, I don't know much about it, so...yeh...well, I just got a Food Network Newsletter, so I'm going to be my incredibly geeky self and read it, and maybe save a few recipes. Oh and congrats Will, for placing 1st.
