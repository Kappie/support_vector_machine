I still am having a lot of lows in my life right now, but things are gradually looking on the up-and-up, so yay for that!  Region band this weekend.  Blah.  I didn't like the conductor very much.  And it just wasn't exciting at all- thank goodness for Leah and being able to pass notes to each other!  What else... I went to Arby's and Main Event on Thursday after school with Charles, Leah, Danny, Kevin, and Ross.  Very fun, though we stayed at Main Event for a loooong time... bowling and playing video games and everything.  Saw Vivian, Travis, Eric, Tim, and Ryan there.  I miss you, Vivian, and I wish you could come to San Antonio with me!  Friday, I bought Electronic Clue and Charles and I played it- I really like it, except it's more fun with more than 2 people.  Then we went to region band, and afterwards, went to Chili's with a whole bunch of people.  Apparently, most people are in agreement that Leah's laugh and my laugh come together and you can hear tuning beats in the combination.  You guys are so mean!  Anyways, Saturday was spent at region band... Charles and I joined Chelsea and Ross at Ross's house during our dinner break and we played Electronic Clue and ate pizza before heading back to the high school for the concert.  The concert went fairly well- I was just thrilled that it was over!  We went to Marble Slab for some naturally yummy ice cream and then went over to Mallory Golding's house for a little bit.  Aaaaand that brings us to today- Sunday.  I went to church this morning, then taught Sunday School, and then came home and sat around for a looooong time.  I watched a lot of TV (I'm so lazy!) and then Charles could do stuff, so we went over to Kevin's because he was having a party.  Not too exciting, but it was better than sitting at my house doing nothing.  Wow... I bet you were totally into that whole update and now your life is complete.  I don't really have much else to say.  Yay for making all-state!  I'm very very very excited about it.  Leah, I will miss you VERY much while I am there... and don't worry, I'll be sure to at least give all the piccolos really mean looks.  To everyone else who didn't make state, congrats... getting to area is quite an achievement!  I guess thats it.  Until next time!  Cool song alert!
