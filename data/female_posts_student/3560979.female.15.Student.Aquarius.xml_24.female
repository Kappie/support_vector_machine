Well...A week ago at my school there was this Christian club started. I thought it was nice, since I am Christian. That same day, just because the religion group started, some person started an anti-religion group. That really made me mad. Now the anti people are trying to say that the Christian club should not be allowed, but that its ok that theres is allowed. Dumb. And to make things clear there is nothing wrong with saying "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance, and I will say it till the day I die. The religion club is not forcing anyone to go. Its for people to go if they so choose, something to do at lunch, nothing is wrong with that. But starting a club out of pure revenge of another club is just plain wrong. The religion club started theres for a reason. I wonder what the anti-religion clubs reason was.      Hey its finally Summer, and it rocks. No school 4 2 months. YAHOOOOOOOOOO!!
