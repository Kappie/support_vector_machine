It should be a kick ass show, so I hope that a ton of people come to see it! The showtimes are listed below.      Wednesday thru Friday-7:00 p.m   Saturday- 2:00 p.m  7:00p.m? ( I am not sure about the second time)      But seriously though, the show is going to be great, so if you need something fun and interesting to do next week(end), come see the show @ the Bay City players! We will appreciate all of the support we can get!      Love Tami
