You've blown me off quite a bit in the past three days, and today especially, but I won't transition into Super Bitch Mode and ignore you. Just  please  stick to your word and CALL if something comes up suddenly so that you don't have people worrying and waiting for you. And that's all. I still love you, GB.  Insha and I did have a really great time at Fashion Valley, though. The two of us haven't been there together in about two years, but we made the very best of it and I don't know about you, Insha, but I think I want to make more frequent trips to this place. Except the parking is horrendous to say the least. A lady and her daughter were yelling obscenities at me and mouthing the word "bitch" just because I passed their car while they were straightening out in a parking spot. Hostile female shopping zombies. After we finally found a parking spot, we shopped around in Brass Plum and I bought two cute shirts there (one Hurley horizontal-striped t-shirt and one red tank top), and three new belts (turtle belt, flower belt, frog belt), all very cute. Then we went to this weird drink "joint" where the people are very lively and force you to take a sip of the drink and tell them you like it before you leave. I had a yummy lemonade slushy and Insha had boba. Then we went to Victoria's Secret where Insha bought a pretty orange tank top with flowers, and after that we went to Sephora and ate some delicious makeup (yes, they have edible makeup now). Then we wrapped it up with some purchases of new earrings, keychains, candy chapsticks, hair accessories, and necklaces at Claire's (a store we're starting to like again). All in all, quite fun. And we didn't get lost on the 163, thank God, but I had one "near accident" trying to change lanes on Friars Road. Made it home safely.  Now? I'm bored as hell. Talking it up online with a few people, ate some good homemade hamburgers for dinner, and might watch a movie sometime later tonight. Oh yes, at 10:30  tonight * MTV has that "I Want a Famous Face" episode of the chick who wants to look like Pamela Lee Anderson. Definitely have to watch that freaky shit. What would I ever do without trashy television?  All right, I'm signing out. Happy Daylight Savings/Palm Sunday (for the Christian folk)!  *Apparently it's tomorrow night. Poo. :(
