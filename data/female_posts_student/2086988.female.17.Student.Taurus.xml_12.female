Starbucks here I come! mmmmm caramel ;) Anyways, I so do not want to go to class tomorrow. I HAVE FOUR FREAKING TESTS ALL IN A ROW!!! AHHH :::slashes wristes::: haha jk! Theater should be pretty easy, Algebra I guess should be ok, AP US History and Chemistry are the ones I'm really worried about, oh well, I'll be so happy when tomorrow is over. Even though I have 2 more tests on Thursday, English and German, I sware to God too many tests! I know this is the last week of our 9 weeks, but it's all crammed in to like 2 days! But enough of my ranting, on to the good things. Last night I was on the phone with my David for like 2 hours, it was the greatest thing, I just hope he knows how much I care about him and that I don't know what I'd do without him. Which reminds me, I had the BEST DREAM last night. And yes it is about David, and if you don't want to hear about him, then don't read my blog, hehe :P. Ok, this is the dream, me and him were just sitting around with a bunch of people and I was in his lap with my arms around him. Well we cuddled for awhile, then we got up and went into my room, got into my bed...and....then the freaking alarm clock goes off. DAMMIT!! lol. Oh well, I'll finish the dream, hopefully. So yeah I'm in a really good mood today, I feel like I am on top of the world. Talking to him last night and then that dream, awwww just makes me melt...German today was so awesome. I did nothing, which is not like me, but I was just too happy to work. So I got on the floor and did some gymastics stuff. Like the bridge, where you put your whole body in the air with you arms and legs, I love doing that. Then I got on one of the back tables and just laid down. Mr. Smith didn't say anything, so oh well. I mean you have Embry and Will trying to rape each other, me always doing some weird stuff, Ryan trying to kill Will and yeah that's my German class. 0_o! Well, I have gone on long enough. Peace out peeps!   I need you like water like breath, like rain I need you like mercy from Heaven's gate There's a freedom in your arms that carries me through I need you
