This was discovered yesterday, after the maintenance man poked around in my apartment, and then up on the roof, for a good two hours. He said he'd have the new one put in this morning, but then the bastard didn't show up! Now the leasing office is hunting his ass down for me. I WANT AIR CONDITIONING! I went to visit Anupam's new place the other day and I paid no attention to his fabulous decor. He was asking me what kind of rug to get for the living room and I was like "Ooooh yeeeeeah baby" cuz I was too busy slathering myself in the pure goodness of his air conditioning. I have two fans going right now. Its not enough. I can only hang out in my bedroom, so now all eating and studying operations have been moved to this little itty bitty room that the fan can actually cool. And the cat is PSYCHO. You know how they say heat affects amygdala functioning? Like, when someone's hotheaded and angry, they might actually be feeling hot? OK... I'll find a link for that later. Its hot in here and I'm pissed. In any case, my cat has been excessively vicious lately, with the claws and the teeth. Kitten teeth are nasty, man. And she zips around here like she's gonna find the air conditioning around any corner. QUIT IT ROXY, IT AINT HAPPENIN. Well at least none of the furniture's melted, yet. It is now 80 degrees Fahrenheit in my apartment. I gotta get outta here...
