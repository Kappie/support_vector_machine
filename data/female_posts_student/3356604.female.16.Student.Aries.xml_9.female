I found that all three were from my most recent boyfriend, and in between apologising profusely, he managed to convey that he didn't think it would work out. This left me in a state of a mixture of confusion, annoyance and guilt. Confusion as to why he didn't talk to me about this, annoyance because he did it over text message and guilt because I didn't feel half as bad as I should have. I can't really remember how I spent the rest of the day...I think I probably read, went on the internet and then at some stage cooked dinner. Fun-diddly-un. After dinner, my friend Lauren came over, and we talked and hung out and stuff until at about 9 I got a VERY interesting phone-call. Jason, a friend of mine who is spending a school year in Japan, rang me from his home in Tokyo. He had some really great stuff to tell me, but I have to publish one of his little anecdotes, because it was truly hilarious.   Jason was riding his bike through the city (which is basically the cheapest and most effective way of travelling) and stacked it. The bike landed on his leg, and the kickstand drove itself deep into his calf muscle. Naturally, this was not an ideal place for the kickstand to be, so he removed it rather promptly. Walking in what would be the general direction of the hospital, he was passed by a teacher of his who saw his bleeding leg and suggested that he go to hospital...before driving off leaving Jason behind. When Jason made it to the hospital, sitting on the operating table, he was surrounded by an assortment of Japanese doctors commenting on how painful his injury looked. Finally, one of the nurses found a rather large needle and jammed it into his leg muscle, claiming it to be for anesthetic purposes. Then, she advised Jason to hold onto something. Jason asked "Didn't you just give me an anesthetic?" to which the nurse replied confidently "Oh, that's not going to be enough..." Next, a doctor stuck his hand into the wound (which was 8cm long and about 3 inches deep if I recall correctly) and was accompanied by the harmonies of a sound which Jason asked me to compare with the sound of a newly boiled potato being shoved up the rear-end of a donkey.  I was in stitches (no pun intended...but now that it's here...) I laughed so much. Anyway, Lauren and I talked to Jason, then went to bed. This morning we got up fairly early and had brekky (french toast) and got ready to go to Mt. Buller. Dad drove myself, Lauren, Bonnie, Fletcher and his friend Josh up to Mansfield where we rented tyre chains and two toboggans. From there we headed to the mountain which was decoratively capped with clean white snow. Half an hour of nauseating turning up the stupid mountain we arrived at the snow (This is a big thing for me, for I've only been to the snow once before when I was really little). Lauren and I watched the kids stack themselves on the slopes for a while before heading to the kiosk for hot chocolate and normal chocolate. About an hour later we all headed to the village and looked around there, and Lauren, Bonnie and I orded a serve of pancakes for the pancake parlour (I love being a fat lard) with bacon and maple syrup and more butter than necessary. Then we caught the shuttle back down to the toboggan slope. I decided to have a go, and on my first run I shot down the hill screaming profanity, warnings and just plain screaming. On my last go, I was racing my brother and rocketted down the hillside, veering far too much to the right, went up a bank of snow and missed a signpost by several inches before nearly stacking the sled on two innocent bystanders. What fun! Anyway, after that we had a bit of a snowball fight, then packed it up and drove home.
