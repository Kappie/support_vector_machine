I must make a  HUGE  apology to Stefie as I sent her an evil messages that was in fact meant for my sister, Steph, oops.......*fucking idiot*.......I new it was gonna happen one day, so I have now solved the problem and renamed Stefie Squif in my phonebook!   IM SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SORRY, IM A BLOODY IDIOT  xxXxXXXxXXxXxXXxXXxXxXXxXxXXxXxXxXxxXxXxxXxXXxXxXxXxXXxXxXXxXxX   Ooh and i'm running as fast as I can but there closing in on me, lol, ahh what am I to do? Dye my hair maybe......ah nooooo, that would obviously ruin my plot to blind society...God I must be soooo transparent, the plan has been figured out, must invent a new one!!..........hmmmmmm.....  ok so now it begins...........*realizes you are all thinking fucking knobcake that should stop writing confusing shit*.......but I will carry on regardless........  well what a week it has been, and the week has not even finished, so that should probably mean I should say what a half week, but it doesn't flow as well so it is staying as 'what a week it has been'.  ............*thinking*......................  hmmmm Monday........ah yes did my photo wall, now i have pictures of y'all on my wall. There is no escape...Mwahahahahhahaa..... ah yes well on Tuesday me and my sister went on a little shopping spree to Southampton.......(if you ever get the chance to go there then go, is absolutely brilliant) anyways where was I...oh yes... I GOT ME A MARILYN MONROE BAG ......well went halves with my sister....Its just got her face on it, I still want one with the most famous pose ever on it...You know the one where she is standing on the street in New York and her dress got blown up by the grill thingy......They did have that one but they had squished her face....grrrrr......yes so will still be looking for another one if anyone see one........Ooh yes Char has already said the Lanes ....Will go there and investigate at some point in the not to distant future.....Got loads of new clothes, lol, and a pair of shoes my total is now 5/6 I think.......Ooh got three belts, lol, well one was half price from the Gap...making it about Â£12..yay....one from River Island, and the other in Next. Southampton is wicked, the Topshop there is the best...its got all the best bits...there is nothing you look at and go WHY?....  hmmmmmmmm what else................Ooh how could I not mention the fact that I had Haz and Vic over to sleep on Wednesday......I loved the randomness of our chats, that's no suprize is it, seeing as this is always random......*hmmmm thinks there maybe a recurring theme*.........  "The Day After Tomorrow"  one word............ AMAZING ...The best film I have seen in a while, really gets you thinking...'What would you do the day after tomorrow?'...I mean this could really happpen, ok so not necessarily in our life time, but you don't know, I mean no one actually considers it being a very real threat do they until something happens to make us sit up and take note! Why does something always have to happen before we take any action against it? That goes for everything, look at 9/11 for example, everyone new about terrorism, and there are many suggesting that The White House knew that the attacks were going to happen, ok maybe not the specifics but there would be an attack on American soil, but they did not take note of the warnings and look what happened......Ok so they might not have been able to stop them, but then gain maybe they could have stopped it becoming such a life/world changing disaster. The same applies here does it not...Everyone knows that we are damaging the environment and causing our own downfall, and yet still very little is being done to change the situation!!!  hmmmmm got to got to work soon, am to tired to go to work......*fights to keep eyes open*............  bye 'd' bye love ye all love your Nat xXxxxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXXxXxXxXxxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxxXxXxXx
