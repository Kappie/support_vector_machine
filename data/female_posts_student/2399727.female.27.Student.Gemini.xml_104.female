They reminded me too much of an article I'd just read online about  urlLink Viennese "poo bags" .   Lighting was absolutely awful.  I couldn't even see the words on the menu, much to the amusement/astonishment of one of my less-than-sensitive companions.  She made a good point, though.  How am I going to be able to go out on a romantic date with a hot guy in a cozy little Italian restaurant and explain that I can't read the menu?  Do I admit I have a disability right up front (way to ruin the mood!), or look like a total freak and pull out my flashlight from my purse?  (I could just picture that now: "Sorry, lighting is atrocious.  Excuse the flashlight and pass the wine list?")  Incidentally, we were right about  urlLink Rancho Relaxo and  The Simpsons  connection .  In the episode "Homer Alone", Marge has a nervous breakdown.  She watches television and catches an advertisement for "Rancho Relaxo'', Springfield's only two-star health spa and decides that's where she is going to go for a few days of peace.  Of course, in Simpsons style, all heck breaks loose.  The CBC is running a contest to allow us to decide who the Greatest Canadian is.   urlLink Cast your vote today .   I had a really hard time deciding between P.E.T., Glenn Gould, Robertson Davies and Jean Vanier.  In the end I went with  urlLink Jean Vanier  for his humanitarian efforts and worldwide impact.  Truly a living example of the preferential option for the poor.  If they had a contest for the Greatest Looking Canadian, I'd vote for P.E.T.'s number one son,  urlLink Justin .  Yummy.  Finally heard back from the mediator for the sponsorship in two weeks.  They know absolutely nothing.  That was useful. :-s  Packed and ready to depart tomorrow morning bright and early.  Just finished a used book deal with a former Psych 100 student.  Have practice tests for the past three years and both textbooks.  Tons of reading.  I really need to get on the magnifier this weekend.  Maybe I will be able to hit the CNIB tomorrow since my dad is on holidays and he can drive.   urlLink Richard Bradshaw  tonight.  He was an intelligent and humorous speaker at Why Wagner? so I'm quite looking forward to hearing this tonight.  I just hope he mentions  Parsifal  or this will be a waste of time.  Seeing my spiritual director Marilyn on Wednesday morning.  Maybe that will help to clarify my future a little.  If only she had a glass ball, or God used flashing neon signs to aid us in our discernment!  Reading Nattiez's  Wagner Androgyne .  Too dense for this time of the morning but I don't really want to lug it back to Steeltown tomorrow.  More to come...
