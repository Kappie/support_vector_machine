I can't tell anyone here though so I have to look like I'm a normal worker bee, so I sit here and I write.  My hands are trembling on each key, they're sweaty and clamy and damp.  It feels like all my guts are smooshing up into a tiny ball inside my ribcage.  Its hot, but its not hot in here.  My upper lip is going numb cause I"m trying to calm my breathing.  Im scared I might pass out, Im having lil dizzy flashes.  I hope all the one oclock lunchers just get out of here so there are less people around.  I dont want to talk to anyone, yet they keep asking how my lunch was.  Stop it.  Im going to pretend to make a phone call, maybe they'll get the hint.  I dont know what to do.  I shouldn't have come back to work, but my boss is a powerhungry bitch and she makes it impossible and akward to call out.  How do i call and say Im a fucking psycho im having a panic attack I cant work.  Damn it...cant take another paxil, can't take a xanax cause i have none.  I need to sleep this off I need to shut everythign off.    Something is weighing very heavily on me and my heart right now and I'm very scared.  And there are only 2 people tops that I can talk to about it.  Im probably worrying for nothing right now and painicking for nothing, but I can't help it.  Im a natural born worrier.  This is probably nothing, and probably not even waht i think it is becuase odds of this kind of thing are one in a kajillionbazillionmillion, but iM that one kajillionthmillionthbazillionth.  Even if people were online I wouldn't be able to talk to them about this, but hopefully I could at least get my mind off of it.  Someone IM me please.  Maybe I could go throw up and then i would feel better.  Something has to stop this now.  Im breathing, im trying to do calm breathing but its hard to get myself unworked up when im like this.  I feel like crying but i cant cry at work.  I wish my mom was working today so I could go talk to her during this lil episode.  Shit shit shit.
