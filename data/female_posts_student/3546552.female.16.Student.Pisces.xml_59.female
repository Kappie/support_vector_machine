The day started out with the  New Berlin Par ade, where my cousin rode his  miniature  motorcycle around with his patriotic shirt! (did I mention my cousin is  20 ?) yeah, so anyway, his knees stuck out super far from the bike...lol! It was most certainly a sight to see. So then, I went out to the church picnic. Got into a huge water fight with  Zach Brose  and soon had everyone joining in! After getting completely soaked, I went to the  Cameron  household to have a wonderful taco dinner courtesy of  Leah , and watch a movie with  Lindsey  and  Andrew . We all went to the  State Fair Fireworks  after dinner and had a great time playing games and eating the puppy chow that  Lindsey  and I made. I miss you  MR  and wish that you were coming back for cell group and worship team and youth group...yeah, basically, just wish you were back...life is boring! LOL, o well I'll find something to do with myself...maybe I'll  dream ...hmmmm maybe not! LOL, see you soon!  HAPPY 4TH!   ~kendra
