We flew First Class like rock stars all the way to New Jersey and that was where my dad picked us up and we drove the rest of the way home. My mom's back is doing better. My dad took her in last night to get an MRI done and he couldn't find too much damage and she is at the doctor right now. Hopefully she won't have to have surgery. Last night I hung out with jennieee and we got pulled over because my tags were expired. But he was a nice and HOT cop and he let me go. That makes me happy.   I really don't have much to say...only that there's no place like home and the feeling of sleeping in your own bed! I have to call Ed Brantley today about working at the radio station. If I don't work there, I'm going to try to get a job with a news station..and if either of those don't work out..i'll just go work somewhere at the mall or something! bahg!  After living in India for a month, I have learned to be appreciative for all I have. Now I feel so guilty about complaining in the past. I will not complain anymore. I have food, shelter, clothes, friends, and a loving family. There's nothing else in the world I need.  I have everything I need and everything I want. I love my life. I love living my life.
