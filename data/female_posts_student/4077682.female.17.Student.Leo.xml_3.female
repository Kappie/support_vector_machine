Really you should be going somewhere, but you dont know where to start. Thats how I feel.    Everyday I'm amazed by something in the world. Theres always something to surprise you, to help you grow. But it seems like, its a temporary change. Like itcan't really last. Everything people do doesn't last....    I always thought the people who said things like "whats the point in living and life?" were morbid, depressed people who don't know how to appreciate things, and how to love. But then I started thinking them. I am deffinitly not depressed. Iappreciate my friends, boyfriendand family. I do know how to love. Im really lucky to live where i do, to have the peope i have in my life. It's just that, sometimes its hard to see what the point is. Its hard not to wonder where thehell we're going.When I hear about the people who go out and drink every weekend, I think, why? I do those things too. They're fun. but they're a waste of time. Most things are, if you think about it.        oh no... ive gotten into one of my phylosophical rants. I better go. me and sam are going to read each others blogs... so, untill next time.
