I would elaborate on how awesome the show was, and about every little aspect of it, but then on the off chance that Wolf still reads my blog regularly, I'd ruin some of the surprises for him... so I keep my mouth shut till next weekend... that's when I'll spill the beans.  Anyhow, I start classes tomorrow.  I'm very thankful that I only have the one class.  I can go to campus in the morning and return home... and lounge around for awhile... I'm not even going to attempt to get books till Tuesday or Wednesday.  It's happened too many times in the past where I buy all the books listed, and then find out I don't even NEED some of them... in such cases I then have to go BACK to the bookstore and return stuff.  And I HATE standing in return lines.  So, I've learned that to avoid that I wait until after I go to all of my classes... and THAT'S when I buy books.  Tuesdays-Thursdays will be my long days.  On Tues/Thurs I won't be done till 3:15.  On Wednesdays I won't be done till 4:45.  :-(  Phooey!  Long days SUCK.  Oh well, at least they don't fall on Monday or Friday.  On those days I only have one class.  Which will make it easier to go visit people out of town on the weekends.  Anyhow, I return now to my "getting ready" for school tomorrow... Gotta clean out old stuff to make room for the new.  :-)  I'll post more later, and I'm sure throughout the semester you'll hear funny jokes about my professors!  I love telling stories about their little quirks.  ;-)  Bye bye for now!       urlLink  postCount('12Jan2003');
