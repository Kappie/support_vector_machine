That is just so amazing. I'm sorry it may seem like nothing for some people, but for me it is everything.  Yearbook is my life, and it means so much to me..and now I (with taylor) am editor in chief. This makes me happier than anything in the world. I could care less about prom or stupid boys. Editor-in-chief is all I have to say! Wow. This is just amazing. This seriously makes me happier than anything else right now.  Someone could come up to me and punch me in the face and I would still be happy. The way I see it is that this is one more step closer to my future. It gives me great experience for the journalism world. Especially since I've seriously been considering majoring in journalism. GAHHH..I'm freaking out...I can't even type I'm so excited.    alright..more good news. haha..enough already i know! Well....this summer i'm quite possibly gonna go to boston university (my DREAM college) for one month!! wahooo. I'm not 100% positive yet tho. But still..it would be amazing.    I swear this day could not get any better. I love today! Long live today!
