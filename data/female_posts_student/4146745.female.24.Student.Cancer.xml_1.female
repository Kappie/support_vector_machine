Angela and Steve were great to let us borrow the money until Friday when Kimo got paid so we had cash to go with.    We left around 11ish and got down there around 12:30ish. Had lunch at Burger King (yuck) and then went to Funtown/Splashtown. It sucked cause Daunte missed 38 inchs but like a 1/2 inch so he couldn't go on any bigger rides like I knew he would want to but he did get it free so that was ok.    Frist we went over Splashtown, the waterpark and played on the pirate structure over there. It was fun, I loved going down the slides and all the kids really enjoyed it too. Mikayla and Jordan were able to go off on it by themselves and they did really good about checking in with us. We were there for about 1 hour 1/2 and then went over the Funtown. Daunte got upset when the other kids got to go on the rides but Kimo took him to get ice cream at one point when we were on rides. He did get to drive the antique cars, go on the choo choo train, go on the frog hopper (which he wouldn't get off ), go on the kiddies swings, merry-go-round, cars, plaes, boats, helicopters, canoes and I think thats all he went on. Mikayla and Jordan also got to go on all those and they also went on the scrambler, casino ride, thunder bolt, bigger swings, tea cups, log flume ride, and roller coaster. All and all they enjoyed it. Mikayla and I both one at the guess your speed pitch thing and Daunte got a care bear for his dad being a Titans fan :) We had some fried dough, cotton candy, popcorn and what not. Daunte jumped in a coin fountain to try and get more money and got soaked, made me upset, but I got over it, kids will be kids :/ Before we left Angela, Steve, Alex and I went on the Dragon Decent which is one of those "bring you up 20 stories and drop you" rides. I have never been on one before and I didnt care for the height part but I lived. I was at stopped telling Angela I was going to kill her lol. I hated the fact my ass came outta the seat, that was the first part. We fell so fast I couldn't even scream. Alex did great for being 7 and going on it. Well that was our day, no one got lost, it wasn't that busy and we had a great time.
