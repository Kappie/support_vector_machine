Not sure what I'm doing tomorrow evening.  There's 007, of course, but I was also invited to a potluck at a prof's house.  I actually was just planning on coming home pretty early since I'm not feeling so hot.    Hmmmmm.  Sometimes I think I need to start writing again.  I used to write a lot, not that I ever wrote anything good, and it's been a long time since I've done so.  But I need a creative outlet.    Hmm.
