Then I got to school and things were good ya know? Then, first period, Mss. Erardi told me she thinks I should do Pre Cal next year instead of Trig and that would be AWESOME!!!! I feel like I've amounted to something ya know? Like I'm never great shakes at school, especially math and now my teacher wants to reccomend me for something? AWESOME MAN!! Then, Mick tells me hes commin and the plans for Florida are like all set.. things are just great ya no? Yay for happiness. Peace x0x
