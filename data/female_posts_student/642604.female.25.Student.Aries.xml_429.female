I have always wanted to go but I have this serious fear of doing things I've never done before alone.  I don't have any problem trying things with other people but when it comes to mustering up the courage alone... I just don't.    So finally I decided after buying my new Bronzer at Sephora and going nuts on all kinds of other makeup to make myself beautiful (haha!) I desperately needed a tan so that my skin will match my face without having to spend 10 minutes blending the bronzer every morning all over my neck and ears.  Pain in the ass.  For those of you who have a natural glow or for the guys who never have to go through this kind of stuff... just shut up.  I research and find out there is a tanning salon right around the corner from where I am working for the summer and I consider it but when I drove by I decided against it.  I just couldn't bring myself to walk in amongst all of the regulars claiming to not know a damn thing about it.  And there are several embarassing questions I would have to ask in order to understand the process.  I have no shame most of the time but in weird circumstances like this I seriously freak out.  Go figure.  So I know that Pandy goes to a tanning salon and decide to ambush her with question after question about lotion, time, tanning beds, price, what to bring, do they care if you are naked, etc.  See, didn't have any problem asking her.  She answers every question and then goes on to say she is tanning the next day at lunch if I wanted to go.  I say what the hell.  This is my oportunity to find out if I not only like it but I will have someone there to hold my hand.  So we get there and Pandy and her friend are ushered back to their rooms all the way around the corner and in the back. I am left with the woman attendant.  The woman, who was very nice, kept saying I had absolutely no color at all... well thanks... isn't that why I am here and didn't I just say I was a first timer.  Do you really need to make me feel like crap because I HAVE NO COLOR?  Would you like to see me cry now.  Anyway so I say that my friends who do this on a regular basis have told me I should go in for 10 on my first try.  The woman says, I would feel better if you only went in for 7.  I say fine.  Fortunately Pandy has already given me lotion, so I purchase a package for 100 minutes total and buy some eyewear.  Not a bad deal.  Then the woman shows me to the room which is right in front of the front desk facing out to the window front facing the parking lot.  She flips a bunch of buttons and says this does this and this does that... and I just smile and nod although I couldn't for the life of me see what she just did.  She's like we clean our own beds when we're done.  I said okay and then she says there is the solution.  I, still trying to focus on what buttons I am going to have to press, cannot process what she just said and when I hear solution I'm like SOLUTION FOR WHAT!  I already have oil, now I have to put on a solution too.  Thank GOD I put two and two together before I actually decided it would be a good idea to spray myself down.  I go into the room and as I am shutting the door I hear her say don't forget to lock it cause sometimes we forget who is in what room.  Okay.    So I take off all my jewelry, all my clothes and start putting on the lotion.  I give one more look to the solution and tell myself one more time that it is the cleaning solution for afterwards.  Then I hit the switches and hope something happens.  The bed turns on and I get in.  There is a face tanner but I am terrified to press any of the other switches for fear of electricuting myself or something.  It's insane I know.  So I am laying there thinking of everything I have and need to get done for the day.  And before I had gone in the woman had mentioned that if I get too hot or itchy I need to get out cause it means that I am burning.  So every few seconds I am literally asking myself the question... do I feel itchy, do I feel too hot?  As if I wouldn't notice.  So then all of the sudden I hear this noise and I realize it's someone in the room next to mine probably cleaning off her bed but for whatever reason it makes me question whether I remembered to lock the door or not.  I couldn't remember, so I spent the remaining five minutes questioning whether or not I should check the door.  I mean if someone did open it up I would be there lying naked for the whole waiting room and passersby outside to see.  But if I got up I would lose a moment of my seven minutes.  So basically I just kept looking over at the door every few moments and then looking back up and looking over and looking up.   So finally I finish up and get dressed.  I clean down the bed.  Go out and thank the woman.  I walk outside and find Pandy and her friend who both went in for like 17 - 20 minutes hanging out in the parking lot.  It aparently took me that long to get aquainted with everything that my seven minute tan took far longer than theirs.  Whatever.  So I say goodbye and head back to work.  The whole time home I'm flipping through my schedule in my head to figure out when I go next... addiction anyone?  So I am eating my lunch back at the office when I lean on my hand and realize that I smell really friggin good.  The lotion smells really good and since I am covered in the lotion... I SMELL REALLY GOOD!  I insist upon telling everyone this throughout the day.    Anyway, to make a long story short, despite my idiot ideas and fears, I really liked it, it was kind of relaxing.  I imagine it is what it's like to be placed in one of those water tank thingys except here you're getting a tan while you do it.  So once again if it hadn't had been for someone else I would still be sitting here at my desk wondering about something I could've been out there enjoying... story of my life.    Now if I could only conquer my recent aquisition of stage fright, everything would be fine.
