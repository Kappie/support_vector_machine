I tried hard to never insult you and even gave you compliments.  It's not lost on me that I can come across and rude and obstinent.  Since RYLA, I've been trying to remove the negative side of my confidence.    My confidence is my best and worst trait: it's the only reason why I accepted myself, that I am still alive today, and can push myself to do well in so many areas, but it can also be my worst because I will mow through anything that gets in my way.  You know how Tchernio has roadblocks?  I don't- cause I use TNT and blow them up as soon as I can.  (bad humor and analogies are my second and third worst traits)  My confidence comes from one of the toughest things I've ever done in my life.  I don't talk about it much cause it still hurts and I feel talking won't help.  My family hates gays.  Even now, my father talks shit about them, silently and behind my back.  My mom thinks I need to go see a shrink.  Why, am I a ward-ready freak?  I snap at her and tell her that's who I am.  How could she not figure it out?  She always used to smile and say that I was "her rainbow child."  She saw a rainbow out the window of the hospital the day I was born.  That explain two things- that I was born gay and that even God and I share a bad sense of humor.  Back to crying... everyone that I looked up to when I was young treated faggots like spoiled, diseased children.  Finding the will within me to resist that perception made me feel invincible.  The only reason why I do well in school and stuff is because I have an incredible push inside of me to prove myself more than shit.  To prove myself better than the people I grew up with.  To prove them wrong.  That's also why, no matter how nice my parents may ever be to me, I will always hate them.  My hate of them is my personality, it is myself.  I could never say that to their faces cause it would crush them, so the nicest thing I can do to them is fight.  I value my friends greatly.  Sure, sometimes I may be a pompous ass cause I'm frustrated- but you must know that I would do anything for you if anything ever needed to be done.  Thats why when one of them treats me like shit, it hurts bad and drives me insane.  The one thing that embarasses me is when someone who is my friend treats me like shit.  It makes people wonder what a crappy person I am.  I'd really appreciate it, even though it may be your nature, to make an extra effort to be curteous to me.  If we have differences, talk them out, I'll see the reason... growing up with Jason taught me to be waaaay to logical.  :)  No offense to you, buddy ol' pal.  Actually come to think of it, I may not have... I mean... the sprinklers... go figure.  So yea, when I called you a bitch I meant it, and I still do mean it if I keep getting treated like shit.  But I seriously don't want to keep meaning it.  Let's call a truce and start an experiment... in politeness.
