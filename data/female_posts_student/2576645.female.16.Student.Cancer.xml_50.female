I feel the need to explain things, if only to get something off my chest.  I do not know why, but I have never had deep spiritual feelings. I do not know if it was because I was raised Catholic, the fact I may have trust issues (?), or I can't seem to believe in something I do not know for certain is there. Even when I was little, I always hated church. I hated the way it was so formal, cold, and forbidding. Maybe I am the only one to ever think of church that way, but I can't change it. That is what I see it as.   If I do go to church nowadays, it is because I am forced to. I have tried resistance, but it failed miserably. I just decided "Well, what the heck? It can't kill me. It can only make me uncomfortable for an hour. Plus, this is the only way my family will shut up and drop it."  I sit there, doing my best to annoy the crap out of my sister (by saying things like: "Oooo... I want a slurpee!!!!" really, really, loud), disagreeing with almost everything the priest says, and staring at all the people who are pretending to look interested.  The thing is, I cannot wrap my brain around the idea that there is only one true thing to believe in, and that there is only one right religion. There are thousands of religions in this world, and many are much older than Christianity. Religion trys to answer the unknown questions ("Why are we here?" "What is the right thing to do?" "What happens after death?"), but I am not quite sure if those questions are meant to be answered.   Me? I believe that if you lead a decent, honest, full-filling life, and don't commit any horrendous crimes (murder, having an affair, knowingly destroying the environment, or going over the mandatory speed limit of 25mph in Roosevelt Park), you will be rewarded when you die. I do not know with what, how, or where, but I am certain something good will happen. If you live a life full of corruption, you will be punished. I do not whole-heartily believe in Heaven or Hell. I just think that if you go through life loving, giving and being appreciative, everything will be okay.   Maybe I am naive, maybe I am confused, maybe I have got it all wrong. Maybe I will end up burning in hell for all eternity, surrounded by evil b-list actors (Aaahh!! Michael Landon! Nooooo!!) .... who knows?  All I can be sure of is myself. I am not saying there is no 'higher power'. There defiantly is, and between all my stubbed toes, cuts and bumps I have been getting lately, I am not entirely sure He/She/It likes me. Afterall, someone needs to be reaponsible for our welfare (THAT and someone needs to be in charge of smiting).  I do not know if anyone can relate, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out there.  *****  Song of the Day: 'Philosophy'- Ben Folds Five
