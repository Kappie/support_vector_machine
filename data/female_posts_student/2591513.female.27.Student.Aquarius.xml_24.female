She e-mailed me and reminded me that she was there, although thousands of miles away, still there.  How did I get so lucky?  Hell she even flew out to see us...I still can't believe how generous she is with her time and her love.  THANK YOU HEIDI!  Thank you for reminding me that there are people out there who know the true value of relationships...whether they be family or friends...I LOVE YA and MISS YOU TONS...more so now.
