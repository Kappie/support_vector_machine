Sometimes I really wish that I could entirely jump this "stage" of life, and leap right into the heavens where I would not have to deal with the woes of life. But, indeed, then I realize that that statement itself sounds suicidal, and I do not intend it to be so at all. But I guess I'm safe typing it here, as I don't really have anyone to misconstrue my words as they do when I speak them.   My friends are completely forgetting me. And whats just as bothersome, I am asking my self if I am really that forgetable? I lost my best friend on Wednesday for good, and I'm working on losing the second one. It's inevitable, I should know that by now. I get to the point where I can share pretty much anything with someone, or goodness, even cry in front of them and not feel guilty, and they disappear.   I really cannot do this much more, and I mean this wholeheartedly. The words that are coming out of my mouth these days should not be disregarded or underestimated. I mean what I say (and what I type), and I mean that I cannot be stepped on for much longer. I am just about to break into a million pieces and scatter into the wind, nameless and lost.
