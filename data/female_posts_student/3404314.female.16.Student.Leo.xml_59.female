Notice me Take my hand Why are we Strangers when Our love is strong Why carry on without me?  Everytime I try to fly I fall without my wings I feel so small I guess I need you baby And everytime I see you in my dreams I see your face, it's haunting me I guess I need you baby  I make believe That you are here It's the only way I see clear What have I done You seem to move on easy  I may have made it rain Please forgive me My weakness caused you pain And this song is my sorry  Ohhhh  At night I pray That soon your face Will fade away  owww.... congratulations to the winners in the last concluded NSSC elections at Nazareth School!!
