One of the reasons ( or excuses) that the govt gave for this was the fact that these students, in spite of achieving an excellent overall grade, had obtained an A- (???!!) in some of the subjects, or possibly in the breakdown of the exam papers sat .. Never sat for STPM myself so i dont know exactly how STPM candidates are graded. However, the govt being the ever sympathetic, concerned-for-its-nation's-welfare ruling party .. has cleverly devised a way of 'absorbing' ( sorry .. this is direct translation hehehe .. 'serap') these students into the medical faculties in the local u's.  Today, there was an interesting letter in the Forum section of utusan malaysia stating that excellent students should try and have a wider option of future careers and not be bogged down by wanting to do medicine alone, and later be disappointed when they fail to secure a place. The contributor of this letter also suggested that a lot of wanna-be doctors choose to do medicine due to family pressure, the desire to make easy money, to raise their 'saham' or simply because medicine is a glam career.  Funny that i should be reading this letter today. Last night, the levels of stress over the coming finals had overwhelmed me to the point where i thought to myself, 'is this really what i want in life?' If I had the option of turning back time, would i have done something different? Mind you, this is NOT the first time i have asked myself this question.   And time and again, i think. NO i wouldnt have chosen to do anything else. But i would have chosen to stay in Malaysia.   But just going back to the letter i had read in the Utusan forum, i have to admit some bits about pple wanting to do medic are quite true. To one who has not had a taste of what its like to be studying medicine, it may seem like a really glamourous, romantic career ( i suppose ER should be blamed for this!!! and NO, i dont like ER). Its far from being glam, trust me. Its a LOT OF HARD WORK ... and if you are unlucky enough to have really nasty seniors ( Read : i dont mean the people who are in the year above), it can have quite a debilitating effect to your confidence and self-esteem. From the 'saham' aspect of it all.. hmm.. a lot of prospective mother-in-laws drool when they find out their sons ( or daughters) are dating a future doctor. But again, it really is NOT worth going into medicine just for this!! The risk outweighs the benefit heheheh... Money? Hmm.. i suppose for those working in the UK, the money isnt too bad .. but from what ive heard from reliable sources in malaysia.. the starting wages for a junior houseman are atrociously low. The engine people earn a whole lot money than the medic pple, or so they tell me.  oh well.. for whatever reason one has decided to go into medicine, there really should be much consideration as to whether one would be willing to devote one's entire life to it.. it is .. shall i reiterate again.. HARD WORK.. even before one qualifies as a doctor. A colleague once pointed out to me that the so-called medical student syndrome does exist as a clinical diagnosis.. i dont know whether this is true or not tho'.  as for me .. there is no turning back now, even if i wanted to.
