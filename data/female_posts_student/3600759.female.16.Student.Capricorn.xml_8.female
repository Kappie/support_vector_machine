I have a Math Regents Wednesday, Global Regents Thursday, Bio Regents Friday and a Spanish Regents Tuesday. Oh what a week! Hopefully I'll do good on all of them!   I am going to inservice at Splish Splash tonight, that should be fun... Lifeguarding is a blast, I love the people, place, and job in general. The people at Splish Splash are the GREATEST, sort of like the HOBY people but the lifeguards don't cheer as much!   Talked to Courtney on the phone and Oh Boy did she FREAK out when I told her something. Hahaha. Courtney is the only one to know about my HOBY secret... Courtney and I when ever we talk on the phone the phone alwasy seems to go dead. Haven't talked to Jess yet, but I probably should to let her know stuff!   I took a nice loooooong nap today which felt SOOO good. I slept from 2:00-5:00. Now I probably wont be able to get to sleep tonight but thats alright, I guess I can jsut watch some TV or a movie in my room until I fall asleep.  Well I am going to go, and talk to some people online, I might post later tonight but deff. tomorrow!   Love, Mel
