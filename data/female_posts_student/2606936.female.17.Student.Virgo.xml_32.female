What's  up  with the candy conversation hearts that say "Let's Read"? I was eating some the other day and I can't figure out what it means. Usually the phrases are like, "Call Me" or "Luv Ya" or something. Cheesy, to-the-point, cliched.  But "Let's Read?" Are teachers supposed to give them to the class or something?   Or maybe "read" is actually "R.E.A.D." and it stands for something mildly to severely suggestive. I don't know what it COULD stand for - but that's how these kids do it these days. The make up all those crazy words for *whispers*  "the sex."    Maybe it should have said "read my lips" or something like that, and the people who work in the factory are just illiterate.....   or maybe it's actually really beautiful and romantic and I'm just missing the point by making fun of candy for the sheer reason that I don't have anyone to give cheesy candy  to?   Nah.  I'm just glad they finally figured out just how a man can knock me off my feet. "Hey, baby, let's READ!"  (We shall ignore, for the moment, the fact that i had my first kiss in a bookstore.)  (ignore it......)  (oh, go.........   climb in a handbasket ............or something to that effect.)
