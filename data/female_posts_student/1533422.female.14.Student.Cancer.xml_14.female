Pooj's coming round my house after school (we will terrorise the bus on the way home, HAHA) and we can laugh at ... well, I don't know if they're in it this year, but certainly if Pubeless Werewolf have changed their name and are in it, then they are going DOWN!  Love In The Asylum should've won last year.  (Rock on, Sean, rock on.)  Del Sato SUCK, because I don't really like Withers at all, and Iodown *snorts* what the hell were they about? *Sighs contentedly* All I can do now is sit and wait for Thursday.  Hmm.  Good God, what am I going to wear?! What if Elliott's there?  Yeah, what if he is there ... ;)  Clare is so annoying!  Slut shoes, slut shoes!  You can't go round with the same shoes as Ellie McCarthy and still have any street cred at all.  Although, it's only me and Pooj who have noticed.  Grr, Clare was flirting so much all day, and then she pretends that she hasn't been bitching about us ... yes you have, honey, and we've been bitching about you so shurrup!   Och, ma daddy needs the computer in fifteen minutes.  No one is online!  Well, Clare is ... Charlotte is ... oh, joyous days.  Not.  Charlotte just asked me what song my name is from.  (It's `Talk to me, dance with me, in the spotlight, boy` which is OBVIOUSLY slightly altered Hot Hot Heat lyrics, and NO ONE has heard of them!!)  Oh dear, got to go, maybe more later.  *~Jools~*
