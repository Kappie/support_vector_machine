Moreover, it was a weekend, so, student cards was out of bounds. No discount for students. However, themovie is really fascinating. It does impress me. Everyone should go to watch out the movie; you will never regret to do so although the tickets are really expensive!Trust me.   A small joke occurs: We, three of us who are already 17-years-old. When we get together, we name ourselves as The Power Puff Girls. I’m the Bubble. Haha! Amazing??   It was a reportcard day yesterday. Of course, I got my reportcard. I was not pleased with it. Anyway, I will work harder to achieve better result in the trial exam. I know I can make it. =)
