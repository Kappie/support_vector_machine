Surprisingly, I was not wrought with angst or unfamiliarity. We went on a great search for marshmallows because we were going to have a bonfire, but because it was late Sunday night it was harder than we had anticipated, so we ended up going to Dairy Queen because there was like 4   really   hot guys. Always fun!  Um... went to Hardees because Mom wanted me to ask Heather when her brother Donny's birthday was. Things are so unbelievably tense between us two. She got a tatoo on her freaking ankle! God how stupid can you be? And it was a lizard on top of all of that, how hideous and cheap. Aside from yet another rant, we got into another "mini-fight" lastnight and I didn't want to see her today, but it was alright I guess. No cat fighting, and that's always a plus.   Matt's game started at 6 but we got rained out...again. I was actually looking forward to it. But it's okay I guess, I'm searching for more scholarships right now, and it's proving quite unsuccessful, so I need the time I can get.   Anyways, I gotta go, Dad's harassing me to get off so he can play. Whatever, I'll finish up explaining my eventless day in explicit detail later!
