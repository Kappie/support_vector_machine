He stood me up saturday night after I got back from Eagle Pass having spent all day doing an immigration clinic for the poor.  He was supposed to see me, so excited yet, entirely exhausted I ditched my family to go home and shower and change and clean up.   I did my hair, put away clothes and spent the night on the couch waiting.  He never called.  After having said he wanted to spend Easter dinner with my family he said he was going to Austin the day before Easter while I was still in Eagle Pass.  I tried to overlook this and said, "Just get back early so I can see you on Easter."  Yeah, definitely.  Didn't happen.  I went to bed on Easter after trying to stay up for his call again.  The call came at 11 p.m. last night after I had given up and gone to sleep.  My easter was a disaster.  That Sat after I got back from doing the clinic I came to my house to find a  300 lbs. part of my oak tree obstructed half the street.  In the rain and hail, alone, I tied ropes around it and tried to move it in my skiing jacket sloshing through puddles.  I cried.  But no one seemed to care or stop or help.  I couldn't even make the damned branch budge.  I wanted to hear his voice to hear anyone's voice.  To have someone else there.  I'm alone.  I ran into him in the library.  "What's up?" he said chipper as ever.  Apparently his weekend had gone off without a hitch.  "You don't know whats wrong, come in here we need to talk."  I told him how he had stood me up.  He claimed to not know he had.  I hate holidays.  I hate being my only fan.  I hate having to hate, to feel so undesirable, so easily overlooked and forgotten.  I told him I was upset, I told him this on Sun night also.  I told himm my feelings were hurt.  He said I'll just let you go to bed you sound tired.  You know what, I think I am.  Maybe not in the exact way he thinks, but I am.  Today I said what I didn't want to ever say, what killed me and I felt my heart had stopped from saying.  "I can't do this, this isn't working."  He had no reaction, he just turned and walked away.  I am the only one hurting.  How do I sit through property, how do I get up tomorrow.  He was the only highlight of every day.  He was my reason for trudging through and sucking it up.  What is my reason now.  My heart is broken.  My chest feels sunken and I AM tired.  Tired of this.  Tired of not having something good happen.
