It's gone; no more Press at UI.  I returned to Contracts after seeing the Arg's headline furious, having to explain that, no, the paper wouldn't be effected, just the only academic press in the state that provides an invaluable service called book-publishing to the population at large.    So I decided the only thing to do would be to join my fellow lovers of books, especially those made by an award-winning Press on such non-profitable subjects as racial equality, Nez Perce history, trail/hiking guides through Lewis and Clark's trail country, not to mention the amount of material authored by faculty and grad students (Oh, and the Story of Idaho textbook published by the Press has been adopted as the standard state history textbook by the Idaho Department of Education) and write the new president-elect a little email politely asking him to reconsider this fucked up decision by our current prick of a president.    I left out the discussion on how the addition of a new swimming pool to benefit the new women's swimming team may not be an adequate trade-off for the Press' undoing.  At any rate, here's my letter:   President-elect White:  I am adding my voice to the assuredly voluminous letters/emails etc you have undoubtedly received in the wake of interim President White's announcement of the closing of the University of Idaho Press.  Much has been, and will continue to be, said about this situation, some from faculty and staff at the University and some from concerned citizens of the community.  I would like to add my perspective as a recent UI graduate and a current student at the University's College of Law, in order to help illustrate how valuable the Press is to the student body, past, present and future.  When, in the spring semester of 2002, I completed a semester-long internship program at the Press within the Editorial department the Press was able to support only  one intern per semester.  This experience and knowledge I gained from the internship was invaluable to my studies in Communication.  The opportunity to work on an in-depth, hands-on level with various stages of book publishing provided not only an increased understanding of the industry but also an expansion of my abilities as a graduate from this institution.  The rate of students enrolled in similar internships increased by 9 in the following two years, bringing the total number of interns to 11 since 2001.    This is only one aspect of the Press' rate of growth and its assured promise of  further expansions.  In addition to the internship program, the Press has facilitated a course in publishing, in which 23 students enrolled.  Furthermore, the Press supports faculty members in the English, Natural Resources, Biology, Chemistry, Entomology, History, Law, Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Physical Science, Agricultural  and Life Sciences, Anthropology and Sociology, Art and Architecture, Library, and the Center for the Center of Disabilities and Human Development Departments by publishing and/or advising them on their written works.  The Press-published Story of Idaho textbook serves as the standard state Idaho state history textbook by the Idaho  Department of Education.    In pursuing your dedication to enhancing academic experiences for students, who  ultimately subsidize these programs, I strenuously urge you to reconsider this administration's decision to do away with the state's only academic press.  These difficult decisions effect not only our current student, faculty and community populations but also  the future generations of possible alumni.    Thank you for your time and consideration.   That'll show 'em!!
