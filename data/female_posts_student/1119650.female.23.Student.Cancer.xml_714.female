Oh and some pizza fries would be yummy too, round it out with a bowl of short sticky rice and some cucumber salad and maybe an order of spinach from  urlLink F.I.S.H.  and I'd be able to die happy right now.  Wait, acutally, I'd need to throw down with some serious BBQ ribs and cornbread as well then.  Yeah...I think that's it.    Somehow the reason I can't lose any weight remains a mystery to me, go figure!
