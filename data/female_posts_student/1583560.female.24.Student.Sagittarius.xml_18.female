There was a brief few minutes there where quite a few of my friends (one or two) seemed interested in reading what I posted here, but I think they have all long since forgotten about this place. It does look like Kate and Kami still check for any updates to this page though, so there is hope I am not the only one to ever read this.   I just got back from my 20 day trip to Australia and New Zealand with my girlfriend, Alisa, and her dad, Vance. We had a great time where we did all sorts of things; we went wine tasting, saw the blue mountains and the three sisters, drove on the wrong (well right for them... well, actually left for them...) side of the road, flew on lots of planes, took most every modern form of transportation, discovered lots of tasty local chocolates, went on a brewery tour and drank plenty of good NZ beer (and some so-so Australian beer), hiked on a glacier, took lots of pictures, relaxed on the beach, saw my first topless beach, petted a kangaroo, found out a dingo was really just a reddish looking dog, ate good food but stayed away from the 'roo or emu burgers, saw a sky full of unfamiliar stars, failed to notice which way the toilets flushed, due to the oddities of traveling over the international date line we lost June 24th 2004 forever but gained an extra July 12th (why did we have to choose gaining an extra Monday?), dived and snorkeled on the Great Barrier Reef, climbed a big rock called Uluru in the middle of the desert, went on lots of hikes, saw many amazing sites, read many Bill Bryson books, finally finished reading Richard Dawkin's  The Selfish Gene  (highly recommended), finally read  Flat Lander , and generally very much enjoyed myself.   Taking that long of a time away from work and my normal day to day life allowed for time to reflect on what I am doing and where I want to go with my life. In short, I pretty much figured out what I knew before the trip, I don't want to keep doing this job and I want to figure out what else to do. I didn't figure what else to do, but at least I have grown more comfortable with the idea of being ok with whatever comes after this. I don't expect to make a huge success of things with anything that come after this job as I once hoped to. I am more or less fine with doing whatever sounds remotely more satisfying or productive. I am still very much considering going back to school to get a Masters in physics or physical sciences, an MBA, or a Teacher's credential, but if those fall to the way side, I am sure something else will come up. I just hope this laissez faire attitude is able to beat back the day to day stresses of this job and researching other opportunities. That is the problem for me about discovering opportunities, it stresses me out. I always worry about the what-ifs and the opportunity costs and whatever... I am too good at cultivating the negative point-less-stresses. Sigh...   That was quite long... Surprised myself there I did. Speak like Yoda I sometimes do.    (I just used the spellchecker, and besides this blogger having the worst spell checker I have everused, I also noticed that it doesn't even recognize the word "blog".)
