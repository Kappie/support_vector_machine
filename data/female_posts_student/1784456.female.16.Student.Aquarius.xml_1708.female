That made sence, my first impressions of people that I met at primary school still stand and I think that they probaly will for the rest of my life.  I also think that in the long term your first opinions are usually your final ones, what is it they say, once a bitch always a bitch??  Sorry I'm having an actual break from coursework for a change, I'm a bit annoyed with it so am leaving it for 10 minutes listening to some loud music and then I'm going to go back and tackle it.  We had this silly revison seminar today.  I expect that some people found it helpful, but personally I did not.  I want to have a rant but don't know what to rant about, actually yes I do.   I have some friends who tell me things and then expect me not to tell anyone else, this is all good and fair but do they not realise that this is putting alot of pressure upon you?  For example Bob tells you that Jim has been sleeping with Sue, whilst Jim was going out with Jane.  How are you meant to react??  (That little story was purely fictional I just made it up, no one is sleeping with each other, well they are but you know what I mean!! I hope!?)  How are you meant to keep something like that to yourself?  So you learn to live with it, when Jane says to you that she has secretly been doing things with Fred?? Please please please bear in mind that I have made this up!!!  I actualy have made it up so dont go saying that one of r mates has dun this and the otha has dun that.  Anyway back to my rant..............  So you know these two things and dont know what to do when Martha and her cat cum up and tell u that they have been beaten up by sum fatty blokes.  But you cant tell anyone because then they'll get beaten up again!!  This is the dilema that many of us face daily, do you say something to someone and face the consequences of your actions or do you keep quite and keep on mulling over what is going on in your head.  I'm a person who usually tells because aledgedly a problem shared is a problem halved, but is that really true??  And dont you want to protect your mates, cos int that what a good mate should do??? xx
