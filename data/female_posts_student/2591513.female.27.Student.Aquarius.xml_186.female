Pa is going to go back on his ship soon so we won't be seeing him for maybe another year.  I hope that isn't the case, it would be nice to have him here sooner, but we have to play things by ear.  I can't believe his visit is almost over, this month went by quickly.  Later on today I have to take Bailey to his best friend's birthday party.  He has been waiting for this for weeks now.  I am so excited for him, he hasn't seen his school friends in over a month now.  He msut miss them.  I feel bad about him mot being able to go to school with them this year, but I think it might be for the best.  I am sure things will work out.  I hope they will.  Keep your fingers crossed for me.  Well i shoudl go to bed now.  I don't knwo when Ed will call me to come and get him.  You all have a great weekend...our weekend has started out great.  I hope it stays that way.
