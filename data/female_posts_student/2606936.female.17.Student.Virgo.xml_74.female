For those of you who a) like me, are slaves to a communications giant because of a family trade and therefore do not recieve this channel, or b) have better things to do with your time, Degrassi is a Canadian-made pre-teen and young teen soap opera.   It is fucking genius. These characters go through every possible problem teens could face, and they do it with perfect hair, dull wit, extra melodrama, and Canadian accents. (How long have we "bean" friends?.... I'm "soary!"..... Ask him "ote!" etc etc)  Anyway, so my favorite character on the show is Ellie. Redheaded, somewhat pretty, punky-gothy-kinda chick. However, she's awesome because she was always one of those mature ones who kinda saw through all the shit going on, without being annoyingly intelligent or rebellious. She's just THERE, but in a good, strong, important way.  But then, in one very special episode, Ellie's dad went off to Iraq and her mother parked her Canadian ass on the couch with a bottle of vodka. So Ellie's all stressed between trying to keep her mom, like, alive, and her dad from worrying, and her grades up, and also to hold on to this film internship deal she landed. So finally, when she sees a compass fall out of her backpack, she starts to cut her wrists.  Anyway, obviously someone notices by accident, and of course it's Paige, the resident bitch queen of this Canadian suburb. So it's like, Ellie's only "hope" is this chick who hated her, and competed with her for that internship, and Ellie has a million reasons not to trust her, but in the end, she ends up talking to the school counselor a lot and getting on her way to being okay.  So in a later episode, a miniature  Breakfast Club  in which some vair vair different people are thrown into detention together and forced to rethink themselves, she ends up talking to and "sparking" this guy she'd never really known before. This kid was Sean.  Both these kids had rumors circulating - while hers was about the cutting, his came from nasty allegations about his stealing school laptops and such. So they're lying on the school roof, talking, and one of them grabbed the other's hand. They kinda looked at each other, and Ellie said, "You don't seem freaked out by me."  Sean: "Nope."  Ellie then rolls down the wrist cuffs she wears, and shows him the scars of when she had cut. "Are you freaked out now?"  Sean ran his fingers across her scars, stroked her hand, and told her he wasn't.  Lately one of my best friends, Jules, has been writing depressed things on her xanga. Things about comparing her old boyfriend to her new one, and how difficult her family life is, and just how things are hard. Anyway, a few days ago she quoted Ellie from Degrassi: "Are you freaked out now?"  So today, I was planning to work out with another good friend, Angela, to complete some P.E. credit for me. So we're kinda lazing around my room, and Jules calls. She said she was on an hour break at work, and was wondering if she could come over.  It was weird, since I don't recall her ever asking herself over before, but of course we wanted to see her, so she came.   Jules, Angela, my mother, and I sat in my kitchen chatting about a million things, and at one point my mom went to tlak on the phone to someone. Angela was talking animatedly when she looked down at Jules' arm. "Oh, what happened?" she asked, pointing at a long red scab across the back-hand-side of her arm.  "Probably a cat," I quipped, in my usual anti-feline fashion, but Jules kind of ummed. I touched the scabbed-over wound and her wrist turned over, showing more.  Six or seven red lines, across the underside of her wrist, all the same length, all evenly spaced. As I ran my fingers over it, she finally said, "I don't know." Our eyes met and hers were frantic, as I tried to push back what came into my mind.  I fussed over it and dismissed it, and the conversation moved away. A while later Jules left. Angela and I were going to go and do our run, but my mother, who was making country-fried steak, needed us to go buy her some eggs.  So we're halfway to the grocery store, yammering about something random, when Angela said - "Oh God, Audrey! Do you think Jules cut herself?"  She saw everything, too - I wasn't the only one to suspect this. Angela cried in the car and we decided to tell my mother. However, her rooting around for her copy of "Reviving Ophelia" didn't quite give us what we'd wanted.  For God's sake, we know what cutting means. What we need to know is what the hell we're supposed to do now.  We're trying to plan a "girls' day/night" for the day after tomorrow. Maybe we can get her to tell us without letting her know we know. Maybe we'll have to tell her, and maybe bad stuff will happen.  I don't know what we'll do, but it will be something. It will be everything we can muster.  She wanted us to see it - she wore short sleeves, she asked to come over, she posted that goddamn Degrassi quote. She needs something, and she knows it, somehow.  I haven't cried yet, though Angela did as we drove home from the grocery. My Jules, my best friend... she's one of those who held me afloat during that dark time known as Getting Over B. She's done so fucking much for me, and she can't do this on her own.   Jules, we are NOT freaked out. We will never be freaked out. I will never be afraid of you, Jules, and as soon as we can come clean, i will never, ever let you be afraid of yourself again. You will never be alone.
