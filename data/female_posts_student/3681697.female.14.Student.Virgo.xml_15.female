L was reading out the answers and i asked malachi what the answer was to a question and Mr. L is like Lily im sick of hearing you laughing and blabbering away so you can move if you like. and im like no sorry. and yeah. it was funny. anyway then there was lunch   lunch  was  rather  boring  today  because  alex  and  others  were  at  choir  ok ill stop writing like this its pissing me off. um lunch. luci and i listened to music as we usually do. then sam was like hey listen to this. but ur not allowed to see the front. so were like ummmmm. ok. it turned out to be shannon nole. or however you spell his stupid name. heehee t’was funny! and yeah. i did do choir but i quit because it sucked. um yeah and i forgot to eat lunch.it just slipped my mind. then everyone swapped bags. well not every one but most ppl. i didnt. ph well. um then i had to go to class :(   the next class happened to be science. and i sat with arlin and malachi. and arlin was chopping bits out of malachi’s ruler and the the ruler shattered all over the floor. and then arlin decided that he wanted to draw on me with whiteboard marker. so i was like no piss of. stop. and then he went for my pants but didnt get them and then im like NO, NOT THE SHOES!!!!!!!!! and he started laughing. and yeah. he did get it on my sweater though. and all over my hands and on my book though. so i boycotted the drawing on me. and moved to a science lab desk thing where you do all the experiments. than it was time to go and i was happy because i could leave. yeah   then i came home. and finished the book i was reading called finding cassie crazy by jaclyn moriarty. which is a really good book. then i went online at 4.30 and started writing this and now i am finished at 5.59 pm on today. byebye luv ya'll  ~Lily~
