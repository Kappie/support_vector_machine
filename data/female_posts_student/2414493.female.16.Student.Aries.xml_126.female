I fell asleep during standardized testing today and was so deep in dreamland that I felt as if I were truly in bed. The history section went beyond what I'd studied so far (chapter 37) so I felt partially idiotic filling in circles based on what spotty knowledge I have from US history years before. I'm actually glad testing comes right before APs, though. There's an excuse to bypass the sometimes needless banter of teachers (i.e. Ballard) so you can actually sit down somewhere quiet and study. I need to bring music next time, though.  I feel like an idiot, really. Cheated. May 22 is a Saturday, so I can get my license on May 24, at the soonest. I always thought the 22 was a Friday. Do I just not remember anymore? Maybe it was the 21st. It was May 21. And I just called the DMV, six months are up at midnight and I can't schedule until the 24th. What terrible luck.   Am getting increasingly annoyed with Mom. She doesn't exactly see why getting a driver's license is so important to me, and insists that even when I have a license I can't go anywhere without asking. My parents are perfectly tyrannical people sometimes. First it was "going to the movies with boys" freshman year which precipitated the "you need to go to private school to learn some discipline" period. Other campaigns to stop my normal growing up have included "you can't ride with teenage drivers" and picking me up before I ask them to. I'm just angry they can't understand. Control really isn't what a growing teenager needs when college is only a short time away.   It sickens me to see the average Chinese kid who ends up with no assertiveness or people skills because parents and culture have kept them so cooped up and only motivated by grades and college. Even worse, they're so brainwashed that they actually appreciate that kind of lifestyle. It's not a comforting example, but one of my cousins is like that. Almost sixteen, hasn't taken driver's ed. Painfully shy. I once heard the story by way of an old friend that he laughed at the f-word. Likes good food, my grandparents think he's too pampered. I respect him for other things, but seeing him just makes me resent being Chinese sometimes. What good is an academic overachiever if he has no people skills? Look around you, you know those people. Passive, with a one-track mind. And I'm probably one of them, too, and it's absolutely disgusting. How would I be now if I'd grown up free of these pernicious restraints?  I think a natural side-effect of intensive studying is apathy toward everything else. I don't know how to explain it, it's just a general feeling. There's things I want to do but I've only halfheartedly cared; I don't have the time. It's wanting, but not wanting. I don't know how it works.  It's that song again.
