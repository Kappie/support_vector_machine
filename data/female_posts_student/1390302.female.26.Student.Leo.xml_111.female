My head is pounding and my daily growing ulcer is reminding me it's still there and getting worse by the moment.  Worse possible solutions are dancing around in my head like christmas sugarplums.  Feelings of defeat and impossibility plauge me, and all the while, nothing is getting done!  I dispise being idle, I hate it with a passion.  I have to be doing something or I go crazy with a capital 'C' and getting the run around is not my best thing.  Matt's taking care of it, but not to my satisfaction...It is my opinion that he should be/have been raising more hell than he did/has.  He's trying to work the system and get everything done civily.  I say to hell with being civil, I am loosing my mind and they are shirking on their responsibility!  Crown Homes forwent their right to civility on our part when they didn't fulfill the contractual agreement to the fullest extent of it's promise.  They agreed to things they didn't give, they lied, suggestively sold, and stuffed a thousand hidden costs in the mix.  They don't deserve to be treated as well as a dog, or an ape, let alone a person!!!  So let me tell explain the ranting.  Matt and I went to Stephenville yesterday to sit around while BMH delivered and anchored the Mobile Home.  The day was a good one.  Things got done and I was feeling optomistic about this process as a whole.  We signed for the delivery, that it was level, strait, and generally stable, all was well.    Today, after getting very, very little sleep, we treked once more to Stephenville to greet the man bringing the skirting, and the men connecting the electric, water, and sewage.  When we arrived everyone was just standing around...why where they standing around?  We were greeted by the inevitable words, "There's a problem."  I wanted to stomp, kick, and cry, instead I remained calm and tried to listen to what the problem was.  Apparently when BMH had delivered the home, they hadn't set it up high enough for the sewage lines to be connected, and the mobile home was hovering over the blocks by about 6" in the back.  Then the skirting guy informed us that until it was all done he couldn't do anything for us.  Meanwhile, the contractors inform us they don't do electric, only sewage and water! WHAT!  We were told by David Wood, the bum that sold us the home, that these guys did everything for under $1000, yea right!  Anyway, everyone left with promises to return when BMH had fixed their booboo.  I almost broke into tears watching their tail lights disappear into the horizon.  This was not the plan.  Then, to top everything off, we are going to have to pay an electrician something like $750 to connect the electric, in addition to the $750 it's going to cost us to do the water and sewage...this is adding up to more than $1000.    BMH is going to fix the problem either this afternoon or tomorrow morning.  Then, the water/sewage guys are going to return tomorrow afternoon or Thursday morning.  So those two problems have been solved.  We drove home, since the drive there was a total waist of time, and called David Wood at Crown Homes.  Guess what?  He wasn't in, shocking!  Matt spoke to his manager and she agreed to speak to David tomorrow regarding the electric problems.  We are hoping they'll comp us the electricity, foot the bill for that since their Salesperson gave us serious misinformation.  Onto the other problems, there is no refrigerator or air conditioner, and several of the glass covers for the light fixtures are broken.  Mostly I am angry about the refrigerator and a/c.  These are things we absolutly cannot live without!  We found out today that they're bringing the fridge either today, tomorrow, or thursday...They had better!  We also found out that the a/c cannot be connected until the electricity is on and working.  TXU, the electric co., will not be out to connect the electricity until sometime Thursday.  So we are not going to have an a/c until Friday morning...problem, Friday is moving day.  So basically we are going to have an a/c just in time for the movers to arrive.    This has been the biggest pain in the ass I have ever dealt with, hands down!  I would never reccommend Crown Homes to anyone, not even my worse enemy.  They're irresponsible and treat their customers terribly!  Ever since we've paid for the home, they've been really nasty and unhelpful.  Today when Matt talked to the manager about all the problems the house is having she didn't even apologize for the problems, she got rude with him, and informed him she would just have to talk to David about all this, it's as if she doesn't want to take our word for it.  Whatever happened to the old slogan, "The Customer is ALWAYS right?" (Especially when they've just given you $25,000 outright!) A$$holes!  I am going to file a report with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) in that region, I am also going to look around the net and see if there is anywhere I can give them a bad raiting.  I may even consider contacting a lawyer regarding their deceptive sales practices!  Now we play the waiting game and it's about to drive me crazy!  I am not sure I can do this. My stress level is so high, the potential for an anxiety attack or two is high and my ulcer is killing me.  I am going to break down before this is done, I know it.    The worse part about this is that for once I put aside my pessimism, let my guard down, hoped and wished for the best, and got kicked in the teeth.  That will teach me to try to see the glass as half-full, or the cup as overflowing.  Kristyn
