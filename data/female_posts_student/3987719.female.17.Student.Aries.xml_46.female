After that, the Orioles never looked back. Mevin Mora had a big day, with 2 home runs. All this came against a AA pitcher, Abe Alverez, who was making his major league debut. The Orioles set aside their struggles against soft tossing left handers, and got the win for Rodrigo Lopez, who pitched six solid innings, giving up only 1 run. Then the bullpen took over, and surrendered a 2 run home run, but that came too late for the Red Sox. Final score: 8-3.  In the second game, the orioles offense came to an abrupt halt. Stymed by Tim wakefield's knuckleball, the Orioles only truly had 2 scoring opportunities. In the first inning, Brian Roberts and David Newhan had singles to put runners on the corners, but Melvin Mora lifted a fly ball to shallow left field, and Brian Roberts was thrown out trying to score on the play. In the 4th inning, Larry Bigbie and Robert Machado had singles, but the top of the order could not scratch out a run. The game was essentially decided in the bottom of the first inning, with Orioles starter Dave Borkowski issuing a walk to Johnny Damon, who advanced to second on a balk call. That balk rattled Borkowski who loaded the bases, could not field a slow bouncing ball back to the mound, and 3 runs scored.  Tonight, the orioles are facing the Minnesota Twins, and hightly touted pitching prospect, John Maine, is going to make his major league debut.
