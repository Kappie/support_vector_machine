He doesn't see what he did as wrong...he thought that fell within the scope of our agreement. I told him maybe it did, but it happened way too soon, and he said he didn't have any control over it happening. I wish I could believe a word he said, but I don't buy that line. I think what he means is that it wasn't preplanned, but he still could've stopped it if he'd wanted to. I don't think he cared either way. He totally seems like he does, and when I talk, he's really listening to me, but I cannot change the fact that it's not just me that he wants. Maybe one day it will be just me. Maybe not. I don't think I can get back into things with him, though. Not knowing that it's going to be like this. I am a monogamous girl. It's the sort of relationship that I'm happiest in. If I wanted to date around, then I'd do it, but I wouldn't string someone along that I liked just because I wasn't sure. I can't believe he's 24 and still so immature. Right now, what would make me happiest is to be in a gratifying relationship with someone worth dating. I don't know if I want to go on the marriage track just yet, but I do want to have a functioning, adult relationship. I'm done with the fucking around with other people. It's so unfulfilling, and I'm not 18 anymore.
