I went there once before on an assignment for Sociology class and had to duck out of the service early because I needed to get home; I wasn't prepared for a three hour service! But it was a good time and I want to go back.  In my essay on the church, I wrote about how nice and accepting the congregation was. And I LOVED the choir music. Who else can belt out the same five words over and over without ever losing enthusiasm?  Jesus, I'll never forget you  can go on for a good twenty minutes, and no one gets tired of it. Everyone claps and bobs and shifts their hips to the rhythm right up until the very last "you"  is sung. It was one of the coolest concerts I'd ever been to. You can just feel the love in the air.  In prayer, they all shout out encouraging words to the deacon:  Amen! ,  You said it! ,  That's RIGHT!  I never dreamed of doing such a thing in the conservative Baptist churches my mom took me to as a child. Services were so quiet that my own eight year old thoughts seemed to echo like tumbling lottery balls in my head. And we were forced to learn long verses of songs that felt like funeral music. Church seemed more like after school detention, something to dread and fake an illness for. At the African American churches, the services are big parties with singing, dancing, and a few quiet moments mixed in to say thanks to their heavenly host.
