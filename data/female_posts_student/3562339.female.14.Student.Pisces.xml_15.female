But it's kind of annoying because now that I've been on all of the rides, and I'm used to them and don't get the adrenaline rush anymore, which was the best ride.  Nothing is scary to me anymore.  It's kind of ironic because just last year I refused to go on any of the big rides and hated roller coasters.  Now I'm a roller coaster addict.  Let's see... I went on Talon 5 times, Steel Force twice, Hang Time thrice, Waveswinger twice, the Dominater (the green tower), Thundercreek Mountain twice, White Water Landing, Thunder Canyon, Scrambler, Enterprise, the Wild Mouse, the Seadragon,  and probably some other rides that I forgot.  There were absolutely no lines at all and no wait was longer than 5 minutes.  It was amazing.  Harry lost his manhood on Hang Time, the last time I went on it, lol.  He has like this little bag of stuff and since he got on the ride too late to stow it to the side, he stuffed it down his shorts.  What he didn't realize is that the harnesses close down at the exact point where he put the bag and it kind of got crushed up against his "manhood".  In his own words, "It hurts every time we swing forward."  He was like seriously screaming from pain on the last part of the ride where you get held facing the ground and go downward and he was limping when he got off the ride.  It was hilarious, but I also felt really bad for him.  Eh, *shrugs*.    WE'RE GRADUATION TOMORROW!!! OMG I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!  WELSH VALLEY CLASS OF 2004 BABY!  Heh heh, according to like every teacher in Welsh Valley, we're the worst class that they've had in 25 years.  :D  ONLY 1 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
