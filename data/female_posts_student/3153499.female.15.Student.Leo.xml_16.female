You wouldnt be able to have some time alone in public because there would always be cameras watching.  2. Where do you think it is fair to have cameras installed? Not fair? I think that it is fair to have cameras installed in public places, such as buses, trains, taxi cabs, police cars, bus stations, train stations, airports, stores, banks, office buildings, and other commercial and public locations. I dont think that it that cameras should be installed in living areas, such as homes, apartment rooms or hotel rooms. It also shouldnt be installed in public restrooms.  3. What is your opinion on this subject? I think that installing cameras in public is a very safe idea. That way, more criminals could be caught. I dont think that there is a bad side of this. Neither do I think that there is an invasion of privacy, because cameras would only be installed in public areas, meaning that no one could have had privacy in the first place anyways.  4. If you feel that this is an invasion of privacy, how do you feel governments should help increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats? I dont feel that there is an invassion of privacy so I feel that installing cameras in public areas would be the best way to increase protection from the inclining terrorist threats.
