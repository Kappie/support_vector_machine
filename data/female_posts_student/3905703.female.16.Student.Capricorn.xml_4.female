We started with Classified Ads, and the first thing that you think of is Matrimonials. Actually before starting on the writing skill, we were sitting idle for 15 mins. So we decided to ask some people about what they would write if they were looking for their partners ( sometime later in life). The best answer which we got was Ajay's which was - "I would like to have a wife with whom I could have an intellectually stimulating conversation." After this we all shut up.  Another interesting thing is the new ,spiky haircut which Apoorv has got. Its obnoxious. Though some people beg to differ (eg. Priyam). Vijeta has also got spikes, though in his very interesting speech in the assembly he declared that having spikes is not what Gen X is all about , vagera vagera.  Otherwise , life is still very dull.What with Physica and Chem still being very big bores...
