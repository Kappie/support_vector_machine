I just sent him an email saying this:  Nathan, I know you really like me but I don't like you that way.  Sorry, but I like someone else.  I don't mind being your friend but I don't want to go any further.  Sorry if any feelings were hurt.  -Julie  I can't keep my feelings inside anymore.  It was hard, yet easy to write this letter.  What's done is done.  I wipe this filth away from my hands.  Now I can finally be happy again.              -Julie LeBlanc
