It was superb :) and the way the conductor rearranged the Preludium and Allegro was so cool...it became so grand! Anyway, b4 the concert, i met yuxin at PS and guess what, suddenly i received an sms from J saying he saw me. I was like quite shocked ay myself for being so blur cos he said he walked past me and i didnt even see him. Sigh. Anyway, i was to see him later to pass the ticX to him anyway.  Talking about passing ticX, i met J.L to take the ticX at the esplanade library and i tell u it was awkward. Thank goodness it only lasted for a few seconds. Lol. Then after i took the ticX J came along and i passed it to him. Not as awkward as last time, i suppose. Lol. Then me and Yuxin went to the roof terrace. The view was ok lar...dunno why it didn't wow me but maybe because i've been there too many times...  The concert was good and how i wished i was good enough to be part of them. Sigh. During the concert, when i looked over to where J.L was sitting, i always catch he and his fren looking at me. Sigh. I felt like I was being watched all the time. Dunno where J was...somewhere in the stalls, which i dunno where. Nvm  Guess what...after the concert mama actually allowed me to go home with my frens!! Yay...I tell u, i was laughing all the way through the CityLink man cos Gail kept telling lame jokes until i think ppl think we all a bit xiao liao. Lol. But it was so funny. O yah, then i got this sms frm J...he asked me to accompany him for his mep exam!! I was like "sure definitely". Lol...i really look forward to it. But imagine tt day when mrs chan sees us on the exam date. She'll be quite shocked. And suspicious. Lol. No lah...not suspicious lar...what's there to suspect.  But good news aside, Amoi got admitted again and this time i know that time is running out. He's going for dylysis tomorrow liao...and tt means he needs a kidney very very soon and yet, no one has asked me to be a donor...is it because i'm too young? But i'm scared to offer myself too...but if they ask, i will go...sigh...wish me good luck for the days of unpredictability ahead...
