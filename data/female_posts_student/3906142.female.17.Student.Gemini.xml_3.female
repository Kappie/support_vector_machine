I would be 20 years old 3 years later and is no longer a teenager.    Some would say it is a great moment for me, because I would turn 21 soon and I can be freed from any "home control". But I don't think i would be overjoy with that idea of turning 20 years old. Because I still love my teenage life now... Haha.    3 years passes fast, especially if I never pay much notice to it. For the past 4 years, it had been wonderful and nostalgic for me. 4 years of education in my secondary school had gave me lots of memories, happiness and also sadness..    10 years later, I would be an adult, 27 years old. At that time, I do hope my parents would still be with me. I love my family members and my parents love me a lot too. It is "love" that bonded us together as one, and I dare not think of the day when my mum or dad would leave me.    I have a nephew who is 3 years old this year. He is very adorable and lovely baby. His innocent eyes, chubby cheek and naive laughter often lighten my days and erased my stress some times. I dote him the most because he is very innocent, with no motive... Human beings are very scary, and you are not be able to judge a human being by they way they talk to you. Even a friend whom you have known for a life time might betray you, and this is human's nature. It is really very scary, and it is only during adolescent period when they r the purest.    How I hope my nephew can be a baby forever, as it would be the best time for him in his life. With no worries, no pain and no stress, won't that be great?   Sometimes I do hope there is a device which can be used to erase unhappy memories, or perhaps if necessary, delete happy memories away too. Having lots of memories about the past might not be a good thing too. When you recall those happy moments you shared with someone, it could be nostalgia sometimes. And when you realise those are just memories and that it might not happen again in the future, you might just felt depressed about it. And that is when happy memories could cause you to feel sad. If that is the case, why not just let me start all over again, at the point when I need not carry any memories and start my life all over again?
