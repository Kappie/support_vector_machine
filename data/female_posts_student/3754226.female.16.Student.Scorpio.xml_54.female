Real love won't change you, though.    Biblically, love can overcome anything. I mean here anything. I guess this means that I have to believe in it. But then, I've never experienced true love. It would be hard to believe that some people as what they have felt of known, they have known love. Not in my parents, not in boyfriends, not in friends - not through or from anyone. Because love, contrary to what we all expect, is not perfect. Love is nothing fancy. In the purest form, it's you down on your knees serving another. Love can't make anyone into anything they're not. And if you're honest with yourself, you don't love someone and want them to change, you love them for who they are right then and there, or you've never actually loved them at all, you only loved yourself. Romantic love doesn't mean you'll get to be with that person you love or you get to cuddle with that special someone for a day just to prove that it is love. So maybe you were told love can conquer all. It can, but real love does not seek its own. Some things it will not set out in conquest after, I've seen what love can do and what it can't do; but this I know... REAL love never fails. It's always there, regardless of what happens. It's not circumstantial. The moment it is, it's no longer love. That's what love is to me.
