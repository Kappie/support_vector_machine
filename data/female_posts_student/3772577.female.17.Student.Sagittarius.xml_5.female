He asks questions that he doesn't know the answer to, doesn't know what he's asking or expecting the answer to be.    'Be your own person,    there's more to life than me and horses.' Frick. I think i know that. it's you who doesn't seem to grasp that there's more to your life than me. Turn it around and he doesn't know how to deal. He's a one way street man. What does he know about what life is to me without him or horses. He doesn't know the real me and never has.    'Find yourself Whereis teh real you?'   Imisplaced her.   'Where? Find her'   She's gone in a yellow and white shoebox under the bed that containsthe remains ofa happier life. You're not touching her you've never known her...   She's dead   'Why?' She died with The Horse   'So what without your dead horse your not happy?' 'Don't expect so much to happen...just relax, don't want so much'       There's more to life than horses you know it's true just listen to me i am giving up i try to help there's more to life find things that make you happy this is a breakthrough, why are you miserable, i love you babe, without some dead horse you're not happy?....There's more to life than horses you should realize that...         I don't know what more to write I am numb I am confused at my own anger and emotions in a way not though i feel better having cried but worse for this outburst because evenfor all these words I can't finda reason for it. The Horse meant so much more to me than he will ever know and that makes me upset because I love One Way Street Man, and I want to share everything with him, every experience every pain every joy, just as I want him to share his with me. I can't though I have a block I feel that since he doesn't know at all what i am going throughmy confidences with him are wasted. He doesn't know where to begin to help me. I dont' talk to him about all the times that I cry and all the days of pain but it hurts so much more not to tell him. In a close relationship like ours, that we shouldn't even be in at our stage of maturity, you feel so incredibly close to your partner that you cannot hide anuthing. aaaahhh running in circles here.    I know that I have lost who I am. and I have given up hope on that. it's ironic tahthe should bring up that I should be myself when it's he who was the reason for my loss of self.I'll remember that though. It's gonna come up again, this find yourself bulltweet. When I go my way; 'well sweety i am being my own person, i've found who I am'   yeah right i am too attached. But that's a whole other heartache.    'Think about what I said' (Which was all spit in the wind)   I don't want to.   'Chickenshit'   ...ouch. i love you too.   That too will   come to bite you in the ass my friend. That too.    I jsut don't want to fight with him. I want to be ok with him, but why taht is not so is also a whole other story. I thought taht this rant would make me feel better. Before I wrote this I cried and yelled and mowed the lawn with such force it was done in less than half the time it usually takes. I was purely emotional then. Now I am upset deep in me I feel the hard coil of upsetness in my stummy and it's not a good feeling. I don't want to go to sleep like this and don't want to feel that familiar dark scary/yet confortable cave feeling of depresssion settling in. But it is.    I want to enjoy life i do, he does't realize that at all, but I can't. There is nothing for me without horses. Instead of saying find other things that make you happy besides horses, why didn't he ask me why I can't be happy with horses again because really that's what my healing quest is all about. To be able to be happy around horses again and not feel physical pain. Horses = Life I am hollow otherwise. I wish he could be here to read this adn then to hug me...after I use him as a punching bag. Is love like this? Somehow I don't quite think so.      "A sea of salt tears that the angels have cried..."    -Jerusalem by Yael Wand      that's all for tonight folks
