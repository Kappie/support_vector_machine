Flora is very beautiful in this series acting as Isabelle (Belle) and I love Belle to bits.  . I wouldn't know who to choose either if I were like Belle. But of course, my love life is not as exciting. No "love triangle". Although I should be thankful that such thing does not happen to me, I just think that it would be so much more exciting to have a love life like Belle. Hmmm.. By the way, I already knew the story and ending of this series, and I surely don't want to end up like Belle.      Two days ago, I had bought the VCD set of "A Case of Misadventure" and also Flora's first movie, "Love Au Zen". Had finished watching all these. ACOM is quite nice, very funny at certain parts. But the movie was a bit like after watching you will ask, "Huh??? Is that all?"
