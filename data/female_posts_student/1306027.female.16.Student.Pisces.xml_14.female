There were people all ages running around the dressing areas and stretching and practicing in the halls. It brought me back to my younger days at church singing things, without the spandex naturally. By the curtain call I was was convinced that I had an awesome time. So maybe it wasn't that bad after all. Well, except for the fact that crissy's little sister chucked on my new shirt....  But back to the pain- Standing around for 3 1/2 hours one night and then standing for 4 the next day can tend to cause major muscle spasms (Insert picture of a leg shaking very violently). Rest? Forget it- I have a life. I will probably just keep going until I am A. Forced to sleep, or B. Become Narcoleptic(spelled by fonix,ha). Right now B looks like he better choice.
