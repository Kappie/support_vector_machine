One of my friends was insulted in front of nearly the entire school, and I was appalled.  It was a singing competition, and my friend was pelted with oranges and apple cores. Afterwards, she freaked out, and I would have too. Blaiming the fruit on the people she didn't hang out with, the preppy/trendwhores. Someone was there listening. Someone who blaims me for being a hypocrite, and talknig behind people's backs. (Not true)  I walked into Socials. Put down my books. Heard my friend's name mentioned. Look up. See this same person telling these people about her breakdown. Calling her a dramaqueen, etc.  I was furious. Here he sat lecturing me on not doing that, and he turns around and does it himself. Is he exempt from the rules? Besides which, if you had just done something on stage, and booed, and had things thrown at you, wouldn't you be the TINIEST bit peeved? It gives you the right to rant, if not condemn the school itself.  I can't believe I even go to a school where this would happen. I was mortified. Embarrassed. I'm very much tempted to make an appeal to the student council and give the school a huge lecture of respect. Because that was the most inconsiderate thing I've seen. Not to mention the episode of the "dramaqueen" after.   ------------------ My best friend lied to me. To my face. Upsetting? Right at this point, you'll all say, wow...that sucks. There's more.  In August, we were fooling around and junk, and we talk about the fact we were virgens, blah blah. And we fooled around, knowing that it was just innocent curiosity, and stuff..something to bring us clsoer together. And when the moment happened, when we both weren't, boy, cool.  I talked to him today. Asked if I was still. Scoff. No. Asked him. No. Asked him when he did it.  End of May.  I freaked. Knowing that something so special COULD have been based on a lie, knowing that there was no limits to what we were doing, knowing...I'm hurt. It's undescribable. Although I told it to Annetta quite well.  In short, I don't know what to do. The person I trusted most in the WORLD, with everything, has suddenly gone out on me like a lamp. I'm so alone.  And even Peter's been difficult. And life with Adam has only gotten more tangled and confusing.  Two days til Con. Two days til Con. If I couldn't say that, I'd die.
