The movie leaves you pondering... I was so happy that when Seemanti joined us later on. We went to take neo prints, which turns out to be fantastic! Amazing that we haven't take neo prints together. What were we doing for the past few years? We were just roaming around Hereen. Oh, we were attracted to the shop with the neon sign "Nude girls live". Yup, that shop. In case anyone is wondering, it just a shop selling lingerie. Ah, I remember walking past the tattoo shop, and there was this guy with a stony face, guess he didn't appreciate all these people gawking at him. Then when we walked past again like 20 mins later, he was still there, except he was topless with a curtain drawn. I bet it must have hurt.(shudders) There was a little drama we had at Burger King at Far East. Seemanti left her phone there, when we went back it was gone. The cleaning lady denied seeing her phone. We requested to the manager that they checked the dustbins, while Divya called her phone. But it was in vibration mode. Nothing was found in the bins. Just when we were at a loss of what to do, the lady took out her phone. The manger asked her where she got it from, and she claimed it was from the bin at the back. Without making a fuss, we left. But we were adamant she took, she thinks we are stupid of what?(rolling my eyes) And that's kinda sum up our little adventure. It was great to meet the rest after so long. Hopefully, we will still be able to meet up like that in the near future!
