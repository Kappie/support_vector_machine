The Constitution's primary purpose is to protect America's human beings and insure their rights. If it causes no harm to another, I strongly believe a human being should be allowed to embrace his or her beliefs and values. I do not see this as an issue of whether the gay population is right or wrong to believe what they do, but an issue of how far the American goverment is willing to push its citizens' rights. America stands for freedom. An amendment to the constitution will not eliminate America's gay population, it will only oppress it and eliminate the freedom which America was built on.
