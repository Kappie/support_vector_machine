So I get to school in the morning and first thing I get is crazy ranting from Jess: "Mrs. Battaglia's taking my Lo-Lo away! She's taking all the journalists and I won't let you go! No, no no...etc." And I didn't undrstand what the heck was going on. And she wouldn't stop yapping and pretty soon I got frustrated. Hah. So Mrs. Battaglia herself comes in and explains (in a comparatively lucid manner) that I have to go down and interview Dick van Dyke.   I don't know him, but I watched Mary Poppins ages ago and I suppose I've heard some of his songs in my lifetime, but he's another affable old man with white hair and smiling eyes. I wish all grandpas could be like that. Got his autograph, but Mrs. Battaglia has it now.  Bearing.  It rained today. Girls in flip flops (me) and skirts (not me) struggling in the wet weather, complaining of the cold and the dampness and the inconvenience and the ruined hairdo. It's amazing how much we complain. You think of starting a conversation with someone and it'll most likely be some sort of complaint that the other party sympathizes with. I complain profusely in here. I complain in my journal. I complain to my friends, to authority, in my head.  Counting white blood cells in physio. Kill me if I have to be a lab technician twenty years hence, for I can't stand looking in microscopes for vague blue blobs in a sea of red specks and identifying which kind of vague blue blob that particular vague blue blob is.  So off-season tennis. I say something to T. She turns around: "OH MY GOD!" I think it's something serious. She continues, "I CAN'T HEAR YOU WHEN YOU MUMBLE LIKE THAT! SPEAK UP!" and she goes on to say how she can't hear me in mock trial and blah blah blah. I just wanted to cry, but I just laugh now because that's the way I'll deal with it and it's a petty little thing. Not what I needed at that point, needless to say. I just wanted to crumple up and yell...nobody else has that problem. Or at least they don't OH MY GOD! me about it. But perhaps the problem is in that nobody ever tells me. It all comes back to mock trial, too. After E decided not to join this year and after I stopped talking to R and everything, I just sit there during the lulls in the proceedings and I just sit there. Personally, if I were alone and not talking to anyone I wouldn't mind (but then again, who would?) but I just don't like it. There's something isolationist and antisocial and just flat out LONER about stuff like that, and it irritates me.   What if they look at me as they do M? What if they get together in their posses and comment on my dress, my behavior, my opinions? What if they said "You know, I've tried hard, but there's nothing I can find to like about that Lydia," like J said about M. I don't fit a niche. I'm not the bitch--A fills that role in the "servant" sense and J does in the "tough female" sense--nor the coquettish ones, as the H's are, or the wisecracking ones, as L and M are, or the ones who just prefer to be alone. J and A and G--the seniors--will talk about their things. It's funny that it starts to irritate me now, of all times. But whose fault is it? will things change when LYDIA SPEAKS UP?  Thinking of many things. Holding on tight. SUCKING IT UP. Not a suck-up.  It's kind of strange explaining to the likes of K and A that maybe I've decided to alter my fundamental beliefs a bit. Wow, that sounded too high and mighty. I used to be the type of person like I or S or just someone who lived for school, who centered universes around that institution that means less and less to me every day. I laugh at those people now, particularly the socially inept ones (A reports that the trainee at Los Robles last week--S--was putting down love. "It has to be devotion, not attraction," he said. Would I have said that too just six months ago? I don't care about love now. Whatever happens happens, even if it's just casual little attractions. I know it's not going to hit me now, so why bother?). I observe their defiant anti-mainstream behavior.   And I cringe to think that I was once someone like that. Don't deny it, I was, and it only helps to recognize it. Living with regret.  So I'm still not happy with that #2 in math or the #4 in English, but what will I do now? I still have the desire to stick it through and do well; I'm not giving up completely. But while life passes me by, I just want to go out and ENJOY MYSELF, even if it means sacrificing that sacrosanct A+ for an A.  You see, I've been lucky to see more well-rounded people in my life than I ever will. Please don't think there are many well-rounded people within the confines of stuffy Westlake High School. I want to be able to just sparkle and shine, I guess, to be that one girl that everyone respects but still considers very approachable. Progress in my case is visible, but still, I suspect, not as significant as J preached. I know what I'm talking about, do you? That pretty, on-top-of-things Asian girl who has a healthy social life and supportive friends, who excels in academics and in extracurriculars, who, above all, has an invincible sense of self-confidence and control.  And that's the ambition that separated me from the hardcore nerds? OH please.
