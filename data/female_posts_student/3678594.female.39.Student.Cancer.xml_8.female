I love reading about food and other people's cooking adventures.  Needless to say, I am a big fan of  cookbook projects . Not only is it fun to read about people's experiences with recipes, but it's handy if you have the book and want to know which recipes are 'must tries' and which are 'avoid at all costs'!  Lately, I have been thinking about doing my own cookbook project. The book I have in mind is  How To Be A Domestic Goddess  by Nigella Lawson. It is a gorgeous book filled with mouth-watering goodies, and my daughter is really big on baking right now, so I thought it would be fun for her, as well.  I do have a couple of challenges though. It is definitely not a vegan-friendly book, so the recipes I choose will require tinkering. That's okay because I'm used to playing around with ingredients and I have a pretty good idea what works and what doesn't. The other possible stumbling block is that I have the British [metric] version and not the American [Imperial] one. To be honest, I'm much more comfortable with cups and teaspoons than I am grams and ounces.  But, hey, that's part of the fun! Right?
