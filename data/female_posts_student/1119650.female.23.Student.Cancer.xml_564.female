I've decided the internet is no longer the abounding happy playplace that it once was and so I leave this blog in the capable hands of the Don.  Maybe I'll pop in from time to time to give y'all a guest post, but if you know where to look you'll prolly find me.  Behave and don't do anything I wouldn't do.
