He headed David Beckham's free kick into the top right corner of the goal. The first ball that managed to get past Barthez in 12 games. While the England supporters went wild and started singing the national anthem, my heart sank. France had so many opportunities at the goal but they were simply off tonight. Or rather, this morning. David James (England's Goalkeeper) thus had plenty of footage showing him throwing in the ball over and over again. England had scored in the 33rd minute, just before half time, and the score remained 1-0 all the way into the second half. By the 80th minute I was starting to lose hope and told myself 'this doesn't look good'. The game became stagnant as the players merely passed the ball from one side of the field to the other.   I must commend the England players for their effort though. You could see that they were really trying. Beckham played a great game and Neville got a bloody head while trying to head the ball but still bravely stayed on in the game. Rooney, however, hogged the screen most of the time especially in the first half where he displayed his use of brute force against the French players. He makes use of his big body mass to ram into or block off French players so that he can clumsily dribble the ball along the sidelines, and kick it out. This clumsy goofball should be playing rugby instead of giving England a bad name. Deciding to put this 17 year old on forward must have been a great challenge for Coach Eriksson who finally took him out in the second half. Hot favourite, Owen, on the other hand barely had contact with the ball, and even lesser footage. He too, was taken out of the game in the second half. Barthez could be seen strolling around the goal line waiting for England to attack until Beckham, who took most of the shots, had a second free kick. This was swiftly blocked off by Barthez, France's life saver.  There was 3 minutes added time because of all the fouls and change of players. These 180 seconds proved to be the turning point as well as the conclusion of this game. Zidane took a free kick 20 seconds into added time. Not surprisingly, he scored. England had lost their lead and it became a draw. But the climax came when James rushed forward to tackle Henry, giving him a huge fall and France's second free kick in 2 minutes. All eyes were now on Zidane as he did a slow run towards the ball, carefully swiping it. The stadium went quiet as the tension and suspense kicked in. (pun intended) The ball took forever to fly through the air. I felt the anticipation and excitment. It curved exquisitely and shot past James' head into the net! ZIDANE SCORES AGAIN! France goes wild! This is the first time they have beaten England in an international competition. England was still in shock. And I can finally go to bed.
