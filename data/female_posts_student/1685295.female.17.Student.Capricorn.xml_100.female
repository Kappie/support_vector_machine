They are really fast. Anyway, today I hung out with Summer Gypsy and Zhang. We had fun, I got to be a  massuer , the guy who gives massages. Man I can't spell for the life of me. Also today Summer Gypsy was introduced to Family Guy, the  bset   best freaking show ever! Have a safe and hopefully not so drug free night.
