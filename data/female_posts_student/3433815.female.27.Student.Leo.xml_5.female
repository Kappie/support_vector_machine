So I was able to put off turning in my paper / presentation till NEXT wednesday! but still haven't really started it... The topic is kinda interesting, but not something I would like to write a paper on (ordained catholic women). I will do it, last min of course. I don't like summer classes. Hey KZ and Bitr when are you guys ever free?? we need to go out, get away, just relax, no hubby, kids, or anyone that needs you. Just sit back and breathe. oh, and no painful shoes. Ugly ones are ok. Have a good night, and take a chance K, I have, with no regrets. :)  Loveya :x
