I really worry about the people that I care about...sometimes too much. ^^;; blah.  But yeah..I got a lovely sight yesterday talking to my friend pete online...x.x god...I swear, I'll just need someone to take my eyes out for a while...cuz, yeah. He was on a webcam when we were talking..and he decided he wanted to show me his dick..and then he started  masturbating !! I freaked out...that was something that I really didn't need to see...at all...>.  But yeah...*shrug* I dunno. I'm mostly just worried...so that's really the only news I have...^^; so...yeah. baiobaio
