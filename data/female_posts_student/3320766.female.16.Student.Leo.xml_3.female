I see my thoughts as sometimes I see people - a big blurry blob as if I've been swimming in a pool for hours. I have to pick out certain thoughts and every now and then I slip and I can't speak just one thought - there are just too many. And at other times my mind goes blank and i don't know what i'm saying. Sometimes when my thoughts get too much for me I have a black out. It cuts me from reality chasing me into the Kingdom. My mind clears up. People say I act like someone else but everything gets switched off and I don't remember. I'll look at the clock - the bastards stole time from me!!! I'm finding things difficult to do, just everyday things. I forget to brush my hair, to go to sleep, to eat, to go to appointments. I get easily distracted and I can't concentrate on too much or I'll throw a fit like a wining child who doesn't get their way.
