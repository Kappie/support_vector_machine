We drove back to SA... and stopped at Jim's to eat lunch... then went on to the TR vs. Austin Westlake game... TR put up a valid fight... the final score was 9-3 in favor of Austin Westlake.  But, it was fun.  Anyhow, after that I took him to his parent's, and I got to see his baby sister... she's so adorable.  Then later that night Melissa, her brother Brandon, Wolf, and I went to see "8 Mile."  I thought it was a good movie, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one.  Me and Melissa are G-Dawg Homies now... ;-)  Then after the movie we went over to the Ansley's to see Ricky and all of them... we watched the end of "Ocean's 11" with them... and then left...  Then we got back to Melissa's... and I was there for a few minutes...  I drove my car by her while she walked her dog to the stop sign and back... :-)  Then I went home because I was tired and I was going to church this morning.  At church we had a visitor pastor, and Ron helped with the service.  That's always interesting!  Anyhow, I had bumped my knee on one of the book racks when I was going in front of my Mom in the pew to get to my seat.  I bumped my bad knee.  It hurt... bad... to say the least.  Anyway, after a while I checked it cause it felt like it was swelling up.  It was a bit... but after the sharing of the peace the older lady at the end of the pew (Iona Tronson) scooched over down the seat towards me... and she asked, "Is that a tattoo on your ankle or the top of your boot?  I couldn't tell and I want to see it up close!"  haha  It was funny... she was so excited that I had a tattoo.  She's one of the "excentric" old ladies of the church.  :-)  I wouldn't be all that surprised if SHE has a tattoo somewhere on her body.  I don't even want to venture a guess of WHERE it is.  hehe  It was just funny.  Anyhow, I chatted with Ron after the service, and he (of course) gave me a huge hug... and picked me up while he was hugging me and twirled me around.  He's so funny!  But he was saying he hoped I could catch a few of his gigs during the holiday break.  His wife is taking a class (or two or more?) at UTSA this semester.  She had asked me how everything was going, and I told her I was just waiting for the semester to be over with lots of anticipation.  I'm so ready for the semester to be over.  I'm ready for this week, too.  I get to register (FINALLY!).  So, that's what I'm doing this week... I also finish my last psych lab tomorrow... and on Thursday I have one of the LAST music quizzes of the semester.  YAY!  That's all I have for now... I'll post more later in the week.        urlLink  postCount('17Nov2002');
