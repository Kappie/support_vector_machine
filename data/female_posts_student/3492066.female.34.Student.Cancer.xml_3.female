Got up in time to take my sister and my almost 4-year-old nephew for a 10:30 a.m. meeting about where he was going to be going to school.   A year ago last January, my nephew, Brendon, was diagnosed as being severely hearing- impared in the right ear, and completely deaf in the left. We had been noticing early on that he wasn’t responding to noises like a normal child does, and after we ran some home tests over Christmas, we knew something was wrong. Add to that, the local Parents as Teachers program person had also noticed as well. So, this past December a cochlear device was implanted into his left ear.  A cochlear implant is a relatively simple device...well, relatively, as well as a small one. The device itself is installed under the skin of the scalp just up and behind the ear. A microfine wire from the device is run into the cochlea and therefor sends sound vibrations to the ear. To make the whole thing work is an electronic processor, which is worn in a fanny-pack, and has a wire with a magnet on it to connect it to the device (note: hair still grows in the place where the device is) and thereby activate it. The processor is programmed about once a month to turn up the volume level that Brendon can hear so that he’s not overwhelmed with sound all at once, and his neural pathways can be built in his brain to handle his hearing.  Oh, and to say the least, Brendon’s deafness hasn’t affected his personality to say the least! He’s a vivacious boy with curly blonde hair and the most expressive a person can be both with is face and with his body. He loves to goof around and flirt as well. He knows he’s cute and boy does he use it to the fullest extent...especially when he knows he’s in trouble with me or his mother. It’s so hard not to laugh when he does it, too. He just gets these riotously cute or goofy expressions on his face, and it’s obvious that he’s deliberately trying to get us to laugh, and himself out of trouble. Getting the implant has only made his personality jump five-fold. I keep telling my sister and her husband that we need to watch him when he gets into his teens, I have a feeling he’s going to be a heartbreaker or an actor. I mean really, watching “A Knight’s Tale,” he gives me the impression of looking like a four-year-old version of Heath Ledger, or even Heath Ledger’s character. Heck, I’ve even gone so far as to keep him in mind when I’m thinking of one of my characters in the “Tanwin” series...Carver ap Hugh...although I can’t say that I’ve ever written about Carver when he was four (only at 10 and 18 thus far), I can easily see him being a bit like Brendon...but as an only child.   Brendon has an older sister, Meghan, who is just about five and a half now, and she’s a personality unto herself. She’s a drama queen and we wonder if bits of her aren’t hopping ahead into teenage-hood with all the dramatics and fits she throws. It’s almost as if she’s trying on emotions, blowing them way out of proportion to see how they work, and driving us all nuts in the process because we’re trying to figure out what’s going on.  The great thing about all this is...well, for starters both Lloyd and myself are sort of getting a training course in how to take care of kids, and seeing how the other gets on with children. Needless to say, Lloyd has no problem at all, Meghan and Brendon love playing with him, and he’s definitely a kid at heart...although the body is having fits trying to keep up at times. Add to that, they’re my sister and her husband’s children, so when our nerves are close to being shot for all the attitude my niece gives us when she’s tired, cranky, and just wants her way (“Are we going to the grocery store?” “Yes Meghan, we’re going to Aldi’s.” “Aldi’s isn’t a grocery store!” “Yes it is, Meghan.”). Add to that, she’s gotten into her head that every time I take my sister somewhere then we also must go to McDonalds...or at least she subjugates us with the question “Are we going to McDonalds?” constantly. She’s got this thing about willful, stubborn, persistence. She has her view of the world and that’s that.  Tomorrow morning I get to climb out of bed to take my sister to the OB-GYN for her ultrasound. Yep, there’s a third child on the way, although it’s doing a great job of giving her aunt (me) the fits, or at least the worries. My sister has spotted early on in the pregnancy, but the doctor checked her out repeatedly, kept an eye on her, and said all was well. Then last week my sister mentions that she hasn’t felt the baby kick yet. I probably turned white as a ghost while she just looked at me and said, “What?” My sister is Mrs. Pregnant-Mother-Knowledge-Woman. Although she hasn’t gone to medical school, she seems to know the stuff like the back of her hand, and what she doesn’t know she talks to her doctor about; thankfully she doesn’t take chances. Then there’s me, who is more fearful than normal folks about her loosing the child. Granted, she’s never miscarried before, and the baby’s heartbeat has been found...I just have vague memories of my mother’s miscarriages and the one baby girl that was still-born when I was five; it wasn’t until I was in my mid-teens that it got explained to me why my mother hadn’t come home from the hospital with a baby back then. Note: my sister is just shy of eight years younger than I am. Anyhow, something I’ve come to realize is that part of me is very much tied in with my niece and nephew and my sister, and that a still-birth or a miscarriage effects more than just the mother and father...it effects the whole family. That, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever have children. I’m hoping that I do, but I’m not sure when it’ll happen or if it will happen.   So, that’s the day in a nutshell. Meanwhile, my future mother-in-law, I guess I’ll dub her Mom Sung-cha (her nickname is Sandy, but I like her Korean birth name better) since I call her “mom” anyhow...she’s pretty much adopted me, although she’s not giving me chores...yet. As I was saying, though, she’s working on going to visit her daughter, Chris, down in Nashville. Lloyd’s younger brother, Court, used to work for an commercial airline and part of his package for leaving was that he got tickets for a year. The catch is, those tickets are only valid if there’s a seat available. If not, then the ticket gets bumped to the next flight out. She’s hoping to go Thursday morning and be back Saturday morning, but who knows. Admittedly, I’m up for some private time with Lloyd when Court’s out of the house. I just have a mental lock on getting all lovey-dovey when someone else is in the house. I don’t know, I just get embarrassed at the thought that someone will hear me, and worse it being a relation that will then perhaps tease me or just give me funny looks. I’m self-conscious in that manner.  Meanwhile, I have a gaming convention to prepare for  urlLink Die Con 4   only I now have to e-mail the head of the con that I won’t be able to make it for the Friday 2 p.m. game I was scheduled to run because I need to run my sister and nephew to his speech therapist. I also have to e-mail my friend Mike to tell him I won’t be able to make the game this Sunday because I’d already scheduled to run a game for Die Con that day.  You know, for being off from school I’m awfully busy. It’s almost as if folks, namely my family, have been waiting for me to get out of classes so that I can do stuff for them.  My life is not boring!
