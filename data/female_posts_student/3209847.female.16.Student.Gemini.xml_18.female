How has everybody's day been? My day has been GREAT! ...  The AP Euro test. It wasn't too bad. I probably got about a 40 on the Multiple Choice, I didn't even start over-analyzing, and I didn't go back to check when I was finished. I think I wrote a really good DBQ though! We shall see, won't we? I really hope I did okay though!  After the test I went to the Parks Mall with Sarah. It was really great because NO ONE was there. And i hate when it's so crowded! We went to exchange her size 9 converse that i got her to a size 8 at Journey's! Now she has fitting shoes and they look really awesome on her! After that we ate at Sbarro's. Got stuffed. Oh yeah! After we ate, we went to Hot Topic to finally spend my $85's worth of gift certificates that i have from there! We got so much cool stuff! She got a REALLY awesome hat! Looks very good in it too..  What we got at hot topic: 1. Gray hat 2. Lots o' shoe laces 3. A Stewey Shirt that says "Quit mocking me" I believe 4. A Rocky Horror Picture Show shirt  5. Some Office Space stuff for my Dad and Mr. Newberry  So yeah, we were "shopaholics" today! It was kind of fun, especially when NO one was there! I loved that. After we went to Hot Topic, we got a starbucks and then drove back to my house. She helped me study for my pre-cal test tomorrow! I feel VERY confident in the material. I really hope I do well. I need to do well on this test! It shouldn't be too hard. I know how to do every single review question, so it shouldn't be too hard =). Oh! She needs to quiz me some more tonight on the nth term and sum formulas for geometric and arithmetic series. I'll do that later! I don't feel like it right now! I miss her ALREADY. She only left about 10 minutes ago. Well I really don't know what else to post about except that tomorrow will be fun because we are going to swim. Friday will be easy because it's english and chem! I'll post some more later on! I think i'm going to do some quizilla quizzes and post them up here, hehe.   Buh-bye! *kisses* to sarah!
