So i thought that was cute. And a thought came to mind, about my past. It has nothing to do with the Jesus game or anything. But we were talking about dogs and cats fighting. And a picture of me when i was like 8,crawed up on the floor out side in grass. And having my Dog at the time being chased by some wild dog. I was out side and heard this barking, and then a dog coming my way. My dog would never hurt me. But that other one, when i was on the ground came up and smelled me. I got sooo scared. But it ran away. I dont remeber after that. But yal want another memior... something that came to mind... Well i have never been kissed, and this was in 7th grade. (Duh.. Cassy not kiss yet... i wish...)But anywyas. I was dating this guy, well really not dating, we never talked, never hanged out. Nothing. But then he started hanging out with this other girl. And i or he, i dont know, said it was over. But a while after that, i dont remeber how long, he started flirting wth me again. So he walked me home and when we were half way down the hill his lips and touge some how found a way to my mouth... What the heck? It was on the side of the freakin street! And i tripped... I didn't fall. But i did feel my foot get stuck. How horrible. And... I bumped my teeth on his... So when we stopped, he went in for the kill again, and i didn't even try. My friends saw him walking down the street smiling and high-fiving all the guys. Nothing happend after that. Then at 12 i think, my friends and i were liking hanging out with 16-17 year old guys, and we ended up in one of there rooms. And this guy named Jessie and i started to kiss. Nothing long or anything. But then afterward, he pulled me closer to him, and just held me... I was like what is going on? There is nothing goin on here. We are just friends, why are holding me. I was kind of freaked out. Dont rember what happend after that. So yea... That it for right now. I can go on with memiors...
