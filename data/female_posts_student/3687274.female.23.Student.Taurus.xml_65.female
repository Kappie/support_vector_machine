When I was actually doing what I was supposed to be doing, I was losing.  I lost 20 pounds at one point.  That lasted for all of a week I think.  So, I've gained 18 pounds back.  That's a lot of fat.  We were working out in the mornings, but now we're kinda slacking.  I should probably start again.  I still have my gym membership.  Maybe I should go there.  Maybe I should quit smoking.  Maybe I should lose weight.  Maybe I should.  I have to lose like 40 pounds, well 48.  And I'd like to lose a significant amount of that by the end of December.  Because, I'm saving money and I'm either buying material to make clothes or buy clothes.  So let's see.  If I lose 2-3 pounds a week, let's play around with 2 lbs,  I have about 20 weeks to lose 40 pounds.  I wonder if I can do it.  I'm gonna try.  Starting tomorrow.   So, I'm going to write down everything I eat and whether or not I exercise.  I'll title the blog weightloss something or another just so anyone who is totally not interested in reading about this won't.  So, okay that's it.  I'm gonna try this and I'm going to write the amount of calories and sodium and fat and everything in the foods that I eat, just in case some other fatass is trying to lose weight and needs help.  And I'll post pictures like once a month in the same clothes so everyone can see the diff.  Well, that's all.  I think that was my issue.
