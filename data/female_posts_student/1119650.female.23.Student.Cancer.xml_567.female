Yes, definitley listing St. Andrew for my Scottish heritage and not for my crush on a boy with the same name....Riiiiiiiiight.   B urton Air 45.  The snowboard I ride in the winter, although I'm contemplating switching to snowblades.  After my deck gets repainted though I might get stoked to ride again.     C ats.  I have six of them.  They're all little darlings.  (In order of girth and sheer magnitude they are: Milo, Shadow, Dallas, Paco, Rosie, Sonic.)   D eja.  My real name.  Contrary to the popular belief that its Gwen.  How's  that  for a kicker.  D is also for Dynamite, Diva, Delightful and a myriad of other adjectives that describe me.  Yes, I'm also delerious.   E ngland.  Where my best friend, Molly Beth now lives, permanently.  I hope to plan to visit her sometime soon.   F ive Point System.  I rate all guys on a five point system that could make them hot.  The 5 points are as follows: good teeth, drives a manual car, plays hockey, has the "V" muscles and nice eyes.  Currently we're running on a 4/5.  Not too shabby.   G  Gwen.  What many of you know me as.  The proper name Gwendolyn (which is not my full version of Gwen, I'm Gwenyth) means "the fairhaired one".   H awaii.  My favorite place to vacation.  I've been there twice and it was totally amazing both times and I can't wait to go back one day.  The surf the sun, the inevitable sunburn.  Luaus.  Its rockin'!   I n Transition.  The stage my life is in right now.  So much is changing for me.  Its kind of exciting.   J ack Russell Terrier.  My favorite kind of dog.  So cute.  I want one, puhleeeeeeze!  Also J is for June because I'm a June Baby (June 28th to be exact, I expect pressies!)   K ickboxing.  My newest fad excercise.  Its actually a lot of fun and I'm losing weight and acutally having fun *gasp* exercising!   L iterature.  My intended college major for when I start up again in the fall.  I'm not sure if I'm going to focus my energies and studies on medieval literature or not yet.  Thats my favorite kind though.   M aroon 5.  My favorite band.  Formerly known as Kara's Flowers.  You better go listen to them.  Now, damn it!   N extel.  My cellphone.  Its bleepy and fabu.  If only I could steal my brother's i730 then it woudl be sooooo perfect.  (Insert wierd Gollum "my precious" impression here).   O dyssey, The.  By Homer.  My favorite book of all time probably...well, except mabye for the Divine Comedy.  Seriously though, the Odyssey has it all, adventures, monsters, heroism, love.  Don't be an ignoramus.  Read it.   P iglet.  Thats basically me.  He's cute, lil, pink and has the best lil quotes like "Its hard to be brave when you're only a very small animal."  So so cute.   Q uotes.  I love quotes.  I have an entire book of quotes that I've collected over the years.  They're good for inspiring you to jumpstart your life, or inspire a painting or a written piece.  As of late my life has been filled with some pretty hysterical quotes thanks to Tim, Timmem, Ru, Gozar and Bill.   R olling Rock.  My latest beer of choice though, Magic Hat #9 is my favorite of all time.   S ushi  Sephora.  My favorite food and my favorite store.  If only there was a way to combine the two.....hmmmm.  I'll have to get the institute to work on this.   T attoos.  I have 3 of them.  I need one more but I want 2 more (to make 5 total).  Its hard to stop gettign them once you've started.  They're an addiction like crack.   U Conn.  My school!  Woo.  Awesome at 'hoops and just all around an awesome school.  Go Huskies!   V alentine's Day.  Wretch!  I hate this day more than any other lame ass, corny, made up holiday.  I hate chocolate, I hate stuffed animals and I generally don't like flowers (unless they're pink roses or those white ones tipped w. pink).  This day and all it stands for is an abomination and I'd take a nice homecooked meal over a nite out in an overcrowded restaurant with the prices jacked up to 3x what they should be.  So this year for Valentine's Day me and my Valentine are gonna snowboard and then head to Burger King where we'll don crowns and mock everyone else.   W estchester.  Best.mall.ever.  It has a Sephora, Nordstroms, Elizabeth Arden Spa.  An apple store, J. Crew, Aldo, Steve Madden, Coach, BCBG and a million other great stores.  Plus they have good sushi in the food court.  Holllllaaaaaaaaaaa!   X treme.  As in Most eXtreme Elimination Challenge. (or as Bex calls it: The Japanese Show Where People Swing From Corn).  So great.  I wanna be on it hardcore.    Y es!  Only 1 more to go!  (Sure this was a copout, but let's see you come up with something)   Z elda The Ocarina Of Time.  Best video game ever.  Even if it is for N64.  Wow,  this was acutally a lot harder than it looks.  I doubt anyone read this far, but if you did cool.  You get a gold star for the day.
