(not to be mean katie, but i just thought that that was weird.) anyway. I'm tired, and i have an english grammar test tommorow. i hate grammar.  margaret is in her room doing who knows what, and i've got to go. Jules - All you need are kisses to start a make-out party/and your invited to my make-out party
