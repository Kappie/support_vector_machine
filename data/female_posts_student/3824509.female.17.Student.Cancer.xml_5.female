I kept beating my cousin Josh at video games and he got sooo mad at me. I enjoyed it though. It was somewhat bad though I could not sleep that night. I don't know what it was I just kept thinking of a certain person.....But yeah. The next day I saw my grandma which was good because I haven't seen her in forever! Nothing much besides that...Oh I split all my Italian left overs on my jeans.....red sauce. I was mad it looked like someone died in the driveway. Speaking of dyeing I almost died coming home! It was pouring rain and I couldn't see a foot in front of me. Then some lady just ran into my lane....Yeah I almost died. hahah But anyway HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY!
