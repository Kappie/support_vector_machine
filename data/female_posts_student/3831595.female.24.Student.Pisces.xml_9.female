I'm up now and I have played through it a few times on the piano, so I am hoping to get in a nap before my dad flies in.  During the little sleep that I had, I had a dream about a parade, and (judging by my sore throat), I am fairly certain that I was singing  Stars and Stripes Forever .  I'm so odd...  Anyway, this week is gonna be a crazy one, that's for sure. My dad flies in today and there's Divisional Band tonight. I have to pick my dress up from the VERY RUDE alterations people on Wednesday, the rehearsal dinner is on Friday, the wedding is on Saturday, and we fly out to Vegas on Sunday. Add to that, all the little errands I have to do, and you've got yourself a pretty hectic week.  My summer is more or less over since the day after we return from the honeymoon, I start back to school. How sad.  A'ight, I have to get going for now... more exciting updates soon! :)
