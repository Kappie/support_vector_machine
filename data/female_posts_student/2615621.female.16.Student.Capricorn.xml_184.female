It was the youth service so it was way better than the normal church service and i hate our preacher..so yeahs.  Last nite i finally got outta the house and i went with zack, lauren and hollis to the Good Life to watch Will do this acoustic thing. We had a BLAST i swear, that was so much fun. We met some new people and sat around playing Scrabble, i hate that game with a passion but i had so much fun playing it..maybe cuz i was stoned. then me, lauren and zack went to walmart after we dropped off hollis and lauren got beads for her stuff. she made me some cute lil earrings at the Good Life..awwws so sweet. I love Will's lil sis!! shes sooo cute!! shes a kickass 4th grader..i think shes in 4th grade now. Anyways, his lil bro Jack can get annoying, but oh well. It was fun.  Hmmm....lets see....lets talk about Charlie.  Charlie goes to East, im sure ive already written about him somewhere in my blog, but we were kinda friends for a lil while then stopped talking and now we talk everyday for like literally hours. I'm going over to his house saturday nite and we're gonna camp out. Mom doesnt know that of course...she thinks im going to spend the nite with a usual friend, but shes so wrapped up in her and john that she doesnt even think to ask where im going. Sooo..this is whats happening: i was talkin to charlie and we were talkin about camping and how ive never been and how he likes to camp sometimes with his bro and get drunk, and then he told me he would set up a tent in his living room and we can camp out in front of the tv. lol awww and then he was makin fun of my stupid knee brace and it was cute. But anyways...hes all excited cuz his mom is outta town and my mom has no clue and zack is taking me to his house so far. He just lives kinda down the road, not too far. Nuttin is gonna happen anyways, cuz of my knee of course...but i like cuddling and charlie does too and he knows i like it..soooo the most that would prob happen is a lil makeout session and sleepin next to each other. More than likely we wont sleep in that tent, prob upstairs in his bed lol awwww. lol Right now though, its purely platonic. lol  Lauren is going today to meet her roomate. yay for lauren! i cant wait to hear all about it!!! :D  Anyways..off to read laurens blog and see if shes updated it!! :p  *much love and car insurence*
