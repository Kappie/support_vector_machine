By train it involves lugging junk to the train station in Innsbruck, hoping you make your train, and for the record, C. and I have at the most had 4 minutes to board on this trip.  Then getting into Verona, Italy changing trains at least once in Italy, getting to Venice, where we spent night 1, then getting up getting the train to Trieste, Italy, getting the next bus, which doubtless involves another wait, and we, being the special folk we are, got off in the wrong city in Croatia thinking we were in Pula, but actually we were in Rovinj. Bad.  Then we waited for the next bus and  got into Pula, and had to con a cabbie into taking us to our beachside getaway.   Okay so the train from Innsburck is about 5 hrs. plus wait time, then 3 more to Trieste and 3 more to Pula, unless you are stupid and get off early in Rovinj.  Today we took the Ferry back to Venice, which cut 6 plus hrs into 2.5, but actually into 3 thanks to the Venetian parade overtaking the waterways/streets.  I am so burned. I look like a lobster. What ever happened to my incredible tan I maintained through semester 2 of 1st yr, but lost in Europe?  Well it'll be back after this.  I am exhausted.  The "Wooden Cottage" or "Bungalow" on the beach was really a painted shed with no A/C and a shared community bathroom with the rest of the campsite.  Live and learn.  The beach itself was amazing and the campsite had its own restarants, and newsstands and a live band on Sat night.  Although the place itself, minus being as close to roughing it as I will hopefully come for awhile, was nice (a stretch of the word admittecly, but under the circumstances) the food was great and cheap and the water was gorgeous.  You know the crayola color cerulean, it used to be my fav when I was all of 7, well thats the exact color of the water.  The beach is rock, but not scary or uncomfortable, part of it is in big slabs where you can stretch your towel out on and set up shop.  C. and I did that all Sat.  Well, my body shows it, I am more of a purple red than a red red.  We didn't really sleep last night because we had to coordinate our ferries, and trains so we could get back. I went to sleep hearing the "band" at the campsite sing "When a Man Loves A Woman"  but obviously neither the male or female could really speak English, so most of the words were sort of fibbed.   i.e., When a man loves a woman, he'l giiiie er eryting e ccccn"  interesting yet very distracting when you are trying to sleep , but keep laughing over the made up words.  Anyway, I still need a shower, today was super hot.  Take care, glad to know my family has reappeared.
