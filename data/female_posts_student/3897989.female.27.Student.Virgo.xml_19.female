Wanting more life, more happiness, more of their Mother. I let them stargaze with me (something I usually do by myself). We camped out in the backyard Saturday night after the drive-in movie we went to see. They helped me paint my facial room in the salon today after eating lunch with my parents. We danced around the house all evening after one of my friends left!! I found a song I hid from myself on the computer by accident.."I'm Gonna Take That Mountain"..ironic for me to find that this weekend.  I did spend some time facing responsibility, I can't let myself stray too far from it. :D I went to the AMTA meeting Saturday(ended up coming home and joining via internet). The productivity had already been produced by the time I got there, so there wasn't much for me to participate in. It sounded like they had all the fun without me!! Dammit!! :D I did remember something soooo funny. My first volunteering project with MHCA at their first annual conference; the secretary had forgot the nametags and the disc was hundreds of miles away to reprint the nametags, so I took the registration of hundreds of people and stayed up till 4am making nametags for them by hand. It's funny how I got the nametag job at the AMTA annual too. Hmmm.  I stayed after the meeting and worked in the clinic until my 3:30 student massage with the male from our deep tissue class. I've always gotten great "spot" work from him, but his full body massages are not full body, or at least they weren't with me. I told him my problem areas...trigger point in left shoulder/neck, lower back, and calves...and that's all I got. I can understand if you're running out of time skip a part or two...say abdomen, face, breasts (if your fortunate enough to find one who therapeutically incorporates it!! :D) etc. But I was a bit taken back when he did calves, back, sat down to do posterior arm, turned supine and did neck and a stretch then says, "Okay, it's 4:30". Didn't even ground me!!!!! The work he did was very good and did help exactly what I came in for...but geeze, I guess I'm spoiled. I shouldn't be too harsh. I just know how I would have done it if I were him, and it wouldn't have been like that. Oh well, you live and you learn.  My massage chair was waiting on me when I got home. Thank heaven's I didn't have to face the flirtacious UPS man again! Speaking of massage chair...my old job at Owen's Company is still trying to find ways for me to stay with them!! Just work here one day a week they say. We'll find anything for you to do. I told them I might volunteer one day a month to come down there and give them chair massage on their break thinking that would get them off my back. Then they said they had already thought about asking me to come down there and do it for pay. I told them tips wouldn't hurt, but I couldn't do it for pay. They are hilarious!! I'm getting such a kick out of watching them squirm!!  I am so happy tonight. I've got to get in bed! My little ones are starting back to school tomorrow morning. I'm soooo excited! They were all excited to get their teeny bookbags packed and their new outfits all laid out. I gave my boys their little haircuts after dancing so they'd be tired and sit still. They got up half a dozen times before they finally went to sleep though :D. Adorable little angels!! My little girl has already bonded with her new teacher and is so excited to see all her friends! I love my babies. I feel great things are going to happen to us this year.  My poor ex's luck keeps getting worse though. I don't understand it. They did a pert test on his land finally after waiting a month for them to come out. Then the fellow who did it gets in a wreck and it's in his impounded vehicle locked up. Even after they get it, it'll have to stay on the environmental dept's desk for 10 days. They could come out an redo it but the fellows who were doing something on the foundation ran over the holes and damaged what they did.  To beat all that, his truck has been running badly he says. I let him take my car to the store to do my maintenance and I drive his truck without a problem. It ran fine for me. He leaves here the day he brings my car back and breaks down on his way home 3 miles from my house. His jeep has been in the shop for a couple months now. My Father has let my ex and one of his mechanics work on it in there spare time. They finally got it together and my ex engages the locker that broke the first couple parts to begin with and when he went to test drive it every part from the motor back broke including the ones he just replaced!!! The mechanic had it towed to the mechanic's house and said he'll fix it as long as my ex doesn't come near it until he's finished. Sometimes I can't believe what I'm seeing. How could someone's luck go soooooo bad?  I'm thankful for my life that's turned out some incredible fortunes. I'm ready to bring myself to a more heightened awareness. I've enjoyed my body today and want it to experience more of weekends like this. To good friends and great love!!  With love,  BLG
