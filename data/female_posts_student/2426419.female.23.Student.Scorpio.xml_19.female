I think back to my time in Brazil and the people there always have time for each other.  Even in the middle of the day while they are at work if they get a call from a friend that wants to go have a drink and talk (the drink of choice is a Brahma by the way a brazillian made beer) and they will take off work and go out, and no one says a word to them.  It is just very common, and they feel it is necessary to do so, relationships are the most important thing to them.  So the problem I see is that we are so busy with american life that we forget, and most of the time literally can't stop and have these types of relationships.  I guess I said all of that to say I am not quite sure what we can do.  GTTANN= Going to take a nap now
