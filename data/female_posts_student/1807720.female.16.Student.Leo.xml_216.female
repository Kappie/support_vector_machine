It makes me feel like I did something wrong or something.  It's actually not about money this time though.  Believe it or not.  My Dad can't find some important envelope so he is like raving and ranting all over the house.  I chose to sit here at my laptop and just be silent - invisible.  Things are better that way.  Other wise, I will end up being yelled at and blamed.  I really don't need that.  On Monday I have to write a position paper in class for Social 30 and tomorrow I get to go to Stampede.  I am excited about that.  Megz and I are going to the rodeo too!  I also have tons of homework again!  So much!!!!  I mean I am crazy to sign up for Summer School!!  The teacher is really really good though, but the info we learn is fast.  I will admit I find it difficult to learn, but I am doing pretty good.  Now I know what it feels like to "go it alone" cause I don't really know or talk much to anyone.  Most of them are kids that normally go to Grandin and they are all strange.  There is one guy from Mary's - my competition, and the rest from O'Byrne that all the smoker-drinker people.  I chose NOT to socialize with those that smoke and drink.  Besides it's again getting a good mark, not about socializing and making friends.  I just have to keep reminding myself: Three more weeks, diploma, then I am DONE SOCIAL for the REST OF MY LIFE.  I can almost taste it.  That is my motivation.  Considering I hate Social with a passion, except for Model UN.  That is really fun, and the way the UN works and is organized is actually pretty interesting.  I don't even know why the hell Social is mandatory anyways.  I mean thirty years from now I am not going to be like "Hey, remember the tactics that Stalin used?"  Like, I DON'T think so!!!!!  And for English, why do I need that to the 30 level??  I want to be a Bio teacher not an English teacher!!  Who cares how well you can interpret Shakespeare and use guessing ability on reading comprehension tests.  What gets me the most is how people DON'T need Math and Sciences to the 30 level.  I think ANY DAY logic and reason are MUCH MORE important than stupid history and English.  I know I am right too.  Those English and Social nerds just hit it lucky that's all.  Then there are people like me - who like Science and Math. (math is hard, but yes I admit it I find it interesting) They are just making the Science and Math nerds do more shit that they really don't need in their schedule.  I have enough courses as it is.  If I didn't have to do English and Social I could spend more of my youthful years doing more productive things and things that would enjoy.  I could take more option classes and have more time to relax.  But...NOOOOOOO...Government...school boards...who ever thought it was a good idea to make make Social and English to the 30 level mandatory and only Science and Math to the 20 level mandatory had too many screws loose.  History and English are merely a waste of time.  Society should be educated to use logic and reason.  To critically examine situations, learn to interpret, and experiment.  Those are the essentials.  Anyways, talking about that is not going to change anything.  Lately I have been having nightmares and thoughts about university.  I even dreamt I was in University one night, but I was taking some performing Arts program, lol.  I like acting, drama, dance, and performing but would NOT do that as a career.  I am scared though.  Scared for the future.  I wish my marks were higher from the previous years, but I tried my best.  Sometimes your best isn't always enough though.  I want to go to Univeristy so badly.  I want to get in so badly.  When the applications come out online in live Oct/Nov I am going to apply as soon as possible.  It's so stressful though.  Just all the articles in the newspaper talking about how difficult it is to get accepted now a days, and I mean even all the teachers during school time telling us all how important it is that we focus and concentrate on acedemics.  I read about a month ago in the Herald that what Universities do now is that they start at the top - those with the highest marks, and then work their way to the bottom - those with the lowest marks.  I have to compete with those people wanting to be doctors, dentists, all that other stuff that requires you to be like super smart.  I just want to get so badly.  I don't want rejection.  I don't know if I could even handle rejection.  I need to consider the possibility that I might not get in.  My marks are nothing amazing and don't stand out as much as other peoples do.  My marks don't suck, and are not bad, but compared to others with 90 averages I just can't compete.  That is not in my range.  I already try my best and get in the 70's on most cores and in the 80's and 90's on other things.  My mom knows this lady whose son got rejected and had a 90 overall average.  I mean EVERYONE in Canada should have a right to higher level education.  Marks should not be everything, but really they are.  Marks are everything when it comes to your future.  Marks determine whether you will be accepted or not accepted.  That then would determine the career path.  One more year of high school and then I am off to bigger and better things.  I work so hard for what I want soooooo incredibly bad.  It's my dream to teach.  When I am standing infront of a high school bio class teaching bio, that is when I can sit back and know that my hard work, effort, dedication, and persistence though the challenging Math, Chem, and a variety of other subjects.  That is the one day I dream of.  I can picture it.  I can "see" it in my mind.  I don't want to anything else but be a teacher.  That is what I was put on Earth to do.  I can hear a voice in my head telling me that is what I am to do.  It's just so right.  I love school, love kids, and would love to be the one to influence and help and support others one day.  All that depends on one thing though.  If I get accepted when I apply for University.  That can make or break everything.  I have to consider it though.  I don't even know what to do if I don't get in.  I guess try again next year, but for the mean time if that happens I guess I will go along with things.  See where my life takes me.  I NEED to get in though, I don't really want to think of the other possibility of being rejected too much.  I believe that I can get in, and I want to get in.  I deserve to get it.  Ok, and now I am thinking about this way too much!  I guess I will just have to wait until the time applications come out in the fall.  Then I will go from there.
