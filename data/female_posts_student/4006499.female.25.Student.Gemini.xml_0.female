There's nothing like looking outside my window and contemplating whether it's 6am or 6pm. I'm thinking about burying myself in hole like those damn droning 17-year locusts, in hopes that when I'd crawl out the sunshine would be wearing a huge ass grin, winking at me, responding with "this one's for you baby!"     I have seen in this past year just how much the crappy weather affects my moods. When it's cloudy and rainy during the day, I hide indoors like I have agoraphobia. However, exposure therapy in my case would probably result in death. As long as it's cloudy and rainy, there is a feeling that the grim reaper's waiting at my bedroom door, just eyeing his watch, impatiently tapping his foot for for me to plead, "fine, come and take me, asshole!" These days are ones where everything shitty in life is magnified by a thousand. In those times, only my bed can beckon me with its comfort; for life eternally sucks and everything I've ever gotten myself into can go to hell.    Conversely, when the sun's out and it's a cloudless blue sky, I feel so elated. I get happier than I have in my entire life. Before it was, yeah I loved the sunny days, but now it's an actual euphoria type of elation when the sun makes it's grand entrance on the wide open blue stage. The type where people insisted they felt drugged in non-drug situations, but it always sounded like bullshit because the only experience I've had of jovial euphoria was always induced by alcohol. But now more than ever, when the sun's smiling, so am I; Life's perfect and I beg for the day to never end.    Don't get me wrong. I don't suffer from moodiness, I just get a bit more depressed. It's easier for my brain to opt for feeling depressed and anxious rather than happy and focused, unfortunately. Most can never tell, I for one never lash out on others so when I am down, others only see it as subtle. I keep denying that it's seasonal affective disorder; I don't want to admit to myself that I will continually have to deal with it on random occasions, suns out with cloudless skies, I'm happy... cloud and rain taking over the skies, I'm sad. Hmm, remedy for now, sun lamps, tanning booths, and alcohol. Otherwise, I'll prescribe myself the bed for days I feel non functional.    Until then I'll be waiting for the smile, wink, and those 5 encouraging words.
