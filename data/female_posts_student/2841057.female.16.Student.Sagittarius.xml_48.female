I'm supposed to be sleeping right now coz the weather is pretty good that it'll make you sleepy. Anyway... I'm doing a research about our damn english subject. Grrr.. I hate it.   Well, about the story that I promised to tell. Tinatamad ako kaya tsaka na lang kapag naisipan ko ulit. hehe... it's just another lonely day.ü I wanna go to badminton court to play but my company is still asleep. hmm... I need to finish the craps... see you later! ü
