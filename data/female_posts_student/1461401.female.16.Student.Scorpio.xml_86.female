Even if I tell you I'm sorry, it's too late to try to heal all the wounds I've created. Who knows, maybe I'm over estimating my influences in your life. Maybe the things I do don't really matter as much as I'm afraid they do. But I still have that feeling... maybe it would be better if I just disappear for a while. Better for the both of us. I wish I were not who I am. I wish I had more control over my life.  I wish you would honestly forgive me.
