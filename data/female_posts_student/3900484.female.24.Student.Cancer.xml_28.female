This is the perfect time to take charge in areas of romance, whether it be with a longtime partner or someone who's just caught your eye. That other party is not only willing to listen and be charmed, but quite ready for it. So put on a flattering shirt and step forward. You may just find that a sly and knowing humor defines the mood of the day, and the rules you're playing by are those which you yourself dictated long ago. You know what you want, so go get it.   I think that means Im supposed to ask tattooboy out... I don't know if I can do it...  but I'll try.  I'm wearing my "boys are stupid shirt".  Think that will win him over?  I have to close tonight as well as working this morning, so Im pretty much assured I will see him.  Hopefully.
