I was going to dedicate pretty much this whole post to a show that at first I made strong efforts to not watch. I felt it was just another  90210 , and to me, that show had run it's course after about the third season. You yourself(Courtney) had told me on several occasions that it was a good show. That it was extremely funny, but didn't let that diminish the drama of the show. I still wasn't convinced. It took three of my friends(you know who you are) to actually convince me to watch the show. They told me about there favorite characters, they told me about the love triangles. They did anything and everything to get me to watch the show. So one night, I was on instant messenger with one of them, she told me that  The OC  was on. With nothing else to watch I reluctantly tuned in. With her telling me who everybody was, telling me about who was into who, or who dated who I slowly started to enjoy watching the show. It was full of wit and sarcasm(sarcasm is my favorite form of humor), in watching one episode I became enthralled in it. Borrowing tapes from a friend to catch up on all the episodes. The characters are so diverse, so intriguing, that it is like nothing that is or ever has been on TV. From Ryan, the bad boy with a heart of gold. To Seth, the avid comic book fan who creates the uber holiday known as Chrismakkuh(a polymerazation of Christmas and Channikah). The creativity that lies within the pen of Josh Schwartz is immeasurable, I believe soon we will put him in the Quentin Tarantino category. Now there still is three episodes I have not seen, but I would have to say that the Thanksgiving episode is the best. It was so crazy, it brought every character in the show to the same house. You have Jimmy and Julie fighting about Marissa, Seth entertaining his two ladies, and Kirsten getting drunk. It was also hilarious to watch Sandy, Seth and Ryan do whatever they can to keep Kirsten from helping cook anything, for what she touches can no longer be considered edible. It is, without question, the best show on TV.  Now that I have expressed my anger to the fact that you stole my post, I feel like commenting on someone that lacks creativity. Michael Eisner is that somebody. He has done everything in his power to keep Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 out of American theaters. He stated that it doesn't fit in with Disney's family friendly movies. He must of forgot about that cinematic masterpiece  Kill Bill Vol. 1 . Wouldn't call that a "family friendly" movie(unless we're talking about the Manson family). Eisner has told his critics that he doesn't feel they should release a politically charged movie in an election year. To me it seems like there is no better time to release it, politics are all over the news so why not have them jump from the little screen to the big screen. It is obvious why Eisner doesn't want this movie released, it doesn't portray his candidate it a good light. Everyone knows this is the reason, he just won't admit it. Now I am not ultra-liberal like Moore, but his films always deliver a message.  Bowling for Columbine  was, at times, a funny movie, but it's true message was that firearms are to easy to obtain, and play to big of a role in society. Eisner's attempts to keep Fahrenheit 9/11 away from American audiences has seemingly failed, it just won the top prize over at the Cannes Film Festival and all signs point to it being released sometime in the coming months. Michael Moore - 1  Michael Eisner - 0.  With that, I will end my post. I look forward to seeing your take on my Eisner critique, I just feel he has been incredibly bad for Hollywood. He is a selfish, arrogant ass-face(reference from  The OC ) that is completely out of touch with the American audience.
