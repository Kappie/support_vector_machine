Haha, that was a blast! Minus the mixing of gum flavors-ew. The ziti was good tho! And I think the clothes are Hollister are missing some material... Went swimming at Caitlins [[skinks, water rescue tube, group shower, water raspberries]] then andrew left and the 3 of us had fun goofing around, looking at pictures, sharing stories on caitlins bed, and learning how to ride the motor scooter *hah* Plus dinner was yumfro! All in all, it was a great day and I'm glad my summer hasnt started to go downhill... YET!
