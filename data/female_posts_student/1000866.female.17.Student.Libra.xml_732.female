She lived in this small town filled with lots of stupid people, Paperville, Stillinois. She was driving home from summer school one day when the person in front of her abruptly slammed on their breaks. Then, Zatie also slammed on her breaks in order to not hit the person in front of her. And so, the fine yung gentleman behind her tried to slam on his breaks, but his breaks did not work fast enough. Sad. So, the young man hit Zatie's car. They had to call the police and file a report and Zatie's cute little car was hurt. :( So was the young man's. The young man was very polite though and made sure Zatie was ok and gave her a hug. What a nice young man. And so, unfortunately, it wasn't really anyone's fault, except for the person in front of Zatie, or perhaps the person in front of that person for slamming on their breaks. Luckily, since it was not Zatie's fault, she does not have to pay the bill.   Names have been changed to protect the integrity of the drivers.  OK, so, fine, it was me. This kid behind me, another kid coming from summer school, slammed into the back of my car. It wasn't pleasant. He was really polite though and we exchanged information and whatnot. Sad though. It wasn't really either of our faults and yet, he has to pay because it's technically his fault.   The rest of my day was much better than the first half. I went to my trumpet lesson and then I went to MC's house to watch a movie with...well, a lot of people. MC, Kelly, Brett, Jamal, John, Chang, Roger, Tom, Stephen and...i think that may have been it actually...amazingly. So, we watched the Secret Window. I came like halfway into it. I wasn't too impressed with the half that I saw. Then, we all went home and I went out again at first with Bryan and Matthew. Then, Matthew had to go home and Bryan and I hung out. So, very fun evening in all.   I worked out today too, which I haven't done in so long. It actually felt pretty good.   Anyway, I must be off to sleep. I wouldn't want to stay up any longer and find out bad news or something and have it ruin my good night. Night kiddies.
