He was her entire world,  She gave him all she possesed,  He did the same in return,  They were thought to be obsessed.   Their love couldn't be reached,  Couldn't be touched by any other,  They were all they needed,  They only wanted each other.   From two they became one,  They made each other whole,  They filled each other's voids,  They filled each other's souls.   Everything was perfect,  Everything was great,  Till one damning day,  They were told they'd have to wait.   Her parents were moving her,  To a distant place,  They'd be torn apart,  Couldn't see each other's face.   They swore they'd make it work,  Vowed to stay together,  Didn't care about the distance,  They'd be toghether forever.   She gave it all she had,  She did her very best,  But he still slipped away,  He didn't pass the test.   While she was thinking of him,  He had found another,  He said he couldn't do it,  He talked it over with his mother.   She was devestated,  Her heart was torn straight out,  She'd been such a fool,  She should have listened to her doubt.   From then on they stopped talking,  Never spoke again,  While he was with his new girl,  She was dreaming of him.   Every day she'd cry,  She tried to fight off all the pain,  But the hurting never stopped,  Just shot through every vein.   Months went by since the ending,  But she only grew worse,  She couldn't accept what happened,  This was love's curse.   It finally overtook her,  She couldn't stand it anymore,  She grabbed a picture of him,  And snuck out the front door.   She walked into the woods,  Found a secluded place,  Kept thinking of the past,  And how she'd been replaced.   Hours later she was found,  In a pool of her blood,  And beside her they found,  His picture in the mud.   On the back read her reason,  Why she took her life,  What he did to her,  It seemed he had held the knife.   Though physically he didn't kill her,  He tore her soul apart,  It was obvious how she did,  It was from a broken heart.   - Friends Are Friends Forever ~  Packing up the dreams, God planted In the fertile soil of you I can’t believe the hopes He’s granted Means a chapter in your life is due But we’ll keep you close as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone ‘Cuz our hearts in big as always We’ll keep the love that keeps us strong.

No a lifetime’s not too long…to live as friends… (this is like, my fav song)     Have you ever wondered which hurts the most? Saying something and wishing you hadn't?, or Saying nothing and wishing you had?  I guess the most important things are the hardest things to say.Don't be afraid to tell someone you love them.  If you do, they might break your heart...if you don't, you might break theirs.  Have u ever decided not 2 become a couple because you were so afraid of losing what you already had with that person?  Your heart decides whom it likes and whom it doesn't. You can't tell your heart what to do. It does it on its own........when you least suspect it, or even when you don't want it to.  Have you ever wanted to love someone with everything you had, but that other person was too afraid to let you?  Too many of us stay walled up because we are too afraid to care too much...for fear that the other person does not care as much, or even at all.  Have you ever denied your feelings for someone because your fear of rejection was too hard to handle?  We tell lies when we are afraid... afraid of what we don't know, afraid of what others will think, afraid of what will be found out about us. But every time we tell a lie, the thing we fear grows stronger.  Life is all about risks and it requires you to jump.  Don't be a person who has to look back and wonder what they would have done, or could  have had.  * What would you do if every time you fell in love you had to say good-bye?  *What would you do if every time you wanted someone they would never be there?  *What would you do if your best friend died tomorrow and you never got to tell them how you felt? (even if it is that you don't care anymore) *What would you do if you loved someone more than ever and you couldn't have them?  *What would you do if you never got the chance to say I am friends with all of my family and they know I love them?*  People live, but people die.  I want to tell you that you are a friend.  If you died tomorrow (God Forbid) you would bein my heart. Would I be in yours?  If you care about me as much as I care about you   you will send this back  You might be best friends one year, pretty good friends the next year, don't talk that often the next, and don't want to talk at all the year after that.   So, I just wanted to say, even if I never talk to you again in my life, you are special to me and you have made a difference in my life,   I look up  to you, respect you, truly cherish you , most of all I  CARE about friends   Send this to all your friends, no matter how often you talk, or how close you are, and send it to the person who sent it to you.    Let old friends know you haven't forgotten them, and tell new friends you never will.    Remember, everyone needs a friend someday you might feel like you have  NO FRIENDS at all, just remember this and take comfort in knowing  somebody out there cares about you and .. always will..   I care about  YOU !!
