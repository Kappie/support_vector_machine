So much that it actually makes me upset. I don't understand, it's not like our relationship was that of a serious one. It was just a "relationship", one rushed into that it kinda felt like you weren't even in. Once we broke up I felt I hadn't even had time to know and understand him and so I wanted us to be friends. But sometimes I feel this friendship thing isn't working. Too much emotion his part and mines.
