I thought this moment would never come today! [ Tue Jul 23, 03:19:24 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] The Smoothie King   So recently, and I blame my mother entirely for this, I was introduced to the Smoothie King. It's located right next door to Quiznos and Starbucks in the new part of the Main Street Shopping center in Fairfax. So I have a limited run for lunch today, one hour. I got stuff to do at the office so I try to make it as quick as possible. So I run all the way out to Centreville to a store I need to go to and then I come back through to Fairfax City. Well the trip from Merrifield to Centreville and into Fairfax took 30 min total, which is really good. So everything seems to be going well. I should probably just go back to Merrifield but I am craving a Smoothie. So I walk in and notice it's kind of busy but I think I've got 30 minutes and it will only take 10 to get back to the office... so I place my order and think I have just enough time to run next door to Quiznos and get a small smoked turkey (my favorite)! So I do! I come back in and look around to notice that the line has hardly changed. The same people that were in the front when I left to get my sandwich are still in the front waiting. 30 MINUTES LATER I finally get my drink and have to speed race it back to Merrifield. But all is well i think, I sit down, start eating my sandwich and then take a nice long sip of my Angel Food Smoothie... IT'S GRAINY! I've gotten this thing so many times in the past and it's always had seeds and such but it's never been grainy! I waited 30 minutes for a grainy smoothie! But in all fairness the girl did give me a punch card which none of the other employees have ever done when I've been in there. I liked her, but I am still angry at how long it took and how it just wasn;t good at all! They better not make a habbit of the graininess or they might just lose me as a customer! (As if that is any kind of threat!)  [ Tue Jul 23, 03:11:38 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] Odd Todd Musing   Odd Todd wrote to the fishstick company! Oh it cracks me up!   Fish Stick Story and reply!

Since my last post was all weird I decided to tell everyone as often as possible what is in my cd player (or on my spinner -- Spinner!!!) and let you know what I think! Since I am a freakin music hound anyway, it seems mildly appropriate!   In My CD Player Now:   Earlier I was listening to Dave Matthews Band's Busted Stuff!!!!  AWESOME!!! I don't really feel the need to go into this cd all that much since if you ever read my blog you would know that I have been talking about it non-stop since I bootlegged it before it's release... AND YES I STILL BOUGHT THE ALBUM TO SUPPORT MY BAND! I WOULDN'T TAKE MONEY FROM THEM! But in my opinion this is probably my favorite studio album since Under The Table and Dreaming! I love it! I just can't get enough of it. Now don't get me wrong, except for the Chicago Live CD, I have them all and love them all but this in particular has just risen to my best expectations. Probably because of Grey Street, Bartender and Grace is Gone which were my favorite lillywhites as well and now I love them even more!!! I HIGHLY recommend this album!!! Stop what you are doing right now, go to the store and BUY IT! It's just that good. And no I am not saying that because I am a freakin dave fanatic!   A Little Later... I was listening to Indigo Girls' 1200 Curfews (their double live disc). I dig it, I definitely have my favorites and I think I have just worn out track two on disc two (Galileo)! It's the chick acoustic rock sound for those of you who live in a hole and don't know what the Indigo Girls sound like! It's been around for a while but if you are a fan of the Lillith Fair sound and you like live discs I highly recommend this one as well!   And Now... I am listening to The Calling's Camino Palmero! I love it! I love this guy's voice. And this is one of those few cds that I have (much like Busted Stuff) where I like every single song on it. I didn't go out and buy it for Wherever You Go, which is still a great song, it wasn't until I heard one of their songs (maybe on Smallville??) called Thank You that I just loved this band. I went out and bought the CD for that song alone and ended up loving the whole thing. I have completely fallen in love with Unstoppable too. Someone told me this song is playing on the radio now, which is great, but we all know I never listen to the radio so I have no idea... I literally cannot say one bad thing about this CD... except are we sure that voice is coming out of that scrawny kid??? But if you like bands like Lifehouse, Vertical Horizon, Greenwheel, Remy Zero, that kind of thing you'll really like this CD.   That;s it for now, still working on The Calling....

Sorry, I am not very good at blogging when music is on! Here's the link!  Book Crossing   "If we had this night together, if we had a moment to ourselves, if we had this night together than we'd be unstoppable!!! LALALALA!...." I really do like this song! For those of you wondering what I am listening to... at the moment it appears to be The Calling's Unstoppable. I love this entire cd! Wow, I am way off subject now!   For those who want to visit my own personal bookshelf (which I actually created a month ago but has somehow screwed itself up and lost my original book review - there was only one - so I created a whole new membership and wrote in a new book review and released a new book into the wild!) go here....  My Bookshelf   That's it! [ Tue Jul 23, 11:32:12 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Last Night   So a friend, who will remain nameless, calls me last night to tell me that his sister's ex-boyfriend (who aparently is heavily into drugs) would not leave the house despite her insistance. They have a son of 2 years old together and have been living together for a while. Aparently she called the police and even though he is NOT on the deed to the house and even though he is up for drug charges in court today the police wouldn't do anything. They said as long as his stuff was there, even if it was just his toothbrush, he didn't have to leave, he had every right to be there. So this friend of mine calls and asks me to help him out. I then call another friend. We all meet up the other friend's apartment. We then drive ourselves to her house and we are ready for whatever might go down. Aparently upon hearing we were coming the ex called his brother to come over because he wanted to rumble??? I don't know. But the guy's brother was like "I don't feel like fighting" and didn't come. Fortunately before any of us met up at all my friend called the ex's parents and asked them to help intervene. So by the time we got to the sister's house the parents had come and gone and took the ex with them. It was a totally weird situation and I was all ready for the worse to go down. I realized how loyal I am to my friends (which is a good thing... kind of) but it completely blindsides me. I got so lucky last night. It could've been so bad with cops and what not had the guy still been there and had a fight broken out. Of course I watch too much television and would've half expected to be dragged down to jail till it was all figured out. I don't know, but anyway, it turned out to be pretty uneventful, of which I am glad. We sat and talked with my friend's sister for a while and then returned to our homes.  [ Tue Jul 23, 11:07:44 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Speculation   There has been quite a bit of speculation as to how I am doing with my current roommate "situation". I don't really feel the need to actually comment on it to most of you since it's not necessarily fair to my roommate and since we obviously have issues to work out just between the two of us. But to give you an idea of how I am now, I'm fine. I'm happy. I'm okay. And despite what has gone down recently, I am surprisingly okay with the situation now. Try to remember, this is not really just one person's fault, it's both of ours... and I am beginning to think it's more of a clash of personalities and a lack of understanding more than anything else... but again, thanks for your concern!
