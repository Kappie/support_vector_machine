It's about 9:30. I have a slight stomachache. Almost tired. Have an unfinished email that goes practically nowhere, I don't think I want to send it except that I know that if I don't, I'm not going to get anything back. I'll just recline slightly...  Ow, stomach really hurts now.  At 9:33 pm on an unusually warm Saturday night, I'm meditating on relationships. Whatever memories I have are so dissimilar to what Nimo tells Wendy and me about his own experiences, so I ask myself, what did I spend all my time on? My memories: talking, writing. Laughing, but mainly at someone else's joke. A journal. A book.  Today I realize: Lydia, that's nothing. Really nothing at all. Things like this aren't forcefully defined, they just happen. I think I put too much into it, or I tried too hard. It's just that I don't really have anything cute, if I may, left over from it. It was just feeling secure, I guess, for a new and novel reason. I guess it was somewhere in between too: I can't deny that I cried sometimes over the things he wrote, and I don't do that kind of silly lachrymose stuff for friends, just friends.  It was a funny, terrible nothing. I'll learn.  Watched Seven with Wendy and Nimo. I was walking up the back stairs and kept checking behind my back to make sure that no, there was no delusional Kevin Spacey following me. The movie is an argument for how things simply work better when there's a central theme, but that concept often goes sour when one tries to employ it effectively in the course of a 1-hour ICE. I love how it was so intellectual, so meticulous, so planned. That red neon cross still scares me a bit.  Ahh, I can't get Weezer unstuck.  I had a good day.   I don't want to finish this email.  Harvard is in three weeks.  Please don't have me deal with "bossy woman" (according to Hank) tomorrow.  I'm tired.
