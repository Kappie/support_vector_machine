I guess that I was afraid to tell most everyone, but I think that I am going to stay here another year. I've been tossing it around in my head since earlier today. Yes, in Oklahoma and not in grad school. It isn't because I particularly think it is God's will or that I could not, by the power of God, make it happen financially (although the monetary odds do seem insurmountable). It's not that at all, because I've had some beautiful support from my friends (that includes all you Jacob Wellers) and I have had prayed some sincere and weeping prayers about it that I know God heard and was going to be faithful in answering most positively. I wanted this so badly that I would go to church each week (Crossroads Cathedral) and cry as if my heart were in mourning over some great loss or person I wanted to love me. And I was building my faith.  This is why I feel as if I am letting God down a little. And my friends who believed I could do it. And myself. I can't tell you all the reasons I will stay another year, but let me assure you that it is of my own volition, my own decision, and I am at peace with it. I am still planning on moving out, because I know that I need to be out on my own and I don't feel as if I can take risks or be independent with my wonderful, but very overprotective Mom. That might happen in October in Edmond.  I don't really understand why I am doing this, but it is my decision. There are the semi-valid reasons, such as I would like to start off graduate school with a teaching assistantship (which I did not recieve, probably because I was on the waiting list at first to just get in) because most incoming MA students receive one and that is how they pay for living expenses and it creates a lovely community of graduate students. Those few who don't get an assistantship and have to work full time somewhere, maybe off campus, for $6.15 an hour, take a little longer to really get into the groove. That's what a prof told me. Maybe if I take the GRE again and work harder on my writing samples, I will recieve one next year. If I don't, then while I'm here, I will save up enough money to live off of and go close by - maybe OU or something. If you get teaching experience in grad school, then you are more likely to get a professor job with just a Masters when you get out.  Then there are the stupid reasons, such as I still have on these crappy, annoying braces that are paid for in full, and most orthodontist transfer fees are $125 a visit. My car is on it's last rope and I can't really get a job very far away from campus because my 'rents keep professing that it will break down on me. My parents keep telling me that I cannot possibly work full-time and go to school full-time. What was another one? Oh, right - Josh can't drive with me there and my parents would be unwilling to pay or accompany me to Ohio if I couldn't find a job before I went up there.  Or maybe I just don't want to admit that I can't work 35 hours and go to class and develop my thesis all at the same time while keeping my sanity.  But anyway, I wish I didn't have to disappoint people. I got myself and everyone so excited and now nothing is going to happen. I don't even have very much time to apply for next year, which sort of stresses me out. My face has been doing an unsightly number of zitfests for the past few months while I've been so stressed. Anyway, I really appreciated everyone's concern and it probably seems like I'm giving up early since school doesn't start until Sept. 22, but I'm not giving up. I fully believe God would have provided me with financial means would I have stepped out and done it. I didn't give up, I just made a decision and I do feel at peace with it. It's just that I have to decide and let the school know before my new loans are, er, loaned for classes and so that they can ask someone else to be in the program. I just hope that God is not too disappointed; if it is His will for me to go to grad school, then I am just stupidly postponing it a year. Hopefully, I will get accepted again, if not at UC, then somewhere else. That is the scary thought - having to go through all of this again, when I'm not too different or much better than before at applying. But maybe I can study for the GRE. It seems sort of pointless for some reason, but I have to remind myself that I'm not giving up grad school forever. I dread going back to OC and getting more letters of recommendation. They will say, "You fool, you should have taken the opportunity when it came up." But that's just something I will have to deal with. maybe I am not as at peace with it all as I think, but I already sent the email to the director of graduate studies, so basically it is a done deal as of 1:30 am Aug. 2. Or as soon as he reads it.  This post is long enough. I don't want to throw my life away and I hope that isn't what I have just done. But if I don't have graduate school and being a professor and traveling to Europe in the summers, I don't feel as if I have a purpose in life. The 20s are such a lost time for us. No one needs us. No family of our own. No career we love. No anything. But I still love being in my 20s. I'm in this glove and I'm stretching it out to fit me to where it is comfortable. I want to see the world as large, but I am so stuck within a backyard. The backyard that follows me wherever I travel. Maslow would say that I just haven't self-actualized yet, and he'd probably be right. I am trapped within my own self and I wish that I knew how to look outside myself more. How to externalize and voice my usually internal dialogues other than through written monologues. I need (?) to be on stage again in a play or a musical. Sometimes that is a place I feel alive. Or singing.  Well, I know that tomorrow, I will be better and that perhaps I will try to find ways to make transform this year into something rich and fulfilling, raspberry chocolate mousse through a straw. Jesus. He knew from the time he was born his purpose in life, for each day. He knew what God wanted and picked through the thorn-speckled forest with his sword until that 33rd year. But then again, he is God. How I would like to see God. How I would like to devote myself as a saint to the religion of Him, or just to Him, day in and day out, to be something like a Catholic nun, a trappist monk, some wanderer on the mountain simply breathing in Holy-air and writing the words for other people to read. Oh precious, beautiful Savior . . . how strange it feels to live on Earth like this where the world is too tangible and my mind is all abstractions and disassociated from everything more every year. Perhaps that is why I need to write. I have proof for myself that something I produce exists. Make my dull eyes your soul, my quivering lips your hands, and, even though I shall deserve it day in and out, never forsake me. Please please please. My blood that pumps blue and tangerine is all yours. I need none. The Great Heaven Synergetic Transfusion. In this waiting room, the antechamber to a dream, I promise to delight in it all, not freak people out too much, and sleep more than one hour a night. Breathe on me.
