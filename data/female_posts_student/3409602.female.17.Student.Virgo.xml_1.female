I love holidays,cos i could take a break...Sleep late..Watch tv progs till dawn.. and just do wadever i like..but...i really dread the feeling of being alone..Alone at home, alone on the streets,alone in my heart,my world...It doesn't feel good,like oil that can't be merged together with water(the groups of ppl out there*water*,me alone*oil*)...*sigh*!! If i could say why it would be becos during my sec sch daes,i abandon my frenx for love,love that i tot would last for an eternity,but i was so wrong.. thruout the years,12 exs,did i noe that love hurts,and could even make me do things that i would never dreamt of doing..hurting myself.If time could go back,i wish to tell my frenx how i regretted my choice of decision,and how i wish i could go back to the daes when we go out as a grp and enjoy,have fun..I realli miss them alot..*sob* Now,today,i oni have my classmates,of which my two sistas,Jane and Jieni,are the closest to my heart.I wish to tell them i cherish them alot and i don wish to lose them,but it seems kinda weird? I have my guy too..and i thank him for standing by me and loving me so much..i wish to tell him that i would give my all and love him with everything i have..and i wish to see him happy being with me.. *another new chapter unfolds, to bring abt the pains and happiness in life*
