So we went to go pick her up and once we got to the civic center it was locked and we didnt have a key. So we went to Moores store and asked for the key and told them we were renting it tonight and he just gave it to us and didnt even asked if we already paided for it! haha (Which we did).. Lol. So once we got there me and kelly moved everything how we liked it and waited for jessie and kris to get there. We set up everything and jessie did a FABulous job getting the decorations! Everyone started coming and it was burning up inside cuz they had the air conditioner thing locked up so everyone was outside.. and me and jessie thought it got off to a bad start but everyone really had fun and it got waay better towards the end! Matt was the dj most of the night and he seemed to enjoy it alot haha! After everyone left we set everything back how it was and we left! Me and my mom went to go get some ice cream afterwards and then we went back home. Thats all.. so see ya!
