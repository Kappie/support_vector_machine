But things go terribly wrong when the ghost of the long lost D-Day is jealous when he is not invited to the reunion and starts to cast his dark and disturbing shadow over the Delta house. Youll be on the edge of your seat with this hilariously distorted and sometimes morbid none stop party and blood bath.   Caution: This film contains real dead people brought back to life and will show several minutes of footage of John Belushi nude. Basically because we cant clothe the dead!
