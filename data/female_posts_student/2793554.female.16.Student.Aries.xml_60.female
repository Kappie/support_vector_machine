I was supposed to meet dylan for lunch but he didnt show up, he was with alex (always) and then i went to see him after school to try and fix things, and he IGNORED ME. and so i got my stuff, and i started crying, and i walked out of gamelan crying. and he just sat there playing games. And so i walked around pearl street crying for like, an hour. Then i decided to not be like one of those dumb girls who just walk away and  ignore their boyfriends and expect them to know what to do.... so i went back to see dylan. And i went to see him  and i had all this stuff to say. And then i saw him and i just started crying. I dont even know why... i didnt want to.  But i just cryed my eyes out for like, a half hour.   i'm insane. and i always fear ill just be abandoned.   this post is stupid.   god, im dumb.  ~abby
