DROWN. i'll drown in my shit-filled life. it's already pulling me under. i sometimes just wish i could DIE. leave everything behind me. why cant that happen? i already know how i want to die. its the perfect death. painless, and beautiful. death. the word in itself sounds so, serene. it is as calm as a quiet winter's day. the kind of winter's day that has dark gray clouds overhead, and endless snow-covered fields for miles and miles. life. what is life? does it have a point? will it ever stop hating me? what do you do when you feel like you cant go on like this? sure i know there are people out there who have it way worse off than me. but still. this is shit for me. argh. when will it end? this endless hellhole that keeps pulling me down. the darkness envelopes me. becoming one with the darkness is what i want most. being alive is not on my list of priorities--  --then again, there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, and the sun will shine again [am i gay? or rather, a lesbo? or maybe im bi. who knows. haha, jk]  like john cusack said when he acted as eddie thomas in the movie america's sweethearts: "i'm a paranoid schizophrenic, so i am an entourage." i think thats the kinda problem i have. i need help. lol.
