I wish I had a friend that would say "Tap on my window, knock on my door/I want to make you feel beautiful/I know I tend to get so insecure/It doesn't matter anymore" ...nobody will talkto me anymore except to ask for advice.     Seriously, no one will talk to me except when they're in trouble and need advice. For some reason people tend to think I have good advice--too bad I don't have any for myself. Somedays, well, most days, ok fine  everyday  I want some one to talk to or just go somewhere with(just so I can get out of this damned house!)   (  Oh no, my vocabulary is failing me! I cannot express myself enough in words so I have used a swear out of pure frutration!) but they're all too busy with their own lives to have time for me--except if they have one crisis or another andneed to talkto me.I would even be content to listen to something other than problems; for example, talk about music or guitars or whatever.   goodness, I've gotten carried away...Because of this song now I'm turning into a hopeless sap so I apologize...gosh this is embarrassing...i never thought a 'band' like maroon 5 would be posted as a song of the day :/      She Will Be Loved  by Maroon 5     Beauty queen of only eighteen  She had some trouble with herself  He was always there to help her  She always belonged to someone else     I drove for miles and miles  And wound up at your door  I've had you so many times but somehow  I want more     I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved(x2)     Tap on my window, knock on my door  I want to make you feel beautiful  I know I tend to get so insecure  It doesn't matter anymore      It's not always rainbows and butterflies  It's compromise that moves us along  My heart is full and my door's always open  You can come anytime you want     I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved (x4)      I know where you hide  Alone in your car  Know all of the things that make you who you are  I know that goodbye means nothing at all  Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls     Tap on my window, knock on my door  I want to make you feel beautiful     I don't mind spending every day  Out on your corner in the pouring rain  Look for the girl with the broken smile  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile  And she will be loved(x4)    Please don't try so hard to say goodbye(x3)      I don't mind spending everyday  Out on your corner in the pouring rain     Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
