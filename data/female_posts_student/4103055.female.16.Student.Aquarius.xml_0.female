Went to Ian's at 7Pm, Nikki was there, then mazzy,kate and Jonathon came over and we all had a laugh. We watched school of rock and sung along to disney sing-a-long aladdin one lol. Was excellent. We pigged out on chinese and Cake teehee :P My diets blown..Meh...Damn tasty foods. Anyway, I'm getting paranoid because everyones asking if me and xan are okay... :S Why shouldnt we be, unless i'm missing something? As soon as I came back from Ian's , Kira was online and the first thing she said to me was 'Are you still going out with xan?'....I got all paranoid and panicked..I dunno what's going on anymore...Anywho lol. I've sliced my foot muscled to pieces, so i've totally knackered my foot and I've got a massive hole in my head with a scab over it...is yukky, so I have to cover it up with makeup  Anywayz, I'm off... Ciao Ciabatta bread!...Gaw, where did that come from?! Sadie x.x.x.  [p.s, working on a website right now, so that's why i cant be bothered with the colourful writing...]
