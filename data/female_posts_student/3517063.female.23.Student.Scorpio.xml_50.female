I haven't yet done much of anything except for walk around Budapest with my parents to buy such artifacts as toilet plungers and liquid plumber yesterday after I arrived. I also drank a liter of wine last night, which enabled me to sleep like a baby.    Today is my dad's birthday. Happy birthday, dad!    Unfortunately, the fact that the laptop is on a chair and I'm on the floor in a rather uncomfortable position prohibits me from expressing my usual creativity. Therefore I will quit while I'm only slightly behind, and write more when the stroke of genius strikes me.
