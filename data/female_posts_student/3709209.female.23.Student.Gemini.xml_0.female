(aside: yes, it is a real baby, a unnaturally tiny one at that, but it never has a name. it is literally just 'the baby') i realize that i think i've only fed the baby once since I got it, which is why it is so small. then, i try to talk KristEYE into taking the baby off my hands, y'know for her new family 'n all (?!?!?!) and because it would really be unethical (?!?!!?) to *return* the baby, which is what KristEYE suggests I do. The remainder of the dream is a blur of me cuddling, caressing and bragging about the tabby kitty, and trying to pawn off the baby onto different people I know.   i figure either 1--this is a clear sign i'm not meant to have children, and/or 2--a foretelling of my getting a tabby pussy when i don't even particularly like kitties; my friend has a bundle and they need homes. i welcome any further interpretations.
