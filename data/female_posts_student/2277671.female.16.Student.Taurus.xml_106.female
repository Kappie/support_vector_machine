It could be that your romantic partner is feeling the need for more  freedom  in the relationship, while you are hoping to gain a greater amount of  commitment . Take things one day at a time and try not to get ahead of yourself by projecting scenarios that may not ever come to fruition out into the future. You are merely  setting yourself up for disappointment  by doing so.  like stina said...  '`  deng  '`
