Peeking at it from their tired eyes and trying to relax their aching head. One of them, Mrs. Pink, had an awful headache. Her head ached, just as headaches do, and she felt terrible. But she had escaped Mr. Blue’s fate. His was death, thankfully it was instant. The Fingers, as they were called, had broken his body in half.   Amina: Ah, the Fingers. Those that meant life and death: the stressed one colored too tightly and poof! You were gone. Or the distracted ones pushed you off a table, and pow: you were dead. Yes, the fingers were indeed lethal!   Mariam: The Fingers, my friend, are never written as the fingers…they are always written as The Fingers. I thought everybody knew that. You know you are quite right about them being lethal. They hold the seesaw that tiptoes between life and death for the colors. But they held an even more important occupation. They were the lines by which the creativity flew from The Brain to The Paper.   Amina: Dearie, tell us what the Fingers have brought to you. What have they led you to sketch? To paint? To draw? Oh my sweetie, I think you forgot to also write: the Fingers let the soul speak as they write the words of the heart. What have your Fingers written? Care to share with us what your nasty heart thinks up of? We so want to laugh. Go ahead and amuse us. :D   Mariam: Amuse you? I think you have mistaken the word amuse for the word inspire. But I don’t mind telling you anyway. I was thinking where I would be, Insha Allah, in less than a week. Specifically about our voyage, our adventure…our trip to Egypt. But I hadn’t gotten so far as to arriving there; I’d just gotten to the airplane. How wondrous it is to fly. To feel as one feels on a roller coaster. The delicious feeling that you have conquered the world. That you have reached the highest peak. Everything appears microscopic. Buildings and houses look like doll houses and cards from up above. Trees appear to be little grasses. People, like specks of moving dust. But what is so ironical is that fact that while you are looking down at everything and thinking of how small the whole world is, everybody under is straining their eyes. Trying to find the tiny airplane in the vast sky. And they are thinking of absolutely insignificant you appear so high above.   Amina: You surprise me…no, really, you really do: that was good! Real good. Now is the time for me to outwit you  write something wittier: something brilliant. Ever heard of an ice cube? It’s frozen: it’s solid. But before it was solid, it was liquid…it was water. Then it froze…once it’s warm again, once it melts it becomes water again. It returns to the liquid phase. *I will now leave you to think of the irony. To see the wisdom in the ice cube. To feel the depth of philosophy from one little ice cube.*  What? How dare you? Me not know what I’m talking about. Well you can just go and kiss my cute a**. The reason why I’m not telling you the mystery of the ice cube is because I don’t want to spoil it for you… I want you to find it ever heard that one before from a grownup? You have…good, then you know what I really mean. :P!  Mariam: You can not write about an ice cube like that! What kind of storytelling is that? Let me begin for you. Once upon a time, there was a water bottle. A man came and poured some warm water into a tray, made up of tiny empty houses. The liquid flowed through, almost passed the brim…just touching the sky. And then the man placed the tray in the frigid north freezer. The air was frigid. Only shrieking icy wind ran through the freezer, making the water colder and colder. They would cry from how scared they were and slowly they turned into hard, ice cubes.   Then one the day, the man took the ice cubes and put them in a pitcher. A pitcher full of warm water. And do you know what happened? The ice cubes bounced a bit on the liquidy trampoline, until they finally fell down…down touched the bottom of the pitcher. The water began to surround the ice cubes, to warm them, and the ice cubes began to melt. Their hearts opened again because they were in such a warm and loving environment and the ice cubes turned into water, inside the water. That is a story, my dearie!   Amina:  nope, that’s not how you write it. Like this:   Flowing through the brooks, the lakes,  Landing in a tiny crystal cup, A spoon of water, a drop of life, Shivering in the glacial air, Frozen as a minuscule prism, Then winds of warmth, blowing away Away the chills, changing the prisms into Water, the quencher of the thirst,  That sprouts the plants, That flows in the brooks,  And in the frozen, ice skating lakes   Mariam: And the blog ends, hence.  For all of you out there…Think of a crayon, an airplane, and an ice cube and the stories and characters that surround us every day!
