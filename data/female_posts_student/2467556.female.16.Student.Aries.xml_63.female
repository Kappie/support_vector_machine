When i see that movie, it reminds me of when Coppell won state.  And the end of the movie where they're all on the pedestal and putting their hands in the air saying that they're number one.  it was so awesome.  Jess went with me and Britt today and she really liked it also.  Sarah was supposed to go with us, but since we went to the early showing (which i didn't know that we were going to do until Britty called me at the crack of dawn aka 10:30am), she couldn't go because she was still at church.  No big deal, i'll go to that movie again.  Alright to all the other girls out there, me and brittany saw the movie opening day, so we've already got claims on the players.  And they go as this:  Me: Rizzo (aka Mike Eruzione), Mac (aka Robbie McClanahan)and Johnson (aka Mark Johnson) Brittany: OC (aka Jack O'Clanahan) Jessica: i think she said she liked Jimmy (Jim Craig) the goalie....  so just take note and all lol.  yeah so today was a great day.  And then after the movie, i went and watched the last part of the all-star game.  it was alright, kinda boring though.  West lost to East 6-4.  Stars play NY Islanders on Wednesday and i think we have tickets to that game and Coppell plays Keller in Euless at 9 frickin 30 pm.  I don't think i'll be able to go to that game because a) its in Euless at 9:30 and b) i've got Brittnee's competition thing to go to because i'm her moral support and she's one of my best friends.    Yeah so, best of luck to all of you for a good week.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
