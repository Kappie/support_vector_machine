I went to the doctor yesterday and they said that everything with my foot is fine. It's healing the right way and I am now allowed to go out and walk....and go to the beach!  Speaking of the beach...Nicole is coming at 3 to take me there. She's gonna teach me how to surf tonight....at least try to, then back to her place, and then we're gonna cruise the strip...or just drive around because we've got no where better to be.  I bought the A Perfect Circle cd last week, it's awesome. Between listening to that, Copeland and the Beatles, I've made it through that past week.  Until I learn to surf and recieve more sweet letters,  I'm out.
