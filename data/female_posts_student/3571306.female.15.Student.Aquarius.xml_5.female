(What's the difference from now, eh? '-__-) I'm still a loner at heart ^_~. Anyway...I just came back from the movies and I saw Shrek 2(FINALLY)! I have dubbed thy donkey/dragon/mutant babies, DRAGONKIES! Now I want one! Lol! As you may have guessed, I'm quite sugar high from all that candy I ate at the theatre! ^^; So pretty much, this post is randomness all the way! Muwahahahahahaha! Hah! I can see you shaking your head! Don't you laugh at me! Only I can laugh at me :D! Hehe...well now that that's over, why don't I talk about something, uh, less pointless ^^'? Hmmm, let's see...I saw my brother graduate on Tuesday and it was so weird to see him up on stage! Oh and all the pretty dresses! Ooooh can't wait till I grad! It's going to be soooo fun picking out and trying on dresses until I find the perfect one! But then again, gradding is so nerve-racking. I mean, you gotta go off to college or university after the summer, not lil ol' Claremont anymore. You gotta make it on your own. When I saw the ceremony, I thought to myself, "I'm going to go through this in 3 years,". Three years isn't that long either ya know. It's strange how we've come so far, yet we haven't even seen half of our lives yet. o_O I'm really scaring myself now! Think I'd better go before I start reminiscing about my childhood again...
