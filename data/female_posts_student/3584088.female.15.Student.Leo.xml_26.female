It just remains "unspoken" it's funny but ya know how it is! Last night my dreams came true Rich finaly said he'd love to date me but then there was a BUT he said But I'm inexperienced I kinda just laughed at him.....Idk if he realizes i'm the same as he is and how much I acctualy like him...welk i g2g ttyl      leiben caci
