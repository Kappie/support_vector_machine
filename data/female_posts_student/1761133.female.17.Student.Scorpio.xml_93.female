Monday- I passed out Tuesday-Mr. Wiater's grandson and Mrs. Groven's son both in the hospital...connection: They're both my teachers Tuesday-Mr.Wiaters grandson died Wednsday-Matt passed out...connection:ex-boyfriend...sorry Matt but I'm laughing right now... Wednsday-Amanda's brother in the hospital...connection: Amanda is my best friend, and he's also my friend, too Thursday-the only normal day...but it's still daytime...night is yet to come...
