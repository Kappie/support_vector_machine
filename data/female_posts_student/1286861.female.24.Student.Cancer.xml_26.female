At first, I was kind of sad to be working so much. Then I realized that I will have 80 hours of regular wages and almost 30 hours of overtime on my next paycheck. I really don�t see anything wrong with that :)   Rob came up last night. He brought a movie, we had some Taco Bell. There was no longer a connection like there was before. He made it obvious that he was not interested in going any further with me. With the events as they are, all my questions have been answered�finally. I no longer need to stress over it.  I have been thinking about Jason more and more. He only lives 45 minutes from me, but in the position I currently find myself in, that is a really really long way to go. We have so much in common, think a lot alike. I talk to him everyday on the phone, and I am not sure what, when, or if things will happen with him. A girl can dream :)  My mom, my brother Corey, his wife Jenna, and their baby Westley have all officially moved into a townhouse right down the street from me. All of my siblings, save my sister Jamie, is now located here in the Antelope Valley. It is exciting, and a little overwhelming all at the same time. It is great that they are here and we are close, but at times I wish they weren�t. It�s a Catch 22 I guess.  I am working and doing Jesus Christ Superstar. The show is still a little rough�which worries me a little bit. We move from the college Black box theatre to the Lancaster Performing Arts Center�to the Main Stage. Hopefully things will begin to click and form into the show it should be. I know it will be a great something to watch, but there is a certain element that we as actors are missing onstage�I am sure some know what I am talking about. Oh well. Onward!  I miss having good friends. Slowly but surely, I find myself losing people who were once close to me. I figure a lot of this has to do with the fact that I can no longer bring myself to them�not having my own car and all. Then I realize, what kind of friends are they in the first place that in my time of need, they distance themselves and do not make an effort to see me rather than just the other way around. Reality is at times a hard pill to swallow, but I kind of see how it is at the moment.  Generally, all is well. Please, all who read�if any�feel free to email or comment at will. I would love to hear from you. Thanks :)
