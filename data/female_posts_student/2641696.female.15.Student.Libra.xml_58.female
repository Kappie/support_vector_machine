Not illegal drugs, don't worry. I'm not that depressed yet. But damnnn... that was painful T.T   So now, I am working on my mini-project (website! yay!), and trying to finish enough of it so I can post up the links and be all happy... HOWEVER. J'ai une probleme. I need another idea for a mini-site. See, I have this amazingly cool set-up for the homepage (i-frames and everything! aw ya!), but for it to look really, REALLY cool, I need 5 links. Not 4. So... any ideas?   Heeheeheehee... and btw -- how did the performance go? I bet ya sounded better without me lol.   A few more things... I'll probably be at school tomorrow, I'm getting my hair cut (YAA), and happy Easter! Oh, and I love Maynard.   Have I said that already? ^^;;;;;;
