I can be that person from time to time (I am not kidding myself into thinking I am a generally up and pleasant person all the time) but there are certain people that are just negative all the damn time. I wonder if they see it and I am certainly not going to be the one to point it out to them.... but still, it's hindering my ability to get through the day unstressed... AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! [ Fri Sep 06, 08:59:44 AM | Erin Trost | edit ] Alan informed me last night that Cover Bands "COVER" other people's music... thanks for the clarification and all this time I thought that they were just trying to rip off other artists and say it was there own. No wonder I have been pissed off when I go to bars all the time. :) So that is why the bands can get away will calling themselves things like the "Dave Matthews Cover Band"... it's all coming together now... the wheels are turning! (For those who don't know... that was pretty much all sarcasm!)
