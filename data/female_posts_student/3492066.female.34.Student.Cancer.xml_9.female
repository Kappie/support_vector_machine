In short, that site will be the illustrated version of this one as that they have free picture hosting.  It’s been a busy week to say the least, but isn’t it always when looking back, and as that I have not been keeping this updated daily as I would have liked, it’s going to be a long entry.   HARRY POTTER: THURSDAY  4 JUNE Last Thursday was of course the midnight showing of “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.” Through fortune, and Lloyd mowing the lawn, we got the chance to go to the show, and I was rather...well, surprised. For starters, only one theater in St. Louis was doing a midnight show, and amazingly enough it was very easy to get tickets even at three in the afternoon. Admittedly, with the popularity of Potter, I had expected something on the level of “Star Wars Episode I”-style attendance making both for sold out tickets as well as a lot of people in costume and long lines. I was wrong on all three counts.   Showing up at 9:30 p.m. Thursday night, I had expected to find a long line, or at least a sizable one, but found instead only three people there for the movie, and all of them were sitting at the little tables in the cafe area of the theater. To say the least, I was beginning to wonder if I wasn’t coming off as a fan-girl type of person; I mean I enjoy the Harry Potter books, but I’m not up for doing costumes and whatnot, though I do find it neat to see young people all wrapped up in it all. About 9:40 a gaggle of young ladies came in dressed to the nines in Hogwarts uniforms armed with both wands and the English school robes that usually are only seen (and cheaply so) at graduations in the states. Hoping that folks would show up in costume, and wanting to share the event later with my friends (costuming is a real bear sometimes, and I laud folks for taking up the effort both for their enjoyment as well as others’), I had trundled along the digital camera that my sister and her husband had given me for Christmas (given to me along with an order that when I go to Ireland for school that I take LOTS of pictures). I almost fell over with the vocal shout of enthusiasm when I asked the young ladies (very lively teenagers! I only wished I had a portion of their energy) if I could take their picture. So...for those of you on my “Illustrated Diary,” you can see the picture below, though it still needs fixing.  Oh, yes, and I need to make a note here that I stopped by the local YMCA and picked up an application. Wednesday I had seen that they had a help wanted sign out, called, and found out that they had a front desk position open part time.  urlLink    Hogwarts Students urlLink     FRIDAY 5 JUNE As per every Friday, I took  my nephew along with my sister and my niece to have Brendan (found out it’s spelled with an “a”) meet with his speech therapist. Beforehand I had to drop Lloyd off for job training over at the community college where, while going to school, he’ll be maintaining their computers. So, for an hour it was myself and Meghan, and I actually found something that she enjoys doing. Usually I bring a huge box of crayons (the advantage of being older...no one can say “no” when you want the bizillion different colored crayons out there) and a pad of paper, but this time I brought the makeup and manicure bag (this coming from a rather plain woman). So, for an hour I did her fingernails and put a little makeup on here including glitter to make her look like a little princess. Oh she loved it! :-) I got a picture of it, but as that I’m still learning the oddities of my camera, the glitter didn’t show up all that well.  I also received my financial aid award letter, also known as how much I can accept for student loans. Aside from it being more than I got last year, I also don’t have to worry about paying for student housing in the dorms, so I’ve got a little something extra to pay other bills with.   urlLink    Brendon urlLink      urlLink    Meghan Dressed Up urlLink      SATURDAY: 5 JUNE This and Sunday were kind of rough days for me as that I had promised to run five role-playing games at the Die Con gaming convention and I could not make it, and it was just eating me alive not to be there. There was a problem with my car (to say the least!), and had I been thinking straight I might have gotten a lift from someone, but even off the top of my head now I can’t  even  think of anyone who would have been available to take me.   Well, Lloyd’s mom was talking about getting me a cell phone, maybe it’s about time, as well as getting contact numbers for the folks I’ll be running games for.  Sadly, we got word on Saturday that one of the long-time members of the church I attend (when I have the time, although Mom Sungcha aka Lloyd’s mom, goes every week) passed away while she was in the hospital. We were told of the funeral and memorial arrangements, and asked if we could help out since she really didn’t have a very large family.  As if to add to this, although the day started with CNN Headline News saying that Ronald Reagan was very ill and it was thought that he would pass away in a few months, later in the day it was announced that he had just died.  Let me start by saying that at almost 34, I was old enough to experience and remember the Reagan years in the White House, and although I didn’t hold with everything he did and didn’t do, I do have a portion of respect for the man. I also have a healthy respect for the relationship he and Nancy had, and how hard it must have been both physically and emotionally to take care of him over the later years with his struggle with Parkinson’s disease. It comes across very clearly that president or not, she very much loved the man.  Anyhow, with all this looking at my own past, my own personal history, it’s made me even more aware of the memories I carry. I remember being on a school-sponsored spring-break trip to Washington D.C. when the “line in the sand” thing was going on with Muammar Al Qadhafi of Libya and how close the U.S. battleships could sail to Libya (this after it was found that the people who had blown up a West Berlin nightclub and killed U.S. service-people were linked to Libya). Makes me wonder how many people remember the invasion of Panama and the ouster of  President Manuel Noriega on December 17, 1989, Noriega when the elder George Bush took over from Reagan. Then of course, there was the Iran-Contra scandal with Oliver North in the mid-80’s. Before the fall of the Berlin wall, and that blessed soul Mikhail Gorbechev who headed the former Soviet Union, I remember how terrified I was that some idiot somewhere would become mentally unhinged and launch a nuclear warhead and start a war.  http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/presidents/rr40.html http://www.qadhafi.org/  Speaking of old memories. A couple of weeks ago I stopped by my storage locker and picked up a pair of old cowboy boots I had. One of the first things out of my mouth was a thanks to my dead grandmother for having them cleaned, because they are now about 22-years-old. Yep, my boots are older than some of my friends, and here’s the kicker, they still fit! My old boots that I had gotten before I went to horse-back riding camp at the YMCA camp, had worn to a wonderful looseness, soaked repeatedly in creeks (it’s like air conditioning for the feet) and walked in for I don’t know how many miles...boots that I used to wear around our family farm.... it was suddenly like meeting my 12-year-old self, and all sorts of memories I hadn’t thought of in so long came pouring back in a good way. Things like being up in the barn loft and sitting on the hay and writing while reading “The Neverending Story” by Michael Ende, ice skating on the pond in winter, seeing the full moon go down outside my window in summer, the sound of the frogs around teh pond, catching tadpoles every year, it just goes on.  Oh, yeah, and thanks to me being home on Saturday, I also got a call from my mother. Admittedly, I was left wondering if she was calling me to make arrangements for both Lloyd and I to come out and help her move something, but that wasn’t the case.  Apparently my mother has found proof that what has been told to my grandfather’s side of the family (my mother’s father) has been true...we are indeed descended from royalty. Now let me add this caveat here and say that we’ve never thought that we belonged to the house of Stuart or even the house of Windsor let alone the house of Hannover. It’s just that we knew somewhere in the German lineage there was talk of nobility, and my mother found the who, the what, and the wear.  To sum up, I am apparently a princess of the house of Ruess. Between 1200 and 1300 A.D. one of the first Heirich’s in the family (named after the Holy Roman Emperor Henry who had given the title of duke and then prince to the family) went to Russia and not only found a wife, but fell in love with the land. When he returned, he took on the new name of Ruess, which means “Russian” in the German of the period. Now the area of the principality of the house of Ruess was sort of medium, pushed up near Czechoslovakia, only with the fights with Saxony to the west, it got shrunk down even smaller to the point that after the Ruess line split into two halves (in 1564), the Elder and the Younger, that as of 1919 it was the two smallest principalities in what was to become Germany. Gera was the capital for the younger line of Ruess, and is in an area called “Thuringia” in Germany, not far away is Greiz, the capital of the older line. Sadly, Gera was largely destroyed in 1945 by allied bombings. Anyhow, Franz Ruess, a member of the elder line, came over to the U.S. in the 1830’s and founded my family. Needless to say, my niece, Meghan fits the bill of “princess” perfectly, although we’ve dubbed her “drama princess.”   SUNDAY: 6 JUNE Aside from lamenting the fact that I felt like I had let down the folks at Die Con (purely my feeling, and not the head of the convention or anyone else saying anything...I even sent an apology letter along with an explanation of my absence), I have no idea what I did on Sunday. And yes, I do take what I promise to do seriously, and that includes running a game.   MONDAY: 7 JUNE Ran over to campus to drop off my financial aid award letter and found out that the disbursal of the funds won’t happen until a week before school starts. The bad news is, I still owe the cashier’s office a little less than $100 for health stuff, and a couple of things I needed to pick up at the book store.  I also went and picked up the books I’d requested on archaeology and language, and...well...I think I’ve found my niche: Archaeological Linguistics. And yes, it’s indeed a real field, and apparently a very active one. The thing is, though, not only do I need to have German (for current research), Latin (for older works) and Ancient Greek, but I also need French (for current theories) before moving on to graduate school. Hmm...I wonder if I ever mentioned that I want to learn Korean and Russian as well along with Irish Gaelic, Welsh, and Old English? :-)   I also stopped by the YMCA and dropped off my application for employment with hopes that maybe I’d fit.    TUESDAY: 8 JUNE Well, I had written up a long entry on this day for the diary, but my computer locked up and I lost it (which is why I’m writing this on Word before posting it to the net). It was a year ago that day that my grandfather had passed away, and although I missed him, and my grandmother, I didn’t feel super-sad or weepy. I did take care of myself, and kept active by helping Lloyd work on the shelves for the storage garage out back; it’s turning out to be a really complex-ish task, not to mention a very warm one with this latest weather.   urlLink    Lloyd urlLink        WEDNESDAY: 9 JUNE Found out that there’s a book called 501 Latin Verbs. YES!!! All the verbs are put through their tenses and declensions, and when I have the funds, I’m getting the thing, along with a copy of the book we’re going to be using for Ancient Greek at school. I have to admit, after looking at a sample page, I’m a little nervous of the Greek...it’s a whole new alphabet that I’m going to have to learn, but at least the professor and I know each other so I should have help.  After running to get lunch for my sister and the kids, she was stuck at home, there was a phone call on the answering machine from Lisa at the YMCA, she wanted to get me in for an interview. I of course gave her a call back and had a delightful conversation with her, and we set up the appointment for Thursday at 2 p.m. for me to come in which worked perfectly.   THURSDAY: 10 JUNE The morning started out a little earlier than usual. Mrs. Arbogast’s funeral service at the church was at 9 a.m., and we where there to help out as well as be of support. After not being at church for almost six months and then some because of school, the bishop and the others were glad to see me back, and said as much very clearly, and teased me about being gone. I also found out that aside from being a practicing lawyer (yes, the clergy of my church have regular jobs to make ends meet), I found out the bishop is also a linguist. Needless to say, when he has the time, I’m going to have to talk more with him, also I do enjoy the fact that he doesn’t just go through the motions of a service and then give a sermon, he actually literally sits down and tells us the history of what is done during the service and whatnot. So, yes, as a history-type of person, you can see why he sort of appeals to me as a person, although the poor gentleman always seems so hurried.  Lunch at Denny’s with Mom Sungcha, Lloyd, and Sister Jane (cool lady), followed by a brief time at home to change and check mail before hurrying off to my interview.  Well, the interview went rather well. The interview itself lasted an hour, and at the end of it Lisa and Nick (who will be my two supervisors) offered me the job at the YMCA. So, not only do I get to work a part-time job where they’re very willing to work around my schedule (Nick’s going to college as well), but I also get a membership to the Y, and health and dental insurance as well as life insurance! The folks there too are great, I mean I’m really impressed with them. The work environment is comfortable, relaxed, and supportive. The thing Nick and Lisa stressed to me was that the Y is a non-for-profit organization, that they’re there to provide a safe and healthy place for the community as well as support. Did I mention the place is huge? I mean this is the perfect job for me right now. It gives me a break from studying, makes me socialize, lets me share something I enjoy (the Y is just that kind of place where it encourages getting exercise and playing), and I get a paycheck. Add to that, it’s a job that will make me healthier!  You know, I was a bit concerned about my weight. I mean sometimes I just don’t like the way some cloths look on me, and frankly I’ve avoided shorts for years. So, I’ll be in a place where I can get exercise as well as education on how to do so. I still have to giggle that Mom Sungcha had me go grocery shopping yesterday. I’ve been concerned about being sure I have fruits and vegetables that that’s the majority of food in the refrigerator: corn, strawberries, grapefruit, watermelon, carrots, salad, and golden delicious apples.   Speaking of which...I need to go get something to eat. :-)   urlLink    Brendan teaching Lloyd how to play the piano urlLink      urlLink    The Little Princess urlLink
