Oh well :P Millionaires become so by being stupidly lucky half the time. The other half of the time they're people who aren't amazing but have a hell of a lot of dedication. Then somewhere there are people who are actually clever and become millionaires *i'm sure i'll fit in somewhere* :P Naaah I don't actually mean it, I would probably boycott myself if I did become a millionaire! So therefore tests are pointless and therefore is over-rated. Damn hyphens, who created them? They're sooo annoying! But anyway... it's A Levels that actually matter, they make up your UCAS points and that dictates which university you can get into. Still it's not good to totally fail your GCSE's, it's about proving something to yourself plus it can't be good for your confidence. Just try your best and do good! They onl matter for people who are leaving really. Also it's kinda good to get an A in that one subject where ou were predicted a C and the teacher patronised you all through GCSE's. Ahh I'm gonna enjoy that.
