Haftagohaftagohaftago. I've never seen Dave live but if he's half as good as Jason live then I think I'll just shit myself. Now where to get fifty dollars...   I'M SO BORED. YOU GUYS SUCK. I JUST SPILLED WATER ON MYSELF. CRAP. I LOVE THE CAPS-LOCK BUTTON. EVERYTHING I SAY SOUNDS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. I ENJOY THE COMPANY OF MONKEYS. THERE'S A FRECKLE ON MY FINGER. THAT'S A WEIRD PLACE TO HAVE A FRECKLE. FRECKLE'S A COOL WORD. IT'S STARTING TO LOSE ALL MEANING. I CAN'T EVEN TELL IF I SPELLED IT RIGHT. I HAVE A FRIGGIN' MOLE ON MY LIP. I DON'T LIKE IT. I HAVE A MOLE BY MY EYE. WHY? BYE.
