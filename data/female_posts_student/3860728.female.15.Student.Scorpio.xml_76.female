I mean.. what if something were to happen to him. So he just called and im trying to decide whether i should call him back or not. Here are reasons i shouldn't call him back:  1) I want him to suffer just as i have  2) long distance calls cost a shitload  3) I might seem needy  reasons to call back:  1) I miss him ever so much  2) Maybe something really is wrong  3) I have nothing else to do.  Beezlebub why must you taunt me? Why must you pull my ASH thousands of miles away from me.. damn you beezlebub. I shall call him.
