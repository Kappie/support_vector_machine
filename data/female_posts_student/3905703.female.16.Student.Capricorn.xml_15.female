For the uninitiated he is the same guy who has written a quiz book, and the preface of which has been done by Siddharth Basu.(if u pay any attention to what Mrs. chona says in the assembly u wud kno.)  Ok, finally I think we are going to check out Spidey on Monday after school. These summer months are very nice. Quite a lot of birthdays resulting in good eating and seeing quite a lot of movies. Well, this is the last year, and what with only 4 months left for school to get over, its creeping in. The feeling of not getting to see most of ur friends that is. I mean we dont even know where we are going to land up finally. And the bloody irony, is that though u would love to spend these last months having a gala time with your friends, chatting with them as if there was no tomorrow, u cannot as this is also the crucial year which decides where we go after this, and how our careers shape up. So, even though u would wanna talk to somebody ,u have to cut the converstation short. Well, most of my friends feel, that I am quite rude over the phone. (coz I usually start my conversation, by saying, "Ha, Bolo"). I think they do understand...  Anyhow, I havent forgotten a certain somebody's phone number. Right.   Lookin forward to lots of fun on Monday , well its only on some rare occasions that we have Soumya and Kanika going with us to see a movie. But this is only after overcoming the barrier of the Chem Monday Test , the course for which is humongous.
