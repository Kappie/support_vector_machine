Each letter, pushing my mind into a whirlpool of thoughts, it would seem my only salvation. Confrontation seemed my downfall, i could not control either my pleasure or displeasure of talking to those who see face value (a mask) rather that the person who shows herself when they walk into the room. Very few people can actually see the real me....... you should know who you are, thanx for listening. While i hid behind "my books surcease of sorrow" i noticed something, there really are people who care for me. No matter how much i feel like their aren't, there's always someone there, sitting next to me, asking how i feel. Let this be the truth, sure there will always be days when i feel so alone and like the world is just too much for me, but you will be there, won't you, promise me this or i don't think the world would hold any value for me anymore.
