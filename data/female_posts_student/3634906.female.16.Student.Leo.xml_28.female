Yes, I dont know the circumstances or what has been going on between him but he needs to chill out. He got all pissy because shes at her storage limit and his email cant get through to her. Boo Frickity Who. And what pissed me off even more the fact that he said its probably because of those "fuckers max and jarred" What the hell?!?! He is the biggest baby ever. How much you want to bet that if I said that I email Britt a lot he would have gone psycho on me and killed me. He is way too up tight for his own good. My god, its only been 3 days, thats it. They arent a married frickin' couple and they are only 16. He should not be freaking out over 3 days of not talking, even if they are fighting. Its not like couples are always together everyday of there life and its not like 16 year olds should freak out over 4 weeks apart, if anything it should do them good. He's way too wrapped up in her. He's 16 for christ's sakes. So if he reads this, and I hope he does, and he confronts me on it that is my reasoning. He is 16, he has the rest of his life ahead of him and many more girlfriends before he finds the one. I'm not saying the he and Britt wont last but if they do I am sure that at one point in time they will take a break to meet new people. How can someone my age say that he is going to spend the rest of his life with someone when they are so young. Come on when youre this age you are more likely to cheat on someone than to last. But maybe I'm wrong, I'm not saying I'm right, they may prove me completely wrong and if they do good for them. Even so I am sticking with my thoughts of 3 days of not talking is not a big deal, and if it is then you are way too attached for your own good.   Well anyways I really needed to vent about that because it really pissed me off. I know its not a nice thing to do and I will probably regret it but I cant deny that I mean every single word of it. If I ever become that infatuated with someone I hope someone will slapped me and tell me I'm being stupid. Please. I get so carried away on things like this because its something that really bothers me. I'm sorry. I dont mean to come off as a stupid jealous bitch, because I'm not. Or maybe I am, maybe I am just wishing that I had someone to be attached to. I dont know but I still think its gross. Its not like I dont want to be in a relationship. Of course I do. And of course it would be a serious relationship and of course I would want to see and talk to the person that I am with as much as possible but I cant let that be the center of my life. I have seen too many people get into a relationship and suddenly they ditch all their friends. I cant do that, I would include my boyfriend in the things I do with my friends but I would also do things with just my friends. I really do want a relationship but everytime I find someone that I feel like I could be with something gets in the way. And really I'm not going to push it. I'm young, I hopefully have many years ahead of me. If I do get into a seriously relationship soon, good for me. But its not something that I am going to force onto myself. I want something real, not just something to fill the void of not having someone. I can handle being alone, I may not always like it but I try not to dwell on that fact. I deal with it and I remind myself that something could happen tomorrow and I could fall in love and it also might not happen for a few years. Only time will tell. No lie I could tell you someone I want a relationship with but wanting it isnt going to get me it any faster. Its just more likely to push it away and for it to never happen. I will just keep telling myself that something will happen, I cant make it happen I will fall into it. Or let's hope so.   goodnight   -gabby
