The other night I got completely wasted, oh gosh! **Good Times with the Gurls. Anyways, The only problem with this summer is the incredible amounts of boys comming in. It's a tad overwhelming. I'm trying to focus on this particular guy, "My Baby", who shall remain anonymous for now. I've been interested in him for almost an entire year, and slowly we're getting somewhere. We've become pretty tight and we've shared a few "intimate moments", but it has never been at the relationship level. He's such a horndog! We've been hanging out a lot, at least once to twice a week. He called me last night, but I couldn't go. Fuuuuuck! He doesn't even realize how amazing he is. He's got a side to him that I only know, it's so cute, romantic, and passionate. The first time I saw it, I fell for him so fast. It kinda sucks though, because there are other guys that I'm semi-involved with too. One is Josh and I'm not sure what I should do. I met him, he's incredible, plays in a band called "False Exposure" and is overall the cutest thing I've everlaid eyes upon. We met before I went to India and when I came back he had a girlfriend. I mean, I didn't expect him to like me or anything, because we had just met, but he still flirts with me like hell. Last night he told me his girlfriend wasn't going to last long, and he didn't mind if I stole him from her. Wow, I felt sorta bad, considering he tells her how much he loves her, and then I'm this "mistress" that he's teasing like hell. I dunno what to do, but then again, shouldn't I be concentrating on my baby?
