So i woke up and got dressed and got the skateboard and rode over to seans. I stayed there for a little bit, helping out then he came over and keith and sean plus me all watched this thing on crop circles. Then he left and my parents were gonna go out somewhere, and asked me and keith if we wanted to go. I said sure, and got my cd's and sketch pad ready. But keith, of course, wanted to stay home. So we left, and we drove to st.petersburg. Then we stopped at this outdoor mall. We went into this realllly cool store called The Buzz, its got all of these great clothes for everyones style....very smart because everyone has different tastes in clothing. They had, uber preppy clothes then they had urban and then they had goth/punkish clothing-they had just every style. I tried on some jeans-and everyone knows i love my jeans, but i didnt seem to like any. Then we left that place and went into a shoe store...okay get this - sandals that look like you could get them for 20 dollars at Wal-Mart are exactly: $275!!! thats crazy if you ask me. But supposedly they're really comfy and last for a very long time. So ya, and then we went to this other mall called DeSoto. I wasnt really having a great time with clothes but, oooh this is a good part. (Best part of my day) i went into the Fye store and just looked around at some cd's and groups and accross from me i hear this singing, and it was funny singing like not trying at all, and i look up and smile, and its this reallllly cute guy. And he's like 'sorry' an i said 'oh its okay' and looked down at the other cd's and one of his friends was like 'dude your freaking people out' and walked a bit and smiled and he's like 'what?she liked it, see i got a smile outa her' , then he said 'im from Alaska so dont mind me' and all of his friends were like 'ya dont mind him' .....so after that encounter i picked out some new ear things for my walkman and left. After alittle bit, i decided to go into Spencers, and guess who i see?!!? the same guy in Fye. Well he saw me too, and i was looking at some jewlery, but u know, kinda looking at him too, and he passed me and said hey and went over to the card section. (the cards there are so grose) so yep i walked up to him and i said 'why do all of these people bring they're kids in here?' and he's like 'yeah i know what you mean', and we both looked at this grose card and laughed at eachothers reactions. So then we started talking about how he's down here for a baseball camp and stuff and all that, and then he dropped the bomb with the question...'so how old are you?', so i said 14,, being honest and he's like 'darnit' and i asked 'well how old are you?' ....he's 17! WHHHYYY ME?! gosh he was cute, funny, great personality...but i mean he's from alaska and of course he'll be gone in a while but, why does he have to be 17? or why do i have to be 14?! aghh. I swear, he's is the cutest guy i've seen all year, and talked to. darn, oh well, more fish in the sea...but, boy did i have a great day lol. yes francesca we shall go to the Vans Warped Tour '05, i talked to the cashier at Fye and he said he went to the show yesterday, and he said it was realllly hot there and he couldnt stay there because it was hot, he was even under a tree.. and i know that if i went this year, i would have gotten overheated because that always happens to me when im out in the sun for a long time or in a hot building or something.  So yep thats it, and i'll probably be going to that mall again tomarrow.
