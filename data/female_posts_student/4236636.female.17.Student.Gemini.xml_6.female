Me and my mom have spent a lot of time together the last couple days, it's cool especially since I haven't seen her all summer since she's been in Montana with her dad who died a couple weeks ago. Scott Bayo is on the show right now advertising his new movie "Baby Geniuses 2", I really want to see it, the first one was so funny. Speaking of movies I watched "The Count of Monte Cristo" last night, it was really good, I had never seen it but it's my best friend from Massachusettes's book. Afterwards I realized I hadn't left the house or done pretty much any excercise so I did jump rope for about 20 minutes, some pullups and then different stomach exercises for about 30 minutes. I felt a lot better afterwards! Tryouts start tomorrow...I have to go get my physical today, I hate waiting in the waiting room, it always takes 4ever! Did I mention this year my sister is trying out with me, gosh I've been with her all summer, sometimes she gets on my last nerve, I hope they seperate the freshman so I don't have to be around her every day since I've already been around her everyday all summer! Oh well, Life is good. GOD BLESS
