And on a darker note I lost my spiral notebook which contained my Bio notes and packet, all my Geometry and Romeo and Juliet stuff.   It really holds just about everything of academic importance.  It sucks.  So tomorrow I'm gonna figure out what has happened to it.  If I can't find it I'll get all the notes from Mr. M and fail Geometry for the quarter.  I choose not to sink into a depression over this and I am determined to be upbeat about life.  Even though it does suck.  Hey Becca and Erica when do you think we can see Home on the Range?  Talk to me later.  Tomorrow is a focus day! Whoo Hoo!
