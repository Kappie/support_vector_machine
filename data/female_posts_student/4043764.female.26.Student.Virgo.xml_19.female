Of course, my drive up had its lonely, dark, and pensive moments, so I popped in  urlLink George Carlin 's "What am I doing in New Jersey?" It's a little dated, but amazingly relevant to the current political climate. Just substitute the name "Bush" for "Reagan".  Anyway, there's this bit where he says:  " I don't know how you feel, but I'm pretty sick of church people. You know what they ought to do with churches? Tax them. If holy people are so interested in politics, government, and public policy, let them pay the price of admission like everybody else. The Catholic Church alone could wipe out the national debt if all you did was tax their real estate."   Eventually, he uses the phrase "tax these church motherfuckers", so I am not just being vulgar. Though I am known to be sometimes. So, what prompted this whole Carlin quotefest? I was reading the  urlLink Fall 2003  issue of Ms magazine (one of my new roommates' archived issues) and read a horrifying piece on the alliance between Pat Robertson and  urlLink Charles Taylor . As many of you readers know, I have a little more than a passing interest in this issue - when I was in Sierra Leone, I worked with Liberian refugees and Sierra Leoneans, many of whom experienced sexual and physical violence during the Taylor-backed wars. Here are some of the highlights of the article:      Robertson, through Freedom Gold Limited, an offshore company registered in the Cayman Islands but based at  urlLink CBN  headquarters in Virginia Beach, signed an agreement with Taylor and key cabinet members allowing the for-profit Freedom Gold to explore and receive gold mining rights in southeastern Liberia.     Robertson tried to get US support to send troops to uphold the "Christian" Taylor government, despite the accusations against the former Liberian leader: Taylor provided financial support to al-Qaeda and has been indicted for war crimes in Sierra Leone (he armed rebels who amputated the arms and legs of civilians in an effort to control diamond mines).     Robertson brokered a similar deal for diamond mining with Zaire's Mobutu, yet another sketchy dictator type - that time, he used money donated to non-profit Operation Blessing (propped up as a source of humanitarian aid) to mine for diamonds. Of course, Robertson called for an end to sanctions against Mobutu's government, even though this guy looted Zaire's treasury and killed thousands. [Sanctions are contentious for me, because they rarely hurt the thieving dictators; they often hurt the people who are supposed to be served by the government - somehow, I do not think this was Robertson's concern.]    Perhaps this would not be as interesting if he were some generally immoral businessman and not an evangelical Christian minister/self-proclaimed righteous man who regularly attacks so-called immoral people and "lifestyles". In response to 9/11, he said: "The focus of many in America has been the pursuit of health, wealth, material pleasures and sexuality...sadly, those in the churches have been as self-indulgent as those in the world." Yes, Pat, it is pretty fucking sad.* If anything, the attacks were a result of misguided, inhumane foreign policy initiatives and not of corrupt churches and Americans seeking sexual pleasure (or "sexuality" as he calls it. If we were all so sexually pleasured, perhaps we would not have to resort to teaching folks how to be terrorists and then get pissed off when they use those tactics on us. But that's not really the point.)  The point is: I suppose he is not self-indulgent with his little business deals with corrupt rulers? Or perhaps he has redeemed himself with the Great Redeemer by doing well financially, after coming to Tidewater, VA, with only $70 in his pocket? Somehow, he manages to urlLink  preach  - with a straight face and a pocket full of cash - that if you worship as a Christian and send him money, you, too, can be prosperous**.  My interest in his commentary on class and upward mobility is further piqued when I read - in the same  urlLink biographical sketch  that talks about his coming to backwater Virginia with that $70- that before this, he attended Yale Law, NY Theological Seminary,  urlLink Washington and Lee  (real southern elitist school), an exclusive all-boys  urlLink prep school , and is the descendant of two presidents (easy, when those people are the Harrisons, but you get my drift).... Somehow, I think that having such connections tremendously increases the value of $70.  I am not going to pretend that I have not gotten far because of my education and my upbringing, but I am not going to lie and say that anyone can have whatever they want, whenever they want it because we live in this society where  everyone  - or is it anyone? - has a "shot" at upward class mobility. I have witnessed too much in my various places of work and play that this is just not true...  So what do you say? Should we tax the motherfuckers?    * Let me just say, that I think there is nothing wrong with pursuing health, especially given its status as a human right...   **Small print is that the real secret to acquiring wealth is to eliminate debt, earn supplemental income (easy when you have non-profit status on your primary income earner), invest well (you know, in gold- and diamond-mining), manage money better...though the guy insists that you must be "blessable" first. And you need to donate "at least $20" to get your "free book" that explains how you'll become prosperous.
