If it would rain, I would go out dancing. I would grab the nearest boy and dance all night long in the rain.  Or we could drink expresso and take a walk along the boardwalk. I could tell you all my secrets, if you'd tell me all of yours. We could hold hands and sit on the edge and pretend that everything's all right. It would be alright if I were with you.
