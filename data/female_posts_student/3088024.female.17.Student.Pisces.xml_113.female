Even if the movie has a good message, I won't watch it if there's too much swearing or dirty language, gratuitous violence, or any sex whatsoever. You have to decide where the line falls for you. "  1.”I try carefully to weigh the message against the objectionable content.”  Christianity teaches that salvation is by faith not by works.  God does not measure our good works against our bad works on a scale.  One sin tarnishes every good thing we could do and it damns us.  “A little leaven leavens the whole lump.”  Christians today, however, do not apply this spiritual truth.  As a whole, we try to justify what we watch by seeing if the “overall message” is good.  One curse, one act of violence, one bit of nudity or sexual innuendo is enough to damn a film.   Any of the film’s “good works” are nullified by any sin in the film.  Our holy God will not allow sin into his presence because it would tarnish His glory.  We should not willingly set sin before our eyes and ears.  Movies have a way of putting sin in a good light.  Homosexuality, murder, pre-marital sex, extra-marital sex are all examples of things the movies make look good.  No consequences.  Do what feels good.   2. ”Even if the movie has a good message, I won't watch it if there's too much swearing or dirty language, gratuitous violence, or any sex whatsoever.”  Too much swearing?  How much is too much?  In our family, it used to be one swear was too much and we changed the show.  Then it was decided that every show has one swear nowadays and so it was upped to two.  Then three.  Then four.  It is a progression.  Following the world from a distance is still following the world.  Are you, a finite human, capable of making a decision about how much sin is acceptable in one’s life?  Coincidentally, God says in the Bible we are not to allow sin in our lives.  So the call isn’t actually up to us.  “Gratuitous violence.”  Hmmm…What is gratuitous violence?  Well “Gratuitous violence is violence that is unnecessary or that does not portray wartime violence or violence that actually occurred (Jesus’ crucifixion)” Ok…People have sex all the time.  Is that acceptable?  Can I watch a portrayal of a married couple having sex?  OF COURSE NOT!  It dulls your mind and exposes you to things you should not be exposed to.  The same with violence.  It has been proven by studies that people who watch movies portraying ANY type of violence or listening to music with violent lyrics are more likely to commit violent crimes.   3. “You have to decide where the line falls for you. "  This implies that there are no absolute standards.  You can decide for yourself what is acceptable.  There is no absolute moral standard regarding movies.  If we say that we can decide what is acceptable, we are taking God out of the picture.      It is doubtful anyone has taken the time to read this entire article.  If someone did, it is unlikely they will change.  Most Christians today could be (and are) slapped in the face with God’s truth and would not do anything different just because they enjoy their sin.  C’est la vie.  I will pray that anyone who reads this might be positively affected.
