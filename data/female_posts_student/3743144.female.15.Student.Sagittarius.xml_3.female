That movie is hilarious in a non-sick-American Wedding way...except for the twins making out...altough there weren't really sister and bro, it's juss the idea of it...*cringe-twitch-twitch* oh and I also got some time to spend with...erm...my crush, if that's wut u call it...but yea, it was a marvy time and i may soon enough be in  looove heaven  *wink*  and I have to say he reminds me sooooo much of Cooper from Eurotrip...haha...except  not as  stupid....hahahahahahahaha....I'll juss laugh to myself about that movie cuz it was hilarious and continue laughing about how much cooper reminds me of him....*laughs hysterically for a long annoying time* ok done....But u know wut I think wud be great is being a roomate with that hot of a guy...*sigh*...scott  but let me ask u this...WHICH IS WORSE:being chased by scary fat naked men, watching their junk flap around  or  being behind all the men seeing their bum-oleys shake about?
