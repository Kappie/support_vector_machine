I'll probably type up my entire tour journal and post it up here for people to read. I've been hanging out with Zakk, Cara, Andrea, Mallory, Kenny, and Keith for the majority of my trip. Everyone seems to be pretty cool with everyone else... that's the great thing about tour. I played my last concert of my high school band career last night. I shed a tear, but I'm a pussy like that. At any rate, I better let Sally have the computer. Yeah, we're actually being rational. Ah... to Milan tomorrow and then home on Friday. I miss you all... :-/   I love you. :-)
