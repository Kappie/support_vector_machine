Well since I can't express how I feel in words, I'll do it by song lyrics. Here we go:   And now I think that you should know That you've got everything That I've wanted for so damn long And that I wouldn't hesitate to trade away everything If you tell me that I'm not wrong So know I think that you should know That I've been waiting for you   -Waiting For You-Allister    It's been so long I should just move on There's other fish in the sea But I keep hoping that you'll swim back to me   -The One That Got Away- Allister    I've been sitting here for hours Burned an image of you in my mind Finding comfort in the words you say But it's not the same I know you're worth the wait And I can't explain What I'm going through inside But I would turn away the world Just to have you here with me tonight   -Scratch-Allister    It wasn't supposed to be like this Another dose of unhappiness   -Emily-Bowling For Soup    How am I supposed to feel about the things I've done? I don't know if I should stay or turn around and run I know that I hurt you, things will never be the same The only love I ever knew, I threw it all away   -Breathing-Yellowcard    Waking up from this nightmare How's your life, what's it like there? Is it all what you want it to be? Does it hurt when you think about me? And how broken my heart is   -Empty Apartment-Yellowcard    Made my mistakes, let you down And I can't, I can't hold on for too long Ran my whole life in the ground And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone And something's breaking up (breaking up) I feel like giving up (like giving up) I won't walk out until you know Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one who gets me like you do You are my only my only one   -Only One-Yellowcard    I am destroyed by the inside, I disassociate I hope to destroy the outside, it will alleviate and elevate me Like water flowing into lungs, I'm flowing through these days Like morphine cuts through, through deadened veins, I'm numbing in these days   -Bleed Black-A.F.I.    Make a move on me baby I cant be the one who's always taking chances see me down so you get down no you've got me all wrong i just want to kiss your lips and you kiss back   -Stay Away-Rooney   Well, hopefully now you can get an idea of how I might feel. No I don't want you to feel sorry for me. I just want you to understand me.
