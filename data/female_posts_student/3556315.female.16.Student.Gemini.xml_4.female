Original Soundtrack of Mita's Bloggieeee.... hohohohoho!   hiii... this is my first posting on my 'new' blog.. wekeekek... i forgot my old username and its password... and after I tried to figuring them up for 15 minutes, i decided to make a new one... kekekekekek...   SIMPLYMITA  is actually like this -> SimplyME(mi)Ta, kekekekek... nice address, isnt it?? yes it is of course! hohohho =) the idea popped up when i had a chatting with  urlLink Evita .   hmmm.. i chose  MiLky Way  coz it sounds so yummmmiieee... and more, it one of my most fav song from BoA.. the Korean Pop Diva. . . YEPP! I'm a big fan of Korean Pop Music, or aka. Kpop...!!!!~ i began to fall in love with Kpop around a year and half ago, i guess..  Now, i'm really interested to Korea, their pop music, their language, their culture, their TV channel (hahahaha) and everything related to Korea. And I fell for their famous group-singers :  SHINHWA!  They have everything u know...   1. great voice  (They can SING! they're not just an ordinary boyband...) 2. very nice songs plus very meaningful lyrics  3. good faces  (at least, they make me and other fans to fall in lub for them.  Most of my friends keep bugging me like this "where's the point for calling them handsome ?? i can't even  tell them apart!" hahahaha... I'm not going to argue. They have a lot of fans yelling their name everytime, it's a big proof, that I'm not the only one who say that they're DEADLY HANDSOME ! kekekekekek =P)  4. they're great dancers too!  5. and more more more more...   Kekekek.. most of them don't understand why I like Kpop very much, but yah.. everyone has their own interest, rite? I found out Kpop is so good, so i love it very much, just like others love Britney, Maroon5, Black Eyed Peas and more... hahaha! I was successful  to influence several of my friends to fall in love to Shinhwa... WeKekekekek, i think i'll make a good Shinhwa's Promoting Manager...!  Wahh.. i think it's quite long for a fist posting, so i just stop here, k??  annyong, ---mitoy---
