Ally fell asleep in my roomand Amanda and I fell asleep downstairs at around 5:30 AM. Then, my mom work us up at 8 AM to go to the lake! So we only got 2.5 hours of sleep. *yawn* And so we went to the lake and that was fun. We layed out and got pizza and took pictures and went on the jet skis. In the afternoon, I actually fell asleep at the pool and I have never done that. Actually, we all fell asleep, then it started to rain so we came in a little bit. Then we took out the jet skis again and Ally got to go because she called her mom and begged her (because she couldn't go before) and it was fun because I was going full throttle (60 mph) and Ally was screaming and scared. lol It was great. Then we went for dinner and came home. Now i'm watching The Miracle Worker with Helen Keller. It's a sad movie. Tonight Brad's suppose to come home. I miss him a lot. It seems like he's been gone forever and it's only been a week...a VERY long week. Tomorrow he's coming over and he's taking me to see A Cinderella Story (aww) and then coming back to my house and i'll cook him dinner or something. Well, that's all for now. I think i'll head to bed. Good night world. ~*xoxo*~*ju
