Today, I am lucky enough to be watching my niece (Caitlin, 4 years old) and my nephew (Toby, 1 year old) at my apartment. It gets better...when my mom gets home around 6pm or so, I get to take Caitlin downstairs to the pool to go swimming. It should be a...how should I say it...eventful evening.   I am very excited about Saturday. I will be taking the train to Fullerton Friday night after work to see  urlLink Brenden , the love of my life. On Saturday afternoon, we are going to meet my friend  urlLink Chris  and he, as the  urlLink master photographer  that he is, will be taking some pictures of Brenden and I. It is hard to imagine that  urlLink Brenden  and I have been together for almost a year and I do not have one photograph of us together.  urlLink Chris  may be able to bring his girlfriend, Danya, with him. It will be nice to finally meet her.   It will be nice to see  urlLink Brenden . We had a good talk this last weekend. It became obvious that we both need to work on the way we approach our relationship. I need to lighten up, that in itself will solve a lot of issues that arise. Slowly but surly, I will become a better person, right?   Living with mom is interesting. She does this touchy feely thing that really bugs me. I mean, not touchy feely, but poke me in the arm, or rub my head, or flick my ear, tickle the top of my hand....ARGH! I really really REALLY do not like it. I have shared these feelings with her. It has yet to do any good.   Leslie and Zach are moving here to Hesperia this weekend. The High Desert will be home to my mother, my brother Toby and his family, my sister Leslie and her family, and myself. Jamie remains in San Marcos with my Aunt and Uncle, and Corey and his family are in Arizona. It is sad that we all used to live in town together, and that we are slowly but surly moving apart...further and further. If my life goes as planned, I will be in Orange County in a year or so. Further and further...people donot understand this family ties thing. I don't think I need them to, just as long as they know what  urlLink my family  means to me.   I want to go to school.   Oh well.
