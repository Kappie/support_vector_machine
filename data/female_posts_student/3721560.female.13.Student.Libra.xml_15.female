That was a first.  ok after school I was going to my g-mas w/ my mom and we stopped at this stop light and there was a HOTT HOTT HOTT 16 or 17 yr old bside us and i glanced over and he was looking at me, but i went on talking, and my moms like "he was checking you out. . . .UR TOO YOUNG TO BE SCHECKED OUT!" Vierginia thinks its cause I wore this pink tank top and a shirt over it, and my hair dow. W/e. Anyway she left me to get a cd. *Sniff Sniif* how dare she leave me. lol anyway she is usually quite funny, it was gust yesterday she didnt put forth much effort. Oh well im not mad. l8er
