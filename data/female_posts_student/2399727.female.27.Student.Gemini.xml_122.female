He was polite enough to not say no, but said he would go away and think and pray about it.   He said that I sell myself very well; he kept flipping through the pages and re-reading them when he was here.    The food seemed to be a hit; apparently he's a cheese-aholic.  Glad that I picked some up as an afterthought.  He asked how I was doing "emotionally" and I told him about talking to Fr. D. (perhaps I shouldn't have?  He might have wondered why I didn't go to him instead... oh well.)  I also mentioned about my school decisions, and he seemed somewhat disappointed.  Well, he didn't "seem" disappointed; he said he was disappointed.  Gee, thanks  for the support ;-)     I just got back from walking him back to his car (he's the type who could easily get lost) and he gave me a lift back up the parking garage ramp so I could listen to Jesus Christ Superstar.  Go Judas.  More to come...
