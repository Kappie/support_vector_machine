I guess I'm on the computer some, and would prolly be considered a geek, but oh well. Computers are the way of the future, geeks just end up teaching the people that made fun of em ;)  Has anyone ever seen Dead Poets Society? I curious since its one of my favorite movies, yet no one I know has seen it. Well I have to go, my sister is yelling at me about some principal called, "Sharing"..whatever that means :p
