Imagine this:  Hold: 1 2 3 4 Prep into Triple Pirouette into Gran Jeté down to floor:  5 6 7 8 1 2 Stand up pose left, step right, layout left, down to floor: 3 4 5 6 Hold: 7 8 1 2 3 Rotate right, fall to splits,  spin around, roll up back: 4 5 6 7 8 Jump aravesc, prep into sodabasc, chassé, step, gran jeté:  1 2 34 5 6 7 8  ...and that is only about 20 secs of a 2 min 30 sec dance.
