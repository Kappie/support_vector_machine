Also something that has kept me from posting is that 'Hello' only lets me post .jpeg pictures and it's hard to find artwork that isn't .art, so i guess I will have to sign up with photobucket or something. I hate signing up for stuff.  I guess I shall start with Saturday because my short term memory only spans for that long.   Saturday I set out to drive a car with a manual transmission. It's something I've always wanted to be able to do, so I figured I might as well get it out of the way while I was still young. We set out to the dealership in Jasper (i practically live at the damn place now) and they let us borrow a 5 speed manual nissan pickup truck. Sooo we drove home and I got down to business in a parking lot. And by Sunday morning I was ready for the open road. So we drove to Auburn and man oh man, it was a long drive. I got to drive through the campus which I love. It's so country out there. We drove out to my Uncle Bud's farm (he's not really my uncle? Maybe my godfather?), which I didn't know existed until we arrived. I completely fell in love with the place. It was just plain comfortable and I felt like I was meant to be there. It was soo strange: I've always hated rural areas and the thought of being far out from the city or serial killers getting loose but something changed. Huge grassy fields, a barn --horses, kittens, and puppies running around, it was like the most amazing place and I wanted to move in right then. Not a single fancy thing about it, these 2 farriers were renting it from Bud, living in mobile homes and everything, and they seemed like the two happiest, laid back men ever to live. Maybe I am a city girl, but I know that at least once in my life Iwant the experience of living on a farm. Just visiting that place made upfor all the stress of re-learning how to drive.    Oh yeah so flash back to Saturday night. I hung out with Mitchell, who is truly one of the most amazing people I've ever met. He's one of those people that belongs in my life. I know when someone belongs when they know every single little thing about them, and they know every single little thing about me, yet spending time with the person is time that i wouldn't trade for anything. Oh yeah so back to what we did. Hm, not really anything. Oooh! I invented a new drink that is the shiznatch. 3 parts Mountain Dew and 1 part Jones' Soda- Fufu Berry. Mitchell came up with the name: Fufu Dew. Ha, you can tell we're running out of things to do. He took me to Target which was a big mistake, and I ended up spending $80. Bummer. But I did get Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume 2 - and the case art is soo cool, a new awesome skirt although I've got nowhere to wear it, and a totally cool gray cord jacket. Woop woop.   Oh yeah so flash back to today, which totally sucked. I went to class and got a 93 on test and did the hokey pokey and head and shoulders knees and toes knees and toes to practice body parts. It was craziness. And then we had to take the truck back to the dealership, thank god. Not only do I not want a manual car, but pretty much despise redlights now too. Getting back in a regular car totally screwed with my mind, my foot kept searching for the clutch and I kept wanting to downshift when coming to a stop, oh well. Then it started pouring down rain on the way home so every couple of miles there was a wreck or people who had run off the side of the road so there were major onlooker delays. Curse them. Now I'm just rambling.   P.S. Papa Johns' Barbecue Chicken Pizza w/out the Bacon is pretty darn tastey.
