I've done nothing all day 'cept make stencils, actually paint a stencil, make more stencils, bake cookies, talk on the phone, and yeah... that was by far, my least interesting day since school let out. And it's a bit grey/rainy, so I assume Ultimate Frisbee is out for tonight. Which gets me wondering... what ARE we doing for Youth tonight? But that's all part of the mystery and excitement.  I got Spongebob Squarepants pyjamas and just thought everyone should know.  I also found out that Dashboard Confessional will be visiting Vancouver in October (was it October), but unfortunately, will be playing a 19+ venue, which is a bit unsettling. I always thought Dashboard was for the kids. The kids who are stuck in a world of continuous heart break and rejection. Not a world of urban, trendy working young adults who drink on the weekends to forget their busy work lives. Oh well. I tried.  I am disgruntled. The jeans I was hoping to wear for tomorrow are not in the wash, but alas, still in the hamper. That's okay. I think I'll do some laundry tonight. It's sad to think that the only time I ever do laundry is when I need something to wear. It's not so bad though.
