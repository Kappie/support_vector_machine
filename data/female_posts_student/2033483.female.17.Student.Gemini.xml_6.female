Although, today he was going through my bag when I came back into the room.  I don't know what that was about he said I didn't have games on my calculator but I already knew that he could have asked and I would have told him the same thing.  But whatever he's cute I'll forgive him.  I'm thinking either Geoff or AJ told him I liked him b/c I get the feeling he knows.  I doubt Jason told him b/c Jason's not like that.  Or I guess he could have wandered into my blog and put two and two together and found out too.  oh well.    My morning was ya know school.  Lunch was fine.  Jason is a pretty cool kid.  Thanks for helping me with my physics question! Chem. was whatever.  I got a really good grade on my test but I expected that b/c it was super easy!  AP History was fun b/c we were supposed to work on our DBQs but did we?  No!  Brian Newcomb, Lizzie and I talked all period...one of my favorite past times.  haha Newspaper was there.  And obviously as you can all tell I survived my band room trip afterschool!    I went to Sioux Valley for the explorers program tonight b/c I liked it last year.  Hopefully this year we can do more things in the Pharmacy department b/c that's what I want to go into.  Pharmacy is a realistic career.  Right, Dad?  Although, if money weren't a factor I would try mass communications or something to do with the media b/c I really like that.   But we have to be practical and Pharmacy seems like a really nice career to go into and I'll have my cousin Jon to help me out since that's what he's in school for now.   Plus I found out tonight that's what Emily wants to go into too so that will be nice if that's how everything turns out.    I think that's enough nonsense for now night
