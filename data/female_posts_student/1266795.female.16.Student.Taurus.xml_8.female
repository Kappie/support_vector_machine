I actually like looking them up and stuff. it's interesting to see what the english translation is. Ridentem dicere verum, quid vetat? What prohibits us to tell the truth laughing (through a joke)? by: Horatius, Satirae i don't really get this one though. but then, i don't get a lot of things.  just a half of day left until we're outta school!!!!:-d i'm so happy!!! this year hasn't been the best, but i'm just glad that it's over.  it only seemed like yesterday that i was walking into chem class. i'm sad to say this, but i'm gonna miss mr. webster. even though he was the most horrible teacher, he was a good guy and he was incredibly smart. a lil too smart to be teaching high school, but this was his last year and we were the last class that he was ever going to teach:(  you guys should all go onto rateteachers.com and rate all your teachers. i think that's the website at least. i  haven't been on there in a while, but it's really funny how they rate the teachers. there's a ton on lupold and mr. savage:-p I've got ears!!!
