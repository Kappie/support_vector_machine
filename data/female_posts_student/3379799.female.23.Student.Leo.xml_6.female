Alot of them we don't use(like avoiding no good n-ggas, still working on that), alot of them sick in our mind like gum on the bottom of our shoes.  One saying that she taught me and I continue to use is "Cut um' off at the kneecaps."  Originally, it meant putting someone in their place after being disrespected or just plain fighting if necessary.  But amongst friends and family, it has become a battle cry.  It now stands for overcoming adversity, accomplishing your goals, and most of all, being everything you can be and then some.  So this is from my mama (STELLA) to you.  When the world seems like it is trying to kill you.  Trying to bring you down.  Trying to make you act a fool, CUT UM' OFF AT THE KNEECAPS!!  I hope this helps you DO BETTER!!
