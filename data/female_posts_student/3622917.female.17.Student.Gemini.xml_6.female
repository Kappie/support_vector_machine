Had to go to my brother's Grade 8 graduation. Ooh, better story actually. But I had better start at the start for this one.   I woke up at around eleven thirty, still in my pajamas I went on the computer. Right then. So I talked to Rachey and Kirsti and Kandis for a bit. Anyway, the day wore on and I ended up spending the whole day on the computer. Very bad. Very very bad. I dunno why I did that but I did. Anyway, so many crazy funni conversations were had. Hot with two t's. Yikes is a funny word. Assface. Etc. Pure hilarity really it was. I dunno. But yeah it was good.   Then I get a call from my mum and I have to go buy my brothers hair dye and then dye his hair. Yeah, so that was super fun. Anyway, this meant that I actually had to get dressed. It was about three thirty and I was still in my pj's. It was awesome. Awesomely lazy but nonetheless, it was. So I got dressed and walked up to my mummy dearest's place o' work. Picked up the deviant brother. Lovely. Anyway, we manage to fight and argue the whole way to the drug store to buy his hair stuff. Even better. So I buy the damn stuff and we head off to the little hole in the wall we call home. Ha ha ha! Dyed his hair and my arms and part of my face. It was a miserable little excursion. Miserable. Or course his hair turned out really nicely thanks to moi! Black and beautiful!   Then I had to go to brother's graduation. Oh my god. That was soo boring and long. I couldn't even believe it. It just kept going and going like that stupid little pink bunny on TV. There were soo many awards. And they all went to the same like five people. Just keep them up there and give them all the awards at once. It would be much easier and quicker and it would have saved me from almost falling asleep about a billion times. Yikes. lol Rach and Kirsti. That is all.  Fuck, I did have a point to this stupid little story and it was supposed to be funny. But I forgot it and it isn't now. Damn it! And Kirsti isn't even here, so I'll have to take the blame for my own stupidity. But really our two head are dumber than one. Jokes Kirsti! It's all good! But we are hardcore losers!  Okay well I am sorry that this went horribly awry. Damn memory.   G'night!   I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles  In our eyes are mirror images and when  We kiss they are perfectly alligned.  ~the Postal Service
