We are gunna go to the beach, have a BBQ with some friends, swim, like we do every year.   Ohhhhh I passed my deep upgrade on Wednesday night!! I was the only one in my group to do it on the first shot!!! We had to swim 8 laps in the wave pool. I was about a lap and a half ahead of everyone in the swimming and I ended up doing an extra lap (because I lost count) but thats ok! Then we had to go to the bottom of Shot Gun Falls and get a 10 pound brick from the bottom (doing a surface dive) and bring it up to the surface and tred water for 1 min. But you could lay on your back and hold the brick on your chest so that made it really really easy. Then they tell you to drop the brick and put your hands out of the water and you have to tred like that for 1 min then your done! It got to dark during my training to do the active skills so we are doing that tomorrow night after work. Only Me, and these 2 kids Luke and Alicia passed from our group of about 15 kids. Congratz you guys!! I can't wait to start my deep shifts!! I am looking forward to that!!!   Ok that's all for now. Have a nice 4th of July. I'll write some more tomorrow after my active skills.
