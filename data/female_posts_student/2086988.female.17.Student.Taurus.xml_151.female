Reading it again made me smile so much...so I just have to post it :) (I had to cut some stuff because it was really really long.)  D Phrygian: me too... you know, back in June, I honestly didn't think it would ever work ashsnl2005: thats not cool D Phrygian: but I wanted to give it a try, and besides, I didn't want to hurt you by saying so ashsnl2005: i never doubted it D Phrygian: I don't mean us, but the logistics of it D Phrygian: I didn't know if we'd ever meet, you know ashsnl2005: yeah... ashsnl2005: i know ashsnl2005: i thought about that too ashsnl2005: but we were determined D Phrygian: but I really wanted it to work, yeah D Phrygian: and then I was so worried about you calling me, lol ashsnl2005: i remember being so nervous asking you in june if you liked me D Phrygian: because Kyle didn't know about us for the longest time, cuz I thought he'd make fun of us ashsnl2005: awww D Phrygian: awwww ashsnl2005: lol D Phrygian: I'm so glad you asked ashsnl2005: yeah, well i didnt know, and you didnt seem like the type that would just blurt out and say something D Phrygian: I guess I knew you had a bit of a crush on me, but I don't know if I'd have ever said anything D Phrygian: yeah ashsnl2005: lol i can go look D Phrygian: lol, all right ashsnl2005: jk thats way too many convos D Phrygian: lol ashsnl2005: like idk how many D Phrygian: I remember our first few phone calls, too, those were cute... I was so nervous at first D Phrygian: but it was great to hear your voice ashsnl2005: i think when you really started opening up was the day before my last day of school and we talked for a couple of hours while you were in germany bc we hadnt talked in the longest time ashsnl2005: awww, yeah i was so nervous ashsnl2005: yeah youre was so cute, i was like awww :-) D Phrygian: I remember being nervous about our late-night convos, too ashsnl2005: lol really? D Phrygian: because I'd never really talked openly about sex to anyone, especially not to a girl I liked ashsnl2005: i thought they were great ashsnl2005: yeah well id never done that either D Phrygian: I think I was always afraid I'd be too graphic or something and turn you off, lol ashsnl2005: i might seem like i know alot, but im not that experienced, well i am now ;-) D Phrygian: hehe, we discover everything together ashsnl2005: hehe yay! D Phrygian: and then I remember for a while after I came back to college, I didn't talk to you much because Kyle was always around ashsnl2005: yeah... D Phrygian: and then I finally got over my phonophobia and called you more D Phrygian: I think it was over Thanksgiving break that I first talked to you like every night for a week D Phrygian: that was fun =) ashsnl2005: yeah it was great D Phrygian: I remember freaking out when I had to actually make our Christmas plans a reality because it meant telling my parents ashsnl2005: yeah i remember that D Phrygian: I was so scared about that, which is kinda silly in retrospect, since they were totally cool about you ashsnl2005: aww yay! D Phrygian: I remember arriving at Christmas...I was getting so nervous on the bus that I was starting to shake... ashsnl2005: really? ashsnl2005: awww D Phrygian: and then I stepped out and saw your car D Phrygian: and I went inside D Phrygian: you had your head down and didn't see me at first I guess ashsnl2005: yeah i was like nervous ashsnl2005: and i have issues when i get nervos ashsnl2005: lol D Phrygian: and then you stood up and you looked so much more beautiful than I'd guessed from your pictures, and I got all nervous again and just hugged you when I really wanted to give you a big kiss D Phrygian: it took me a while to open up, lol ashsnl2005: awwww, i was so nervous bc i didnt know if i was good enough and stuff, that freaked me out the most, and all i wanted to do that first day was just lay on you...but i was too nervous to make any move D Phrygian: I wanted to touch you so much those first days, you were so beautiful and curvy and nice, but I was just so nervous that I'd go too far or something D Phrygian: remember Kiera putting my arm around you? lol... ashsnl2005: haha yeah ashsnl2005: gotta love kiera D Phrygian: I was so afraid to touch you, it seems silly now D Phrygian: but I wanted to kiss you so bad that whole time ashsnl2005: i was too, i didnt know if you wanted me to or what and i didnt wont to make the first move, i figured that was your job D Phrygian: and then finally after two days we just went at it, hehe ashsnl2005: hehe ashsnl2005: news years at midnight D Phrygian: oh yeah... =) ashsnl2005: and we didnt stop till you left D Phrygian: that was my first kiss D Phrygian: it might've been obvious, lol ashsnl2005: well it was nice ashsnl2005: that was pretty much mine too ashsnl2005: like a real kiss D Phrygian: I'll always remember that night...in bed, making out, with Titanic on ashsnl2005: hehe yeha D Phrygian: it was magical ashsnl2005: that was so great ashsnl2005: i just wanted to take off my cherry pjs and shirt and get on you with my bra and "D" panties on D Phrygian: aww, I know, and I was still nervous about being too forward so I wouldn't take them off for you D Phrygian: you'll have to wear your D panties in May, hehe D Phrygian: only this time I'll get to see them more D Phrygian: and take them off ;-) ashsnl2005: hehe ok!
