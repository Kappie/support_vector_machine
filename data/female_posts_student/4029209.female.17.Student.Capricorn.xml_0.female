I mean obviously we're gonna, do the usual, get drunk and thank god for resits, but where we gonnadrink? what time? how much? lol. Any suggestions, feel free to post. It'd be good to do something different this year, since next year we'll all be leaving each other :(. So, all suggestions welcome.  On a different note, anyone know how we're supposed to enrole again? i forgot to listen to that bit, damn those 3 hour history lessons, thanks Gem for keep me awake ;).  Well, thats all for now. Least theres something to think about :).
