Well, that's been happening to me for about 12 hrs. What's the formal word for anal? Please help me. It's been bugging me for half a day and will continue to do so for a while.   And Divz. Who? I have never heard of that guy. Where did you meet him? Is he on a kiddies' show? coz those shows are frightening. Did you know that Emilie de Ravin a.k.a. Tess Harding was on as episode of NSIC? She was an Aussie chic sun-bathing on a boat. It was pretty cool coz she didn't have that fake American accent. This was a while back though, I forgot to tell you, but now I have. So there you go. How do you burn your finger from lighting a candle? Where you trying to put it out with your fingers, coz you shoulda licked them or dipped them in water first. Otherwise you'll burn them. Not that I know from personal experience coz I'M NOT ALLOWED TO BURN CANDLES ANYWHERE OTHER THAN THE KITCHEN (which defeats the purpose of having an candles for aromatherapy in my room)  Okay, I've rambled on for long enough. Maybe I should start my own blog so I can ramble some more. But that involves logging on two sites. Can't be stuffed.  Namárië
