More specifically, Galileo proposed that the earth went around the sun rather than vice versa.   It sounds stupid now to an American with free speech and separated church/state functions, but Galileo had to officially renounce his scientific discoveries under threat of death."   ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS COMES TO MIND:  Galileo  Indigo Girls   Galileo's head was on the block  The crime was looking up the truth  And as the bombshells of my daily fears explode  I try to trace them to my youth   And then you had to bring up reincarnation  Over a couple of beers the other night  And now I'm serving time for mistakes  Made by another in another lifetime   How long till my soul gets it right  Can any human being ever reach that kind of light  I call on the resting soul of Galileo  King of night vision  King of insight   And then I think about my fear of motion  Which I never could explain  Some other fool across the ocean years ago  Must have crashed his little airplane   How long till my soul gets it right  Can any human being ever reach that kind of light  I call on the resting soul of Galileo  King of night vision  King of insight   I'm not making a joke  You know me  I take everything so seriously  If we wait for the time till all souls get it right  Then at least I know there'll be no nuclear annihilation  In my lifetime I'm still not right   I offer thanks to those before me  That's all I've got to say  'Cause maybe you squandered big bucks in your lifetime  Now I have to pay  But then again it feels like some sort of inspiration  To let the next life off the hook  But she'll say, "Look what I had to overcome from my last life  I think I'll write a book"   How long till my soul gets it right  Can any human being ever reach the highest light  Except for Galileo god rest his soul  (Except for the resting soul of Galileo)  King of night vision  King of insight  How long  (Til my soul gets it right)  [Til we reach the highest light]  How long  (Til my soul gets it right)  [Til we reach the highest light]  How long
