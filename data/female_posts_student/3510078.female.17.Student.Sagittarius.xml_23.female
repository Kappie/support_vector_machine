I would suggest calling me on my cell if you really need to talk, but only for quick emergencies, and I mean QUICK. And this is why:      I will not be online any more today/tonight, or even all tomorrow and tomorrow tonight. My schedule is beyond crazy: I have to play host tonight, and even host tomorrow morning before orientation.  After orientation, I have summer reading to finish, a test to study for, and a project to prep.  After all this, I have errands to run, clothes to pick up, and AGH phone calls to make to the agency and my photographers.  (Possible shoot this weekend. Cross your fingers for me!)      These are the days when I love the label "Insomniac".          P.S.- Hello to all my newcomers! (I gave out my site to a few more friends.) Hope y'all enjoy!
