I was telling her I either wanted to be a missionary or a history teacher and she was like "I wanted to be those exact things when I was your age!" Then I was telling her how I really wanted to go on mission trips but my parents were to scared to let me go and she told me how her parents were the exact same way but she just kept praying and God changed their hearts and let her go. Isn't that cool?!!? So I decided to pray a ton about it.  I have been thinking a ton lately.  What do I really want to do with my life? Its only 3 years until I graduate from highschool...only 7 years until I graduate from college and have to set off on my own. I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can support myself on my own...I am quite worried. How will I get money? It would be awesoem to be a teacher and it seems like there are a lot of jobs for teacher but they don't get payed that much...what to do what to do...  I have also been wondering about what I should do with my summer...I think I am going to do summer servants so I can grow in my relationship with God then next summer I will be able to put my relationship in action!  I am so excited!!!!  The month of June brings so many promises of new beginnings and new adventures...but I fear leaving the old behind.  New School... New Friends...  New Life.
