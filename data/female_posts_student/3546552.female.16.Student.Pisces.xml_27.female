He was singin up a storm, starin into space and talking about dancing! It was great. Then After cell group he, Sarah w. and Ilissa M. came over to my house to watch The Italian Job, and Andrew " Had a bad experience " (that's a line from the movie which he kept repeating over and over at random intervals) HAHAHA. O my, I've never seen him like that before, but let me tell ya, it's pretty darn funny! Have a good day, see you later. ~BS
