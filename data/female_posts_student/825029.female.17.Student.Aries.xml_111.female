Well, today started out kinda sucky, with Mr. Pace and all.  Thank God for uniform checkout! - too bad my dress does NOT fit.  It's way too short and too big, but noooo.  The uniform ladies are so freaking stubborn.  Oh yes, and I'd like to congratulate Mitch Johnson on way more than 3 months of being a dumbass.  Anyhoo, I had a fairly good day.  Master class wasn't TOO terrible, I suppose...  My uncle leaves tomorrow to go to (most likely) Iraq - he got called in by the Navy a few days ago, and has to go for at least a year.  They sure don't give much notice :\    I have mixed feelings about it... I mean, it's cool to think that my uncle gets to serve in the Navy, but.. I dunno... there's always that chance something could happen... egh I don't wanna think about it.  On a happier note, my aunt might come stay with us for a while, since it would suck to have to spend Thanksgiving and Christmas and every other thing by yourself.  Sadly, it looks like I won't get to celebrate Hanukkah AND Christmas this year (it's my Jewish uncle).  *sigh*  Well, I better get going on my homework and such... have a good day!
