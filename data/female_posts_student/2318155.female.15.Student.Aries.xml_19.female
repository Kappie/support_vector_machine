And then after school I made up this test, a geometry test, and I got 97/100! But to top it off, I got to see Brandon! We went and saw Gothika. Now that was one of the scariest and best movies ever. Then when I got home I watched Finding Nemo which was a really good movie too! So, yesterday I stayed up for 20 hours! Today I woke up at 10:30 by the phone ringing from Devin. We talked for a while and then I called up Brandon. I've been watchin the MC Battle and Wreckonize won, which I think that Blind Flurry should've, o well. Now I'm watchin this interview with Sway and Jay-Z. But, I gotta go get ready cause i'm going shopping with my mom. I'm gonna get some new pairs of pants, new long sleeve shirts, and maybe a new cell phone cover! Well I better go have some lunch, macaroni and cheese! "Brandon why did you pick nasty fish stix over macaroni and cheese?"...."Well, if you haven't noticed, macaroni and  CHEESE  is the name"
