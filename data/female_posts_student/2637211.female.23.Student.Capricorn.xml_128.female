Last time, I got an A on the paper, but that time I read the book, this time I don't think I can get through it. Ugg. Well see. I've gotten through harder topics in less time before, I will just have to do the same again. Hmm. May need to do some grade calculation to see how badly I can do and still get a B in the class.
