I'm lacking in the date department, but I'm going with the girls so it's going to be more fun anyway. I'm headed over to the lovely Claire Bira's house at 4:00 to primp, and then we are out to the Pasta House. At first it was Bella Italia, but since a bajillion people are going, we decided against it. So Claire, Claire Goodson, Kaci, Emily, maybe Aimee?, me, Matt, Brett, and Zach are going to Pasta House. It'll be fun. :-)  Since my fingers are too cold to type, I'm being random again...  *My fingers are healed.  *I'm getting my hair done tomorrow.  *I'm going to die during finals.  *We have a 90% chance of snow tonight.  *Sara and Allie have gone insane within this past week.  *Some guy stole Sara's phone and left me a hilarious voice message.  *I'm going out to eat in a formal dress tomorrow, which I have never done.  Goodnight kids.
