His name is Campbell, i mean what kind of name is that anyway and he has the worst taste in SOME music, he likes listening to an artist I really really hate, which wouldn't be so bad if he didn't remark about......it... all the time. huh steal my idea will he! and he's pathetic AH,he just trashed me on his Blog. He can't even think of his own jokes, he just leaches off everyone else.  Rhedyn "Nevermore"
