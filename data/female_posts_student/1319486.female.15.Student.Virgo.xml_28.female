I CRIED FOREVER LAST NIGHT AND THIS MORNING WHEN SHE TOLD ME. i got home and i was like "where's jack?" b/c all he ever did this past two weeks was lay in his bed, yesterday he couldn't even walk or get up or eat...my mom had to take him outside to go to the bathroom and it was SO SAD im crying right now....anways, and my mom was like "we put him to sleep this morning." as she was crying and then i almost fell over i couldn't take it...i've had Jack for as long as I can remember....we actually got him from these people who abused him when i was just turning four, they were about to give him back when i was having my four year old birthday party, but they saw how nice he was when he took all the stuff we(twenty-something 4 year olds) could dish at him, we played "wheelbarrow" with him and held his hind legs and he would walk on his front legs, and we'd pull his tail(it doesnt actually hurt them but still...) and we'd pick him up and pull his ears and beat him up slightly and he would be so nice and he would never bite or scratch you, he was very sweet and mellow, my other dog Suzie doesnt notice really that he's gone, she used to bite him and play with him and he would just stand there and take it, he was so nice, i love my puppy, the megans are throwing me a party to cheer me up and that might help, i know he was suffering (he had cancer by the way), it was the worst kind of cancer he could get, it supposedly took over every cell in his body, the last time i saw him was when i packed up my stuff to go to megan peterson's house, i hugged him and gave him lots of kisses so im glad i kind of got to say goodbye, im glad my mom didn't tell me what she was gonna do or else i would've had the worst night last night even though it was pretty bad, i felt really stupid going to megan's house yesterday afternoon on my bicycle, crying....wow, it's 11:11, I'm making a wish that Jack is in heaven with Rosie(Megan P's dog) and that he's happy and chasing squirrels and eating them and tearing them to bits.....well, this entry was dedicated to Jack, my beloved hooch-y dog that i've known and loved since as long as i can remember, i'll miss you so much and i wish you could live forever and stay with me but i know you cant, omg i can't stop crying now, now there's no one to jump on my bed at night and then i can kick you out and be mean to you, and no one to lay around and scratch, and he'll never put his head in my lap like he used to when he wanted someone to pet him, that was the cutest thing, and he'll never "scoot" or run around the house real fast, or chase squirrels and catch them and leave them on the front porch, or kill cockroaches b/c im scared of them or bark late at night or roll around on the carpet all cute and itchy, or run up and down the fence really fast b/c of the neighbor dog, i saw suzi doing that two days ago and i started crying b/c jack hasn't done that in like 3 months, ive been scared of him dying for like a year and when he would sleep i would get really scared and then i'd perk him up by saying "squirrels" or "cookies"(cookies are like dog treats) so i could make myself feel better, but yesterday i kept trying to get him up and he just layed there and looked at me with his big sad eyes breathing really hard.......i can't write anymore, i have to go do something to cheer myself up, in conclusion, i love you so much jack and i'll miss you and remember you forever, you were the best dog ever......
