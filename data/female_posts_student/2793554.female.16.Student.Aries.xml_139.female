Theres a fan in my windowsill (behind my computer) and its on cause its hot but as a result im looking straight into a fan and trying to read so im keeping my eyes really open and theyre drying out and it hurts. psh. but im listening to beautiful. beautiful punk rock music.   aah! my phone keeps ringing. i feel so loved, a whole bunch of people are calling me and asking me to hang out! too bad i cant cause i have to chase after little children at 8:30 IN THE FUCKING MORNING. ::slice slice::  little kids. ew. be prepared for the upcoming whining and rants this week as the events commence.   mmm, pop punk. mmm, 99 red balloons song.  this is boring. i think maybe ill go sleep or go play more vice city because at the moment that is all my life consists of.   im way excited to go to london, theres apparently free legal mushrooms and theyre fresh and really yummy but they sell them as "ornaments" so maybe ill bring a bunch of them back and have a huge tripping extravaganza. If anyone wants some and im able to smuggle them back and i dont have to cram them in my ass, give me money before next week and i shall get you some. mmm, mushrooms.  i wish i had  $300 to pay for santa cruz... and $900 for a car, and $1000 for insurance. damn, things are expensive. pbthh.  vice city!!!(thank you dylan)  ~abby
