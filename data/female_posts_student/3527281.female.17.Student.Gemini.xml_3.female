I know it's summer and we're all kind've busy with this and that, but I think as soon as school starts up and we start getting into things (band, plays, college, etc.) there will probably be more to be said.       So yeah... LeeAnne and I were watching "I Love the 90's" on VH1 the other day and we started thinking of things we remembered from back then. So we thought it would be fun to put some stuff on here and just say "Hey, remember that?!" So I'll go first, obviously.      Remember...       The talkboy like in "Home Alone"   ( I loved that thing...)      Furbies   ( Unfortunately, I have one of those scary things)      The tomagachi and giga pets   ( Yeah, I had a few of those)      The beanie baby craze   ( I have a whole basketful in my room from my grandma)      Tickle-me-Elmo   ( Can't sayIhave one of those...)      When the Indians actually made it to the World Series    (Those were the gold ol' days)      Those TGIF shows every Friday    (Man, I always watched those)      The cartoons that were on all morning until noon on Saturdays    (Always watched those, too)          Well that's all I've got for now. If you think of anything, just post about it. It's fun to think about the fun we had when we were kids. Such carefree times...
