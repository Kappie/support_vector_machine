I'm flying solo this weekend - Kim, Jess and baby are going to Virginia for a baby shower - may be a good time to take in a flick.  I thought Vin Diesel was great in "The Fast and the Furious".  Here's what I really wanted to post about today - Jay goes back to school!  Starting at  urlLink Madonna University  in lovely  urlLink Livonia, MI  - more white people per capita than any other 100,000+ city in the country.  I used to work there, 15 years ago.  Apparently still what it always was...  My degree will be in Church Music, may try to work it into a teaching certificate too.  I have a 1982 BA in Economics from  urlLink Wayne State University  (a FAR more diverse place), so school this time will just be about fulfilling the major requirements.  Wish me luck - I'll need it!
