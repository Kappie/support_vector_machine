I mean come on almost every guy I know has made me cry or really hurt me to the point that I hate them.  There is those selected few that a girl can talk to and be real good friends with but then later on you find out they are gay.  You know what bothers me is when you are such good friends with a guy and you hang out all the time and every 20 minutes you have people asking you if you are going out with him but he is STUPID and doesn't want to ruin the friendship or he just uses that as an excuse of not exactly telling you that you are an ugly fat bitch and he doesn't like you.  Stop being such a pussy and be straight up with a girl.  It is better than being dumb and avoiding it forever.  That isn't even what I am mad about.  My old friend came over today for the first time in months.  hmThe one og the first things he says to me is where's my hug.  Yea a hug is the last thing I want to give him.  After all the crap he talked about me and all the mean things he tell my brother I don't even want to hit him with a 30 foot pole.  That isn't what is really bothering me either.  It is the fact that when he was trying to talk to me he said so I hear you're going after the black guys now.  Oooooo how low can you go.  Well and then he told me one of the real reasons we took a break on our friendship which is some real bullshit.  I really don't want to talk about that.  Guys really do suck ass though.  What also pissed me off is that yesterday Manny hit me like I was a fricking guy.  I have like a million and one bruises.  What the freak was he thinking.  Like I really wanna hang out with him anytime soon.  Well I think I am done venting right now.
