One of my best friends,V., is undergoing drastic surgery, I disagree with the choice, but this is her call and she's made it. I will bekeeping vigilin her hospital room until the nurses try to drag me out afterward. V.I hope you are absolutely sure about this, you can change your mind. Of course you did this while I am too far away to sit you down and attempt to talk you out of this, but at least you are waiting until I get back.
