Nothing interesting happening, although it was great to speak to Angie again! I don't know how she is so busy all the time and sill manage to get everything done (Homework Included). The have 5 weeks off now - lucky German's! I should write my cheat sheet- and do all the other homework that should have been done a while a go...
