Wanted to try another question from the same Web site, but alas, there were none on the other issues we covered in class.  Bummer.  Now just waiting for the laundry to finish so I can distract myself with that for a few minutes.  These kind of days are so odd.  The ones where you're just waiting for the next day to arrive.  Suppose I could go back and refine my original answer, just for the sake of typing it all out; hopefully my hands will remember the process even if my mind doesn't.  I'm torn between studying for the subsequent exams and not over-extending myself.  Really, I'm not sure how well reviewing other material would sink in at this point.  Wondering about my classmates.  Hoping they all slept well and aren't ripping their hair out today.  Think we all run a risk of over-reviewing, -studying, -practicing.  Doing it all to the point where we think ourselves out of knowing the material.    Think I'll take a drive in a bit.  Maybe do some yoga while the clothes dry.    I don't imagine alcohol has tasted or will taste better than it will Thursday the 18th at 4 pm.
