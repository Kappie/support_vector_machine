Any ways dude these fuckers think I'm um... depresed (well who isn't now adays) and that I cry and write poetry! HA HA HA!!I wonder where they got that idea from. I bet they pulled it out of their ass!Well um... yeah. Man, Tony left for Miami.  That ass is probably visiting the damb hookers. HORNEY BASTARD!!! N.E ways I just got off the phone with my cousin Chris and we are leaving to go eat or do whutever she said she wanted to do. We didn't talk long because she was at work.
