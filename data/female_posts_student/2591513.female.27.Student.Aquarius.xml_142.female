He has grown into this incredible human being and I am so sure he will do great things in his lifetime, he has already done so many, it is hard to see him stopping.  Then here is my oober goober husband complaining about stuff...haha I love my Edward.  I have decided in the next life I will be a psychologist...haha  I don't know why, but that is what I have decided...random thoughts...  Nalani is sleeping in her bed in our room, my dream is to have a nice job so we can buy a bigger house where my kids can each have their own room.  ED HURRY UP AND BE AN OFFICER!  haha    Well that is all this kookie girl has to say tonight.  Have a great evening.
