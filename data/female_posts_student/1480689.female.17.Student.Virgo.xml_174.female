I was in the airport, coming back from Mexico. There I saw people, so many people. And my heart stopped. There you were with you're new best friend, and everyone was hugging you and greeting you. You were wearing that navy blue The Used t-shirt that I've never seen anyone else with, and a black zip-up hoodie. Heh, I just went to their site to look at that shirt. You were wearing those jeans you always wear, ya'know the ones with the rufio plane patch? You had on two necklaces, one replacing the one I broke. Your hair, always looking tousled, and you're one left dimple showing itself everytime you smiled at someone you hadn't seen for a while. Your eyes, they look so tired, have you not been sleeping? I kept to the shadows for a while, dripping wet because I just got out of the deep end of the pool. Yes, a pool. I couldn't take it anymore, I ran up behind you, stopped just short of running into you, and stood behind you out of breath. You slowly turned around, and looked at me. You stopped, everything stopped. Everyone kept pulling at you and grabbing for your attention, so I put my eyes to the ground, and waited my turn, nothing new I suppose. I grew tired of it, and I pushed the short blonde out of my way and embraced you, so tight and close, I could smell you.  I asked where you had been, you said "I've been driving."  So that's why you looked so tired.  I asked where. You said "Down through Illinois, Mostly in Kentucky, because it was so green, then I stayed in Mississippi for two weeks, and Louisiana for two. We're in Florida just cause, fancy seeing you here."  I wonder why those girls keep giving me bad looks.   Cut to: My basement, both of us on the futon you laying down and myself laid upon you.  Kiss Kiss Kiss Kiss. "Hey, knock it off, we already decided not to do this."  He's right.  I can't help it.  I rub up against you and kiss your neck. "Stop it! Now."  Damnit! This is horrible.  I cried and you held me, and whispered comfort into my ear, slowing my sobs to chokes I held in my throat.  Cut to: The airport again, filled with chaos and feet. Scuffling everywhere, just trying to get closer to you, and I keep getting stepped on.  I wonder who the blonde was that I pushed out of my way.  Apparently it's your soon to be girlfriend. And if it wasn't fair for me to grow green with envy, I still did. I'm prettier than her anyway.  But that's not comforting at all.   You told me that while you and your new best friend were on your road trip, you crashed HIS car, and that you were lucky to be alive. I went to hug you, but you shrugged me off, and told me you had to go. Eight people followed you, including that little blonde. I stood in my bikini, confused, wanting to reach to you. I found the negatives you dropped out of the picture envelope. They were beautiful, 8 pictures of nature teaching people how ignorant we can be and how much we take for granted, and 2 of a beautiful cemetary, with statues of angels and crosses,  on top of hills and trees shading the old woman from the sun.  By the time I looked up, I was the only person in the terminal, waiting for my luggage, like none of what we talked about or what I saw, or how i wrapped my arms around you, ever happened.  I woke up crying.
