It's right, I know it is. But it feels so wrong. It feels so empty. I can't come out of the dark though. I've been in there for so long now, it's all I know. The light is painful, the dark is familliar. I wish I were someone who could just pick up and walk away. Someone less empathic than me. I wish I could be like Spike, or Vash. Someone who isn't me. Just pick up and walk away, and forget what I've left behind. The road of the wanderer. The mind of a wonderer. Damn it all. And damn you too.
