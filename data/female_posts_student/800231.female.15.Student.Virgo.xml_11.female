Last year I wrote a 20 page term project at 11pm the night it was due and got an A.(!) The teacher that graded it had specifically told us that it was impossible to throw together a paper like that and get an A. Showed her...  Anyway, I did a bit of research for my essay today but I don't feel like writing the rough draft right now. Screw it anyway, its only for health and the rough draft is barely worth anything. I did do my science homework though. Go me.  A very large tree limb crashed through our fence last night, it was pretty spectacular. It snapped right through a 6ft chain link fence, trust me that takes a lot force. Our  lovely  next door neighbors showed up at our door this morning to inform us of two things  1) The broken fence takes away from the beauty of the neighborhood. 2)The tree (which is at least 100 yards from anything they own) somehow endangers  their  lives. Keep in mind that these same people have in the past called the fire department on us on Christmas smoke was coming out of our chimney. Needless to say, my dad told them to bugger off.
