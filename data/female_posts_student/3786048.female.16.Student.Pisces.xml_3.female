Jim Baker: Where do you kids learn all this stuff? Mike Baker: School. Jim Baker: Good, I'm getting my money's worth.  Ginny: I love Rudy, and he is totally enamored of me. I mean, other men have loved me, but not for six whole months in a row.  Grandma Helen: Oh Sam, let me take a look at you. Fred, she's gotten her boobies! Grandpa Fred: I better get my magnifying glass! Ha Ha Ha. Grandma Helen: Oh, and they are so PERKY![reaches to cup them] cut to: Samantha: I can't believe my grandmother actually felt me up!  Long Duk Dong: What's a happenin' hot stuff?  Brenda Baker: Can you remember to turn off the stove in twenty minutes? Samantha: I can remember lots of things.  Geek: Do you know how many times a week I go without lunch because some bitch borrows my lunch money? Y'know, any halfway decent girl can rob me blind, because I'm too torqued up to say no.  Samantha: It's really human of you to listen to all my bullshit.  Geek: How's it going? Samantha: How's what going? Geek: You know - things, life, whatnot. Samantha: Life is not whatnot, and it's none of your business.  Geek: You know, I'm getting input here that I'm reading as relatively hostile. Samantha: Go to hell. Geek: VERY hostile!  Geek: So, what's your story? I mean, you got a guy, or...? Samantha: Yes, three big ones, and they lust wimp blood so quit bugging me or I'll sic them all over your weenie ass!  Samantha: This is Farmer Fred. Geek: Ted. Samantha: Oh, I'm sorry, Farmer Ted. Geek: I'm not really a farmer. I'm a freshman.  Jim Baker: That's why they call them crushes. If they were easy, they'd call them something else.  Jim Baker: Why do you think you're a dork? I don't think you're a dork. I don't think Mom thinks you're a dork. Samantha: Mike thinks I'm a dork. Jim Baker: Mike is a dork.  Samantha: I can't believe I gave my panties to a geek!  Geek: Not many girls in contemporary American society today would give their underwear to help a geek like me.  Long Duk Dong: No more yankie my wankie. The Donger need food.  Randy: Geek, can I be honest with you? Geek: Not if you're gonna insult me. Randy: [laughs] Ok. Geek: Shoot. Randy: Get the hell outta here!  Geek: Just answer me one question. Samantha: Yes, you're a total faggot. Geek: Ha ha ha. That's not the question.  Samantha: Donger's here for five hours, and he's got somebody. I live here my whole life, and I'm like a disease.  Ted: Would you guys please hurry up, I'm breaking like 20 major laws right now.  The Geek: Where am I? Caroline: I'll tell you where you are if you tell me who you are. The Geek: I'm Farmer Ted. Caroline: You're in the parking lot across from my church. The Geek: You own a church?
