An dto top that off when I was bending ove rto pick something up off teh floor in my room I whacked my head on the side of bed (has a this wooden thing around the edge) and now have a dent in it as well as a added to headache. Hmph. But I thought it was very nice to come in, put on the internet for a quick spin on my usual message boards and blogs to find that all my cool Ryan fans are really lovely and nice and don't argue with me for the sake of it. In fact they are all relaly suportive of each other, really helpful and are happy to help each other out. Then my cousin was on msn and it was cool talking to him as he is in North Carolina. His wife, dawn, has an interview tomorrow and if she gets the job they will be moving to....ready....CHICAGO! Wahoo! They are both really lucky!!! Brilliant. have to go and visit them then. :)
