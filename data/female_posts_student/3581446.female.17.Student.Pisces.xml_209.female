This became my good fortune today when I attended the Watermelon Festival up in Chipley. Since it was raining, it wasn't very crowded at all.  I had a Steak Burger from the Piggly Wiggly booth. Throw on some peppers and onions and it was right tasty. I didn't buy any Boiled Peanuts, though.  Proceeded into the auditorium and was very pleased to find that the lead singer from the old band Shenandoah was there along with his new bluegrass band. They really got down, and, being a big fan of the artform, I found the whole experience quite tantalizing. During their rendition of "Thank God I'm a Country Boy" I almost felt like jumping up and giving a good "Yeeeeeehaw!" One must understand, such thangs ain't all that uncommon when attending a good Southern concert. In fact, you might say they are almost expected! I was particularly impressed by the Mandolin player. I'd never before had the opportunity to hear one in person, and this particular player was quite skilled.  Anyways, before I left I picked up a bag of fresh ground corn grits and brought them home and cooked added them to my planned dinner. They go quite well with black beans, but then again, what don't they go good with? ;-)  Has anyone seen that movie "White Chicks"? What rubbish! Can you imagine them daring to do a similar film with white men called "Black Chicks"? The NAACP and Rev. Jesse Jackson would be up in arms!
