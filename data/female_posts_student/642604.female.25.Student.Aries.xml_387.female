She said she was going to try and get over there very soon but since she's a nanny this summer she had to wait for the parents to get home.  So I go in and I wait around, talking to Anna the tattoo artist and the rest of the people there, smoking cigarettes and just hanging out.  Of course what they don't know is every five seconds I'm thinking it's not too late to walk out the door, I hadn't paid for anything.  So then Anna admits that she didn't think I was coming back today and I told her I am seriously freaked out but when I commit to something I always follow through.  So finally it was time to go and Caitlin wasn't there but whatever.  So we went in and she showed me the stencil of the knot,heart,trinity thing she had come up with which was what I wanted previously but with the knot behind the heart and the trinity sign.  Anyway, the point is it looked very cool and I'll get a picture of it up here soon. Maybe today.  So I go in and Anna is so nice and we're just chit chatting and she knows I am freaking out so she tells me when she is going to start and tells me to let her know if I want to break at any point.  Oddly enough it wasn't that painful and I had a lot of outline work done.  Everyone had told me before that it would hurt so badly and it was more irritating than anything else.  I was also told that the shading would never hurt as badly as the outline but the shading for me was far worse.  I think it's because the outline work took so long and is ALL OVER THE TATTOO unlike many of my friends by the time she got to the shading my skin was so sore and iritable.  But it was finally over and as I was walking into the parking lot, Caitlin showed up.  Wasn't that nice.  The parents of the kids she watches didn't show till late.  So anyway, the tattoo  ended up hurting more after the fact then it did while it was going on.  My back is very sore right now and it's starting to dry out.  But I'll get a picture up later.
