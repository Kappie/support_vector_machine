So then I get back from that and go back to sleep, and then go to lessons only to find out I have no lessons. So I go home after waiting 1000 years for my sis to get out of hers. Then I go home and am sitting here tying this now. Kind of pissed off, if you realized.  I'm going to sleep, this week has been hell as is.  Sorry for lakk of k-age.  God.
