It's packed with all the good stuff: Six periods of art and seven periods of AP courses throughout the year. It'll be fun. Being nerdy is my thing after all.          Schedule for Year 2004-2005     1)  Photo Design    2)  AP Psychology    3)  Economics    4)  Drawing  Painting    5)  AP 2-D Design Portfolio    6)  AP Literature       1)  Photo Design    2)  AP Psychology    3)  AP American Government    4)  Photo Design    5)  AP 2-D Design Portfolio    6)  AP Literature       Um, wheee. Thrilling, yes? Ah, and for you dumb ones, the first set of periods are for my first semester and the second set is for the second semester. And yes, I am taking Photo Design three times this year, which means I will graduate with four semesters of Photo Design, as well as three semesters of Drawing  Painting.            My Goal:    Graduate out of high school with enough skills to make Da Vinci roll in his grave.            Besides all the art I'll be messing around with and the studying I will have to do in order to raise my embarassing GPA, I will spend a good portion of this year enjoying the last year of my youth.           Birthday:  Not celebrating        Homecoming:  Not going        Pep Rallies:  Don't care        Part-time Job:  Can't drive        Prom:  Not going        Senioritis:  Won't have it        Graduation Celebration:  Won't have that either         The last year of my youth will be exciting. Why? Because by the end of the year, no matter how much I study or how often I exclude myself from the joys of the last year of high school, and whether I pass or fail, become smart or stupid, get into Harvard or a special eds school, I will still be able to lift my head and walk as an adult with the prospect of growing up and initiating my life.    ...Actually, that sounds a little corny.   Forget I typed any of that. I'm gonna go study Psych now.
