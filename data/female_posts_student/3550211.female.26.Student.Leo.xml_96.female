When I heard about this  urlLink story , you know, the one where 23-year-old reading specialist, Debra Lafave, is "accused of having sex with a 14-year-old student at least five times at her home, at school and in the back of her SUV," I thought to myself,  again . It's not like we haven't heard about these types of stories before. However, I find this story a little bit more disturbing. I think because, I'm more closely related to this woman's age. Plus, she has sex WITH A 14 YEAR OLD! A 14 YEAR OLD! If he was 17, maybe I could have some compassion for this woman, but this kid is SERIOUSLY young! AND SHE IS 23! I'm 25, and I think anyone under 21 is to young ... and even  that  is a stretch.   Once again, I'm forced to asked my favorite question: What is  wrong  with people?  Ah, but what the hell do I know. She'll forever be remembered as the teacher who had sex with a 14yr old (that alone would make me want to tie a rope around my neck), she'll write a book and make millions. Hmm. Maybe she had a 10yr plan in mind, after all.
