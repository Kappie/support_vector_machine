(doesn't really shift gears that well) The recently aquired mountain bike does not have this problem! Hills are easy when you have gears that you can work through. I think I'm going to take my race bike into the shop and see what can be done and how expensive that will be. So that I can have gears!! Maybe it'll make a difference in my race time?? Time will tell.
