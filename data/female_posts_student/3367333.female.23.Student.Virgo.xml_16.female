(and i want to avoid the visit to the giant mosquito statue in komarno -- i'm so sick of the winterpeg and big bug jokes.)  i'm also missing ontario quite badly just now, although i'm really not sure why.  perhaps something to do with pete's visit... also beginning to have some more body memories.  i hate them, particularly this feeling of suffocation that doesn't seem tied to any external stimulus.  and i'm tired of the facile assumption that this is the result of having felt suffocated in the past.  why is it that, because of my history of trauma, people assume a one to one correlation between what my body experiences now and what it experienced in the past?  is that really the way it works? anyway, off to go grocery shopping and clean my apartment before he gets here.  because of my chronic absence from home (the whole conference thing) the fur balls are being fruitful and multiplying.  so are the dust rabbits.
