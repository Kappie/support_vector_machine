Yup, I was up at 4, eating cheerios with massive amounts of sugar and having a Diet Coke, getting dressed and out the door promptly at 4:45, which sucks because the rest of the fam was snoozing pretty deep.  I changed my classes around for the Fall, yet again. And am currently happily searching and finding cheap books online. Here are my favorite places to go:  urlLink half.com ,  urlLink aaatextbooksearch.com , and  urlLink barnes  noble . I like aaa because it compares all of the top used and new textbook sites, but it doesn't include half.com. I decided against taking PHI 102 Ethics for the time and ENG 323 18th Century British-Romantic Literature London for the second. Knowing my luck and basing the possible outcomes on my BIO 103 class, which I took 3 times and still fought for a D+, I decided to drop those and take new classes from those sections. Which leaves me free to plunk in a writing class (ENG 382 Nature Writing) and (WGS 200 Intro to Gender Study or something). So after these two semesters (Fall  Winter), I'll be finished with my Gen Eds, my English Major, my Geography Minor, my Writing Minor, my School of Ed pre-reqs, and I'm applying to the school of ed this semester so that if I get in I can post-pone my student assisting for one semester until the Fall.  On another note, I've been trying and trying (for absolutely no reason at all) to remember what Sally would say to Linus in the Peanuts cartoon. I finally asked my boss what she said. Was it   The Great Baboo ? No! Sally always said that Linus was      H er Sweet Baboo  !               And so I've decided that I too am on my search for my own  SWEET BABOO ! So the position of companion is now only open to men who would consider being called " My Sweet Baboo " as a direct compliment, worthy of praise.  :)       Let me tell you something though, James Bond would never consider being called "My Sweet Baboo" as anything but a means towards foreplay. I'm such a Bond-girl! : )
