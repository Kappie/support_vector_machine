(monotone-)oh. whoops. i guess my stick slipped, causing the puck to hit you square in the forehead leaving the biggest, hardest-to-cover-up-with-makeup bruise the world will ever see. yeah that's right i did it on purpose. im not sorry either!  when the girls who wear way too much make-up claim they're models when they obviously get their pictures done at se ears.  and when they think they're in the entertainment business when they've only been in one commercial for gen-x. that store is just a hyped-up, cheap-ass goodwill. haven't you seen familiar clothes like that on the the jenny-jones-show guests who are teens gone wild? it's all just whore clothes and cheap knockoffs of already cheap pay-less/wal-mart brands.  when people try to force they're beliefs on you even if theyre pointless, immoral, illegal, or fattening.
