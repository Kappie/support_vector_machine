       
      Well, not quite how I wished to spend the majority of my day... Because of the vehicle fiasco on our return from the family vacation (tranny blew in Baker, CA), the rented Astro van had to be returned. I drove the van as my sister followed me in my car. I spent the 2 hours there on the phone and listening to Sean Hannity. :-) On the way back Erin and I found songs to sing to. We returned home a little after 5pm. It was not terribly enjoyable to spend yet another day on the road, but c'est la vie! The rest of the day I spent working on various church projects including putting together binders for missions info and making the Keynote file for Sunday morning's worship service. My brother came over to pick up the paperwork to be sent to Chrysler "Customer Care" (the quotation marks are purposeful) and we played a few rounds of Yahtzee. It was nice to spend a little time with him anyway, since he was not able to join us for the family vacation (summer school). Drank coffee not too long ago in hopes of getting rid of a caffeine-deprivation headache. We shall see if I can get to sleep. In the meantime, however, I shall enjoy reading Stephen R. Lawhead's TALIESIN.
