(I add the healthy part because I'm not thinking of someone confined to a hospital bed or hospice who has little choice over what they would do with their last 24 hours.)  I'm referring to someone who is healthy and receives a divine vision that in 24 hours, their life will be cut short by a bus running them over.  What would you do with those last 24 hours?  Really, not just the sanitized version?  I did manage to squeeze in some paperwork for my dissertation.  I took care of some long overdue correspondence and revised my proposal so I'm ready to go in January.  I wish I had access to more than just the Internet for research though, and I'd try to get some other work done between now and then.  Alas, they won't let me in the libraries until January so my options are fairly limited.  Ah well, they're not paying me to work anyway.  More to come...
