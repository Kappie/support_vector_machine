I have heard that blogging is  not  an online diary, as some would have it - my diary would make no sense if I posted it online, and I wouldn't write half the things I write in there if there was any chance that anybody would be reading it. However, there are some things you write that aren't just for yourself. Writing is a good way to go over ideas, just like talking. Blogging has the advantage that you may find other people interested in your ideas and topics and actually get some feedback. So right from the beginning, I must confess I'm interested in comments. Today I'm not going to write anything interesting, but maybe tommorrow... The things I'm mostly thinking about now, which will undoubtedly be reflected in later postings: 'the day after tommorrow' (the film); culture shock (specifically me returning from China to NZ, and Chinese friends who return from holidays in China to study in NZ again); Chinese parenting; Tibetans in China; writing a thesis... I could go on.  Let's just leave it there for today, and I'll see how it goes tommorrow...
