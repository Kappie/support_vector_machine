It seems like every time we talk, we fight about at least something. And it seems like he wouldnt come put effort into seeing me if i was about to die.   or maybe i'm insane. i really want to travel away...   writing this made me all sad... im going to go. sorry about all the dramatic and emo posts lately, everyone.  abby
