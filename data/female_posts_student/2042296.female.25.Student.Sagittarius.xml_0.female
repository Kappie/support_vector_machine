Bruce Dickinson is probably almost 50 years old but his voice is still amazingly clear and powerful and he can still sing the hight parts, too. He must be in an amazing condition, since he runs around the stage, plays mr. Death or whatever fits into the scene and sings at the same time for 2 hours. Gamma Ray's performance was more modest and the sound was shitty and they also played only for about an hour (like always with the opening acts...), but they really rocked. Man, I really love old school heavy metal! Long live true metal and death to false metal! ;)  Friday... We've been invited to a party. A friend of ours is leaving soon to Australia for 3 months and this is the last night together. We're gonna go to a mexican restaurant to eat and drink. Oh man... It's gonna be a busy weekend. Today to Bern to meet some buddies from IRC and on Sunday Rico has to go to studio to check out some things with some guys. I'm not gonna go with him, wanna stay home or go walking on the hills.  I hate this fucking Halloween fuzz. A good excuse to party. Who the hell needs an excuse to party? Why do people have to support such stupid commercial parties like Halloween... It's all american bullshit. A "Great Tradition"... My ass. Well yeah, you can send your kids (if you have some) to beg for candies and that way irritate your possibly annoying neighbours. That's just about the only good thing about Halloween ;)   Well, gotta go hug and kiss my man. He came home from the office completely pissed off with stupid people there =)
