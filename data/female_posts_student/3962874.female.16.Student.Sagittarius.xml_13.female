When she asked dad if they could switch, dad said he already had plans too to go up to Anns beach place. Us kids were invited to go with him but every one of us already had plans, so we get the house to ourselves. Dad made clear rules that we weren't allowed to have anyone in the house but I know Alex is definatley going to have a party. At least, he said he was going to. I have plans to go to a BBQ with some of Daniel's family so today I am going in to my mom's house to stay overnight. Then tomarrow we are going to the BBQ and we will probably end up staying overnight at Daniel's house. So basically, I wont get to take part in any of the weekend long party because I will be leaving today and coming home sometime on Sunday. Which also means I wont have much time to work this weekend.
