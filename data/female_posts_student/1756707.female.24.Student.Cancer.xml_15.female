In a 10" straight sided saute pan (or skillet), heat the oil over medium-high heat until it's hot enough to shimmer.  Add half the chicken and cook, flipping once, until lightly browned and just barely cooked through.  Transfer the chicken to a plate, and repeat with the remaining chicken.  Cover with foil to keep warm.  Return the pan to medium heat and, if it looks dry, add another T oil.  Add the onion, ginger, and jalapeno and saute, stirring almost constantly with a wooden spoon, until the vegetables soften, about 2 minutes.  Add the curry powder and saute for 30 seconds.  Pour in the chicken broth and scrape the pan with the spoon to loosen any browned bits.  Add the potato and 1/2 t salt.  Bring to a simmer and cook, partially covered (I do this with an inverted skillet), until the potato is barely tender, 7-8 minutes.  Add the coconut milk and peas; simmer uncovered until the peas are thawed, the potato is fully tender, and the sauce is somewhat thickened, 4-5 minutes.  Taste the sauce; add salt and pepper as needed.  Add the chicken along with any accumulated juices to the sauce and turn to coat.  Serve immediately, garnished with the cilantro.  When I made this for Meat Night it was really tasty, though a little salty.  I would recommend getting a low-salt broth, and maybe cutting the salt added to the recipe.  A different curry might also help.  Either way, this was really good with Parmesan couscous, a green salad, and some fresh melon.  Recipe from  urlLink Fine Cooking
