And it should! Just tell me the fucking truth... don't lie because (1) it is totally hypocritical, especially for my mom to do, and yeah, Sarah too seeing as she tries the hardest to emulate Mom down to the way she does her makeup; and (2) they are leaving the house to get away from me and Matthew. ME and MATTHEW- STOP PUTTING ME IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THAT 12- YEAR OLD TORNADO! I am ABSOLUTELY NOTHING like him. So yeah, thanks guys.   Okay, I feel like screaming-- and in a way it is kind of sad that this is the only way I ever have to vent. Kenny blew me off not once, but twice this week. Screw it-- I swear to God, is it me? I think I'm cursed, honestly. Why in the hell am I wasting my time with this boy- stupid me, I actually thought he liked me, that I finally met a good guy, a good well mannered and smart guy that I like. Well, I just got the cold shoulder for a Lord of the Rings game yesterday, so putting in that perspective, I should just go drown myself in my own stupidity.   I haven't heard from Marie since Monday when she called me a bitch for being a little frustrating (and I was completely entitled to be upset, mind you). She told me that if I didn't go to calling hours I would be in the wrong. NO. NO. NO. Woe is she, no one wanted to listen about her and her fucked up life with her practically nonexistant and practically imaginary "boyfriend" John. I'm tired of swallowing what I want to say so I can listen to her. NO. It's not happening, and Monday definitely wasn't the day to try to overpower me again to talk about herself, and on top of all of that, call me a bitch because I didn't want to drop Dot's death. I had to gulp down my emotions when Carolyn died, I didn't want to talk about it but knew I had to because she was my best friend. Again, STUPID ME.
