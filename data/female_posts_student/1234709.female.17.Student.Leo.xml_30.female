Get a job 4.  Go on a road trip with a couple friends 5.  Jump off the Kelowna bridge (again) 6.  Meet someone new 7.  Play Hack and improve 8.  Go to a few gigs  9.  Go to a big concert  10. Learn a guitar song 11. Take breakdancing lessons 12. Learn to ride a unicycle 13. Spend hours skipping stones 14. Watch the sunrise 15. Have a picnic  16. Take goofy photobooth pictures with a friend  17. Dye my hair (maybe?) 18. Get a tan 19. Play volleyball lots 20. Go to Skaha
