THE WORD OF THE DAY --> tv remote.     the best thing to don't do anything. u're in the sofa, and thanks to the remote u can do zapping without getting up...that's cool... but if u're on some kind of diet don't use the remote...get ur ass up and go change the channel on the tv!!     yeah...a remote is an useful object.  ***take care***
