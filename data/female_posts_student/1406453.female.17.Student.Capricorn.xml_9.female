Yosemite was awesome: I biked, hiked, climbed, relaxed, read, rafted, swam, flirted, got sunburned, then tanned, and generally had fun. The squirrels were cool, once again, but the little boogers chewed through my Bank of America bag- grrr.... I got back Sun. night really late. Last night I was invited to Catie's "Welcome back from France"/Birthday party. It was great, chatted with Kevin about band stuff and showed him some of my newest pieces; he seemed impressed, which made me feel good. I chilled there with pizza, salad, and soda but then felt like crap. I thought Sam might come over and join us or I might have spent the night, but instead I went home and ralphed... bummer. Today is all about recuperation: I really need a break. I bought the original  The Manchurian Candidate  novel, and I want to read it before Igo see the new movie (seen the old one long ago) on Saturday. Speaking of which, I have tickets to M. Night Shymalan's "The Village" Friday night; call me for details. That guy has some real old school genius. You can read about his works at urlLink http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0796117/ . He's a young Indian director from Philadelphia known for The Sixth Sense and Signs along with a few others. This ought to be a great film. Off to the gym and a lesson this afternoon. My new notebook p.c. comes in tomorrow- yay! Looking forward to the last sunny San Diego days and weeks.
