I believe the government of America should take steps towards solving this war on terror with clear targets.  I feel the war is like a “game” where the spectators comment on the players by sitting on their seats, commenting how the players should play.   It is true that a war will crumble down the economy in a country. This is where the president and his administration should take steady steps to be more specific on their regulations.  Instead of been a “dictator” and forcing rules on people of the country, I think Bush should be more concerned about the people and their concerns.  America has gone through a lot during the past couple of years and people seem to be frustrated with everything.  The standard of living has gone down due to low paid jobs, loss of business and many more.   Now I understand why the “Patriot Act” is opposed by many Americans.  Liberty is America, and now with this Patriot Act and its constant changing of the constitution has aggravated many people.  I feel the Patriot Act is like one of the reality shows where the act is like the live camera, waiting to busts someone for some so called “terrorist act”,  be it drugs or taking off a  man t-shirt in public.    If the US government is so worried about the country and its people then they should stop acting like the spectators of the game and start playing in the game.
