I don't even remember. Shh..." Jeff tried to kill me on my couch. He was throwing pillows at me and trying to put blankets on me...he practically killed me...so yea. Jeff..."You got pregnant...Remember that happened?" Rachel says..."What do you want me to say?" Jeff..."Up to you." Ok...for the record...I DID NOT...I repeat...DID NOT have sex with Jeff...lol. It's a LONG story...but yea, I'm still a virgin...and I'm not even remotly close to losing it...so yea. No one ask about this. Thank you. :o)
