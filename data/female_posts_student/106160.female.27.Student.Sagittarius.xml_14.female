We lounged around for most of the day and my mum came by and picked Andy up around 3pm to let him hang out with her. Then he went over to Jennifer's house to stay the eve and spend the night. We went out to dinner...first by Olive Garden where the wait was over an hour and then to Red Lobster where we were seated in fifteen minutes. I splurged and enjoyed the cheddar bay biscuits and a Shirley Temple. The food was quite nice for a change though we were disappointed to find out that they were out of key lime pie(!!!). Of course, we then thought about the fact that we could buy a whole  urlLink Edwards Key Lime Pie  for the price of one slice, which we did after we left. So now we're back home and about to watch  Van Helsing  which one of Izzy's friends downloaded for us.
