       
      I’m really just making it all up.  I don’t even know what I’m talking about now.  I’m supposed to have tracked the changes in family and community values (since it’s part of the community’s definition of well-being), but I never actually discussed this with them.  So this whole section will be based on my random impressions from living there.  Ai-yo!  Can I ever finish it?  What did I do there for three months?
