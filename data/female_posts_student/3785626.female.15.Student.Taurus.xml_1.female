Tregory called, YAY, I didn't get to talk to him yesterday. Poopy. But anyways...I have no cavities, BUT I have to get braces so I can have space for my wisdom teeth. I don't want braces though. :( MAYBE I can talk my dad into getting those invisiline braces. :D Happy Me. Anyways we ate at Bumper's. Yummay. Then I mowed the front yard, took a shower, and I was going to get my haircut but they closed. My dad said that alot of stores close on Tuesday afternoon. *rolls eyes* STUPID HICK TOWN. Anyways now I think I'm going to take a nap. I'll mow the rest of the grass tomorrow maybe. Yeeah. Anyways holla. Love, Cherry
