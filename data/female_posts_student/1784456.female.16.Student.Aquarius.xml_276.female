Well I have to hand in that options form thingy plus I lost the 'yes she can see the drama group' letter! Whoops! Heeey! I watched the Animal Show or whatever it's called. It's the Jim Henson thingy. It's sooo cool, I've watched it ever since I was little though. Okay so now you see what staying inside all the time does to you! One thing I'll never do in life is look at the inside of ears! Laura's against looking at feet though. They can be kind of gross. Hey does any one out there say gr-o-ss not grow-se. Erm guess not. How cold is it today?! Brrrr! Freezing. Oh, yeah, it would kind of help if I put the heating on... Whoopsie! The scary dustbin men came! So I kind of hid behind Mango. Great huh? Oh and I'm kind of working on a new page for this, but it's kind of tiring typing out all that HTML and no one else gets it! Hmmm....HTML lessons. Yeah, I'll need them! Oh thought for the day: I can't get wetter than this. Hey, that's more like a quote... Have fun you soaked people you. Yeah, just remember it's because I've been stuck inside...
