I have really been wanting to start my own business and I think I might have found a way to do just that. With a little bit of networking, I think it will all happen soon. I don't want to give you my idea just yet but I will definitely let you know when it all happens. I am so excited, I just hope I keep this motivation and actually carry everything out that I need to.  I will definitely keep you posted on the progress and I might need some opinions when it comes to choosing a name. So hold tight and keep your fingers crossed.
