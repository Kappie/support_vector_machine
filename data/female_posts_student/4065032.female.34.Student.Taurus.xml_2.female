They would open their beaks and deliver a squeak that seemed to take every ounce of energy they had. With my presence still unobtrusive, I quietly watched each parent deliver bug after bug to the youngsters. Much to my surprise, I soon learned that there were actually four little ones living above me. I'm not sure how the two on the bottom of the nest survived, but they seemed to have had it all figured out.   Several days passed and each baby managed to look over the edge of the nest. It was as if they were bobbing in water up to their shoulders. The one who could squeak the loudest and open its mouth the widest was often the recipient of "the catch of the minute." I remember watching a parent dutifully bring the young ones a moth. It was pale white in color...its natural color or a color of shear fright, I'm not sure. The adult bird, perhaps letting its guard down with the monotony of delivering bug after bug, attempted to give its offering to the loud, wide mouthed babe. But in an instant, the moth delightfully escaped its pending doom and plotted its miraculous escape. Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on who you are rooting for), the other adult bird was in close proximity and recaught the baby's dinner. I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad.   Gradually, over the course of at least a week, the fuzzy headed noise makers began to grow feathers. One day they were dark grey cotton balls, and the next they were miniature versions of their parents. They learned to groom themselves, spread their wings, comb their feathers, and scratch their heads. Occasionally an unwelcome third adult barn swallow would swoop by to check out the homestead. It would soon be forcefully convinced to conduct its fly-bys elsewhere.   I also was fortunate to see another intimate detail of this family's life. On occasion, a baby swallow would fidget its way around the nest so that its tail end was hanging over the nest. One of the adults would bring and deliver food. Then the baby bird, tail end out, would produce a fecal sack (yep...The remnants of yesterday's bugs). The adult would grab the fecal sack and fly away with it, dropping it away from the nest. Apparently that was to deter predators from the nest. Judging by the white and black pile of "bird surprises" under the nest, this process was not always successfully completed.   In my new home, I have found great comfort in being a silent observer of the routines of these six swallows. The people within ear shot must think I'm crazy, as I often talk to the birds. They turn and tilt their head, similar to the way my golden retriever does when I talk to him. Sometimes I even get a tweet or two from them. I'm not sure if they are cursing me out or singing my praises or if they are even directing their tunes at me. I like to think that we are exchanging pleasantries.   As the birds went from fuzz to feathers, I learned more lessons.   Don't be afraid to spread your wings, even if it is in the comfort of your own home.   Sometimes the one with the loudest mouth is the one whogets fed first.   It's okay if you bring in"good" and leave with "bad," especially if it involves taking care of loved ones.
