Some stuff makes me angry, some stuff makes me happy, some stuff makes me stressed, some stuff makes me nervous...some stuff makes me wanna change.  I'm kinda scared. I've been like this before and...I just don't want to talk about it.  Anyways...moving on before I depress myself the day before a great trip.  I want the chance to make things right. Please...let me make things right.  Okay...time to finish packing...getting my mind off worries...  Whew. Okay. No stress. Calm. Everything's gonna be okay.  Think about the trip, dammit!  Alright crazies, see you in a week and a half. :)
