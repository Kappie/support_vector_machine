And i really shouldn't be bored or lonely because I have like a million things to do - and my grandparents are still home and Apollo is home and once in a while i do see my sister.but it's so DULL. I miss everyone. Go cry about it. anyway, going to go do some more work and take over some of Apollo's belly rubs (if you forget he gets a little nippy)
