A pile of something  rather unpleasant . *glares*  ;_; I nearly threw up today. I guess I did kinda... and I kinda wanted to.. because the throwie-upie feeling keeps returning. I just want to get it over with! *angst*  I decided to consider making a webcomic... not that I'd really expect anyone to read it, mostly for my own amusement more or less. I already wrote up a rather extensive plot and made character sketches of two of my many mayhaps-future characters. I'm not going to write it out, maybe I'll just scan in what I've already written in me sketch book... I think I will. Wait, I'll go scan now.. but it will seem like not time has past for you. Strange that. Damn you and you're lack of time experience. *shakes fist* ...blerg... scanners being a picky bastard... *kills*  Well, then, that took way more time than it was worth *anguish*    urlLink character sketches   - what are those crazy scribblings you ask? They're their names. That's right. I scribbled them out. Bitches. Well, you'll find out the boy's name if you read the plot line... bah   plotline:   1   - that's right... it's got death and rape. Cry about it.    2   - Ha! I based the siblings on people I hate/have a distaste for! Yay~! *donces* The doodle at the bottom was a pathetic attempt at morbid humour and space filling. Oi.. *badger*   {I changed the names of things so that people can't say that I'm dissing actual things.. I'll just say that I don't know what they're talking about and that I invented those names and that they're just crazy fucks. Clever, no? *turns french*}   ??click for exciting prize??   - that is what happens when you doodle late at night while listening to sexy placebo songs.. well.. it's what happens to me anyways ._.   I have a feeling that if I do go thru with this thinger it'll end up being all gothy. I don't exactly want it to be like that but I'm apathetic enough to let it slide if it does. Well.. I'm done the plot line in my head.. kinda. 12 is gunna be one of them stupid petaphile-bait children and 13 is gunna be a very terrible 2 yr old. It's gunna be possessed-like.. *bug-eyed*   Anyways... Had an interesting conversation with "peat" XD Only a select few will understand that.. Hahe~! Yes... That's right.. *pelvic thrust*
