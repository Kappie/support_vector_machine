So far, I have one complete and another about halfway done and I can already tell that this is going to be so much easier...it's even motivating me to make new layouts for all of them! :O I'm seriously kicking myself for not knowing about this before...all of those hours on dial-up spent updating FLs. Bleh. Who knows...I might even start a new one after I finish with this.
