Anyways, my mom felt bad for me so she bought me some Chinese food today. Apparently- the waiter guy got a little excited and dumped about 12 fortune cookies into the to-go bag. I was excited naturally.. I think fortune cookies are awesome. I began cracking em' and found the fortunes were slighty crappy, and the cookies were stale to boot. I found one good fortune out of my chosen 4.... it said "A surprising change is coming your way!" I thought it was a pretty awesome fortune. Pretty awesome for me anyways. I've been in this "mental lull" and I can't seem to get out of it. I'm hoping that my bday puts me in some better spirits. Even if it doesn't, I've still planned a buncha crap to do that day to keep me busy. I'll spare you the bulleted list, but just to give you an idea;   Operation: Hair  Ok, so I've had the same hair style since I was like.. ten. Sure, it's been shorter and times. But, I really wanna do something drastic. Some might say I'm taking a chance since prom is coming up soon, but hey, I could always wear a tight Elvis wig right? Anyways, I'm gonna get my hair about.. touching shoulder length, and I'm gonna get sandy blonde highlights in it. Maybe not as bold as you imagined, but prom is only 2 months away.   Operation: Good Lunch  I'm going to the best restaurant ever- the Mongolian barbecue. It's my absolute fav. restaurant besides all Chinese restaurants.. lol. I'm going with my family, which is sure to be a mistake. Knowing my mom she'll tell the waiter that it's my birthday and then he/she will say "Really?!" and then precede to congratulate me or sing. And I will proceed to blush until you can't tell that I'm white anymore.   Operation: Build-a-Bear  Everybody wants a keepsake from their 16th birthday right? Well.. I love teddy bears so I decided on that. What I don't know is what I'm gonna make... I've already made like 5 of the things. Got a suggestion? Leave me a comment and I might consider it.   Operation: Read Emails and Ims that say "O, today was your birthday? I completely forgot........... HAPPY BIRTHDAY"  Yeah... theres no love like the love that says "I forgot your birthday". Just so we are all clear- my birthday is March 1st, for all those forgetful people out there. I don't need fireworks or anything, but an ecard would be nice. If you don't have time for even that, than don't bother talking to me for AT LEAST a month.   And In Conclusion  See, I told you it wasn't going to be a "bulleted" list. Yes, It was a list. But it wasn't a bulleted one. Aren't I clever? Don't answer that. Anyways- the countdown is on: 7 days. Leave me comments on stuff I should do!!    Never Pet a Beaver Backwards.. Just Trust Me On This One.
