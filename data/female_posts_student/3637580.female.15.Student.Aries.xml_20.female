Yeah so as for the big Canada trip, well Lauren ended up inviting me to come to her lake house for the weekend, and I talked it over with my dad, and he said he wouldn't mind if I didn't go to Canada cause it wouldn't be a fun trip and plus I barley even knew his dad. So that was that. We went up to Laurens lake house on Friday. It was way fun. I mean hello it's me and Lauren!!! haha So we layed out Saturday and we decide heeey lets go out on the Jet-Ski, so we're doing all kind of crazy circles and stuff and we come aroud and we're speeding into the dock and then we realize that the boat sheriff is trying to pull us over ..opps. So he asks for boat registration and laurens boating saftey certificate. Well they had the registration for the jet ski but it was expired and they didn't have the serial number on it. Strike one and two, then Lauren didn't have a boating license either. Strike three. But we played dumb, Lauren said she thought you only had to have a drivers license and her dad made something up about the serial number issue, also the cop looked like a total nerd so he just said we needed to get boating saftey licenses and get the serial number on the jet ski and we'd be set. So yes no ticket. Lauren and me decided he only pulled us over cause we were some hot chicks and he knew pulling us over would be as close as he could ever get. haha pssshhh...well we had some really good laughs on that. So of course after that Lauren was to scared to Jet Ski , but I still ended up going with Michael , who is SUCH a crazy driver. So we ended up having an awesome time up at the lake.  We have 10 days till school starts , I need to clothing/accesories shop,supply shop, and highlight/cut my hair. Busy week. My ankle still isn't better so I have a doctors appointment next week again. I don't even know if I can play Northridge, which sucks majorly bad. I hate sitting out,it sucks.  The olympics started this weekend, the bastards have yet to play soccer ...ugh!  I'm cold so I'm gunna go sleep in a big huge warm fleece blanket yyaayy!! haha
