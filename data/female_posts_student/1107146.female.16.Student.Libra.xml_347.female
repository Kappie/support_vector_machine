Because I thought you were out of town with daddy dearest...=). Cheer up...we'll have a girls night with Linds and we can bash males all we want....and you can scream and scream and scream...if you want, or we could just have fun and just forget how totally horrible the male sex is....either one. But cheer up becuase we're here and as soon as Linds's mom settles and I get my schedule settled with Vandy we'll do something. =)
