I'm sorry that you think i just go for looks....i really don't....i mean yeah thats what firsts attracts me to them when i've never talked to them before...but the guys at Illiana are good friends that i'd never date considering most of them are in college but i did get to know them and they are all cool people then Ryan and Riley...yeah they are hot but i've literally known them all my life and the only reason i said that they are getting hotter everytime i see them b/c little RIley is growing up and i've gotten to know him a lot better and b/c Ryan and i have gotten closer and they are awesome people can i not say that they are hot without people gettin upset with me?! is that alright with you....trust me i've gone out with people who aren't cute but because i got to know them they became cute b/c of their personalities so stop accusin me for just lookin on the outside and not on the inside until you really get to know me b/c obviously you don't...actually i was just with a really cute guy and i broke it off b/c he wasn't my type! (we were talking so i got to know him....yeah so booya grandma) thank you!  Tori
