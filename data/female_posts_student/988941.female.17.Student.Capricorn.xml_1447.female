Still, I took a half hour brake so ner ner nikiniki ner ner sainsbury's!!  I did 6 and a half hours tills yesterday, well 3, i spent the rest of the time putting things on the shelves that the customers decided they didnt want when they got to the checkout!  I also had to buddy someone, means I'm good at my job!!!  They wanted me to watch over someone who was new and hepl them out if they got stuck, coolio or what!  Doing gardening today, sorting out Annie's Kennel.  She's gonna have a big bush going around it, talking of big bushes, has anyone seen The Mighty Boosh on BBC 3?  its VERY funny, and I recommend it,  its on most nights at 8 or half past.  Other than that all is well, looking forward to having a big reunion on thursday!  I wonder what the dress code will be this time!  beach wear, ski wear, posh, we'll see.  I know theres not many exams left but for those who do have some, again I wish you all the best of luck, and for those of you get back from the physics exam this eveing, I hope it went well!!  Brazil Night is a bit of a cock up, theres loadsa of jobs that need doing and I'm not sure we have enough people coming.  Hopefully it'll work out when the meetings start up again. If anyone has anything which could be given as a raffle prize that they don't want, or that can be brought for a small price, let me or Tom know!  Chow for Now, love and all the rest of it...
