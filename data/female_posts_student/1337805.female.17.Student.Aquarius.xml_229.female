Sunday I went to church, did some childcare, watched the Neverending Story. It's been so long since I last watched it, I couldn't actaully remember what happens after Atreyu reaches the Southern Oracle..but now I do. Wasn't a suitable movie for poor Maria though. Then I went to Steve's to drop off a book, killed some tent caterpillers. Maaaaaaan that was wicked :P Then I went to Spelts, picked up a phone card (reminder for self, I need a new one before this one expires May 17) then went to Laura's. She knocked down a walll :O Then I went over to Nick's for a bit, then back to Laura's, then to Kim's, watched some TV there, and then Laura, Kimmy, Mandy and I all hoofed it down to Silver City to watch Mean Girls. Kim had NO money in her bank account however (she somehow transfered it all) so we almost didn't get to see the movie until Laura gave the twins movie money. Then we went to buy tickets, and discovered the movie didn't actaully start at 7.45 like Kim thought, but at 7.15!! So we missed 15 minutes of movie and credits, and had to sit at the front, off to the side. But whatever :) It was a good movie.   Watched Ayla and went shopping on Monday, and watched her again on Tuesday. Got a ride home from Nick's dad on Tuesday, which was sweet-o. Wednesday was the one day I went straight home, doing prolly nothing. Waited for a stupid update to download and install, pretty much it. Thursday was Laura's birthday, I baked cupcakes for her. Went over to Nick's after school so we could watch the last Friends together. We....had fun until then though. Holy crap, yes. Watched the finale, I cried like a baby. I looked up, and someone else was too. Honestly, cutest thing ever. Golly, do I love Nick :).  Friday was yesterday, went to a self-defence thingy after school, kinda wish I had taken it at school now. Walked home with Nick, got really wet. Had more fun at his house. Rwawr........Then went over to Laura's, braided her hair, and we went off to youth group. (We were so late :P) It was Chinese food night, so we loaded up plates of that. Boooooy that was some goood chinese food. Then we all dispersed outside and such, out in the rain on the lookout. Then we all came together inside to start a game of Sardines, which we never played. Instead we played a ROCKIN' 2-3 hour long game of Silent Foooooot ball...so fun. It's just so much fun when Tom is the dictator, randomly giving out points, punishing people, crap, that's funny. It was better when he handed out the power to Kathrine, and she wouldn't listen to anything he said, and totally freaked. :D Fun!   Today's plans are going shopping with Laura...getting her something else for her birthday, and some stuff for my trip (which is in 13 THIRTEEN days!!!!) and some presents for all the May Birthdays and anniversaries :P yay! There's something else going down, but I can't blog about it now..:D SO EXCITED!  Anyways, I'm out. I'm going to be SO busy until everyone starts leaving.....and I leave..and come back :P
