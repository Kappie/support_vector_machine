Wheee!  :D  Well, I have 160dollars out of the bank, but 110 is going in the bank... the rest is for when I go to Canada on my Mission Trip and for whatever.  Maybe even possibly streaking meh hair.  Yaay..  o_O;;  As I said, I am boring and strange.. don't say I didn't warn you.   Summer Vacation is... SO BORING!  BLAAAAH!   I've been out for almost a month now, and I still have two more months of freedom... How more boring can you get?  Oh well... *grabs trix yogurt* Yummie.   La la la... I'm going to a party soon.  Yaay.  : D   I'm getting her a present.  :J  I hope she likes it.  Well, technically, its not her birthday, more like her half, but I didn't get to give her a present on her b-day, so  I'm giving her one anyways.  X3    . .. .what is there to talk about?  Hrm... I vish I could meet all you peoples.  ;-;  But I'm here in America for another year, then who knows where I'll be?  Thats the cool part.  I'm voting for a small town in Canada.   My daddy found one vacant.  Its in Forest, Ontario.. its so small, and 10minutes from the beach.  And close to you guys!   So I said I want to go there too.  I don't like big cities... *spits on all US's big cities*  Too big, know no one.  La laa... I think I'm done for the day... gotta clean the two rooms I'm assigned, :: -_-; ::  and then practice drums and have lunch.  Well, ciao!
