I've been super busy and trying to make the best of life.  One of the first things I'd like to address is the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster.  I was horrified at first when I learned of the disaster, and I quickly became saddened about the situation as I watched the Memorial on TV today.  It brings me such grief and sorrow to know that people with such accomplished and diverse backgrounds have left us so abruptly.    I have always been intrigued by the vast realms of space.  It takes such commitment and bravery to master space travel, and I always held astronauts past and present in such great esteem for their ventures and accomplishments.  This is the second Space Flight disaster to occur within my lifetime (I was six when the Challenger  exploded in 1986).  I really wish to not have to witness anymore in my remaining years.  May God bless the familes of the Columbia Crew.   On a lighter note:  Friday the 31st was one of the best times I have ever had.  Gen and I conspired for me to drive down to Portsmouth to celebrate Gen's birthday.  The conspiracy behind it?  Sharona didn't know I was coming down.  Sharona's stepdad answered the door and told her she had a visitor.  I wish I had a camera with me, because the look on Sharona's face was PRICELESS when she came down the stairs and saw me there.  We did all kinds of fun stuff that night.  We played chess, watched TV and a couple of movies, we played Scrabble (FEZ!!!), and made a wonderful mexican dinner that all could enjoy (Gen, Christopher, and Andrea are vegetarians).  Such a delightful night that I will soon not forget.  Well, I've ran out of things to say.  Go figure.  Until next time...
