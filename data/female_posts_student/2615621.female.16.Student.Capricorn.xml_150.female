So i guess now is the time i write about the wedding i went to. i heard "my goodness! you've grown up so much!" and "wow! you've grown up!" WAY too many times. duh people, 10, 11 years makes u grow up. hell, thats from a baby to middle school! But arent you lucky, u saw me as a baby so u just missed from early school years to *gasp* late high school! i be damned!! hell, i grew boobs!!! OMG!! and i got a life! OH MY! and u know what else, i developed my own views and opinions about things--such as you. Doesnt make a damn bit of sense. duh, when you igorne me for several years i of course got older and grew up, without you so i dont know why they all acted like they had something to do with the person i am today. They should have been embarrased. There were all these people who i had no idea who the hell they were. they were coming at me from all angles, all saying "wow uve grown!" or "hows my 14yr old niece?!" umm..im 16 now. *smile* *wants to run away and take the cake with me* *just keeps smiling, saying "well gordon is the 14yr old one, maybe thats why u thought that*. ugh. Anyways, there was one person who i thought made me feel like family. the groom, my cousin Lance. he saw me and smiled and gave me a big hug, no one else had even touched me...and he said "how ya been girl!, it's been ages!" and he told me he was excited i was coming. His new bride, Hailey, hugged me and said "wow, i've heard so much about you! im so glad you could make it!" they were very nice..then i met Hailey's mother off to the side when my dad introduced himself, and then me, and when she heard my name she said "oo ur julia! i've heard some much about you from hailey and lance!"...made me feel good... anyways, to lance and hailey, have fun in jamacia! :p   Speaking of family, my aunt Gale and cousin Kayre or Cayre..or whatever Kay-re want me to come up and spend 3 days and 2 nites with Kayre and her daughter my 2nd cousin Caroline. I'm a year older than Caroline. Shes the only cousin i actually remember as a kid. I've already written about her i think. But surprise surprise! they actually called to make plans for me to come up. i think i wrote that it would be fun, but i wasnt getting my hopes up. for once, they came through. Spending time with Caroline and her brother Evan should be a lot of fun. Me and Caroline can stay up late and talk about boys and that kinda stuff..i hope shes like that. She's all neat and organized and i'm hectic and choatic. hopefull i'll get along with her...i know i will, but i hope i REALLY like her and i dont have to put on a fake smile and laugh. and god help me if she listens to suckass music.  I called my mom this morning and told her i was calling again to say hey cuz she was mean to me last nite. lol she just laughed. she was totally different. i swear, shes crazy. lol I asked her about the concert yet again, she wants me to get home and sit down with her and john and talk about. i quote.."im all for it julia, but u need to make sure john is" OMG SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHAT JOHN SAYS i know he wont say no..hell, hes smarter than that. doesnt want me to be all pissed off at him! haha so..in other words, im going to my freakin concert. lol i better be at least...im not gonna give a def. yay or nay, but between me and my lil blog, YAY im going! lol Mom also said she was planning a white water rafting trip for when i got home (with john and his family) but then glenn didnt wanna go U DAMN BRAT and then she thought it would be too much for my knee MY FUCKIN KNEE and ive ALWAYS wanted to go rafting, but she said with all the rocks and rough water..it wouldnt be smart for my knee. SO HER, JOHN AND ROBERTA MAY STILL GO. HOW FAIR IS THAT?! HELLLLL NO. but so all of us can do something, we're going to Carowinds when i get home. okay..now carowins..white water rafting trip..carowinds...white water rafting trip..carowinds...HELL I SAY WHITE WATER RAFTING DAMMIT. but nooo julia has to go to carowinds. am i complaing? no. i mean, i like going to carowinds and john does rollercoasters, so that means mom will get on them and i used to not be able to get her on any of them. she would soo piss me off but i guess now since john is getting on them...she will do. i almost asked if i could take a friend and then take kaela with me, but i figured she wanted it to be a "family" thing. i said at least i get to ride the kickass lil yellow kiddy taxi ride cuz u can only get on it if ur like 4 feet tall or with a lil kid. and im sure i'll grab zack..hahaha but who will be with zack when we all go on rollercoasters? umm i guess roberta can sit that one out hahaha naw, she'll prob throw a fit and glenn or gordon will be the babysitter. lol I'll prob do all the coasters, i just hate the old wooden one Thunder Road and i def. wont do it backwards! thats crazy shit...i dont like it cuz when it goes down that big drop i feel like im gonna fall out. i want to be tightly secured in that seat like the newer ones where u have the harness over you, i dont want a lil bar...it freaks the hell outta me lol now, maybe if i had some hot dude..hahaha mom then asked me if i could walk carowinds and i said umm yeah, i walk malls. lol and then told her she did it with her hip before she got it replaced and she was like "yeah ur right.." so i'll be walking carowinds and ridding rides! yay. and not white water rafting...but i'll get to go to my concert! haha  I have decided that if anything goes fucky with my knee i'll get one of those kickass hover crafts!! u know those scooter thingies..im tryin to remember their exact name lol oh well, they're kickass!! i'll get to be in a commerical where i go to the grand canyon and be like "I LOVE MY NEW HOVER CRAFT!
