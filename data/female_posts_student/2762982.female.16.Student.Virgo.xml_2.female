It's the last week of this semester....yay for final in math... and then, Kat's going to Summit next semi, so she's not going to be here...it'll be interesting. ack...so stressed over tests and not knowing where everything is going with people around me. Why do i feel so left out in the dark...?  So...there's this one guy on my mind...Brad... I really haven't known him very long, and I know very little about him. I want the chance to know more....but we haven't been talking like we used to...why? I hope something hasn't happened since the last time i saw him. I want the chacne to at least be his friend, or one of them, maybe be more if he gives me that chance...but how would I tell him how I feel. yeah, i could just come out and say it, but that's not who I am. i would keep everything inside, all emotions, unless they bursted out unwillingly. God!! how I wish I could tell people how I feel....like earlier today, Kat and Conley didn't want to do their english sim because they didn't know what to say about the topics they could talk about, and instead of just trying to give it a shot, they gave up and said they wouldn't do it. sure, you have 2 more years to do it, but what if you don't pass???? At least this time you know and your prepared for the next time you have to take it. oh well...their loss. then they were talking about their childern...that I couldn't handle, and I think, or I hope, they knew that. It just didn't seem right what they were saying...really really uncomfortable.  So other then that, life is pretty good. I can't seem to get along with my mom though...dunno why...and i'd rather be living with my dad, which is weird considering i hated him when my parents were together, but now that they are apart, it's switched...we'll see where it goes. I've been pulling away from my sister, and I feel really bad about that, but I don't know how to make it up to her because she hasn't given me the chance to. And Kat...with her going to Summit, I've felt like she's been putting more and more distance between us and our friendship........not that it hasn't happened before, but we've always been able to see eachother durring school hours... It's all just soo confusing...I don't know what to say...  my goal, for this, is to try to upgrade it when i get the chance, but that'll work when I've got soemthign to talk about :)
