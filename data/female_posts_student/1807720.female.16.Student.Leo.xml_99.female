Since I didn't understand the stuff yesterday it was difficult and well I tried to get some help with the stuff in the resourse room but like every teacher that tries to explain it to me was really confusing.  Tommorow I am going to see how I did on the quiz and hopefully my math teacher will go over more of it.  Chem today was great!  I did good on my quiz.  I got 16/20 which I think is an 80% which is much better than failing like previous times.  I have to study tonight alot but I know that I KNOW this stuff.  I studied soooo much on the weekend, I have to do good.  I believe in myself right now.  I really believe.  I can do it.  The chem teacher was really nice again, ever since I talked to her she has been extremely nice.  I think I ask her way too many qustions though and by the end of the term I will probably have driven her up the wall from "How do I do this...How do I do that?"  LOL.  I guess that is what she is there for.
