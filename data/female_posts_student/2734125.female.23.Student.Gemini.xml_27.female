Humans, for generations (those that had to deal with winter), spend cold shitty days sitting inside, cooking, weaving, and telling stories.  Then we got stupid annoying things like electricity and heat and indoor plumbing and everything went down hill.  Now I can sit in front of the black box, writing for all the world to see, but I weave for crap, and I'm not very good at starting a fire, even with the fire fluid.  I'm an angry bunny, truth be told.  Why?  No reason, other then its healthy to be slightly peeved occationally.  I expect it will abate.    WHY ISN'T IT JUNE DAMN IT?!  Those of you that are practical will say something about the spinning of the earth, or our tilt, or the way we need winter to renew life.  The rest of us, the real people who are not sciences slaves, recognize this winter thing for what it really is: BULLSHIT.  The fact of the matter is, not too long ago, winter didn't happen.  It was created to make people more dependent on the government, and to increase blanket sales.  You see, animals are scarcer during the winter, so people have to work together to get food to last it out (IE organized gov comes in).  Before, when winter was a day a year where everyone drank really cold brewed drinks and slept all day (In Latin Winter means "Day of inebriated Sleep") we didn't need to work together.  We just got together to party.  Then, a power hungry person who was most likely from Canada called his shamans and his inventors together and they started a mass consciousness altering program to convince people that winter was about 5 months of the year and involved cold white water falling from the sky.  When a certain critical level was reached the reality of the world changed and we got this.  The power hungry Canadian made a fortune on blanket sales, and the rest of us are still suffering.    I'm going to go hibernate.
