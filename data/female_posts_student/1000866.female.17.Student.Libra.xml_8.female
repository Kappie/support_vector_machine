It was super-duper fun, as was the first party I went to....but, I'll talk about that more later. Well, today was the last day before break, and it was dress up day, so naturally, I wore my dressiest outfit. Pajamas. They had stars on them. Quite nifty. Got the school newspaper, and there was this editorial (editorial being the operative word there, meaning that they ARE allowed to have opinions) in there that talked about teens and sex. They used band practice rooms, and band in general to prove their point. Honestly, I think people are making far too big of a deal out of it. It's a stupid editorial. Editorials are supposed to get a rise out of you. They're opinions. So, my opinion of the whole situation is to let it go, and be mature about it, but...many of the band kids beg to differ with me. Oh well. Anyway, this contraversial story was the highlight of my school day. Quite amusing. After school, I came home, blah-de-blah-de-blah, and then at 5:15'ish Carson picked me up, and we went to Noodles to celebrate her birthday. It was really fun. I got to meet some really awesome people. :) When we went in, these kids from Nequa stole our table. We plotted to get revenge, but never did. Then during dinner, this really creepy guy kept looking at us. He came at three different times during the meal looking through the window. *Shiver* Then, when we decided to go home and were standing outside waiting for Carson's mom to come, this guy in a van asks us where Naperville Central is, so, being the polite kids we are, we told him. So, then he says, "Are you sure?"  We say, "Yes, we're sure." "Do you kids go there?" "Yes." "Are you sure?" "Yes." "OK, so I take a left, then another left at the bell tower. Are you sure?" "Yes!" Finally, after asking us about ten thousand times if we're sure, he turns the corner, and we start talking, and we're like, "Didn't he notice the jackets, and he asked, "Are you sure," a heck of a lot." To our dismay, he was still basically right there. With his windows rolled down. Whoops. Oh well, that was my adventure at Noodles. Carson's parents drove us home, and I went to Kathryn's for her shindig. It was also tons of fun. We were looking at classified ads in the newspaper it was hilarious. "HOT Victoria's secret model. Likes to rollerblade, work out, talk, and MUCH more."  "Great looking man looking for a vivacious woman to please me."  It was just too funny. Well, I should be off to bed now. I have to get up early the first day of Winter Break? How poopy is that? My brother has a bunch of friends over though, so, it'll be hard to fall asleep with all the noise. I'll just turn my music up. :) Anyway, I'm off to sleepyland. Goodnight everyone. Sweet dreams.  *Ya di amore*
