I'm blinded by these shit I'm numb, coldness seeping in No more feelings breaking in I'm endorsed with ice The hurt won't raise I wanna shout When the lights out When no one's there And no feelings break in I promise; I swear The numbness shocking me Pull me out from this deep pit I don't wanna die alone here, please Fear's coming and gone again The hurt's all left inside of me Why is the sky dark? I'm blinded by these shit I'm numb, coldness seeping in No more feelings breaking in Halt my mind, make it stop I don't wanna hear these stupid thoughts The voice is bugging me non-stop Just shut it up, I'm begging, please I'm on my knees, I'm slumping down Into the deep pit I've dug myself I'm blinded by these shit No more feelings breaking in What's left is gone What's gone has left No more...no more feelings breaking in...
