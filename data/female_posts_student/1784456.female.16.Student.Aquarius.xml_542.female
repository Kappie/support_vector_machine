Ooh, sorry, bored and I dunno what to talk about! Yeay! It's my birthday soon! Woooohooo! Aargh, we had a french test and I pinged Izzy's bracelet and it went by Megan, then the teacher picked it up and Megan said it was hers and she said that she had been looking for it for ages! Liar! Then Rosie was like, I got 16 I must be cleverer than you. But they all cheated and copied each other, and is it me or do I sound really kiddy today? I'm gonna go disappear in a florish of moralness!
