She has her own place (a crummy apartment with no air-conditioning unit only God knows where -- she gave Mom the address after she moved there, but Mom wasn't paying attention or didn't care, probably a little of both, so we don't know where it is). Mom was pretty upset and Dad was really angry at first, but they got over it. Jen has been pulling antics like these ever since I can remember. Mom and Dad are used to it now, sad to say. Matt takes care of Logan for the most part. Mom and Karen, Matt's mom, take turns baby-sitting throughout the week.    Your fantasy baseball team sounds interesting, Daf. I'm glad that it's doing well. I'm not much of a sports fan, much less a baseball fan. I don't know what anything is. It's interesting, though !  Don't they have fantasy football and fantasy basketball, too?
