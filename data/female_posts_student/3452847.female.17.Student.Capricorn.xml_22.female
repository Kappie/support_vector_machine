Jason has gone away today, probably best, i spoke to him briefly online last night but he was pissed off about lots of things including Laura apparatly being the top of the iceberg, they argue quite a bit, especially as it will only be 4 weeks tomorrow that they have been together, we never had that, i mean we had that blip but as he said in one of his conversations with Ami, nothing was ever bad apart from that blip...  We had fun, we had a laugh, and i feel ok now, as i know we're back on to getting along ok, i have the satisfaction of knowing him and Laura won't last lont, but that doesn't stop me pitying her but at the same time i want to spend time with her, i think its to find out about him...  I am still lonely, its been nearly 10 months, 10 months since we were together, its a long but short time, nearly a year... A year nearly passed since i properly held him close. That sucks, it really does, we were so god damn close, and had everything on our bloody side, apart from her, you bitch!!!!!! I think i want to go shopping tomorrow, spend some money if its not too hot, after all i have 133 in the bank, not so bad this time is it? I better fuck off, at least this year i'm not going to miss Jason,  i pined so much and it sucked so bad last year. Sad thing is, if we ever (not like we will) but if we ever did have the chance, i couldn't miss him like i used to straight away, hes hurt me too bad, hes cut me up, literally.  ~Lisa~
