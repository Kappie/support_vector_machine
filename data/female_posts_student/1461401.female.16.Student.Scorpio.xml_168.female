The funny thing is, Cowboy Bebop last night talked about the meaningless colonization on different planets. I think it's a sign. That we should all become teddy bear bombers... or not.   So today wasn't terrible. I've still been kinda depressed, but it hasn't been on my mind so much, so it wasn't too terrible. Was working with drama till 5, and then lilly and I went downtown. I got my homecoming pics dropped off, so I should have those by tomorrow. Then we went to the library where I got really far with my tome (yay). And then we went to grounds and Joe stalked us there so he sat through dinner with us. I would say he ate dinner with us but he didn't actually eat anything. Then lilly and I went back to the library where we ran into doug who gave us a ride home. (Thank you!!!) And then I realized something very important. If you are a realitor, you should never lock a person's door. Especially if the person has no key... and is an idiot... *cough*   I need to talk to him, but I don't know what to say, and I'm so scared I'll start crying. Or yelling.  And then... what about... so cute and so sad... He really needs someone to love him, but I'm so scared of hurting anyone else... I don't know what to do...
