But when that special someone is not around, you might look around to find them. At that moment, you are in love.  Although there is someone else who always makes you laugh, your eyes and attention might go only to that special someone. Then, you are in love.  Although that special someone was supposed to have called you long back, to let you know of their safe arrival, your phone is quiet. You are desperately waiting for the call! At that moment, you are in love.  If you are much more excited for one short e- mail from that special someone than other many long e-mails, you are in love.  When you find yourself as one who cannot erase all the messages in your answering machine because of one message from that special someone, you are in love.  When you get a couple of free movie tickets, you would not hesitate to think of that special someone. Then, you are in love.  You keep telling yourself, "that special someone is just a friend", but you realize that you can not avoid that person's special attraction. At that moment, you are in love.  While you are reading this page, if someone appears in your mind, then u are in love with that person.
