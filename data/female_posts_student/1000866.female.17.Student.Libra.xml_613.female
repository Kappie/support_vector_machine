I was in such a bad mood and...in ways it was nice to be with them and it was terrific spending time with Joanne but Kathryn seemed really mad for no reason and she was all snappy so...that sort of made it worse.  Haha and we definitely had some interesting conversations. It was fun, really...I just wish I hadn't been in such a bad mood. We went to sleep at like 2:00 and I had to leave her house at 7:30 because I had work at 8:00 but I actually slept. Like...I never sleep soundly at sleepovers and I slept through it and wasn't in too much pain when I woke up.    So then, I went to work with MUCH reluctance. Like...wow....I didn't want to go AT ALL. Like, you have no idea how much I loathed everyone and then...I don't know, as the day went on at work, my mood got better. I don't know. I work with this hilarious kid named Javan. I love him so much! He's such a nice kid and he always makes the time go by faster. YaY! Kathryn, Kel, Joanne and MC also all came in! That was a nice surprise. After work I went out to Red Lobster for dinner (us Catholics and our silly Good Friday) Then, I talked to Carson on the phone and it was odd. She didn't act like anything happened. Odd. Anyway, we talked about our little...plan...  Anyywayyyy, then I went to John's house. It was super fun. It was obviously me, Joanney, Kathryn, Mary Clare, Jamal, Faisil, Matt, Brett and Brett's German, Tim.... :) Oh, Neil was there for a bit too!  Oh and...little update...I'm totally getting over "the boy" for another guy now....I think. :) Hehe, and now...I must go sleep.  Oh gosh....I''d also like to say...Pat is like, the nicest, awesomest kid I know! He totally just made my night. Anyway, au revoir.
