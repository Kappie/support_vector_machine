The other interpretation of this song that i've is that one's best friend isdoing what God wants him or her to do...that is to go somewhere to become a missionary or other stuff...and as the friend obeys what the Lordhas told him or her, both the friends knew that they will still remembereach other forever. Friends are an important part of our lives. They either build us or destroy us. The choice is ours to decide. -Abigail
