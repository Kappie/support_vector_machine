Friday night, I finally went out with Rox and Graeme. I found out that Laurie was supposedly the one who has lately not been able to stand me. Apparently she was telling everyone to basically not invite me. Well, I get home tonight, and guess who calls! So...is it really her and she was just bored tonight? Or is it someone else? What the fuck...I don't know who to talk to and who to believe anymore. It's so fucked up. Oh well, Julia gets home tomorrow, hopefully that will help to level me out a little bit.
