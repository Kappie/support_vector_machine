It was hot for half of the time anyway which was cool. I wore my sumo suit when it was sunny! Yup, I was the freak everyone pointed and laughed at. And it was fun! The whole experience was worth all the bother; the one and a half hours of hell, lugging around a massive bag, the money, the annoyance when it rained, and dealing with bugs in the tent. But then for all that you get a once *hopefully five :P* in a life time experience, with all the hippie extras that no where else would have! What other festival would have people doing free massages and a giant LOVE statue that you could sit on? And I got to see all these amazing bands! Damn, missed out on I am Kloot, and they're actually kinda good! Anyway... so much stuff in my head! I'll go phone someone otherwise I'm gonna piss everyone off :P Haha, inflict it on one person only :D
