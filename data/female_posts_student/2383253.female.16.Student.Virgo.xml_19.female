Well, not celebrating yet, but at least the special section is done, and when you see it Thursday, I hope you all like it.  I believe you'll find the topic very appropos, and you may even find yourselves quoted as anonymous sources.  Hmm.  Evans didn't have me do my Zinn report today, so I was three hours short of sleep for nothing.  However, I did come in during fifth to get that damn DBQ done.  So I'm finally caught up in History...oh, no, wait...test next class.  I want to sleep.  We'll see how long this English takes me.
