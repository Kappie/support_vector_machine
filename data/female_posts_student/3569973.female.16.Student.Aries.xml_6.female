Friday I got to spend the whole night with jake, then saturday I got to go shopping for the wedding that night, then we went to Casey Walravens and Abbys wedding, which me, Jake, Clint, and Jessica has a little bit too much fun at. Then me, Jake and his mom stole fish from the wedding which ended up spilling all over the car and me and Tracy ended up leaving jake at the stop sign. I didnt end up getting home until about 1 in the morning. Sunday I woke up early and went and got ready at Jakes and went to his family reunion...which really wasnt the best thing ever but that didnt matter cause we spent most of the time feeding the ducks (and watching them mate....which believe me was an experience of a life time)plus we got the play with lukes new baby and Faith...then we went back to jakes where we were supposed to go swimming, but yet ended up reading Harry Potter and sleeping. Then today I left and went up to Royal Pizza and got a job!!! OH yeah...rollin in the money and free pizza!! LOL. Plus I still get off on sundays which is perfect since thats mine and Jakes day anyways, but its no big deal cause now he doesnt have to sit at home when Im working cause he got a job today to. Well thats all I have for now...So Ill still be bored until I go to work tonight at 5. Till then, Later Days
