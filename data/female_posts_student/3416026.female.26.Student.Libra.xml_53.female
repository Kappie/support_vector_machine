Anyhow, the crotch-grabber was  urlLink quoted as saying  that he was "not so sure that public hangings don't have a place in society."  I know what you're thinking.  But he didn't mean c. 1500-1960 Mississippian society.  He's talking about, like, today.   This sets off my Republican Mad Libs alarm.  Say we make a sentence out of this, remove Ditka's name and insert your favorite republican:  ___________________ is not so sure that public hangings don't have a place in society.  Some choices to get you started: 1. Strom Thurmand (ok, ok. Too easy.  Even if he already bit it.) 2. Pat Buchanan 3. Jesse Helms 4. William Rehnquist 5. George W. Bush
