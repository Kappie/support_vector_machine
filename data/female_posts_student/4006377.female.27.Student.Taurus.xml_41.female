I still remember my Barbie cake from my 4th birthday. While surfing for ideas I come across something corny like this:     Which would totally work.   Or  even this:    But then I see this:   And at first glance I'm thinking, a coffin? For a kid's birthday?  What would you write on top?   "Here's to one more year closer to DEATH Timmy!"  "Life's a bitch and then you die kid!"  "Pretty soon you'll have one foot in the grave. Enjoy it while it lasts!"  What the hell? Then I noticed that the caption for the cake said it was a treasure chest. And I'm soooooooooooo relieved!
