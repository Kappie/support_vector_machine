"Oh! iloveyouiloveyouiloveyou! i dont ever want to lose you!" holding on to her so tight like i could keep us from drifting apart if i never let go...like my grasp alone could keep everything from falling to pieces... and just stand there stuck like that for a long time (or what would seem like a long time when you rush up to someone and take them by surprise and with such intensity during passing periods) until i reassured myself that when i relaxed my grip she would still be there and we would still be friends and still in highschool with 2 and some years left to reapply the cement between our souls.   but then again that would probably freak her out....and it would freak out the other people in the hallway... and i dont have enough courage to do something crazy like that... or, at least, i havent been worried so intensely and i havent had emotions running so high during study hall to rev up my adrenaline for that kind of insanity. plus it would be weird cause im not really a random hug kind of gal. and with my luck id probably end up knocking both of us to the floor, with me on top of her....and then that would just be a really uncomfortable situation. and what do you say after that? "um...sorry... i was kinda going for one of those crazy passionate, intense hugs...but i was a little off." riiight.   it is for these reasons and more i cannot think of that i have never executed such a gesture of affection, though i have on many an occasion felt everything inside of me jump towards her (referencing pervious entry) and ive ignored it because...you cant just go around doing everything you feel like all the time. i dunno.   maybe some day i should just have a day of doing whatever i feel like when i feel like. just a day. and if i felt like saying something i normally would have kept to myself, then ill say it. and if i feel like hugging the life out of emily, then i will. and if i feel like drawing during class when i should be taking notes, tehn im gonna draw. and if i feel like swearing, i will. and if i feel like telling the blatant, ugly, not polite, socially incorrect truth, then i will. and people will have to deal with it because it will be my special day.   see? this is one of those entries i cant put on the othe blog. i really dont want anyone and his brother reading it. id like to spare most people from knowing im crazy like this.   and now i have to go finsih passage to india reading. stupid blog and its time consumsion.
