The storyline was sophisticated (maybe a little too much on the irreverent side, but not bad, I think), the effects were good, the charecters were quite likable, the jokes were funny, so on- so forth- so whattathehell you havta cancel it for? What's it been on for, like two weeks?  Why is it that the cancelled shows always seem the most brilliant, anyway? Is that just our imagination, or are the TV companies set up in such a way so that all the really good shows get axed?   If so, why?  We may never know. -Ian
