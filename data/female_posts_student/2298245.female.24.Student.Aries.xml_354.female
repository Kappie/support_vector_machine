I've been bored out of my mind, and it's sometimes hard to motivate oneself to get over the boredom and get up and do things.   Another reason for the lack of posting has been that I have been wanting to post something meaningful, something about my anger at many world events at present.  But I have not been able to find the words.  Anger is not an eloquent emotion.  So I have persistently struggled with those emotions over the past couple of days, trying to put them down.  I will eventually succeed, but it is a more arduous task that I have the energy for at the moment.  Until then, I will tell you of the fun I've been up to, in the form of major movie time.  I love film, and I have been too busy to appreciate it of late, but now that I find myself with very little to occupy my time, I have gone a little crazy.  First, I watched Big Fish.  I had wanted to see this movie since it was out in theaters, and it just never happened.  I was supposed to see it with my sister over Christmas, but it had not opened at home yet.  Then, when I got back up here, I found no one to see it with and then, before I knew it, it was gone.  Should have gone by myself.  But, alas, I did not.  But I rented it this weekend, and I really liked it.  I think it was almost the perfect example of how a familiar story can be told in an unfamiliar and wonderful way.   Then, for the surprises.  I wasn't planning on renting Kill Bill, Vol. 1, when I went to the video store, but I walked by it, and something told me to rent it.  And I was not disappointed.  I actually really liked it, having only one small quibble toward the end of the movie.  It wasn't the violence and gore that bothered me, it was the fact that it all just went on for too long, and I started to lose my interest in the film.  For all I know, this was some sort of tribute to Asian cinema, but my complete lack of familiarity with these films puts me at somewhat of a disadvantage.  I actually was more impressed with the other homages in the film, particularly the references to the spaghetti westerns.  It was a nice blending of styles.  And Vol. 2, which I went to see at the theater after liking the first one, was even better, helped greatly along by the presence of David Carradine, who was merely ephemeral in the first film.  I can see that they would benefit from being screened as one, though.  Finally, yesterday, I watched Matchstick Men.  I liked this film, even more because it was not at all what I expected it to be.  It was finely crafted, and really really surprising to me.  So I guess I'd say I liked it.  All in all it was a very successful rental trip.  And I still have one movie to go, 21 Grams.  So I'll be back to present my thoughts, though I'm expecting a very heavy and depressing experience.  But these are emotions that are easier to express.
