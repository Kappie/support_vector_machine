I rocked at the Frog game! ha ha and  guess who  and  scatagories     Thanks for the smore Jimmy.. it was the best one ive ever had without chocolate!    DE , yeah that was fun.. NOT! lol one of these times I'll fall asleep    * It's only been a week but Its coming over me, its makin me believe, you're the one for me.   7 days and 7 nights of thunder, waters rising and im slipping under.   I think I fell in love with the 8th world wonder.      Everyone-- have a fun rest the summer, to some of my friends-- have safe fun trips!
