It's december, and i've only got like... 2 and 1/2 weeks until school gets out for break. i can't describe my excitment. excitement. hm. i have church stuff tonight, for like an hour and a half, which cuts into my "the simple life" portion of the night. i also have a lot of homework, because all the classes i had today and yesterday, will be together tomorrow for mom's day. so i kind of have a lot of work to do. i have to write a poem, and i'm having the hardest time doing it, i don't know why. i have some french stuff to do and memorize. dad is gone. mom has started stressing out again. AGAIN, the kids have been so bad again. i can't figure it out. when i'm not there nontheless! they are so so so terrible. i can't take it. my room is sooo soo messy. my brain hurts. my teeth hurt (orthodontist yesterday!) and i'm procrastinating a lot. a lot a lot. i've got and hour and a half to work. then i have to go. so i'd better get to it.
