At first I though it was a pebble stuck on one of the tires but then everytime I hit a bump. The feel of the drive felt like something wasnt right.  As I was driving around the block from my apartment, The right tire sounded like it was flat.  I pulled over and looked, but it wasnt flat.  After I parked my poor Samantha, I looked more closely at the tire in question.  As I suspected there was something wrong.  Stupid Screw!  Now I have to go to the service station in the morning to get the thing taken out and have the tire plugged.  ~Sigh   more to come... NET
