Even though its doubtful that any of you are mothers.. We are going out to "brunch" which should be muy interesante. I betcha i'm gonna eat till I feel like i'm going to puke...thats what always happens at those darn buffetts.  Ooh! I think I might bring my camera! That would be fun. Then I could post a bunch of pictures of my relative on my blog. Mwa haahaha.  Like Miranda who was Little Miss Clark County. Hahahha. And Reis who is like water skking champion. Haha. Then my aunt who was like Miss Washington. Haha. I have an...interesting...family....
