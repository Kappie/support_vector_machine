A year ago a kid murdered another kid, they were like 14 or something, anyways the kid said he did it because he played the game 'manhunt' and thought it'd be cool to kill some guy he knew. Now for those who arent into computer games, Manhunt is a game where you basically run around and kill people in all kinds of grusome ways, the more horrible it is the more points you get, or something along those lines (I've never played it but I sure want to!). Anyways if you are a stuck up prick then yes you could say that playing these types of games could lead to angry people going out and killing people, however.... If you are of sane mind, you will see things very differently, here are my opinions on the matter..    The kid was 14, the game was rated 18.. (can ya see where I'm going with this?) First thing you think is how disgraceful that shops these days selling kids these games thats rotting their minds. I thought that too, but like you i was WRONG! The shop refused to sell the child the game.. how did the pubesant brat with a mind of a sponge get his spunk crusty hands on them???? His Parents bought it him.    Now hold up, the parents buy him a game rated 18/Adult, and they wonder how their little boy gets a disturbed mind? O.k. Then...    The reason I'm talking about this now is that i've just heard now that there aer currently talks about how all these not so nice games are going to be banned?! Say What?! Just because this 14 year old who didnt even get served with the game, his parents bought it him, played this game, and murdered someone, ALL violent games are going to be banned?!?    I've played all of these games:  Hitman (where you play the role of an assassin)  GTA (where you rob cars and kill people)  GTA3 (Same as above but in 3d and more graphic)  GTA:VC (Same as above but the story plot of the game revolves around drug smuggling)  The Quake Trilogy (monster shoot em up)  Counterstrike (Kill the Opposite Team)    Now just because ive played and in most instances completed these games for the past, oh i dunno 7 years? (yes again some of these I was underage when I played them, however..) I have never killed anyone, stolen a car, smuggled drugs, used a hooker or axed an evil monster, these games havent effected me in the slightest.    I think its sick that some fucked up kid with crap parents and a playstation can simply blame murder on the fact he played a particular game, does that mean its ok for me to do drugs cos i've seen it on telly? Or 'Fuck the Po-lice' just because I heard it on a CD? Does it make it ok to go around chasing faries just because thats what I did when I played zelda? The answer no its not, I cant believe a bull shit story like this could even be considered, its silly I hope the lad spends his life in prison and is charged with being a bint and never allowed near any form of media ever again for fear the influences given off by media will make him kill more people or some crazsy shit.    And if they do ban violent games, what will happen to all the people who want to vent their anger ina fantasy role without actually harming anyone in real life.. I.e. when i get pissed off I own some noob on CS and I feel much better, I'll tell you what'll happen, theyll buy guns and take it to the streets.. Good bye Liverpool, Hello Compton!       I've just found out that the boy in question was a drug addict in serious debt, the use of drugs caused him to not be able to perceive the difference between the game and reality.. they failed to mention however that it was simply the fact he was a crackpot looney kid who just murdered his mate for money to settle his drug debts and is using this stupid idea of the games influencing him and an escape plea, because he's such a white trash piece of shit that commited such a sickening crime that no other type of plea is ever going to work.. I hope they give him the chair.
