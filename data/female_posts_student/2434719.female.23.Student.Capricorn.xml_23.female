HE SAT BY ME TODAY. seriously, what's up with this creep. i guess now he didn't have to STARE across the room.  he stares.  not a stare where we catch glances, oops, no he STARES. not at the wall, or the teacher, or hte other students, AT ME. ME. WHY! leave me alone, i hate you staring man.   i have so much work to do, i'm getting nervous about it all... and kristin is coming up tomorrow morning (yay), but i'm so worried that i wont' get enough studying done....  sheesh. wish me luck kids!   i really like katie couric... does anyone know if she has written an autobiography or anything? i'm working on the hillary clinton one (ken feels me on this one!), and it's really good. oh and oprah was the editor of the year in AdWeekly... yay! look at all these positive female role models i have... :)  but i really do enjoy a good issue of O, if i may say so.  ha, i was watching the daily show tonight (it's um, for school, you know, journalism?)... and damn that show is funny. maybe our generation has figured something out :).   okay, this ESFJ personality has gotta get going.
