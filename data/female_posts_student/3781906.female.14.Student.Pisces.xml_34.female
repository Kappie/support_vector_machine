Maybe he's glad to see you, but are glad to see him?  A cloud comes over you. You feel like turning back.  But...  You tell yourself not to back down. You know this is where you need to be. There is a lot fo work to be done. Coffee, cream, sugar; you take a sip. Bang bang... Your head spins.   It's the pastor's wife. She's coming right towards you. Your hands clam up. A lump creeps up in the back of your throat.  Shake shake, yawn, you smile, hoping she will ignore you.  "Want to sing today?" Her only words. You freeze. Not at all what you expected. You nod in shock and she motions you to follow her. Can you really go though with it?  You wait next to the soundboard and hum softly to yourself. "Testing: 1, 2, 3!" Goosebumps cover your body. You can't believe your doing this. You want to run and hide. Your head spins in every direction and you're stomach turns.   "Don't worry!" You hear a voice tell you from behind. You look around, but nobody's there. "Shake shake." You try to losen up. You hear the voice again.   "I am here."   The voice is clear as day. You take a deep breath and continue over to the band.   You begin to sing with the pastor's wife. You try and give it your best, but nothing seems to be going well. About now your head feels like it's going to explode. The screaching of the microphones makes you feel as if you are going to die. You cringe. "Don't worry, I am here."  You hear the voice again. "What is this?" you ask yourself. You can't figure out where it is coming from. People are bustling around you, but they look as if they are in slow motion. You head stops hurting. "Don't worry, I am here."  After the practice you go into the kitchen to be alone. You look around the room frantically. "This isn't happening. Not to you." You say to yourself. You never thought it would. "Could this voice be the voice of God?" you ask yourself.   "Lord... Help me." You pray sceptically. A shiver runs down your spine. You begin to pray louder. Your voice becomes stronger and stronger with every word you speak. With your prayer, the voice becomes more clear.  You hear the voices of people arriving. "Lord, help me do your will. Help me walk in your ways!" You leave the kitchen praying quietly to yourself. It will soon be time to sing.  "God, help me give my all to you today."  You approch the microphone and grasp it firmly in your hand. An incredible peace floods over you. Tears build in your eyes. You are content. You close your eyes and smile to yourself.  "Father in heaven! Blessed is your holy name! Great is the God of Heaven and Earth."
