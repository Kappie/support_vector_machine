I am all for telling; in fact I love to share all the sordid details (well, not ALL of them) about my life!  At any rate, I'm probably going to get a restraining order on me rather soon.  Or Motion City Soundtrack and/or The Reunion Show will write a song about a stalker (me) who wouldn't leave a friend (them) alone, and she kept talking to them (email) and wouldn't shut up about meeting (matrimony) and they're going to fucking hurt her (my) pansy (weak) ass ( >) and peel the skin off her (my) face (death is imminent). Aaaaahhhhh oh well.
