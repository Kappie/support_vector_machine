It turns out that it was bobby and him and tommy were driving around Big Meadow trying to find where I lived, and said that it would just be easier if I told them. So I did, and they drop by my house, and we hang out for about 5 minutes. They couldnt come inside tho because their little brother and sister were in the car. It was funny tho, cuz Bobby was like "erica arent you gonna ask us inside?" and tommy was like "we can't, the kids are in the car...maybe next time" and so him and bobby said that they will have to come over some other time. It was very interesting! It seemed so weird for that to happen tho, but hey, I didn't mind! haha. Now for today....hmmm....this morning amanda came over and i straightened her hair. my mission for lunch is to find scott and ask him what his plans are this weekend and if he prefers pie or cake. i really want to know. haha. im weird, but hey, i know that. i have a math test that i need to study for tonight, because i need to get an A on it. well, this blog is getting kind of boring for me to type, so i'll be going!
