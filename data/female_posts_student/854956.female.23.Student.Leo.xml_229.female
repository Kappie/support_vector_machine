Honestly, I've always LOVED thunderstorms... they're comforting to me... so, I've been in Heaven... but it DOES kinda bum me out, because I wanted to try and go out to Canyon Lake next week, and I dunno if I can... given that it's been raining so much.  I dunno if it's gonna get flooded out over there.  Hopefully the forecast is correct and it won't be raining anymore after today... but Texas weather (as we all know) is very unpredictable... so, who knows what'll happen in the next few days.  Other than that, all is going well... Weather like this puts me in a cleaning mood... so I'm doing laundry and tidying up my room.  :-)  Tomorrow I have a meeting at the office at 11am w/ Henry and other training facilitators... then I also need to talk to Will, because some of the training I was going to do in August got cancelled... :-\  ARGH!  Now I'm gonna have to redo my training hours... Again.  But, I also can't take a lot of training before July 14 (my hire date)... I'm only allowed to take like, 6 hours of training... and the bulk of my training in August was cancelled... so, it sounded like I'd be out about 10-15 hours... GREAT!  I'm hoping that I can just get credit for other stuff I facilitate... that'd be nice.  I'm sure everything will work out fine...
