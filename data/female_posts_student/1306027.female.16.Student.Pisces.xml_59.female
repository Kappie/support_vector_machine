The Real Great Prom Dress Caper  It all started Thursday, January 1st, of 2004. I hopped into the car with my mom expecting to go grocery shopping. Little did I know, we were about to go dress shopping. My mom said to me "We are going to Jcpenny". "Jcpenny doesn't sell food", I replied. "Stop being a smart-alec", rebuttals my mom, "We are going to look at prom dresses". I wasn't stunned. My mom had had prom fever since May of '03.   Well, we got to Jcpennys and went straight to the dress section expecting to see formalwear and evening wear. Wrong. Jcpennys had absolutely nothing. As my mom and I walked out to the car, we thought about places that would have nice prom dresses. "Let's go to that one mall", says my mom. "O ya!", I reply, "I gotta buy Arturo's Christmas gift there anyways." So we again hop in the car and drive to that mall. Once there, we made a plan. "Ok- Hot Topic first, then we will wonder around aimlessly until we find a store with nice dresses. Sound good?", I said to my mom. "Yea sounds fine", she replys. So we went to Hot Topic to buy a gift, then we started wondering around. Finally we got the guts up to ask a salesdude where we might find a decent prom dress. "Lazarus", he says, "That is, if they haven't sold out already". I laughed inside, because it was not a very funny joke.  Once at Lazarus we made for the formals section.  On the way there, some lady stopped my mom and said, "Did you just graduate?". My mom was wearing a college themed sweat shirt. "No", said my mom. The lady talked to us for ten minutes about the college and the town it was in. She was nice so it didn't bother my mom and I. Once we were done talking to the lady, we continued on towards the formals. We we finally got there I noticed a sale sign, 30% off. But my mom and I were just "looking". Little did we know that my soon-to-be prom dress was calling to us. I searched the racks and found something very pretty in my size. I told my mom I was gonna try it on. I walked into the Lazarus dressing room, not expecting what would happen next. I put the dress on and came out to the main viewing area- the dress was so amazing! I fell in love with the dress right there. A passing lady even commented, "Wow, that is a really lovely dress", she says. I felt like a princess almost, and I never felt  that way in a dress before. My mom was iffy though. She said "You shouldn't go with the first dress you try on meg". "But mom, if this was the first dress you tryed on, wouldn't you want it too?", I pleaded with my mom.   We ended up leaving my perfect dress at the perfect price there, at Lazarus, and not in our car. My mom and I continued on to a giant bridle store. I had three crappy dresses to try on. They were plain, and plain, and crappy. I was upset over leaving my perfect dress. My mom finally pulled me out of the dressing room and said "Come on, these aren't what I expected at all." We then ventured to a fabric store to try to get a name of a seamstress. After that we headed to Taco Bell for lunch. Over lunch, my mom and I talked about the dresses. When we left taco bell, my mom was acting funny. Suddenly, while we were driving home, my mom said, "It was a really pretty dress wasn't it.". "Yes it was, mom. It's the one that I want." My mom drove into a little alcove off the side of the road and tryed to turn around. That wasn't working so we got on the highway and tryed to get off at the next exit. What really ended up happening- is we got off on one exit, then another, then we came to this road, and unintentionally went around in a big circle right back to the mall! "The dress is calling to us", I told my mom. So it was a little corny. We got back to Lazarus, and ran for the formals section. I tryed the dress on again, then took it off and gave it too my mom so she could get it to the checkout. It ended up costing only $107.35. And my mom was cool enough to pay $57.35 of it.    Everyone loves my dress and I love my dress. I totally cannot wait for prom.
