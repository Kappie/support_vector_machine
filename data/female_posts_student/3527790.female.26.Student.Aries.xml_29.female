Some times it is some whom has merely drifted away as life paths took you both in separate directions and then suddenly something brings you both back together. I had diner last night with a good friend of mine whom I haven't seem in WOW almost a year! It was great. It was like no time had past between us. The only evidence that we haven't been seeing each other or a regular basis was the pile of stories that we had to tell one another. But the trust, respect, love was still there unchanged. So nice!  Other times it is not such a great surprise. Sometimes the life paths were interrupted by an unacceptable action on one persons side. Then their guilt resurfaces and then attempt to make contact with you. Yeah you guessed it  my ex had the never to email me from Budapest where he and his "new"old girlfriend are! It left me shaking fighting back tears. Just when I thought I was beginning to beat that ghost out. Now all the feelings come flooding back and I feel like I have to start all over again. It sucks to love someone who doesn't love you.
