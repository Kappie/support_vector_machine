'cause everyone thinks they're right, and nobody thinks that there just might be more than one way to our final desination...... i'd like to think that i can go my own way and meet you in the end..."      -hoobastank       "Love is free, free is love... Love is living, living love... Love is needing to be lovedâ€¦"             john lennon  well my mom is pissed at me so i'll add more later.... MUCH LOVE!!!!
