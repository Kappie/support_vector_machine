I just came back from lunch (yummy McDonald's salad and Starbucks coffee), and there's still not much to do around here.  I found that interesting website and that killed a few minutes (although I have no idea where he came up with some of these grades).  Mostly I'm just enjoying getting paid for doing nothing- besides looking up cute doggy names for my future puppy.  So far Lola and Pepper are in the lead, but I still like Phoebe and Zoe (maybe for my future daughter, WAY future!).  I'm also pretty excited about Thursday.  It's not everyday one gets the opportunity to watch aging rockers strut their stuff on stage.  I am really stoked to see Cheap Trick perform live- and Aerosmith are in a league all their own!  I know that Vinnie is excited too, although I don't know if it's the concert or the fact that we will be driving in a car from this decade... Maybe a little of both!  So I am trying to find ways to make the day go by faster which wouldn't get me fired immediately.  If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.  There are only so many quizzes one can take before getting tired of them.  Some day I will reach that point.  Until then, I enjoy hearing that I am Meatwad.  Despite what Vinnie says, I am  not  that gullible or dumb- but the rest is pretty on the money.  For what it's worth, I think he's Carl!!!  I'll write more later when I get bored again.
