I was too naive...  To fall for your trap..  How silly I am...   No..No..  I m not another victim of love.   I am Kaili.  I am  different  from others.  I do not believe in Love.  I'm inhumane. I'm selfish.  I'm sick of self-love.  I keep all the love to myself. All was but a lie.  I'm foolish.but ure worse. DO you reali think i will really like you,you fool?   It was but a Game. A prank.  Fwahaha. I got you and everyone fooled.    I won.    +=Game Over=+
