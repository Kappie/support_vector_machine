The hypocrisy of "sex" in this country seems to know, no bounds. America, wants to be known around the world, as the country devoted to its ethical morality. And ethical morality, according to the Christian Fundamentalist who rule our great nation, is of course, attached to our sex organs. Once again, we easily brush aside the fact that our devoted leader has lied consistently through out his term, but oh no no no - he has NEVER cheated on his wife like Clinton. Who, by the way, is still being condemned. So, I guess, by American standards, Bush has not broken a single ethical rule.   Good for HIM.  Unfortunately, it would appear that nobody informed Republican Senate candidate Jack Ryan of these rules. The kinky bastard, has to pull out of the race (ha! no pun intended).   The scandal ...  urlLink sex club allegations.  Yep. You read right. Sex club allegations.    I have to agree with  urlLink vice squad  when they say,  this is quite possibly the lamest sex scandal in the history of sex scandals.  Allegedly, the guy took his wife to a few racy clubs back when they were married.   I guess he should have worked within the hypocrisy, and rented porn. Porn on TV ok. Live nude girls not.  Shame on HIM.
