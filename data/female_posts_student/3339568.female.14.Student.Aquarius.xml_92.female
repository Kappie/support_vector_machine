Not that they are really that old seeing as I've only been blogging since May, but I'm reading the blog about where Mel and I had a fight about Luke in front of everyone at small group and found out a "secret" bout me. Hehe, well it's not much of a secret now is it? It's funny, looking back on my blogs, how many things I had to conceal back then. Mmmm..sumthin 2 think 'bout.        I'm having an incredibly boring day. Mum says I have to stay home becuase I have literally done something everyday since I got back from Canberra. I really should do this stupid Science assignement. But I am the world's biggest procrastinator so I won't! Mwhahaha.        Y'know, just talking to Mel last night, sometimes I wonder, if guys will ever figure out how evil girls can be. Not in like mean bitchy ways, but in like their secretive things. Like, "you ask him this for me, and then you tell me what he said after" or "oh mi gosh, so and so just told me who he likes" Stuff like that. It's quite amusing in hindsight, and being a girl and all. But I feel sorry for the poor, clueless guys. Hehe, I s'pose girls always were the superior race, neway! Hehe, girls you all know what I'm talking bout!    Ok I sounded like Shannon Noll then. Scary. I don't like Shannon Noll that much. Matter o fact I don't like Guy Sebastian either. I just assosciate them together becuase they were on Australian Idol.        Mmm...I think I'm learning to touch type. Like not on one of those stupid computer programsat school where they try and get u to learn them. But just because I am on the compuet so often chatting to people and blogging all the time, that I just seem 2 know where all the keys are. Hmmm...that's cool. But I s'pose it's not a good sign, seeing as I'm on the computer so much I'm learning to touch type. Maybe my brain will turn to mush becuase of all the radiaton waves. Hehe...hmmm how interesting. That stupid program at school never worked on me. Becuase I cheated and looked down at the keys. Hehe..naughty bethie. But come on you can't blame me, it was deathly boring.        How cool is the new Blogger posting thing?! So many more things to do, different fonts and sizes and colours and bullet point things and left, centre and right alignments, and uploading images that doesn't work! haha. No wonder Blogger had 2 hours of down time the otha day. How amazing of them to get all this done. Nice work Blogger. Love the new layout, will have to play around with it a bit.        Hmm mi Mum is like desperate to find my blog. She is getting really pissy at my becuase I won't tell her the address and I will tell my Aunty Cathy. But I can trust Aunty Cathy. Yes I can. Hello if you are reading! Feel proud I can trust you! We had to fill out this thing in PD last year, and it said, who would be the member of your family, extended or wateva, who you would trust to tell if you were preganant at a young age. And I said you Aunty Cathy. So there. I'll be coming to you if I have a problem. :) But don't worry, because I'm not gonna be getting pregnant when I'm a teenager, becuase I'm only having sex with marriage.        Mmmm...I s'pose I better get bak to reading these archives. Might I add, why is no-one blogging. I am so bored and need contact with the outside world!!
