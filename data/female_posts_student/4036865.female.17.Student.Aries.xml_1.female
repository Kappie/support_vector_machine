There is still some things that i need to sort out, and i certainly need to find a way to de-stress and relax, but, i'm getting there.  i have this sunday off work, which is wonderful. Also, i'm going out to dinner on Saturday and i'm really excited to put on my outfit and see the whole thing come together, i absolutely love the heels i bought. Then on Monday, its back to work, which isn't so bad, i should have just $500 (perhaps just under, but im sure i can find something extra to do for that extra little boost) by mid august, and thats my deadline, so i'll be really happy to meet that. it's so incredibly hard to save, but i'm doing alright. Absolutely no one has been on msn all day, so i've been sorta bored, work will be alright thou, its only 4 hours, and i have my discman with me, i'm sure i will find something to do. This morning i took a shower and it was just amazing, perfect pressure and heat, i loved it. Anywayz, should be going to work now. :) michelle
