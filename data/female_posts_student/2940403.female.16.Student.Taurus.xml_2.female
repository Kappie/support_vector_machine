And while writing, I now realize that all these words will be read by you, so I'm afraid to say what I really feel... because I don't want you to worry about me. So this is your warning. The contents of this journal are my deepest feelings, as dark, hateful, spiteful, bitter, and angry as they may be towards the world or any person imparticular. If you take offense to anything I write, then don't read it. I don't care. I don't want your sympathies, I don't want you to feel guilt... even though some people deserve that at the very least... I am thankful for the concern that some people have expressed, but I don't want it or need it at this point... I will not harm myself in any way. I know better than that.   I did my homework tonight, not all of it of course, but most of it. Then I gave in to the screaming, spoiled, fingernails-on-a-chalkboard annoying child inside my head and had a (small) piece of cake. *shame*   It's difficult to write how I feel when what I think is even impacted by I affect other people... in a way that is a good thing, but not when I can't even have my own thoughts without feeling shame.   Today is only Tuesday and it feels like it should be Friday. I don't want to go to school anymore. It used to be something I was excited about... corny as it may sound... I hated weekends even, because that usually meant that I wouldn't see my friends for a whole two days. *sigh* That's what people do to you. Now I'm trying to think of a good simile that I could use for that... but nothing comes to mind. Maybe Salmon? Yeah... salmon... because they try so hard to get to where they know they want to be, but all the greedy poaching fishermen take all the salmon. So pretty soon, all the bears taht relied on those salmon will either die or eat the fishermen in revolt. Then the bears will be shot for eating the fishermen. And then all that's left are the fishermen with no more fish.   Maybe that wasn't the best example. I'm too tired to tell.
