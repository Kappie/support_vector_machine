And I dont like you I love you." I dont want you I need you" and I Wouldnt cry If you Walked Away I woulD die "   ....." My new Best Friend".....   Today I met a great new friend  Who knew me right away  It was funny how she understood  All I had to say   She listened To my problems  She listened to my dreams  We talked about love and life  She's been there too, it seems   I never once felt judged by her  she knew just how I felt  She seemed to just accpet me  And all the problems I'd been dealt   She didn't interrupt me  Or need to have her say  She Just listened very patiently  And didn't go away   I wanted her to understand  how much this meant to me  But as I went to hug her  Something startled me   I put my arms in front of me  And went to pull her nearer  And realize my new best friend  Was nothing but a mirror.   And I luv u more with every breath i'll be yours from now until death.  I hate u because u made me luv u but u were not here to luv me back because u were to busy luving her.  ~*~I didn't mean to hurt you, But your sexy when you cry Maybe I really loved you, HaHa!!!

Life isn't a garden...so stop being a hoe!!!    ~When a guy tells u to suck it turn around and say...its dangerous to have small objects in my mouth~    "People say that Love is giving someone the ability to destroy you, but trusting them not to. If you really love me tell me what I want to hear, but those other words are what I fear. If you really love me, would you stand by my side? Would you care for me? Be there for me? Be there when I cry? Don't tell me you love me when you have someone else on your mind. Don't tell me you want me when you have someone else by your side. I really don't wanna hear it, because you'll break my heart. Don't try to fix what is broken. Don't even start. If you didn't notice...I've been in luv with u from the start  Boys are like taxi's whenever you need them their not there, whenever you don't their everywhere!!!!!
