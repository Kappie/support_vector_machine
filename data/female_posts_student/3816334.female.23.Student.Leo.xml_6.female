I'm going home tomorrow night till thurs. night .... spending sometime with the mumma as her surgery was postponed for a while. We are planning (after I get my linsence renewed) to shop. I need to get rick a bday gift so she said she would come along to help out. She has great taste so i am excited.  I have to go to work tonight, that is always a great time (NOT). Need to talk to Steve tonight and see what is up with him. He got some news that is making him reevaluate a bit, I want to make sure he has someone neutral to talk to. Sometimes I think that he thinks the talking is only for him, but it has helped me to build more connections here and reasons that it will be ok to stay here with rick forever.   At least I have good friends and a loving boyfriend to take care of me when I am not with my family. Its more then most people have and lately I am realizing that i am extremely lucky to have love in my life. Most of the time I take it for granted but lately, and i don't really know what sparked it , but i find myself thanking God alot before I go to sleep at night. And sometime when i am with Rick I thank Him right there. Its hard to imagine going through life alone. In face I can't even. I would be lost without him and he really is my best friend. Not my soulmate but I have never believed that we are ment to be with people that complete us totally, if we were all completed no one would need eachother anymore. I need Rick and I like it that way because I know that he will always be there when i need him. I think a soulmate is a spritual best friend, the kind you spend a life time look ing for and then in the end realize you never really needed your soulmate at all. you just need to love someone and that is always enough in the end.  I have never been a big God person, but this thought just hit me: what if God (or your variation of) is the soulmate we spend a lifetime looking for? What if we miss so much in our life because we are looking and looking for someone we only get to meet in death?! I think that might be my answer to my ultimate question in life : what does God want from you. My answer might just be .... to love rick fully and unconditionally while i am here and then to accept that in my end God will be my salvation and reward for a life spent doing the easiest thing in the world, loving the one person who knows me and loves me for me,totally and completely me.  are you throwing up yet? maybe you just couldn't even stand to read the end of this post. if that is the case i am sorry my new found revalations bothered you so, but remember this, you don't have to understand it completely or accept it as your answer to anything, I just needed to write it down and get it out of my head.
