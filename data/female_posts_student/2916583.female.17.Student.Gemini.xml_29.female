I've been so busy with enjoying Spring Break that every time I think of something to write, there's something to do.  The only reason I have time now is cause I'm procrastinating (one of the best pleasures stemming from school).   So far, I've gone shopping twice, seen  Jersey Girl  (I don't care what critics say, I loved it), been swimming and jacuzzi hopping twice, went to Chuck E. Cheese's (don't laugh, I had to take my sister and Kayla there...at least that's what YOU think), and designed several houses and community spots courtesy of The Sims.  It's funny what makes you cry.  Not a drop during  The Passion of the Christ  (and the toughest person I know cried during the movie), but  Jersey Girl  and  Tarzan  made me bawl.  Oh well.  Tomorrow, we're going to Maymont and to the pool/jacuzzi.  That's the beauty of coupons. I think I found a new favorite shampoo/conditioner.  There's this stuff called Tres Semme Hydrology that gave me really shiny hair, no easy feat.  And I need all the conditioning I can get...I rehilighted my hair.  It's a bit lighter, but it sometimes looks dirty in the wrong light from all the streaks. I can't seem to figure out why, but my hand's bruised on the right side of my right hand.  It's swollen too.  Maybe I'm a hemophiliac, and I need to suck my blood.  I once knew a girl who did that, but her sister would do it too, and she was normal.  One of the weirdest people I knew.  Andy and Vicky R. take the cake though.  She would throw fits, allow her little brother to run around in his underwear during a blizzard, and had a weird fascination with our pool.  He would hide and cry during thunderstorms, had an odd fixation with Egyptian culture/artifacts, and had a crush on me.  Odd. Before I go to sleep, I really need to finish these notes.  Or maybe I should finish in the morning...I'm kinda tired.  Actually, I just want to make Lexia fall for Bruno...sounds like Russian soaps.  At any rate, I g2g.  Later.  Lack of motivation has made me lazy, so just read Dave Barry for a joke: http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/
