But I would be less happy without them, so I am thankful.   Seussical was wonderful. I teared up during the "A person's a person no matter how small" song. That Jojo and Horton - I tell you. Okay, and don't kill me, but I could so see Kenda playing Gertrude the bird or the Mayor of Whoville's wife. Kenda, why aren't you on Broadway? Let's go together. You and I. Let's tour London and be a part of the Seussical cast. I'll be Horton. He's so fun.
