When a girl says she's sad, but she isn't  crying,it means she's crying in her heart.   2. When she ignores you after you've done  something wrong,it's best to give her some time  to cool down before touching her heart with an  apology.   3. A girl can't find anything to hate about the  guy she loves (which is why it is so hard for  her to 'get over him' after the relationship's  over.)   4.

Music, poetry,drawings and writing are ways of  expressing themselves(which explains why most  girls like writing journals).   11. Never tell a girl that she is useless in  any way.   12. Being too serious can turn a girl off.   13. When the guy she likes calls her for the  first time, the girl may act uninterested during  the call. But as soon as the phone is back on  the hook, she will whoop with joy and  immediately  start telephoning her friends to spread the  news.   14. A smile means a lot to a girl.   15. If you like a girl, try making friends with  her first.Let her get to know you.   16. If a girl says she can't go out with you  because she has to study, leave.   17.
