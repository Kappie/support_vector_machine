But we are flying through Dallas, ooh the memories, I'll be so close to TK I may just run from the airport to that ghetto Super 6. We'll see each other, and we'll both just feel it, that instant Indian connection of love. In two days time our families will have set up a wedding, and I'll finally get some henna. We will not speak to one another until our wedding night where we will make passionate, kinky, hardcore porn sex all night long. Then we will have 35 kids and reside in a hut outside of Dallas. It's so beautiful. Are you crying yet? My trip was boring. I got to go visit Drexel by myself. There I met this girl who was also alone and followed me around telling me how her father cannot handle her doing anything by herself. She stopped the tour to have pictures taken of everything. So obnoxious. I almost got off the train in NYC... my homeland, except for India. Went to the Rhode Island Zoo and to my favorite place in the world, Watch Hill, which was gorgeous. Then I got in my first fight with my dad, over the size of his coffee. Yeah, don't want to talk about it. My plane to Cincinnati was horrible. The turbulence was so bad, I thought I was going to die and I was really scared. Nobody on the plane seemed to fear anything, and I just wanted to shout, "Don't you people get it! This plane is going to crash and we are all going to DIE!" Good thing I didn't, or I would have been electrocuted and killed right on the spot, just because I'm brown. Then on the next plane this woman talked the entire time. I didn't know if I could put on my headphones, if that would be rude, so I didn't. This boy in front of me was reading Harry Potter, and I really wanted to know where he was at in the book! I kept looking over, and this is so gross, he was chewing gum, but he would pull it out and twist it around his two fingers. YUCK. Happy Birthday, Ann... sorry you are not feeling well. Well ladies and gents, tomorrow I become a California beach bum, NOT. I will always be a hardcore bitch from the East Coast (okay, I will be one day) and I probably will be stoned in California and the Klan will grab me and dye my hair blonde. Hope it looks good!
