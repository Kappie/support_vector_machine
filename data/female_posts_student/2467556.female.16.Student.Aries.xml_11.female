I saw Brittany Dearest on KCBY today!!!!!!  If you see her or have her s/n, say congrats to her today!  She was absolutely brilliant, oscar winning performance.  4th period was pretty cool because we did yoga and i was extremely relaxed.  I was almost falling asleep in 5th period.  Now i love my 5th period class, BCIS I, because Mr. Phillips is soooo funny.  We call him "Phil" for short even though he always tells us to call him Mr. Phillips.  And we all made him laugh today, i haven't EVER seen him laugh.  He doesn't have a girlfriend, its so sad! Me and Kate (my buddy in BCIS) have decided to try and set him up.  See, he's kinda a computer nerd.....but he's so nice! We were daring each other to ask him if he goes clubbing today, but we decided against it.....we'll do it tomorrow.   2 MORE DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS BREAK!!!! Oh yeah, and the Stars play Vancouver tonight........pray they win! and i get to go to the game! yaaay! They've been playing better, so maybe we have a chance.  I mean, we beat the defending cup champions, New Jersey, 2-0 and everyone thought they were going to kill us.  We snapped their 13 game unbeaten streak right there.  So maybe we'll do the same thing here.  Allison told me today that me and Brittany are freaking crazy for driving all the way to Duncanville to see a hockey game.  She said she would go but she has to babysit.  i told her we're hardcore, lol.  We're not insane, we just like hockey....ALOT.  and we'd drive anywhere to see it for the cheap price of $3.  Coppell Hockey is pretty good hockey and you don't have to pay tons of money to see them AND they always win, sometimes tie.  Unlike the Stars where you have to pay tons of money to see them play and this season, you pay only to see them lose.  Actually.....i pay to go see Niko......but thats not the point.  My plans for New Years' Eve in case you're wondering, partying it down with Brittany at her house while watching the hockey game, eating and hanging out.  I wonder if we get champagne.....Brittany- can we hook that up?? lol.   Ok i'm hungry, tired and i have hw to do before the stars game.....ttyl!  Go Stars!, Niko Rocks,  ~~~Taylor~~~  P.S. - To the Nikettes 02-03 (Sarah, Liz, Jess, and Me): we need to have a Nikettes reunion tour soon.....party down at all the the Nikettes' houses all xmas break or spring break or whatever and then go to Masengill's house (when we figure out how to get there, lol).  Jess still needs a shirt from Spring Break '03 with Sarah, Liz and Me (Jess there in spirit).  Much love to my Nikettes, the Brittanys and everyone else!
