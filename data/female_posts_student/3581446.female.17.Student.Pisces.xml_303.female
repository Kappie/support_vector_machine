He is an affectionate father to his 7 adopted children. He is a murderer. He is a cabaret star. He is...a homo.  Well, since the gay topic came up in a few of my conversations today, I would like to say...  They're here and they're queer and I love 'em. One love, y'all.   [/two cents]  I miss Robert. He was the coolest. Sometimes, I miss Joe too.
