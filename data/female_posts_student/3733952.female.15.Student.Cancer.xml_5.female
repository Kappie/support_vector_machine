We won because the other team had to forfeit. It was a fun game though. Then I had to go home and pack for the weekend. And then I left for Chantal's house.   I went to Chantal's house to drop of my stuff because I stayed with her the whole weekend. Then we went to a surprise party for my friend Isabel. She's moving to California! Where it's always hot! It's so not fair. But we're all gonna miss her very VERY much. The party was a lot of fun. I got to see some friends that I hadn't seen all summer. There was a water balloon fight, some people swam in the nasty pond. It was great. We went for a couple of walks too. And those of you there know what made my day on that second walk. Hi Jack! *waves* Feisty!Livi came out and tried to kill Christina with a water gun. That was SO funny, and you know it, Christina. And Mit, please take my mother's advice and BE NICE. Then at the end of the party, we just all sat and talked. Some of them stripped, but that's another story and shall be told another time. Then when I left, my day was againmade. Hi Jack! *waves* That was such a fun party. We're all gonna miss you, Isabel!   Saturday morning I got out of bed at like 6. I took a shower, blah blah blah. Then Chantal's mom drove me and Chantal's siblings, Pete and Kate, to our high school. Today's the parade! Yay! We got there like right when we had to board the buses. And I couldn't find my marching shoes! So I was like the last one to board my bus. I didn't know which bus Jack and Mit were on, so I just got on the closest one to me, and luckily they were on it. I sat across from them. I sat with this girl whose friend was behind her. They were making up these hilarious songs which I will NOT repeat. And for breakfast I had flavored cardboard. After a couple hours we got to Peru, the Circus City. We did our warms ups and stuff. Then we had a while to just talk and whatever. There were all these circus animals. Jack wouldn't let me pet the tiger. He said it would bite my hand off. I got to pet the asses though. Mit said they looked like my mother. He is SO mean sometimes. I tell ya.. So, then we marched in the parade. It was cool. After the parade, we got to walk around the midway for a while. Then we went to the circus. It had a bunch of kids in it. It was so cool to watch them do everything. They did like everything. It was amazing. After that, we got back on the bus to go home. On the ride back, I sat next to Jack, and Mit sat next to those girls that I sat next to. I dropped my bottle cap underneath Mit's seat. That started EVERYTHING. I was so bored; I had to do something to entertain me. First I poured water on Mit's head when he was sleeping. Then I asked him for my bottle cap back. He wouldn't give it back, so we made this big deal about it. It was so funny. I tried to act all sad and all, like I really wanted the thing back. I'd say that I'm a pretty good actress. No matter how hard I wanted to laugh, I kept my sad face. But it was so funny! We were fighting over a bottle cap. A  bottle cap.  In the end Mit madea compromise with Jack and I got my bottle cap back. Thanks Jack! You're the greatest. And oh man. I had to go to the bathroom SO BAD. And the driver kept driving on the shoulder of the road, where its all bumpy. It was horrible. Then we got back to the school and I ran to the bathroom. THE GIRLS' DOOR WAS LOCKED. I like panicked. Then a bunch of us girls ran into the guys bathroom. The whole day was rather funny. Had-to-be-there moments. Tomorrow (Monday) starts band camp. Yay!!! (that was sarcasm) Then I went to the lake with Chantal's family. They have a cottage right by ours. I went to babysit these kids with Chantal. It was great fun. The kids happened to be her ex's siblings. After the kids went to bed, we got tired and fell asleep in Chantal's ex's bed. It was quite funny. And no, he wasn't there. I was so tired. I had all these strange dreams, but of course, I'm known for my strange dreams.   Sunday was fun too. We got up and went to church like good little Catholics. Then we came back and went skiing. We had four people up on the skis at the same time. It was me, Chantal, Kate, and Pete. We all got up on the first try and we all stayed on until we decided to all let go. It was SO awesome!!! Pete was next to me and he kept spraying me with he ski. And every time we turned a corner, Chantal got whipped out of the wake, but she stayed on just fine. We are all such good skiers. Kudos, kudos.   Now I get to read this stupid book for school. I really don't wanna read it. But I have to. Oh well. And I have to get up early, so I better stop typing and get on with my life.   Bye!
