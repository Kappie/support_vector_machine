(  i won't say FOREVER, because for some weird reason that fucking word has an expiration date  )      "between being with someone for the wrong reasons and being with someone for the right reasons, i'd rather be right"                            -Amanda Jones, Some Kind Of Wonderful                   Simple Kind Of Life by No Doubt        For a long time I was in love        Not only in love, I was obsessed        With a friendship that no one else could touch        It didn't work out, I'm covered in shells        And all I wanted was the simple things        A simple kind of life        And all I needed was a simple man        So I could be a wife                 I'm so ashamed, I've been so mean        I don't know how it got to this point        I always was the one with all the love        You came along, I'm hunting you down                 Like a sick domestic abuser looking for a fight        And all I wanted was the simple things        A simple kind of life           If we met tomorrow for the very first time        Would it start all over again?        Would I try to make you mine?                  I always thought I'd be a mom        Sometimes I wish for a mistake        The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get        You seem like you'd be a good dad           Now all those simple things are simply too complicated for my life        How'd I get so faithful to my freedom?        A selfish kind of life        When all I ever wanted was the simple things        A simple kind of life
