I treat my readers well.  So babysitting went ok last night.  We watched Haunted Mansion which scared the bejesus out of me.  HEY YOU! Stop laughing.  Seriously, it was scary.  Then after the kids went to bed I read a little and then watched "Monk."  It's a show about a defective detective with OCD except because of his OCD he is able to solve all these cases because of his close attention to detail.  I recommend it to any of you late-night TV watchers, good times.  My Nana is here.  She slept over last night and this morning she went to church with my parents.  She usually comes over every other weekend to hang out.  If Grandmothers do indeed "hang out," which mine does.  She's full of great stories about WWII (which she was a nurse in) and the Depression (which she grew up in).  I remember when I had my Gone With the Wind faze in 7th grade, she told me about going on a date to see that movie when it was first released (in 1939)!  She even had a little program they used to pass out for the big movies.  The 30's and 40's seemed like such a romantic time didn't it?  I read the biographies of Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, and the times sound so romantic.  Even when there was drug problems and failed marriages you thought "Gee if I had to have a drug problem and a failed marriage, by golly I think I'd want it in the 30's or 40's"...  OK you're right, not really.  But the other aspects of it, the fashion and the manners (who wouldn't mind being helped out of car)that sounded wonderful. Not about the 50's... and blahedy blah blah....Why don't yall say something when I start to wander?   Oh I'm so excited about "The Notebook" coming out.  As yall have probably figured out I like a good romantic story, but it has to be  good .  I hate those romance novels that follow the same exact formula each time. (My friend Kathryn was reading from quite a steamy romance novel in the tent the other night.  It was quite funny because she skipped ahead to "good" part and she had quite an audience, including me.)  I thing I really dislike about those books is that the girl usually has no backbone and just follows whatever the guy says.  Or sometimes the girl's wild and he "tames" her...What are we women, horses?!   As long as the story has a strong female character, that can stand up for herself, I'll enjoy it, hence my fascination with Gone With the Wind.  I read this book called Outlander and it drove me crazy because the husband, (the good guy, the romantic interest) actually beat his wife, and at first she was mad and then she forgave him!  WHAT?!  There's no forgiving and then getting on with the love story.  There is no love story!  I had to reread it 17 times to believe it, and it actually ruined my day.  Hmmm... My coffee's almost cold and I have a bit of a headache from not eating any breakfast.  We have nothing good in my house though so you can understand my dilemma.  You can't have fruit with coffee and I'm not a cereal person.  I could have eggs but I always make them runny.  Last night I was kind of sad because I was thinking about how my childhood is pretty much over. Next year I'll be going away to college, I'm not old enough to be on my own!  I just figured out how to put gas in my car, I don't know anything about mortgage payments or HMO's or doctor visits or money management or...Anything.  The only thing that makes me feel a little better is that luckily, I'm not the only teenager in the world who has to face this stuff, and hopefully I'm not alone in my apprehension for the real world.     Wow I just reread this entry, how many times can I randomly switch subjects?  A lot apparently.  But now I must go in search of food and shower.  Hi ho Silver!
