At a recent fundraiser to raise money for presidential candidate John Kerry and his vice president, John Edwards, Whoopi made "a lewd riff on President Bush." These comments that she made with a wine glass in hand has gotten her cut from starring in the commercials any longer. The New York Post describes her comment as "Waving a bottle of wine, she fired off a stream of vulgar sexual wordplays on Bush's name in a riff about female genitalia." Her comments offended guests at the prestigous event. The General Manager of the Slim Fast company says, "Ads featuring Ms. Goldberg will no longer be on the air." The Slim-Fast company is being a gatekeeper now, so as to keep out Whoopi's negative comments by cutting her as the star of the commercials. She is getting punished for her lack of thought and the embarrassment she has caused the Slim-Fast company.
