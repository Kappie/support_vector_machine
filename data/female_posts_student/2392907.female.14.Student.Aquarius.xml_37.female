"I guess," says Janey with a smug feeling inside. "I'll pick you up at 7-30 tonight then?" "Tonight?" "Are you busy?" "Well, no, but.." "Me neither," says Ryan. Janey laughs. "Alright then, tonight it is. Do you even know where I live?" "No. Are you gonna tell me?" Janey laughs again and tells him her address. "Really? I just live down the road!" "Seriously?" "Yeah! This is amazing! Wow!" "What number do you live at then?" "46." "Weird.." "I know! And you live at number 25!" "Hehe, listen, I've got to go now." "Alright, remember, 7-30!" Janey departs from Starbucks feeling happy.
