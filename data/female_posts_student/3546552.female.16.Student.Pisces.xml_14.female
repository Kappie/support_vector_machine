I just realized how much I don't know about what's goin on once we get there, how much money this is really going to cost, and I'm not done packing. Most of all however, I think that I am going to miss my friends and family. Esp...my mom, my Grandpa, and...ahem...others (cough m.r. cough) hehe. I will however, try to write on this website to update you guys on what's going on with me. You can also feel free to write me a "comment" which you can use just like an e-mail to tell me how  you  are! Otherwise I hope you all keep enjoying your summers and I will talk to you when I get back!  Off to the beach now Bye.
