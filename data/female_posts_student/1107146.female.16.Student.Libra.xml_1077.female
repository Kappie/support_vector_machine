While you guys are improving I'll be playing piano in the sevice then flying down to mellow mushrooms for dinner then to the Sportsplex so I can break some bones on the ice....kidding....Kinda. Anyway, yes the Curran thing was fun and I would do it again after the AP exam. Also Riley hasn't called yet to tell my parents what an awful student I am.....hopefully he won't. Gifted is going well as long as I don't fail the verbal part. That's my life in a nutshell. Bye!
