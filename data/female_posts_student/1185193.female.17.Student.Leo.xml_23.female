So, I had to get more bloodwork done to get the specifics of what exactly is wrong with my thyroid.  Results come in 10 days.    This is almost a relief that they found this problem because that explains a lot about my illness.  That the reason for my illness is my thyroid.  I am happy because it is like this is a simple answer to a once complex problem.  Hooray!  The only thing that worries me a little is what if it is thyroid cancer?  But my white blood cell count was normal...so that couldn't be it, right?  My Grandma Judy (the one in Grass Valley) took thyroid meds was she was younger, and my Grandma Charlotte (the one at church every Sunday) takes meds for that now.  Grandma Judy's hair turned gray when she was in her early twenties because of her thyroid, so all her life  she dyed her hair.  So I will definetly be taking some kind of a medication to regulate my thyroid after we get these next results back.  These current tests are just to pinpoint the specifics.
