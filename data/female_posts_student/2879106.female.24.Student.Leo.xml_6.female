I am so out of shape and I remember serving being tiring but hell I don't remember the pain I am in now. I have to say that I was having nightmares about going back but really other than the pain in my legs and feet, the night wasn't all that bad. Now tomorrow may be another story. It is now 12:16am and I have to be up at 6:00am to be at American General at 8:00am. URGHHH Then when I leave AGI I have to be back at Lonestar by five. URGHHHH Oh well I really need the money.   One quick thing about Alek. He wrote me today and said that he will write me back tomorrow with his decision about our relationship. I hope everything in his letter is what I want. I guess though I should know what I want before I say that. I will keep you updated as to what happens with that. Love you bunches and bunches Royale
