Well I sort of did some of my assignment on Monday - but not very successfully, and then went and helped Debs paint the walls on her stairs and landing. Great fun - even if I did whinge about having to sand down the paint work first!  Sorry Debs!  Came back and worked unsuccessfully again. You see this is why I don't understand how Melanie can just sit down and write an essay in 1 day.  Like sometimes my brain just doesn't work. So on the first day i wrote 2000 words, but then I only wrote another 500 words during the next 2 sessions.  Am hoping to finish it off on Thursday/Friday though - so please pray that it isn't a day when my brain decides not to function.  Had fun time last night making cards and wrapping paper.  Am such a perfectionist though - it takes me about 1 hour to make 1 card!!  My borther's fiancee has just asked me to help her make the wedding invitations for their wedding which is realy exciting.  We are going to go to this huge craft store and get all the stuff. But even though the wedding isn't until next year, considering it takes me 1 hour per card I guess I ought to start soon!  Had interesting lectures (well don't know if I can call them lectures when there are only 5 people in my class!) today. First one was about how  community health development interacts with other approaches to health promotion and also how do we effectively evaluation community health development - as it is not like your typical medical intervention.  Second one was about the principles and limits of individual behaviour change.  I got really frustrated in this class, because whilst I'm not totally against individual behaviour change I do feel really strongly that often it is used inappropriately.  There is so much focus on changing the 'unhealthy' behaviour and never considering why that person is using that behaviour in the first place.  So say a single mum with 3 kids who lives in a high rise block of flats and has to hold down 2 jobs to make ends meet - a cigarette might be her only relief, the only thing that enables her to cope. Now I'm not advocating smoking, but I believe we should be looking at why she is smoking - helping her with childcare, of economic problems, and such things.  We were disucssing this example of a guy taking drugs today and how could we best approach encouraging him to change his behaviour and stop taking drugs.  The protocol and models say that we should ensure he has the motivation to change, the awareness that what he is doing is unhealthy, and has weighed up the benefits versus the costs. There is no mention about considering why he feels the need to use drugs.  And also I believe that even if he does manage to come off drugs, there will be further work required because probably issues will then arise that the drugs were covering.  It constantly feels like we are trying to change the behaviour and 'patch them up'.  We need to meet targets - reduce the numbers of people smoking, reduce the number of suicides, reduce the number of heartattacks, and so that's what we focus on - instead of actually helping someone to fulfill their potential, to be the person they could be.  We blame the individual and never consider external factors. Like I know I want to change, I know I need to change, I know the benefits of changing outweigh the costs, I have support to change, but there is more to it than that.  If my behaviour is a coping-mechanism, a way of surviving this world, you can't just cut out the behaviour without considering why the behaviour is required and trying to find ways of meeting those needs in other ways. It makes me SO angry.  Sorry for the rant....it drives me mad....a bit like The Mission film!
