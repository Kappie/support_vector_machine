It's like 80s death metal on depressants and tone-deaf pills. Give me my Metallica and Limp Bizkit, and leave the werahkjberbfj music at home.  Note:  that's not actually the name of any Russian music because, of course, the name would use the Cyrillic (aka Satan's) alphabet. Russian in our alphabet involves a lot of consonants and spit. :)  This weekend I'm off to North Carolina for Pop Pop Bill's 90th birthday. Sheesh...90 years old. I can't imagine.  Bruce and I celebrated our 2nd anniversary yesterday. I gave him a straight-girl-eye for the straight guy make over (I cleaned and organized his apartment...or as he says "anal-retentive-girl-afied it), and he took me out for a very posh dinner at The Melting Pot. It was a lovely but exhausting day.  I know my blogs lately have been even less interesting than usual. It's not that I've been busy exactly. Just playing an excessive amount of video games. :) At some point there will be the following:  1) pictures from the cruise 2) pictures and a review for Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban 3) a new blog for my trip to Russia  Until then just visit the regular  urlLink site . And send me comments! I feel so ignored! :(
