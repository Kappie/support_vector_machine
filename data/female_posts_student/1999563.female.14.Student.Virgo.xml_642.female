See, my brother didn't want to clean this week so I have to do the whole house. Double the cash, but double the work. It's a win loose situation. Usually I have to do 2 hours of work but now I am going to be cleaning all afternoon! Oh well. Now I  will have enough money for my worldview camp in 2 weeks.  Yay! I wonder if I have to buy anything at CYT camp..I doubt it but I will bring a little bit of money just in case.   I am quite excited. I hope good people come. Some people at CYT don't like me very much so we will see how it goes.   I wont get to blog for 5 days, but it will be quite worth it! We have a performance at the end of the week which should be quite interesting. it's "Footloose" woohoo! It's a play about this guy who moves to this town where you can't dance. Hahahha. Typical musical plot.  Musicals are so weird. I wish life was like a musical where people would just start dancing and singing in unison, it would make life so much easier.
