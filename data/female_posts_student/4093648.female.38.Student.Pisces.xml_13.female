After the 23rd I have to be responsible again.  Not that I completely avoided neglecting my schoolwork this summer.  Good habits starting immediately this term!      I've been isolating sort of in general.  That has to stop too.  I have felt too screwed up to be around people.  The only way to fix it though is to get out there and make some new connections though.  I've I'm a downer to be around people will just choose not to be around me.  That won't hurt my feelings.      I've been using the need to get my house and my papers etc. in order before school as an excuse to not go anywhere.  Am I chicken?  Do I feel guilty making connections outside of my family.  Part of the reason I avoid dating is that I don't want to get stuck with someone being around all the time interfering with my new found freedom.  And I know if someone gets attached to me I will spend time with him even though I don't want to so as not to hurt his feelings.  I would like to get out and socialize but I really don't want someone who's going to be calling all the time.  It's time to work on me for a while.      Maybe I'm writing all the time because I'm not done.  I haven't sorted everything out yet and I still have work to do.  But all work and no play...
