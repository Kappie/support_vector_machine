Amazingly, Keller won 20-14 in overtime. Hey, is it possible that we might have a good team this year? I'm not quite sure yet...Well, again, I'm extremely bored. I wanna do something fun tonight. I skipped 1st and 2nd period today to sleep...and because I had a ton of homework due 2nd period that I wasn't even gonna try to do. So I am in party-mode tonight, kids!  Oh yea...I had a weird dream last night...it made me puzzled. If you want to know about it, I'd be glad to tell you. It was good, and then there was conflict, but what's odd...there was a resolution. A happy ending...how odd. I think I understand the moral, but it's only causing me more confusion. I think that it's a product of my lonliness. I feel kinda pushed away...not that I blame anyone for pushing me away. I don't deserve to have anyone close to me.
