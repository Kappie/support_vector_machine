Yes i did meet nathan foley FROM  Hi5  - how can u guys not know him or not think he's famous...I was screaming and jumping when i realised it was him....BTW, Tina i live in the bush that is right next to a major city known as Liverpool....so you may call my humble suburb "The Bush near the city"  Mel - how did u know i would like that guy from King Arthur - that's spooky!  As soon as i watched Rove i was going all crazy all around my living room... coz Lancealot was sooooooo cute!!!!!!!!! I wanted to kiss him... You know this morining he was on the "today" show!!! where he was even cuter coz he was being serious about the movie - and he was sooooo humble...i'm gonna marry him some day!  i'm also in love with Josh Groban - he's so cute and has a delightful voice!  Nat ur spooky too!!! How did u know i held the matchstick too long! I know never to play with fire again but only fire that resides in the hearts of my many male lovers!!!!  BTW, Thanks guys for all ur support - because of ur love, my finger is actually getting better!!!  heheheh - sorry i laugh every time i hear or think of the word  anal  - hehe there i go again...please no one use that word near me from now on - i'll die of giggles  Nat what was dissappointing about Kill Bill? A lot of people said it was good - personally i don't think i'd like the movie no matter how good it was... coz Quintin is so proud and seems so up himself   Mary, i knew about the tess thingy - but i didn't know which episode it was and when it was airing - so i missed it :(  Mary do u know about the movie "the Grudge"? It's got one of my babies and one of ur babies in it!!!  Mel, ur so lucky, u better bring me back some snow!!!!   GO the bluessssss - we're sooooo gonna win!!!
