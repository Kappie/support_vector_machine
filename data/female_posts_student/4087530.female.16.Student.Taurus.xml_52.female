"My father died six months ago. Since he and mother were divorced, we thus had our problems. I haven´t seen him as often as I should have, but you know the habit: You think, you have all the world´s time to iron things out. But there is always something more important to do and you postpone the call on next week. Then a letter of the advocate arrives and suddenly it is too late. You cannot do anything anymore, everything that should have been said, remains unsaid. Forever.  My father was pastor in a village near Cornwall. He was very popular, had time for everyone...except for his son.  I don´t know why, but recently I started to dream of a house, incredibly lively dreams. [image of Rebecca Trevisard, another main character] At the same time I had other dreams which were realistic as well, but not as sinister. On the contrary. I knew that I haven´t met her before, but that she existed nevertheless.... somewhere.  Then I was visited by this priest. He was counted among those people my father never liked but who he distrusted. I even intended to shut the door before his nose, but something kept me away from doing so. He said, his name was Elias Camber. He and my father would have met on a congress some years ago and corresponded  since then in a loose way. He told me that father´s letters would have sounded very worringly. He would have found out something about a strange house at the outskirts. Something dreadful. Then the letters would have stayed away, but one week before father´s death he would have received a parcel with a note, in which he asked Camber to implicitly hand it out to me.  Almost everthing Camber had told me was lied. There was no priest with his name in Cornwall. I surveyed that. For some time, I just ignored the whole matter, presumably I also didn´t want to deal with it.  But the dreams became more and more worse.  Finally I opened the parcel after all two days ago. It contained the fragments of some rune stones, some pieces were missing. I searched every imaginable book for it, but I couldn´t find out the identity of those things. I only know that they have a certain aura.  [image of the house and its closer surroundings] Well, here it is, the house Camber told me about. The house of my nightmares. Something has piloted me here, I just don´t know what. Or why."
