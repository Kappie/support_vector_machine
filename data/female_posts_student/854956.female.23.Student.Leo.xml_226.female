The people who are running it this year... well, they put it off til the last minute and it shows... big time!  The music program is pretty bad... the whole program is pretty bad.  They have ALL age groups doing music at once.  That is impossible to do... and I know, because I've worked with kids forever... you have to do things in different age groups... the little kids don't learn at the same rate as the 4-5th graders... ya know?  Oy... tomorrow I have training stuff... so that should be interesting...  Okay... back to talking with Melissa...
