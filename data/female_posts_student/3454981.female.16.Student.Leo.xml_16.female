Sometimes I think I have seperation anxiety.Though I guess everyone does to a certain extent. But I will miss him, ever so much. I apologize  for being very vague, but I'm *still* afraid of someone I know finding this and laughing at me. i'll just miss him a lot...    again, I   am having another pity party! i really need to stop this...         I've written 8 songs in the past few days. Even with harmonizing vocals  guitar parts. Saddness is my #1 muse...I just wish happiness could be my '#1 muse' instead.         Song of the day: Such Great Heights by The Postal Service       +great song. gotta love it. if you've never heard it then you should! So click on the title and go to their site and download a song of theirs. or go   urlLink  here    and watch their music video.      ♪neutiquam erro♪    (i think this is latin for 'i am not lost' but I have been neglecting my studies for a while...eeks!)
