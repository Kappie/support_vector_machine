Phone update for the morning:  my phone is STILL kicking ass :)   Cameron update for the morning:  I dunno, haven't really talked to him yet.   God update for the morning:  God is being nice today, this I appreciate. :)  Thank you, God :D  I'm so annoyed that  Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle  isn't playing anywhere near me!!! It's so upsetting that I'm going to have to go into New York to see a movie. >:o  So frustrating, :P  In other news, there is no news, too early.
