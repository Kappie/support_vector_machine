As you can tell that's really bothering me so whoever it is please tell me!    In Algebra I had the hardest time trying to convince one of the smelly kids I was a junior and that being a junior I would graduate in 2005 but he didn't believe the shirt I was wearing that said "junior girls-2005" on it and thought I was a sophomore.  Once I had him convinced I was in fact a junior he was determined to think I graduated in 2006.  Do you see what I put up with?  In Lit and Comp we watched a movie...well they did, I did Algebra homework.  In Hell today some kids presented thier projects...nap time.  Anna and I finished our project in lunch, which should be more entertaining than the kids that went today.  In Chem we reviewed and in Physics she reviewed with us except I did my Chem homework.  Then in Newspaper I did...nada.    Tonight, I went to Lewis to buy graduation cards because yes...I put it off.  Logan proved to be hardest to buy for.  But I was satisfied with my purchases.  Then I met Lizzie at Century where we went to see Mean Girls.  That was a nice movie.  A bit unrealistic but nice nonetheless.  Then we went to Coldstone.  After waiting 30 minutes in line we finally got our ice cream.  Lexi waited on me.  Hi, Lexi!  Loved the ice cream, although I still couldn't finish the like it.  Lizzie and I saw Mrs. Leistra there.  It is weird to see your teacher outside of school.  I guess one just half expects them to live there.  Can't you just seem them rolling out a cot from the closet and cuddling up to their corrected tests?  haha, that's a funny thought.    It's raining outside.  I like it when it's raining and I'm laying in bed and I can hear it.  I like the sound, it's just soothing.    Night ~Kayla
