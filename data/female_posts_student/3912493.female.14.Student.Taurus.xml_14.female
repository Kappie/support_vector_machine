She was telling me all these reasons, but I wasn't really paying attention, just nodding and saying, "OK." Maybe we wouldn't have talked about all of this if she knew that there were some chances that I wouldn't be in band anymore. Holy crap, if I told her that, she'd probably give me some kind of lecture about not doing so or asking me why. Oh well, who cares. XP The day that I get out of band will be the best day ever. Maybe some Smirnoff to celebrate. ;P  I've been getting a lot of crappy fuggin' forwards lately. Oh my goddess... how much I loathe them! Stupid moronic and idiotic e-mails that just fill up my inbox with useless crap. I wonder if the people who send them really believe in those things, or if they just do it to annoy people. I mean, who's gonna believe that stupid forward can actually bring you good luck and/or it can make your crush fall crazily in love with you? That's just insane. I got a forward entitled, "I'm not superstitious, but w/e," and it said that Dr. Seuss's hat had visited you, make a wish, and, I quote, "Send this to 10 people within the hour you  read this. If you do, your wish will come true. If you don't it will become the opposite." Yeah right. Well, if you're not superstitious, then why the heck send this forward?! Wasting my precious time. ¬¬  They also give lame examples. I remember I got one that said that the chain letter had been going since the 1950s. Yeah right. The internet didn't even exist back then, so how the heck did they send those stupid forwards? I mean, did a geeky person sat down on a desk and wrote that mail a bunch of times to send it to people and annoy them to death? I wouldn't do that. Not to mention that they give the same examples  every fuggin' time!  To close this entry, I'll leave you with an idiotic example. Curse you all chain mailers! >_   "CASE 2:  Take Katie Robinson ...  She received this poem and being the believer that  she was, she sent it to a few of her friends but didn't have enough e-mail addresses to send out the full 10 that you must. Three days later, Katie went to a masquerade ball. Later that night when she left to get to her car to go home, she was killed on the spot by a hit-and-run drunk driver."
