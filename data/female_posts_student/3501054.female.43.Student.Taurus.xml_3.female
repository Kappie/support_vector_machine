(1400 BC to 300 AD) Copan Ruinas, Honduras is the Easternmost outpost of Mayan culture. It was an important religious center during Preclassic (1400 BC) thru Post Classic (1000 AD)phases. The current research is to determine the reasons for decline of the civilization and to determine as much as we can about the people who lived there.  The schools that are doing ongoing research at the site are Harvard University, Penn State and the University of Houston.  I am currently working onsite with my professor, Dr. Rebecca Storey, Gina (Graduate student, UH) and Molly (Graduate Student, Harvard)
