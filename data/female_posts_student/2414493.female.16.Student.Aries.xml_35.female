Three days a year, I put on the suit and the makeup and do the hair and try to transform into the kind of dynamic individual that makes the judges smile and the teammates cheer. Today was to be one of those days, and now as I sit here munching on surprisingly good cookies I wonder how effective I was.  According to the debriefing the coaches gave us, we're fighting for our lives to stay in finals. Buena, La Reina, Camarillo and TO are all competent teams, and only four can compete again Thursday. I just know that we can't afford to be that one team that works our butts off but doesn't make it past round 4. I just won't let it happen because I know I've put a lot in emotionally and physically and it just negates everything I do if we can't even make it to FINALS. I just don't want to be standing there tomorrow night holding hands and dying from suspense because "Westlake" happens to be the last team alphabetically and then finding out that we didn't make it. So there's Buena, Camarillo, La Reina and TO. Hm. Still very much wiggle room, and we won't be able to tell where we are from what comes before us.  I just want everyone to go home and decide what it is that they need to fix and come to competition tomorrow with a determined and fierce attitude. We can make it to finals. We just need to pull everything together. We need to choose our battles when it comes to objections, we need to memorize perfectly openings and closings, we need to get the genders down, we need to smile and sparkle and attack and defend. We can't sniffle or laugh or frown or vacillate or back down, DAMNIT.  And I preach too much.  And sometimes things tell me that I should just drop everything and put what I have into mock trial. That means no obsessing over minute details in school, no obsessing over people, no obsessing over piano...oww, that one hurts in particular.  You're adorable, C, but would life be easier if I gave you up for three days?
