Kristen. KRISTEN KRISTEN. She likes lorne..she calls lorne...she makes lorne take up for her when people say things...she complains and whines to lorne...she makes him stay on the phone with her when he tries to tell her he wants to go and call me before it gets too late...i dont like it. Lorne is sooo totally mine it's not even funny. The one guy that seems like mr perfect the one dude that seems like he could mean the world to me one of these days comes along and kristen has to like him.  Yeah, i've had my crush on andrew when katie was dating him, but god, i didnt step in the way of anything at all. She calls me a whore and a bitch and all these uncalled for things in front of lorne and it makes her look really stupid, but still, the point is she tries to take his attention off of me thinkin it will make him like her. NOPE sorry kristen. UGH i dont like it AT ALL. Kristen needs to let things go and leave lorne alone...lol Cuz by Saturday i'll be lornes GIRLFRIEND. yay lol I can see where kristen is coming from, and yeah shes my friend..but i guess things like this will bring out her true colors. She'll find someone, and it wont be lorne.
