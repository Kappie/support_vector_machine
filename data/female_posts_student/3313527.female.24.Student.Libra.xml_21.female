See, I LOVE writing on my blog... but I've been so damn  busy ... but I know that is no excuse. If it were a priority, I would have made it so. Unfortunately, whenever my life gets busy the first things to go are all of the self-care things that feed my soul- the things I really like to do- the hobbies, the time alone, the writing, the art, the nourishing friendships and good conversations that feed me-- there's just been no time with this crazy summer semester and all the juggling I've been doing. Luckily, the education feeds me, I am really loving being back in school and learning actual *facts* and *knowledge*. What is draining is having to work a soul-sucking job for 40 hrs/wk on top of that. I mean... I work at a yoga center... one would think it couldn't be THAT bad, right? Well... I guess maybe it's just the baggage I'm bringing to it, I don't know... but things aren't how I thought they'd be here. Very much like any other 40 hr/wk lifeless office job. Tension headaches almost everyday on the drive to work... ahh repressed frustration so quickly becomes physical pain, doesn't it? I can easily complain to my coworkers that I have a headache 'this big', but it's not easy to say that they are all driving me nuts and I want to throw each of them out of a moving car-- nothing personal of course. So headaches let me translate my grief, frustration and suffering into some more manageable pathology. God bless ibuprofen for helping me stuff so many emotions each and every day. Whatever would I do w/out it?... Probably get a more satisfying job, I guess. Hmm. Back to homework.
