Life is what you make of it, so I guess it's all up to me. If I'm not having fun or am not happy, something must be wrong. But not today. I am happy today. Baseball? We'll see. Go and make the best of it, what other choicedo I have. Only a couple more to go. I wish I was on KK's team, but that didn't happen. CL rigged her team so of course her team is better. KK is lucky, but in a way she's not, not just KK, CL's team in general. I think it helps to put 13 year olds with a bunch of different ages and experienced players so it helps them. It helped me when I was 13. But not this. Not when her team is purposely good. Extremely good. Good to begin with, not to mention there's always room for improvement. How are they supposed to get better when they don't come to practices? How are they supposed to get better when they don't observe the more experienced, and stick to their own methods? Closed minded. Immature. Have no idea what theyr'e talking about. I think it's even too late to begin. I don't think SH and DB are very good coaches. Not very experienced. And because SH and JB are younger, SH and DB may have experience, but this is a diffferent league now. Age group change. CL is good, well at least I thought she was, but then look at what she did this year. Exactly what RH did last year, and she was the first to complain about that. Yet she has no problem doing it herself. I didn't think she was the type of person to rig her team. Unexpected. I hope I get to pitch. Probably. Yet it's so frustrating when they hit it, and there's no help whatsoever in the field to back you up. It's like at times a one man show and you just hope someone will be there to back you up. I don't feel I have the trust with my team mates that was there last year. I think we had better players last year. A better team. More experienced. I don't understand why CL would do that, especially when she knows what it's like to be on the other end of it, as she was with RH last season. I wonder if I'll play nexxt year. Maybe. Maybe KK and SW will play. Hmmm. I don't know, just get through this week and next week and I'm done. It's like SH doesn't even feel the need for the practices, we called the one last Sunday because I asked for it and I pushed for it. I guess it worked, but ONE good practice is not worth it. We may as well give up. I feel the playoffs are a way of showasing what you're learned as a team, and even how far you've come, as individuals as well as a team. Not this year. My pitching gets better every game - but does SH always put me in? No. I feel he sometimes gives me a chance, but definently favours SS. He would. Makes sense. SS is the kind of person who is aware of it, just because of her situation. Likely. I don't know what elseI can do. Push for another practice? Would people come? Would they be willing? Or is it too late.  Make the best of it.
