Adam O said he'd let us play his playstation, thank you jesus. finally my nintendo junk can be laid to rest- assuming i ever get to play. I missed most of the extreme south park tonight...weak. this angers me. but it was a good night. so theres this kid right... and well hes really nice, a bit odd most definetly, but nice all the same. what to do? he liked me last week, i dont know about now- i havent talked to him since they got home from the lions thing. i use to like him... maybe i still do, i just waited so long that i think maybe im starting to lose interest. maybe ill see him tomorrow- see what happens. dont ask me why i think about what i think about, besides movies, music, and politics, i probably wont be able to answer any questions- but the phrase 'used to' is that weird? or is it 'use to' is this correct english? it seems odd to me. you always hear it though like in songs and in conversation... "do you remember when we use(d) to..etc" if anyone can answer this question for me id much apperciate it! correct, incorrect whatever. when i typed it above i typed used to but then i had to go back and erase the 'd' because it was weird. hmm, can i have the correct spelling please lol- jessie bob, what a girl Well now that you know how gay my life is and that i have nothing interesting to say please go on enjoying your day! haha. see all you kids later Until Time Next
