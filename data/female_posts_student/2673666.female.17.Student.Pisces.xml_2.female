The lovely Colin took me out for a meal at the Harvester on Saturday night for Valentine's day, along with his brother Paul and his girlfriend/my friend Chaz.  Much fun was had.  I ate far too much, got a little tipsy too, then we all came back to my house and slept (eventually). No rudeness!!  Anyway, here's some pics:   You can just about make me out in this one, grabbing my chest   Chaz and Paul, drunk as skunks   He'll hate me for putting this up, but this is Colin wearing my bra...   Awww, bless, I don't even remember this one being taken but it's cute!   Colin, Chaz and Paul   This one's just far too funny not to post, doesn't look at all suspicious does it? Then on Sunday evening I went to see  urlLink A Profound Reason  (band with Colin, Jamie etc. in) in a Battle of the Bands at the Adge, along with Julie and some other friends.  They didn't get through, but rocked mightily, the crowd loved them and they got a lot of requests for CD's etc (alas, they haven't got round to recording one yet... they've only been together 2 months!).  Got drunk  again , was very soppy with Colin, then Julie came back to mine and we attempted to sleep.  Bah.  So today I'm absolutely knackered, but have still managed to update  urlLink www.useful-idiot.cjb.net .  Have a look.  Bye all xxx
