Below, I state I dislike dramatic people, but yet just by writing that entry on that certain subject I was being dramatic.   In fact... just by my admission of this, I am being dramatic.   I don't know why, I just hate to appear like I want attention. I didn't. I just needed to get all that off my chest.   And, again, I repeat...that was NOT about one certain person... it was about a certain state of mind. My rantings were about the idea that people nowadays take alot of things for granted.   Kids in Cambodia don't have to deal with ADD, anerexia, obesity or family troubles because all that doesn't exsist there. Neither does security, democracy or respect. I'm just trying to fit it in people's small little minds that our situations are all pretty damn good if ya think about it.   I think I was inspired my an episode of Oprah.
