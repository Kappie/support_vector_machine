Due to the extravagence of my aforementioned hair for the play, I am obliged to sleep on my stomach at night to prevent it from going flat and awful (though in popular opinion, it is already awful. Micheal, a little guy from BATS made the charming comment today that it looks as though I have a rat stuck on my had with many 'rat's-tails' dangling down. Lovely). Anyway, this means that by sleeping on my stomach, I'm also sleeping on my face which in turn restricts my breathing. To add another element of adventure, I have to stay about one quarter concious all night so I don't roll over and destroy my cursed hair. Now that I've washed my hair (three shampoos and a 5-minute condition)I shall enjoy sleeping tonight! I've got a maths exam tomorrow, for which I am happily avoiding studying for. I've made myself a deal that I will study after I eat dinner. Let's see if I can hold up my end of the deal...Geez I feel like a hug, and it's a nice feeling these days to know that I actually have someone to hug. I'll have to use that resource to its full extent...Bye!!
