BOWA would have been kick ass to hear Friday night.  I guess a lot of people have been complaining about the set list so far.  It has been repetitive, but Im glad they didn't play the same songs at the same venue in two nights.  I think people would have thrown shit.    I found out today that Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan are going to play at the minor league baseball field here in South Bend, late August.  Setting up the stage in Center Field.  You can take blankets and sit in the outfield.  Un-FUCKING-believable.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday and you bet your sweet ass I will be in line to get tickets.  I am not passing this one up.  Wille and Bob...god damn.    This morning I found out someone broke into my car.  Busted out the rear vent window and unlocked the door.  Someone with a long arm, I couldn't even reach in to unlock the door.  They went through my cds and took all my silver change.  About $4.00, but its still the principle.  I just don't understand the reasoning behind breaking into someone's car and thinking it is ok.  So now I have to get the window replaced and thank god they didn't steal any of my Dave CDs.   Grey would have been pissy!!   I wrote 'the story', so if you want to read it, let me know and I'll email it.  I will send it off and see what tCj thinks by Friday.  I've just wanted to get some opinions and 'advice', if you will.  I think I have gotten a lot of good ideas and to those who have helped-Thank You!  OK, I need to crash out, class tonight.  Quiz, oh Quiz.     Peace.Love.DMB.
