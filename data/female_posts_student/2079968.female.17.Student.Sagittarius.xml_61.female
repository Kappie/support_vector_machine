What being an adult means: You can...  -Legally buy cigarettes -Legally drink alcohol -Finally have access to porn and other sexual materials  It just doesn't seem logical either...in South Carolina, with parental consent, a girl can marry at 14 and a guy at 16...you can legally have sex at 16...and without parental consent, marry at 18.  People who make laws are stupid. There is absolutely no logic to any of that stuff above.  And if those things qualify becoming an adult, then I think i'll pass and stay a child at heart, thank you very much.  Brought to you by Veronica Alexander for the person who makes laws in 2004. (a member of congress...or president.)
