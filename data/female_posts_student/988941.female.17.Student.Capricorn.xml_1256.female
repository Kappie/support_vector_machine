I am please I have this weekend off so will probably be organising cinema for Sunday evening to see 'The Butterfly Effect' so if you can come I'll send out an email or something. How has everyone's week been? First week back of our last term? Ahhh! Mines been kinda ok but also kinda gah. I'm annoyed we have vending machines atm, I want some food as I am still at school "doing some work in the computer lab". lol.    Have a good weekend.
