In that city, there was no one The lights in the windows were on but no one was walking on the streets I looked inside a window and there was a person But they were with "that" I looked inside another window, there was another person But, obviously, they were with "that" Because when you're with "that" you're happy That's why no one comes outside I want to find someone for me But if that person becomes attached to me and me only then.... It will time for the two of us to part But, still... I'd like to meet that person just for me... Thinking that, i headed on to another empty city...  --Chobits--
