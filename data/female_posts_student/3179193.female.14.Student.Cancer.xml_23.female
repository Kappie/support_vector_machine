This is the first actual serious-serious conversation I've ever had with him ever since I met him. I know he's real. Not a fake. I know that the GM Crew is real and no fakes. We're all true to each other, and we stay that way. We don't back stab each other. *cough*  I'm getting tired... gonna get off computer. Julie wants to go on so from 6pm on, Julie will be on my computer. Hers is getting fixed. Whatever. I'm off... gotta say bye to Martin. Peace.
