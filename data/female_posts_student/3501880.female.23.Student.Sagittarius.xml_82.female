Now, my lips are stained bluish/purple as if I have suffered a bad cause of hypothermia. I feel like I am five years old again, where I had a permanently-stained kool-aid lips for the better part of a year. I kid you not! I have the pictures to prove it.  ***** Alas, I feel a bit sad, as it dawned on me that school will start again in a matter of two weeks. My heart will ache for these sublime days in which I put in the requisite hours at work, with a good portion of those hours spent staring into space and chatting with co-workers and taking cat-naps,  and then have the rest of the evening to spend guilt-free, without the burden of homework looming over my shoulder. It's just not FAIR! WAAAA!
