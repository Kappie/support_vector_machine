And there's plenty of perfectly human ones so Nala isn't even necessary.   Black Cauldron girl was...dammit. No, not "dammit". The guy's name was Taran. Um...the girl's was Eilonwy. I have all of the Prydain Chronicles to back me up on that one, s'don'go thur. It's sad about that movie...I read that it was a disasterpiece in the box office even tho there was some animation innovation with that movie that made it ultra-mega-spiff-lookin'.  And let's not forget....Ariel! That's nine. Jasmine, how about?!? Since Belle really isn't a princess, she gets lumped in with then tho. I guess you could say she's one since Beast is a prince-thing if I recall, and that would make her a princess, marrying as such.   So that's like a billion. Woohoo!  And no hate crimes against the queer that mopped up the rest of the Disney princesses, now.
