I don't mind listening to your problems, I don't mind giving you advice, I am here for my friends, family and co-workers whenever... except at one particular time... HAPPY HOUR!  I am not a licensed professional counselor, and we all my stance on marriage so I AM NOT A GODDAMNED marriage counselor.  And I refuse to play either WHEN I AM HANGING OUT AND DRINKING BEER.  Come on!  Time and place... people, time and place.  So here's a no name version of what happened...  I get to happy hour and find out that this one friend of mine from work... we'll call him Bitch, invited this other guy from work, which is fine, we'll call him Miserable.  So Bitch tells me Miserable is coming out and I am fine with that, on occasion I have been told that Miserable can be fun.  Friday was not one of those days.  So as I am hanging out with other friends from work now known as Pandamonium, MR.IWANNACIGARETTE, KEEPEROFSHADOWS (I am stretching here but I am trying to start each word with the first letter of their name), Bitch and well, I got nothing so we'll call him Bert.  Miserable walks through the door.  Miserable wastes no time in coming up to me when I ask him how he is telling me that his marriage is falling apart... MISERABLE PISSED ME OFF RIGHT THEN.  How are you in a bar does not really mean how are you!  Miserable then proceeds to go on and on about said marriage and then confides in me that Miserable's wife thought at one point that Miserable and I were having some illicit affair... WHAT THE F!  Again, I have to say it cause I am still in shock and gagging... WHAT THE F!  Just one more time because if you knew who I was talking about you would say it too... WHAT THE F!  Okay, so done with that.  Anyway, I laugh, and let it go because what the hell do you say to that?  So the night continues and I think I have dodged the bullet of dealing with Miserable for the rest of the night till he then tells me he feels like we're friends and he can confide in me.  He then tells me that he is in love with someone he can't have.  One more time.. WHAT THE F!  Why, you ask?  Because he's married, so? you ask, I mean after all his marriage is falling apart... BECAUSE she's married.  Great.  So skip to the end of the happy hour because it all goes on like this for hours... and Pandimonium who is now seeming kind of down wants to go dancing... well fine.  So we go to another bar and Miserable is going to back out but in the last few moments someone else convinces him to go.  So he tails us over to the next bar.  Now I feel for the guy and he's pretty nice so I am not going to protest but I was so close to being rid of him.  We get to the other bar and he proceeds to ruin my night further by bitching some more and then on top of that proceeds to go on about catching young things and taking them home for a one night stand.  MR.IDONTWANTACIGARETTE convinces him to go hit on some chick and we watch as Miserable stands behind her for a while like some sick stalker and then backs out.  He then comes back to the table to go on and on about how he's just not that kind of guy, he's sensitive, sweet, caring, he wants a girl for a lifetime not a girl for a night... WHAT?  WHAT?  WHAT?  What are you a goddamn girl yourself!  Jesus Christ I wanted to smack the shit out of him right there and tell him that he better find himself a "homely" one, to put it nicely.  But instead I just smile and say, that's really great of you.  He then proceeds to tell me how great I am... WHAT THE F!  Finally after Pandamonium and I ditch him to go dancing he comes and stands there in the middle of the dance floor talking about his whole issue again... WHAT THE F!  After ditching him over and over again, telling him I had to go here and do this and then turning right around after he followed me... he decides he's old and too tired to hang out.  Thank God.  So this concludes this part of my dramatic night, there was more but it'll have to wait for another time.
