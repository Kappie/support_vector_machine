((small shrug))   very few people… with the exception of a select few (you know who you are).. already know to some extent what this entry is going to be about… although, no one, not even the few who know, know everything about what I have to say… I know I probably sound like a hardcore nutcase right now, and, after this, will probably lose a lot of people I consider friends… but this is my choice.. people would have to know at some point in time... ((sighs)) just please.. bear with me people and hear me out completely before leaving uber worried notes.. this entry isn't about pity, attention, or worry.. I just want to get something off my chest that's been weighing me down for quite a while now…  I was randomly hunting around TOD today, bored out of my mind and trying to find something to do to keep myself occupied (my uncle is here and I don’t particularly have anything to say to him… sorry, but we're not exactly close..) and I happened upon the diary of a cutter… these diaries, as anyone who's been using TOD for a while knows, are extremely common…but something about this dairy made me want to say something… more specifically, it was a couple of quotes I found that really made me think- "Self injury is not a way to die, but more an attempt to stay alive" …I'm not condoning the usage of cutting as a method of gaining some sort of control over one's life, don’t get me wrong… all I'm saying, is that I related to this quote.. I've been cutting since my eighth grade year.. most of you probably know about it, and I'm sorry if I'm stating the obvious, but I need to get it out… cutting for me has never been something light or easy.. some say that cutting just comes naturally and that it's a simple cry for attention.. I beg to differ.. I first saw what cutting was long before I actually knew that there was a term for it.. a close friend of mine began it as a method of coping with boyfriend problems… and, at the time, I thought it was a little disturbing and worrisome.. but another, deeper part of me thought 'what if..'  after a time I forgot about cutting and continued to talk to people about my problems in a rather free manner… eventually, however, I began to realize that all I was doing was burdening other people with my simple problems… and I didn’t want to do that.. my entire life, I had been taught not to unload things on other people because a lot of people have it so much worse than I do.. which is true… in comparison, I have things extremely easy… my parents support me, they've never been divorced, my brother and I get along at times, and I have a couple of close friends… I have no room to say I have it bad.. I don’t.. but some things… just get  to me, to put it simply… Unlike my friend, I didn’t start cutting because of boyfriend problems… I began doing SI *self injury* as a way to escape my family… my mom more specifically.. don’t get me wrong, I love my mother… but there are times in my life when I've just wanted to simply cease to exist if it would please her… every time we have ever fought, she has felt the need to bring up the fact that she wanted to have a little girl so badly.. (my parents tried for about a year to have me).. and went through some hard times in the process… although she never completes this statement, some small part of my mind always returns to the same thing 'you tried to hard to have a second child and all you got was me' its an extremely self-depreciating comment, but I cant help but think that somewhere in her mind she thinks this thought everyday of her life… returning to the quote though, many people think that SI is a way to simply cry out.. and in a lot of ways it is.. (although, it's become so common now that very few people actually say something to stop it..) thinking back on it, all of my cutting seems to have been a way to tell my mother that I was sorry for being such a disappointment.. for being a loser, a dreamer, a whore.. (all of which she's told me I am) a way to kill a part of myself that I've never been proud of…in other ways though, SI has always been not a way to die, but a way to get from point A *depression, pain, angst, etc* to point B *happiness, contentment, etc*.. many people, myself included, don’t know how to get between these two points without unloading problems on other people.. without being a burden.. often times people who don’t cut say that cutters should find a healthy outlet… drawing, writing, singing, etc.. and, for many circumstances, I use these but, as many can attest, sometimes this doesn’t work… these feelings simply become bottled up inside until there's no room left for feeling.. and everything explodes…and in exploding, you take the risk of hurting other people… personally, this has never been my goal… I don’t want to hurt other people in the process of making myself feel better… ever…I have a very loving boyfriend and several friends who care that I cut… but I've never wanted them to know that I hurt this badly… I've never wanted them to worry…  so I found a method of erupting silently… something that seemed to affect no one… I began to cut… every time my mother would scream at me that she could no longer stand the sight of me and that I was absolutely worthless, I'd retreat to some solitude, grab whatever I could find and press it against my skin… as sick as this sounds… cutting has become one of my only outlets… in cutting, I can focus on another pain besides whatever pain I’m feeling inside.. it helps at the time,  but afterward, I’m left with the responsibility and burden of  bandaging and hiding the wound… initially I had to think about how I was going to relieve internal pain… but as of late, I'm sorry to say that it's become a bit of a reflex… the bandaging and hiding have become just another element of pretending I’m absolutely okay… many people who don’t cut also seem to think that many cutters simply don’t want to stop their cries for attention… but, again, a lot of the time, this isn't true… personally, I'd love to stop cutting… I'd absolutely love to be able to wake up one day and instantly know what to do when something bad happens… but I cant… I've tried for the past two years to stop cutting… and I'd be so incredibly proud when I could say that I hadn't cut for a month or so… but as soon as something would happen that was bad enough to make me want to stop breathing, I'd go back to it… I'm not saying that I don’t know what to do instead of cutting.. sadly, I do..  but when push comes to shove, it all comes down to the fact that these have always been my problems… my mother, my family, my life.. why should anyone else ever have to deal with my problems?.. they're mine and I have to deal with them, as simple or as difficult as they may be… and cutting has always been a silent way of packing everything down into that tiny emotional bottle.. when things feel as if they're going to erupt, I cut… In essence people, I'm sorry… again, I'm not condoning cutting… I actually really rather dislike it… and don’t want anyone else to go down this road.. it's addicting simply put… and can ruin your life… I'll always have scars and I'll eventually have to face explaining to my husband and children their meaning… but until then, all I can do is try to stop… I’m not guaranteeing that it'll ever happen but I can try… unfortunately, though, I seem to be in deeper than I had originally thought…
