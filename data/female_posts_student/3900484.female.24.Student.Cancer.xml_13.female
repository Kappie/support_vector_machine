We just sort of forget to run, because we get too busy talking. So we walked the other day, 4 miles. We could have run those four miles in half the time, at least, but we were busy talking. Maybe it's sorta like those anorexic girls forgetting to eat. I can understand that.    Sooo yeah. I've been really lazy lately, slacking off from running and all. I do have the good intentions though. Linds and I talk aboutmaybe lifting weights in the fall, as well as running in the mornings. Which would be fab, could we ever work up enough energy to actually DO it. Ugh, stay away from the nike brands though, children, I don't like their business practices much. I lean towards asics or addidas. or New Balance.    Ok, today's the day, as well. Im going to get my final list of Grad schools I want to go to, and then start practicing for   urlLink  this    horrific test I have to take in the fall. It's enough to give a girl an ulcer.
