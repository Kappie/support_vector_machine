And explaining that if they wanted to hang out they'd have to come over at 11:00pm-12:00, Mike calls me when I'm ready to fall asleep. I ask to talk with Josh (big mistake) and then I get hung up on. Josh calls back, and I get hung up on. Josh calls back, and I get hung up on. Josh calls back.... and gives me a lecture. "I was thinking about saying it, but I didn't because I knew it'd hurt you." or something to that extent. Well, sorry to say Josh, but that was the wrong fucking sentence to use. It hurt even more for you to agree with what I said then to just play it off. And you KNEW it would hurt me. You fucking knew it. I know we said we'd be brutally honest but you knew that I wasn't feeling that great and for anything of the sort to be brought up was just... Aggravating.   "Let me guess... You think this time it's the same as Allen." "You just want men until they give themselves up to you." "No, I think it's different this time." "Well, I wasn't going to say I agreed with that, but I was thinking it. Maybe it's just like how Allen was..."  I'm not wearing the dress tonight. I don't even know if I want to go out anywhere today. And the last person I want to see is Nick... because that was all about him...     I'm going to climb back into bed and listen to depressing music while curled in a ball under my covers. Hopefully I'll just shrivel up and die.
