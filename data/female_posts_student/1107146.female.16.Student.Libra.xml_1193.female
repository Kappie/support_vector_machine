The "3-fold Rule" is only applied to Wiccans, which is a relatively new religion, that worships a God and/or a Goddess (long story about the and/or part) and they believe that if someone does something bad, it comes bad times three.  Kind of like karma.  It really has nothing to do with different schools.  You're just sheltered!  But on to Michael.  Yeah, I knew about Erin, too.  I had the EXACT same reaction you did.  I was like, Oh...I'm so sorry (Josh was there.  He knows that's what I really did!)  But inside, I was like hahahahahahaha!!!! which of course, I posted on the blog.  Just to save Abby the time, I'm not going to say come to BHS because we already know where that's going to lead...
