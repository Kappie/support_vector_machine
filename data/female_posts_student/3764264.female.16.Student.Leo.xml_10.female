I've been talking about those thoughts too much, I think. hehe.   In my mind though, I'm much better at explaining these thoughts than others. ... Anyone that would read this might think that I've just tricked myself, and that I'm a slut. Not that I care about what people would think, but I want to make it super clear that... I don't, wait I do... That I lust for Erich  beCAUSE  I love him.   And though I have my kinky little fantasies... Most of the time my real fantasies go like this:      Erich has his arms wrapped around me we're still for hours, laying on a blanket and being very warm     or:      Today me and Erich hung out with a bunch of friends. It was pretty cool; we went and played pool (etc)     or even:      Today me and Erich got into a fight. Errrgh. It was so dumb. I think I said something I shouldn't have.     Get the picture? I could've gone into a lot more detail, but I wanted to make my point without getting sidetracked.   I want to have imperfect moments with Erich. I know this because I think about these imperfect moments just as much as the fantasies. I'm sure fighting with Erich wasn't fun, or hanging out with friends was awkward at one point or another, or even those seemingly "perfect" moments will have their downfalls. And that makes everything so much more interesting.   --Sage   PS: See? I'm not so good at explaining these thoughts. Told yah so.   PPS: hey. Maybe sex will be not so perfect at first either. I'm sure we'll need lots and lots of practice, (if we ever get to that point.)
