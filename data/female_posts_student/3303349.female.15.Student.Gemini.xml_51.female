It's been just keeping thoughts of him going lately, not thoughts of him being gone, that has kept me from missing him as much as I thought I would. But when I do start missing him it gets preaty intense. My only sconsolence tonight is that he's coming back tomorrow. I think I forgot to mention that I talked to Rachel today and her boyfriend was at here house I so I kinda got to meet him over the phone. I liked him, he had a nice voice. And I admire him for putting up with Rachel! They kept kissing each other while talking to me which was acward but I laughed at them, thought about Paul and spun in circles which made it all good. Now let's see if I can go back to sleep since my eyes won't focus anymore, but maybe it's because i don't have my glasses on...hum...I don't know...feel preatty tired though....
