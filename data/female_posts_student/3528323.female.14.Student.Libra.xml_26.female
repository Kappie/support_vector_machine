My aunt in San Diego, who I have been staying with for the majority of the time, has no internet connection (yes yes, I know, what the fuck?). Right now I am at my friend's house. I am  not  back in Stockton yet. I fly to Texas this Wednesday, and don't get back to Stockton until July 6. I know those of you with working memories realize I have told you the stuff in this post many times before.   Any ways, I am having as much fun as can be expected. I am gonna watch  Club Dread  in a little while, which looks good. Last night, we saw  Dodgeball , which was really funny. I already saw  The Stepford Wives  and  The Chronicles of Riddick , and I rented  Along Came Polly  and  50 Firs --  Okay, I should save this for my personal blog, so I'm gonna end this before I revert back to 'noob' mode. Um, anyways, I hope your summers are going alright. I have (some) pictures from my little trippy-thingy, so yeah.  That post was horrible.  P.S. I wasn't calling anyone a cupcake when I titled this post. Pet names are for fags, and the line is from  Invader Zim .
