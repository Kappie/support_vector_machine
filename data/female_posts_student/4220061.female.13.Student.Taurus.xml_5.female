I am crying.   I rolled my ankle playing badminton recently, and it hurts quite a bit.  It feels better when i wrap it.  I'm going to go to school tomorrow with my ankle wrapped... ughhh that smells.  I'll like have to answer 'What's wrong with your ankle?' like 1000000000 times.  Oh well.  Real badminton tryouts start tomorrow... the last few days have been practice and warm-ups for the tryouts.  I'm scared... and since my ankle is hurt, I may not make the team.  I got a yellow racquet.  It's pretty groovy.  School tomorrow!  Party on!  -Candice
