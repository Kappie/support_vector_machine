Whenever it gets like all gross out I feel gross. Stupid weather. It's so over rated. I still have homework to do, and I gotta clean my room before my mom gets home. Well, she's got bowling tonight so I can always clean and stuff later. Yea, it was nice to sleep late today. Just chill in bed. I like didn't even wanna get up to eat anything like, I woke up, and like I hadda tell Vin I wasn't feelin good and then I got a Hot Pocket and after I took a bite I didn't feel like eatin too much more of it so I went back to bed lol. Yea.. so that was my day lol... peace x0x
