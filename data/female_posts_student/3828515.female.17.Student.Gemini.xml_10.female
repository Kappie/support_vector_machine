Apparently if one wants to return a broken item, one must deal directly through the manufacturer (aka: Microsoft :P). So we'll see about that. Anyways. I also went out to try to find a new CD or MP3 player that I could take with me for the ride up to Canada on Tuesday, but everything was really crappy and really expensive. One of these days, when I have the money, I will just break down and buy an iPod. I must admit, Apple products really are superior (shut up, David, because I know what you're thinking). Well, I was fruitless on the MP3/CD player hunt, as you may have guessed. So I guess I'll need to head out and buy some double-A batteries at the least :P. Ugh... Well that's my story. I hope you had a nice time wasting less than a minute of your life reading it.     Last song I listened to:   Brick  by Ben Folds Five.    Last album I listened to:   Some Kind Of Monster .    Last meal I ate:  Chicken sandwich.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I do not know.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.   Last person I talked to:  Dan.    Favorite song today:   Narcolepsy  by Ben Folds Five.    Favorite food today:  This weird basil-seasoned roll. Good stuff.    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went shopping... in computer and electronics stores, of course!   Funniest thing that happened today:  I was talking to my brother and didn't realize that he had the digital camera in his hand, so he just flashed it right in my face in the middle of my sentence. That was weird.
