I mean we didn't silently throw a ball around, we just talked and absentmindedly threw the ball.  It just started with Kathryn bouncing it, saying how it must be annoying to hear that sound so she threw it to one of us, who threw it to another person and so on.  Good times.   Another part of my day that made it was good was that I had to call this number for help with my computer.  The guy who helped me was from Texas and he had the most sultry voice..He is now known as cute-Texas-phone-boy with my friends.  We had some weird conversations--matches led to gay marriage somehow.  Our next door neighbors are having this huge party.  There was like 20 teenagers in my driveway when I came home.  I wish they'd leave...Good for nothin teenagers--I hate em!  I want to go to the beach tomorrow.  I'm also going to ribfest!  yay leonarnd skinard.  Go white sox and who ever plays the flubs!
