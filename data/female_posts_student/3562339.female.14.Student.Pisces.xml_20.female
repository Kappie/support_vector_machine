Alicia oh so nervous, but the bus driver didn't even notice me, so whatever.  And now we're having oodles of fun torturing Magus.  And I'm eating slim jims, yummy!    Anyways, tonight is the graduation celebration thingy!  And neither me nor Alicia have any school supplies to donate, but whatever.  Grrrr, I keep making typos cause Alicia's keyboard is icky.  Alicia is defending her keyboard and says, "It's awesome!  You just can't harness its awesome power."  Today was like the last real day of school, even though we didn't even do anything today other than graduation practice, which was boring, as usual.  We watched  Scary Movie 3  in Language Arts because Dan Stadlin had the DVD in his locker and it was uber funny.  Mrs. Lawley didn't even mind that they cursed like every 3 seconds.  That's about it for today.  I'll probably post again when I get back from the celebration thingy.  Thank god this week is finally over.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ..la Gu
