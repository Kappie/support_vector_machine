But on the bright side of everything, I alreaady got my chores done for the day, I get to go get my contacts at 4, I got to talk to Ken last night for ore than 5 mins, he's going to try to get off work before 12 tonight so he can come and see me (his Mustang is supposed to be dropped off at his work today!), and... and...  oh yeah, tomorrow I'm going to Beth's!  So YAY!!  The rest of this week should be pretty cool.  *does a little dance*  Hopefully everything goes well...  YAY!!!!  I just got off the phone w/ Church!  He told me to show up for play prac. on Monday night!  I get to be the judge, which is just a small part in the beginning, but really that's all I think I could handle...  Too much stress, especially since the play is in... 3 weeks?  But yeah, it's all good.  So see, today's getting better by the minute.  I still have to get ahold of Heather, b/c she wants me to babysit her rat for her while she's on vacay.  I missed her call this morning, then I left her a message, and now I'm waiting for her to call me back. Lalalalalalalalalala...  *random jig*  Now I'm just bored...
