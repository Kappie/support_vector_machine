Go us, we rock niya!!!  lol, i'm really proud of myself, i don't think i really studied for that test very well.  Maybe i don't need to study just like i didn't study in masengill's class!!  Take that Charlie Mitchell! I don't have to work in this class!!!  lol, ok we're good there...  Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: Alright i think he's doing good now, he's started hanging out with that broad again.  At least he's stopped with the socks and sandals bit.  I've decided that broad he hangs out with....looks like a horse.  I'm sorry!  But she does!!  She wears far too much eye liner and powder and her face is shaped weird.  Anyways, the blonde kid's jeans were cute today and his shirt looked nice.  His arms looked skinny today.....or have his arms always been skinny?  I dunno, that one white shirt he wore made him look like he had tons of muscle.  Or maybe that was a figment of my imagination and i was wishing that he had tons of muscle.  I dunno.  Sports Update: REMEMBER Coppell vs. Marcus tomorrow at 7:30pm!  Double hockey week don't forget!! Then on Thursday we meet up with Flower Mound at 8!!  Stars play Calgary tonight and i know we'll take them down!  Your team is sooooo going down Steven Danby!    Gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
