If I dwell on this one thing - its a good thing. But then there's something else and it's a bad thing.  I guess it sounds simple - dwell on the happy thing - the good thing. There should be no question about it. So why do I question?  I don't know why I can't be happy or let myself be happy. Maybe...I don't think it's a good idea to block everything out just because it's hard to face. Because eventually you'll have to face it anyway and if you ignore it it can just get worse and worse and you won't realize it until it's too late and it's so inflamed you can never get over it.  I guess.  I think I did okay on that test on Caesar's Commentaries...I'm a little worried about the sight translation but I think I did okay. I'm surprised I got an 80 on that Algebra II quiz...I know I should be happy but still...I had high hopes for that quiz.  I have to cancel my orthadontist appointment tomorrow. I found out I've missed 3 2nd and 3rd period classes. Two class I can exempt exams in and I am definetly going to exempt any exam I can.  (You can miss up to 3 days and have an A in the class and it has to be a non-SOL class to exempt.)
