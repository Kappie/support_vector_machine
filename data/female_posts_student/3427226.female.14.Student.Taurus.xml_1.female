Unfortunately for him, three of the seven stones were lost when he was banished to hell. The remaining stones he had were then passed on to his son, Count Vladislause Dragulia, for safe keeping. Now, the dark lord Voldemort wants the stones so as to rule the world, but the only way to obtain them is from Dracula, and Dracula has no intentions of giving the stones up without a fight.
