There was a huge line at the Bon Ton check out, and then I saw Megha, and I hadn't seen her in a few months so I had to talk to her. She's going to Brown University in the fall, which is awesome for her :)  So that was cool. Even though I have to stay later. I got new thongs, lol, to replace the ones my mom threw out. And a new denim skirt and two new shirts I think. I'd have to actually check the bag, but I left it in Carissa's car. I didn't need my mom seeing my new undies, lol. Not. her. business.   I got a shirt that says "I wish I could Ctrl+Alt+Delete you" :D  I also bought a lot of pink. I don't know why necessarily. Infact, I used to hate pink. But I've been doing a lot of putting pink and black together. Hmmm...maybe I'm becoming more *gasp* GIRLY?!?!?!?!111one  Oh good Lord I hope not.   I got my pacheck!!! 466.38, I believe :)  I feel so...I dunno, lol, it's just really cool. I've never had a paycheck before, it feels good to actually earn my money instead of just having my parents give it to me. I'm spoiled, lol, so this is good for me. But I've never had an issue with having to earn my keep with anything.   In other news, I am bored, lol.  I'll probably post again before my day is through.
