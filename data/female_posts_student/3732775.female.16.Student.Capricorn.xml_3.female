"If tears could build a stairway, and memories a lane, I'd walk right up to heaven, and bring you home again."  "Be brave, Be bold, Be free"  "Life is not measured by the number of breaths you take, it's measured by the moments that take your breath away."  "Do more than exist- live, Do more than touch- feel, Do more than look- observe, Do more than read- absorb, Do more than listen- understand."
