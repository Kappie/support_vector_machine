Too bad I went to school both Thursday AND Friday.  Never play in a basketball scrimmage when you have a 100 degree fever, ok?  Anyways, being sick has made me realize the best skeezy quick-fix diet plan ever.  You know how they have those things you drink that basically make you throw up all weekend? Well, I figure, we can send these people food that I've coughed all over or something lol. That way, they'll get the flu, their tummyswill fill up with mucus and their throat will hurt too to swallow anything besides jello! End result: knock off a few pounds. I'm surprised someone hasn't thought of this sooner.  My butt is officially deceased.   I got two catalogs in the mail yesterday. One, American Girl Doll, the other Victoria's Secret. hahahahahaha   anyways. I'm still feverish, so don't pay attention to anything I wrote.
