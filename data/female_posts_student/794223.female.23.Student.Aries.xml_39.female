Lord of the Rings! The last movie comes out tomorrow...and I'm getting up early and wating in line for an hour to get a good seat. Crazy, I know--but this very well might be the film of the year. The entire trilogy (aside from being based on Tolkien, one of the greatest writers of all time) has made cinemagraphic and film history. The amount of work, money, time, and people involved in filming these movies is astounding.  Ok enough rambling about the movie. (But I'm not ready for the Journey to be over!)
