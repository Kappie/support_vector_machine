I suppose it's in the family, our house is the only one lit up at this time if I take a look at the quiet suburban street outside the window. To be fair, besides me it's only my father and one of my two little brothers living here at the moment, since my parents are divorced and my other little brother away at some friends house. But still, we're alive at this time.    Blogging:  I need to write in order to express myself, so I'm constantly writing ("like a goddess" to pick the words out of my teachers mouth), and like nothing else it helps me to sort my mind out. I also need to gain approval from others, (I suppose everybody does) but I've found out that a recurrent pattern in my life is seeking away from who and what I know to meet completely new people and the challenge of getting to know them and becoming their friend. In my eyes that's a bit odd, since I think most people tend to get involved with the same stuff as their friends, but it has given me loads of new friens and experiences, and also a better knowledge of myself.   To keep it simple, writing in order to get a grip and getting to know new people is probably what brought me into blogging. Though, in order to be able to write what ever is on my mind, I think I'd better keep the blog a secret to my friends... Not that I think they'll get mad reading my 3 a.m.-philosophic nonsense, but...well, I suppose that if this diary ever gets down to the bottom of my mind (which I've probably never even seen myself), even they might not recognize me.   Me:  Having been this honest with you all already at the beginning, I don't know if there's anything left to say that won't sound shallow... But, well: I'm 17 years old (feeling the pressure of going 18 in about six months). I'm female (you might've guessed from the name). I live in Sweden (forgive me if the English is poor!). I don't know if there's anything more to tell you at the moment, but if you just hang on you'll soon know me better!  Cheers -and good night!
