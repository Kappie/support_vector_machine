Hey talking of Pagan festivals, did you know that if i became a Pagan i would be celebrated! Cos my birthday is on 21st of December (hint hint) and thats the winter equinox thingy.. yeah.... *proud grin* Hey - someone typed in peanut shells on google search and found our site! I mentioned peanut shells like- once, and it came up on the search! I'm gonna try that! Hi sad person who found us on Google! Why would you search for peanut shells anyway??
