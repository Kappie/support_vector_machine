Slighty odd considering they've     NEVER SEEN MY FRICKEN POETRY      Dear David,  I'm sorry you will be unable to join us at the 2004 International Society of Poets' Spring Convention and Symposium at the Walt Disney World Resort--the largest and most prestigious poetry event ever held. As you know, you were selected to be honored at this event, and we were looking forward to your presenting your poetic artistry in front of the more than 2000 poets from over 50 countries who will be attending.  However, because we don't want you to miss out on this unique opportunity altogether, we have arranged a way for you and your poetic accomplishments to be a part of this event in a major way, without your actually being present. Although you will be unable to participate in the Convention contest (you must be present to win), you can receive all of the awards and benefits of ISP membership we have scheduled for you--including your custom engraved Outstanding Achievement in Poetry Silver Award Bowl (see it here), your bronze Commemorative Award Medallion, and your Full One Year Membership into the International Society of Poets for 2004--if you will allow us to present one of your poems at the convention in your place.  We have arranged for professional poetry readers to read your poem at this largest gathering of poets in history. Our readers will present your poem with imaginative style, so that your artistry receives the worldwide exposure and recognition that it deserves. Your poem will also be featured in printed form, proudly displayed in a special room at the convention that will be accessible to more than 2000 attending poets and guests.  And let me  tell you  a little about the  actual awards and membership benefits  that you will  receive by mail immediately after you confirm your participation  in this prestigious event  by submitting your poem :   -- Your Outstanding Achievement in Poetry Silver Award Bowl (a $200.00 value) is a magnificent work of art in itself that measures over 10 inches across and over 11 inches high. It is handcrafted in silver and has your name custom-engraved on a beautiful cherry-wood base. It is certain to enjoy a special place of pride in your home and will serve as a fitting symbol of your unique poetic artistry.   -- Your bronze Commemorative Award Medallion (a $40.00 value) is a deeply etched bronze medal brilliantly displayed on a 25 inch red, white and blue satin ribbon.   -- And your Full One Year Membership into the International Society of Poets for 2004 (a $60.00 value) entitles you to a personalized membership card, an ISP patch and decal, entry into special contests during the year, and a subscription to The Poet's Corner quarterly newsletter. Please note, if you are already an ISP member, your benefits will be extended an additional year.  David, all that's required for us to immediately send you all of these Awards is for you to submit a poem to be formally presented at the convention. Additionally, we must also ask you for the necessary funds ($169.00 plus p+h) to cover the costs of the time and effort required to present your poem before the convention attendees both aloud and in writing, as well as the costs incurred in insuring and shipping to you these extremely bulky and heavy awards via Federal Express.  David, we are, of course, ultimately most interested in meeting you and having you personally present your artistry in front of the thousands of other poets who attend these live events. Unfortunately, this is not to be the case at this time, so we're trying to do the next best thing. But we sincerely hope to personally present you with your most deserved awards in the future.  Sincerely, Steve Michaels Convention Awards Chairperson      wow!! my own special award, a 200 dollar value, can be MINE for only 170 dollars!!   YES!! THANK YOU GENEROUS GODDESS OF LUCK!! How can you give me an award for something you have not seen? Oh wait, your not giving it to me.. I'm PAYING for it with my own fricken money. Thank you so much.
