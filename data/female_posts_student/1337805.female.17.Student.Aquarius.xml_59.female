Genius, ain't it?  Went to the Commenwelth with Lannie and Tyler last night. I saw faces from my past...Rite, from my old church. She's going to be gonig to my school in Sept, so I get to see her more. Avril, someone I've known for eeever and ever. Since I was in grade 4 maybe? She's one of my oldest friends, and it was so great seeing her again. Memories around...This year, no matter how busy and flustered I will be, will prolly be one of the best. It has to be the best.  My friends are now either in grade 9-12. This will be my last year with some of my older friends, before they go running off to the real world and leave me here. It's a scary year. Lots of pain, but I'll survive. I need a yearbook this year.  The worst has happened, as I thought life was getting perfect. That was a lie. I fell for Thomas, and I thought everything was going to be alright, I was gonan do this, and make myself proud. Now, especially after talking to him last night, I find myself wanting to be with this other guy. He's decided he's going to be single this week, and what do you know! Tom's gone too for this week. It's too horrible to think of...So I present the problem to my audience: If I'm only just dating Tom, and it hasn't even presented itself as a boyfriend/girlfriend mix (and I haven't asked him to be sure), would it be wrong to fool around with another guy?
