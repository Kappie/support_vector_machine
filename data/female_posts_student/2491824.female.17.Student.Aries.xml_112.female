At one part--when Jordan takes off his pants--I came on too early and forgot my first line after I came on there...  ...But no one noticed... Not even our director...  Last night I typed up the first scene of the play that I am directing--I'm directing the second scene of it-- but it disappeared. :( I might redo it tonight.  Oh, and I like my make-up. Leia did my make-up, as she always has for  Actor's Nightmare , and, tonight, I love it! I'm tempted to take a picture of myself, so I can look at it later and think, "Wow, I was hot that night!"...  I'm a dork.
