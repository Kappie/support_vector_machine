More reverent, carefree about things. There is hope in this world after all.  I've skipped my nap for today too, though I don't know how I'm going to make it through two hours of orchestra tonight. But I do get to talk to Sylvia, perhaps, and ask her if she really got into Stanford. I'm so happy for her, she deserves it every bit of the way though I don't know why Harvard didn't take her. I want to be like her in so many ways--actually, is that habit healthy? But I need people to look up to, to prod me into shape.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, I like Sylvia's foil (thanks for the word, Peter) less and less. Well, it'll never be hatred, no. But just remembering Hollywood Knights and her running around and just taking pictures and schmoozing with the "stars" while people like Anna were honestly diligent, and today when she was just looking over my shoulder in journalism at all the pictures she took at HK that night...they were all yellow in the dim of the gymnasium, too. But she wholly deserves what's coming: to get that kind of PSAT score, etc. and then just to decide to go where she's going. Well, I won't judge. I'm sure people think I am horrid too.  So it's a little after 4 and I have my Fe Bland Foundation application sitting to my right. I'm going to have to fill it out to night, as unpleasant as it may be, since I'm going to send it out tomorrow. And funnily, I don't think the application's what's bothering me now, it's going over the CD and the recorded clips again and making sure everything sounds at least passable. More than passable, I hope, I really do. Piano is probably the greatest, most persistent factor in my life that's kept me humble since I'm so apt to screw up in that area. I realize I've become more apathetic lately--Bach Festival is Saturday and I've pretty much prevented it from bothering me--but I don't want to fail. I know Wendy's right and that it's probably better to submit it knowing that you're going to make it and getting pleasantly surprised in mid-May, but I still want to put up a fight. Oh, well, the first page isn't that bad. I'll just take it step by step.  Mmmm, I got a B- on my Spanish test. I laugh now, but I don't know what happened. There's TEN rules of subjunctive? And in some cases I was simply too retarded to realize that the previous verb was in future, not conditional tense. Having missed nine on the grammar side, I'm going to go in at lunch next Wed. to learn it again. With half of the 4AP students, hah.  Oh man, tomorrow's Friday. And I have to stay after for journalism since it's the second to last day to work. As usual, I've procrastinated on the front page, and I have nothing set up right now. I wish they'd pass out locks so I could get a secondary picture to go with the one Austin is going to take tomorrow (this morning's plan evaporated after I couldn't find batteries and ended up blurting an expletive, to Mom's dismay). We've never tried a lead story with two pictures, and I think it'd be perfect for this one since Holmboe is so reluctant to give out information, anyways. But knowing school bureaucracy, I doubt we'll be lucky enough to catch any action by Monday, at the latest. I really wish I could talk to a professional journalist about front page layouts because mine turn out the same every time and I don't know if I should feel guilty: four-column, column on the left, lead story with horizontal rectangular picture, a secondary story. From what little glances I get, the LA Times seems to stay on pretty much one layout too, but I'd still like confer with someone and see if the static layout is ok.   And sometimes I feel like I'm letting Battaglia down too. Hands down, she's my favorite teacher. Actually, I like Novak and Freeman too, but they don't let me go through their Girl Scout cookies and candy, lol. Let's just say this: I used to be dependable. Now? I've gotten tired. I'll say again for this April issue that I'd still like to go through and do some copy editing, but it doesn't look like it's going to work. Dorothy's doing her first news page, though, so I hope she learns to get a feel for it herself. Mm, no offense but the center spread seems like it's too texty and prosaic. Pegleg won't stop telling me "EYES ON YOUR OWN SCREEN!" Amanda's page is cute with the curtains. Ah, but I am anal. Selfishly, I think: how much better would it be if I could go through every page and fix anything and everything that bothered me? But I can't. I already have a reputation for being an ogre, lol, and that USC copy editing workshop didn't help.  I must go, I dally too much. I hope I can credit invisible mode for a decent amount of time saved tonight.
