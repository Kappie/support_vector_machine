Heehee, I've spent most of my time when I haven't been out playing Rolocoaster Tycoon 2. I'm addicted :(   Coudln't sleep last night. Thought I'd get to bed earlyish but it was so hot and then once I finally got to sleep I woke up again then went back to sleep so all in all I slept about 3 hours last night before waking up at 8.15 by the sun streaming in through my white curtains. Gah. So I'm tired.
