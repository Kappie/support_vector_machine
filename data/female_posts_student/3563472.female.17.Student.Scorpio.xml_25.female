Can you imagine? A certain divinity that we all have inside of us.. the same divinity in everyone.  And leaving yourself to become part of it all. It's rather exciting actually!:D I mean.. those who have experienced are very diverse with religions that don't necessary link, and it's such an interesting concept. If we all have the same divine internal self (soul).. then we are all the same... in an eternal sense. Just thinking about it gets me excited.. because.. hate and love become pointless in a way. We spend our whole lives building relationships and associating ourselves with certain people, but if we're all the same in the end it seems sort of redundant. But if we all work for self improvement, maybe it'll improve everyone. I don't know if I buy into all of this, but I do find it extremely interesting.
