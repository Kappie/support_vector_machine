I got there a little late, but here is a recap...  We had a little food and fun and listened to Amanda Shelby.  Afterwards we drove towards to Kasso's house.  There we all unloaded--, whoops...  I failed to mention that Ryan did  REAR END MANDY !  HA HA HA, it was so funny!  Then we watched a few movies and about half of us left...  I was very sad, but kept my cool and head...  From then on it is quite hazy...  I just remember random rapes, gropes, screams, threats, farts, inferrings, munching, snoozing, waking, fearing, zipping, rolling, touching, fibbing (and finding), sticking, hiding, bullldozing, watching, eating, popping, honeying (is that a verb), putting (ITCHING POWDER ON EVERYTHING I OWN (FUCK YOU SUSAN, j/k)), and other things...  To put it lightly, it was one fat fucking frenzy or just an orgy...  It was a lot of fun and happy birthday to all.  As far as antics go...  Actually a lot of stuff happened.  First of all, Ryan and my prank failed.  Too many people found out (thanks Jason and Bryan) so it failed misreably!  However, Susan succedded in drenching my entire pillow with itching powder and making me very uncomfortable.  I spanked Maggie horribly at least three times (remember folks, that is the minimum).  Oh, I also pantsed Kassovic! HA HA HA, I saw her butt!  We all had a big fat pillow fights on more than one occasion during the night.  Also, everyone did their fair share of groping and touching and the above verbs.  There is the low down!  Enjoy!  or you can just FUCK THE PO-LICE!  :)
