So, I am moving in 11 days. It is exciting for me to be doing this whole thing all by myself...I feel like it will bring out the sides of me which have been sufficating because I have lived so long with the company of others. It will be nice to be able to stretch myself into a whole new environment for a while.   I almost killed my friend's fish this week. I almost became a murderer!!  See, it is a beta fish and the bowl was yucky so I tried to clean it, but didn't realize that I need to put de-oxygenated water in it.  Oops. I checked on the status of "Beta" the fish and so far so good.  My friend says that the fish is grumpy, but I think it is really his own feelings transfered from him to the fish...Freud would call it peojection....see, I am learning my psych stuff.   In other news...ummm...Ikea is having a sale. I need a couch. Or a futon, I am not picky. Nor am I being suggesive...that just isn't my nature :-P.  So with that I will get back to Freud and his penis, or lack thereof. Oh yeah, and if, as Freud thinks, Girls have penis envy then boys have boob envy because man oh man, if the proverbial "boobs" were on the other "chest" men would never leave the house.:)  See ya'll later Amanda
