Well don't you think that every one's different, with a different point? Or maybe we've all got the same point. Maybe it's to enjoy yourself and help others, but not every one keeps to that so maybe they find a different point. Mmm... maybe I should shut up and stop saying maybe. Does any one else think this deep or are my brain patterns just that weird? I guess the fact that no one gets our humor might tell me some thing... I think out loud too much don't I? But that's a good thing to do otherwise those thoughts just fly past? More sleep needed? I think so! Bubi sorry for being deep today.
