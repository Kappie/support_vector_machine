I hope the BPA (Blog Protection Agency) doesn't get a hold of this.  Since I've updated my other two blogs within a timespan of about 45 minutes, I can't say I have to much to say for the old community blog.  I survived Prom... and to tell you the truth, I would keep reliving the day over and over again just to keep myself out of reality.  Yes, even with the imprint from my headband.  It was an awesome day.  I knew what was coming, I mild to moderately seized the day, I had fun.  I got a little flustered at times, but it comes and goes.    I kinda wish I had a parlor talent.  You know, something neat I can whip out of my bag at parties that is instantaneously amusing to people.  People who can play piano and sing are really neat.  I might secretly dispise you for your talent, but I still think you're really neat.  It's only b/c I'm jealous.  Behold, the power of mediocrity.  It's Tuesday tomorrow.  There's not enough weekend in that Tuesday.  There REALLY needs to be more weekends in the spring.  Many many MANY more weekends.    I'm not really missing it, Bob, Manda
