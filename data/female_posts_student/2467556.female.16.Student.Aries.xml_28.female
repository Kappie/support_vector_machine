I didn't actually watch the game because i was at the movies with Brittany, but i heard it was awesome.  Me and Brittany went to go see Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King at 7:40pm last night.....which meant that frickin long movie thats 3hrs and 30 mins long.....didn't let out until 11:15.  Its ok, i had fun making fun of the movie the entire time....Brittany didn't like that though lol.  Ok the part where Frodo is standing on the cliff thing and is getting ready to drop the ring......yeah that was waaaaay too long of a scene.  He needed to just drop it and be done with it.  But nooooo, this is Lord of the Rings where we have to take 15 minutes to watch a stupid little annoying hobbit sit there and look all evil while comtemplating to drop the stupid ring in or not AND then decide not to AND then get his finger bitten off by another stupid ugly used-to-be hobbit when it could've been SO MUCH EASIER to just shove Frodo off the cliff and end the movie.  yeah.  If only a woman had been a part of the Fellowship of the Ring in the books/movies, the journey to the stupid mountain to destroy the ring would've gone sooo much faster and easier (lol Sarah and Kristen).  Haha oh yeah and after the movie when Brittany was going to call her parents and see who won the Stars game......her buttons on her cell except for one of the pointer buttons and zero DIED.  So we spazzed on the phone because we HAD to know who won the game!  It was amusing.  Oh man, do you know what kind of freaky people are at the mall at 11:30????  Scary people....people with no color coordination.....freaky pot smoking high skateboarder poser people.....*shiver*.  OMG there were all these little 6th graders at the mall at 11:30!!!!  I wasn't even allowed to go to the mall alone in the DAYTIME until i was about 13-14!!!  I would never let my children that were middle schoolers go to the mall past 9, ever.  Its just too dangerous.  I remember thinking that i would let my kids do that when my mom wouldn't let me go to the mall alone......but now i realized that she was right all along and that i wouldn't let my kids do that....darnit! why does she always have to be right about those things!    I also went to church this morning at VRBC, there was this lady with this really ugly pink and blue plaid dress thing on....ew.  The colors were correct for her skin color, but the plaid with the selected colors were ugly.  oh well.  During church, me and this hot guy (he looked hot from far away at least) were....ummm.....how do you put this......catching each others eye?  And we did that for most of the singing parts of the service.  And then i when i got up close, he wasn't really that good looking.  He was actually kinda...ew.....its ok though, he wasn't really my type anyways.  After church, i went to Krispy Kreme with Sarah, Kristen, Kendra and the gang.  We turned in our bulletins from church and got a free donut, it was awesome.  Then we went to Fazoli's and ate alot of italian food......and talked about a funny movie we should make in which someone flirts with the picture of the boy on the coke fountain machine and freaks everyone in the restaurant out and then tape your phone number to the machine.  Don't try to understand, it was funny at the time.    I looked for jobs today and i found 2 online applications.  One for AMC Theatres and one at the Dr. Pepper Star Center in wherever.  I thought about working at Starbucks but i dunno if i could deal with the smell of coffee for that long of periods at a time.  if you have any ideas of where i could possibly work.....please let me know.  Alright, gotta go......4 MORE DAYS UNTIL THE STARS GAME WITH BRITTY AND JESS!!!! YAAAAY!!!  Go Stars!, ~~~Taylor~~~
