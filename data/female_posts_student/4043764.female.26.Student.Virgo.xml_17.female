All cultural critiques – I  am,  after all, the “culture critic” who is seeking a home - will be based upon stories from the “news”, television, articles... I don’t have a television yet, though I will be paying for cable, it seems. Perhaps I should break down and invest in the television and get the money from the roommates later.      I am not sure where people who read my blog stand on this celebrity gossip drivel, but sometimes these stories elucidate more complex social phenomena. In this case, I'm just being one of the celebrity-obsessed hoi polloi. This Nicky Hilton business does not elucidate phenomena as much as it confirms what we already know: money matters often influence decisions to marry, and rich men like to marry young women. It is a bonus if the young woman is also rich. (On a side note, it is funny to me that atlbb brought this Nicky Hilton wedding to my attention; she really tries her best to keep out of the pop culture loop.)    Anyway, I read  urlLink this article  about the Vegas wedding… Nicky Hilton married a money manager from New York who is nearly 15 years older than she. They want you to know (in other articles I skimmed): It’s okay, though; they’ve known each other for years. And they had an 18-month courtship.            The quote from the article that I feel  demonstrates  the doomed nature of this younger woman/older man-rich man/richer woman relationship:             “this is a real, meaningful loving relationship…” Is there an assumption that these two got married for other reasons? Jesus-aged money manager + barely post-adolescent heiress = real, meaningful, loving relationship. Maybe we should get a  urlLink precocious South Boston-reared janitor     in here to work out this equation, it’s so mindboggling.             I’ve devoted too much time to this crud already.             DRUNK WHITE PEOPLE.     Last night, I met a fellow student. He was interesting, mostly because of his views on the world, his work in Ghana, his devoted and demonstrable solidarity with all black people he sees on the street, his aversion for bars… I asked him why he's been coyly avoiding entering bars in the square. He whispers, in mock secrecy: "Drunk white people." Well, how long  have you  been living in Boston?
