Well it's not like I didn't do anything today, but I feel like I am a very boring person, I probably am.  No one is ever willing to tell you things like that, and that might be good...that could be a little  too  honest.  It would be quite surprising, to hear someone come out with something completely honest.  Not that people aren't honest...but everyone always holds back at the very least one thing they think about you...whether it's good  or  bad.  I'm a dork.  I am finally getting back to reading Dude, Where's My Country.  After reading a little more than a quarter of it I had to take a break in order to finish some other books that needed to be completed for assignments.  It's quite funny, he's a funny guy.  I've been meaning to see Rodger  Me, but I haven't gotten around to it...I forget, because well...I do that sometimes, a lot of the time.  It's almost Christmas...but I must say it feels nothing like it.  Maybe because of the lack of snow. I feel kind of odd...considering that christmas is all about the celebration of the birth of christ...and yet my beliefs have changed.  What is it for now? But I will have to attend mass anyways...because we do every year...and it's just something I have to do(parentals...) I hate Christmas Eve mass.  It's extremely crowded because all the people that show up are those that pretend they are good catholics when really this is probably the only time they ever  really  think of their beliefs...they would feel guilty if they didn't go because it's what Christmas is supposed to be about...religion...not gifts. So they show up to sing songs and pretend like they are listening to the priest while in their heads they are thinking of what they will be doing when they get home.  Have they forgotten anything? Are all the presents wrapped? They come Christmas Eve rather than Christmas because it would be inconvenient to go Christmas day...they have to open presents and getting ready that early isn't really an option, it would be much more enjoyable if they didn't have to go to church on christmas. Well...at least that's my thought of the majority of the people that show up Christmas eve...that's the one day of the year they attend.  I'm done.   I'm going to go sleep.
