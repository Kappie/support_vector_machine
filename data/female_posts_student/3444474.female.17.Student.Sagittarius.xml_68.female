But damn, that strawberry filling was good. I'll regret it, infact I do, I should've only eaten half. But daaaaaaaaaamn. I guess that means no lunch for me! Oh well.   Today I get my allstars!! Yay! Well, atleast I hope I get my allstars today. I don't really have a lot of money on me at this point in time, and I refuse to take any out. The 400 in the bank STAYS in the bank.   My confusion still stands, but that's later.   Tonight I'm going to see the  Brighton Beach Memoirs  with Cameron and possibly Dewey. Should be fun :D   In other news, I need to make my bed, it's fucking bugging me again. gah!
