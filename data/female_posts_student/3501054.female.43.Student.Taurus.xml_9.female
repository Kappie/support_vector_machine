Cars and gasoline. Air Conditioning. Jobs ---even for $5 per hour. Laundromats. Here, I see people washing their clothes in a polluted stream, scrubbing them on rocks. Dogfood is not sold and all the dogs are skinny and sick. Horses are fed on the side of the road because one family owns ALL the land. Horses are the transportation for anyone who can{t walk that far or can not afford a broken down American Schoolbus that doubles in its new life as a bus service for long distances. Cats do not live past age 2 because of disease. they were imported. Daily thunderstorms knock out the powergrid for the town almost every other day.... which also means no water. The water here is not safe to drink. It will give you Dysentery, Cholera and a host of ugly parasites. There is no trash pick up. Telephones are rare. The only jobs are tourista shops and the farms belonging to a single family. If you are born here...your life expectancy is about 60 years...if you make it past age 15. Thank God tonight. And instead of sending missionaries to save the souls of these people....send the corps of engineers. Love, Evelyn
