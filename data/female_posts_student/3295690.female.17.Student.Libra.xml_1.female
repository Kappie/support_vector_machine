But that's not really the point of this post, Dear God did I have an eventful weekend!!!   I guess I should start with Friday, seeing as Thursday just sucked the cock and had no real purpose. :P So... Friday... Got up early and did Pre-Bond for Arrie and Dain and then figured out that I had the times wrong and was actually an hour late! *blushes* But yes, ended up being late to school, which was fine, soldiered on through the day and went shopping with the boys in the afternoon, and then convinced them all that we should all go and see After Juliet again, because I'd promised Starkey I'd go with her and Leva.  Anyway, the play was good again, although I think the first time I saw it was better...   And afterwards, we stuck around to talk to the cast, and who should come up to me but A? Yes, that's right, he told me to come back in a couple hours and pick him up after the cast and crew had finished packing up, so I did... 10.30 I picked him up, and we went to his place and hung out for a while, and the cruised over to the Drama Crew After Party, which sucked. A lot. As in, they were sitting there watching Mary and Frederic's Royal Wedding, so A and I shot through and ended up going to a party at Squalor Lodge after being charged a ridiculous amount of money for a bottle of Bacardi and some cans of rum  coke.    So yes, for those of you who happen to be uneducated, the Lodge is the house of the O'Farrell brothers, and their mother Margo.  My sister, who gets along famously with me, happens to be friends with the older o'Farrell brother who no longer lives at the Lodge, and yet still her generation continues to party there almost every weekend.  So yes, myself, A, Meumann, Ian and Gin all ended up there, surrounded by mostly my sisters friends and a bunch of people who we didn't know, and I proceeded to get myself very drunk.  'Twas great.  Anyway, I ended up having some great conversations with those of my sisters friends who I knew (Sam, Tristan, Jem, Margo, and Bec's paralytic boyfriend Jon) and somehow managed to get myself in the kitchen drinking shots with a guy who called himself Luke, and I later coined Luke Skywalker.  Luke Skywalker spent about an hour telling me how I shouldn't fuck with him because there were people after him man, he stole $500,000 of cocaine off a guy who held a knife to his throat, and he has millions stored away, millions, and he's a dangerous fucker, only now he's out of all that shit and works at the caz for $25 an hour.  My arse you did, Skywalker. Obviously Jedi's can lie. :P And several times throughout the night, Skywalker told me "but don't worry baby, it's all good sweetie" and tried to kiss me.  Horny fuck.  I don't care if you're remotely goodlooking when I'm pissed as a fart, keep your filthy lying paws off me. *nod*  Another thing that happened, A, being the touchy feely guy he is hugged me and kissed my cheek several times throughout the night, and Sam actually asked me if we were together. *blink* How strange... A and I are definitely not together, whatever doubts in my mind about his feelings or mine or whatever, we're not together and God knows I wouldn't want to be with him. *nods* He's just so... Him! But anyway, off track again...  So, after leaving the Lodge at around 4.30am in my very own drunken stupor, with a not-so drunken A, and not-particularly-drunk-at-all Meumann and Ian, after Gin having gone home because she was so scared of everyone already, I got myself through the front door only to have my mother scream at me about going up to my sister's place and letting herself and her boyfriend inside.  My immediate thought was; 'Oh fuck, he's left them at the Lodge somewhere' so I left my mates at my place and got a lift back up to the Lodge, where I saw a shirtless Wil o'Farrell with a strange scratch on his back, and grabbed his hand and asked him to help me search for them... But then I started to remember that Jon - the idiot - had wanted to drive  himself home, so I'd taken his keys and put them in his back pocket.  So up to Bec's place we go, and yes... That's right... They were still in his back pocket. :P Ridiculous, I know.  The ride home was interesting, to say the least.  My mother flew into a spontaneous fit of rage at me, and by the time we got inside, I was in tears and I ended up walking out and slamming the front door, leaving my mates to deal with my mother.  Bad of me, I know, but keep in mind all of my alcohol had been consumed at that point. :P So anyway, A runs after me and I proceed to embarrass myself with retellings of a neglected childhood and shite.  Anyway, he talked me into coming home, where he and Ian decided it was best to leave and I put Meumann to bed in the spare room.  (Wow, this is turning out to be quite long!)  Yes. Well. Saturday just consisted of a long overdue Maccas run, a shopping trip I really didn't need, feeling terrible for my friend Pheebs who got ripped at a party she went to on Friday and had the guy of her dreams tell her the next morning that they were "just friends", went to see Van Helsing which freaked me out incredibly because of those fucking vampires, and then went to Scotties... I was just sooo tired though, so I ended up coming home really early!  And yet still, not much sleep that night because Hami decided he felt the need to come over and talk to me until 2.30am and explain why he'd been acting like a dick to me all night. Men... fucking men, they're so confusing!   Anyway, after shit all sleep, I went to work all day yesterday, and then to my Dad's for tea with Bec, and got another night with shit all sleep and have been at school all day. This afternoon was another Edge arvo, I went on the radio again for an hour a day which is actually going to be a fortnightly occurrence from here on, Mondays 4-5(GMT+10) http://www.edgeradio.org.au for those of you who'd like a listen/squiz! And right now I've just got this strange... Regretful(?) feeling in me for some reason... Maybe it's because God knows why but I can't get Wil out of my head, or maybe its because Chutes will be going to Kakadu on Sunday and Ian to Japan on Thursday, and I'm really going to be feeling the stress of not having my outlets here for most of the holidays, or... I don't really know.  I just feel this strange regret sinking inside me and I don't know what its about.  Anyway, peace out guys, this has been one long frazzled entry about nothing in particular, so congrats to you if you actually read it!  Lotsa love, Sims xoxo
