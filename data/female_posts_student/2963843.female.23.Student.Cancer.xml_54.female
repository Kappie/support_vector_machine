ABSOLUTELY ROCKS!!  It is worth every cent.. ahh... I love them! Very rock n roll... Reminds me of Oasis's old songs... The wondewall era... Ahh....  ROCK N ROLL FOREVER!!  Okok.. now I'll tell you what happened on friday.. I went clubbing on thursday with Jand found out what a fine piece of meat I am.. hahaha.... But I felt like a bimbo.. I actually let 2 guys i didn't know send me home!! I'm just damn lucky that they were pretty nice guys.. Was given a dressing down by Don when I told him about it.. I told him that J was in the car with me too.. He said, yeah, that's good, more meat for the wolves.. sheesh... Okie I was actually regretting it halfway.. Scared I must say.. Stupid gal!!! They told me that there is no nightbus.. But there is! I have not been clubbing for quite a while but they must have! Anyway I gave 2 guys my number in return so its not totally free.. BUt anyway they were pretty cool when I told them I am attached..  That's it. I'm never gonna be so gullible again.. I'm just god damn lucky..
