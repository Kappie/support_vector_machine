For one, I wouldn't be sick so I could make the most of my time. But then maybe something wouldn't have happened. Like I wouldn't have found my awesome prom dress. Why does time have to be so complicated? I mean its there, then its gone. If you try to change it, something even potentially worse could end up happening. Like- you make someone mad and per chance it causes a global war somewhere in the near future. Time is pissant. I hate time. People say, why can't life be fair? Its because time and life skip heinously through a field of your dreams and kick the petals as if they were nothing, and are nothing.    I'm a deep thinker  But only when I don't want to be. I was just sitting, thinking about if I wanted to ask someone to my prom when all of the sudden I started thinking about time. Maybe because my birthday is coming up soon, and my closest friends won't be here. It's weird that I had to go all the way to chicago to find them. I want them to be there really badly, but I know that's not going to happen. So- time sucks. I wish so much that I could be back there in summer '03 kicking it with the top minds (and some top losers) and laughing it up with all those guys. I'm gonna miss that the most this summer. Not being able to hang out with them, or cram with them, or slack-off the work with them.    I sound like some sentimental freak  Yea, its been hitting me hard lately. I don't want to grow up. I want to be like wendy and fly off with the hot peter pan to never-never land, and stay there. Its almost not far the way a person has to grow up. First your 5 and having a good ol' time finger painting and napping, then next thing you know your an Adult. You have to make your own discisions and pay the bills and go to work. It hardly seems fair.   Anyways  I should really stop blabbing because I have some last minute homework to do. Bonne nuit.
