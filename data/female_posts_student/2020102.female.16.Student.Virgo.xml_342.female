She also turned the front lights on, even though it's the middle of the day, and my dad asked her about this, why are the lights on, it's the middle of the day, and she said "I know, it's fine, they can stay on" and I said, "do you think we can't flip a switch when it gets dark outside...?" It's the first time my parents have left us alone overnight but really, how is it different from them leaving my sister and me alone any other time.   My mom also went to the store (to stock up on food for the pending apocalypse that is sure to come about, due to our being left home alone overnight) and she bought MORE cat toys (we do NOT have enough already) and one of them is a little football that is blue and yellow and squeaks when you squeeze it. It looks and sounds more like a dog toy than a cat toy. My cat is evidently terrified of the noise it makes, and this fills my sister with much glee, as she is currently chasing him around the house squeaking it at him. It's sort of entertaining to see his tail get all poofy, like it always does when he's freaked out or intimidated by something, but after a while I sort of feel sorry for him, and if he's hiding under the bed you can't see him flipping out anyway so what is the point.
