Creasy, a heavy-drinking, spiritually bankrupt former military assassin who picks up a job as a body guard for the daughter of a wealthy couple in Mexico City. It is a place, the movie reminds us, where abduction is common and often fatal. Man on Fire is a movie of high ambition, dressed up in jazzy, jittery style. All the flash and dash that director Tony Scott (  Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State  ) brings to the screen apparently is meant to obscure the fact that, minus its artistic cloaking devices and big budget, the movie is really just another rampaging-avenger flick. Deep down inside, it is no more sophisticated than, say,   Walking Tall  .   Not too many R-rated revenge pics depend on   Uptown Girls   star Dakota Fanning for the stronger scenes. Yet once the ten year old star exits the picture,   Man on Fire   starts blowing a lot of smoke. Once on the job, he bonds with the 9-year-old girl in his charge (the brilliant Dakota Fanning) and thereby finds a reason to keep living. So when the unthinkable happens to her, he's happy to devote himself to tracking down and eliminating the gangsters and corrupt cops responsible.  The plot contains several twists and tangents that give it the gloss of a sophisticated thriller, but they are for the most part too predictable to lend much depth. Among Creasy's allies are a former comrade-in-arms called Rayburn, a confusing character played well by Christopher Walken. But despite the phenomenal performances by the stars of the movie, Scott indulges in maddeningly fussy camera and sound-editing techniques that Tony's director brother, Ridley Scott (  Gladiator  ), knows to ignore. I felt this movie could have been another tremendous tale of revenge, ala   Kill Bill  , if only it had been under the direction of someone like Quentin Tarantino.   When it is all said and done. There are too many flaws in this movie for the actors to overcome. Scott's hyperactive style - and about 20 minutes of excess footage - cannot masquerade the same-old story that lies beneath.
