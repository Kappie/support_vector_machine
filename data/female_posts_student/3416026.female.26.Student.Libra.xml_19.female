Anyhow, today Pagesix.com reports that P. Diddy is bringing a copy of the Declaration of Independence to his 4th of July White Party.    Will it be displayed on a bed of white silk and diamonds?  Read aloud by   urlLink Mario Winans ?  Or what if they like, assumed the voices of England and the U.S., with England all, "Gave you extra cheese (c'mon), put you in the SUV You wanted ice so I made you freeze Made you hot like the West Indies (that's right) Now it's time you invest in me Cause if not then it's best you leave Holla, yeah"  It just doesn't stop with him.  I am such a sucker for shamelessness.  Read for yourself  urlLink here .
