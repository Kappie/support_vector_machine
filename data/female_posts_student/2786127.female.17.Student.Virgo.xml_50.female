I also figured out that younger generations are getting more and more sexually savvy. Disgusting. Thats my sister...she needs to be sheltered from these things.  I've also found out what lindsay really feels about our situtation. I was talking to her brother today, and found out that her and I are "cool" now, but that we can never be friends again. What the hell, is all i have to say. I hate this person she's become. I want the Lindsay i love back, not this selfish little bitch that decided to take over her brain. I understand that she's upset about this Ryan situation, and I feel for her, but why does she have to hate me because of it? She acts like i have no right to be upset about any of this either. Hence the selfish. I'm so beyond frustrated right now, I can't express it enough. And theres absolutely nothing i can do about it. If I talk to her about it, it's like fueling a fire...she'll just flare up and freak out at me some more. Nothing I could say would get through to her, I'd just piss her off more. Therefore, I'm stepping back and not careing until she decides to be herself again.   God. I hate boyfriends and what they do to people.
