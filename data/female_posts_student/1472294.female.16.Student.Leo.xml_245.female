I was early, I was able to get the poster, it looked quite nice and cool, a winter look picture. Listening to Track no. 5, 'Bounce', very catchy and nice. Very different from the 1st album where there were many pop songs, now there are ballads and a little R and they surely have matured through their songs. They even have one song written by Toro, ex-member from Energy, 'For You', very slow and sweet. I heard the members of 5566 love this song very much. I think I have kinda take a fancy on Toro, his hair is nice, so does the songs he sang for his debut drama... Ooops, too much pop. Now I will insert a survey to fill up the blanks... Here goes!   who do you wanna   kill: No one physical in particular. Everybody deserve a little chance and love... Whoa, suddenly I have became so forgiving! talk to: My friends, they are so busy with their school life. Actually one did called me in the afternoon to meet up with her to shop for clothes. But I was short of money after purchasing 5566 and topping up my money. Hiaz... kiss: Nobody in particular too. Coz I am wearing braces and looked so hideous, haha!   favorites   food: Nothing really in paricular. But Tarimisu came first on my mind, although I have only eaten once. cd: None. As long I like it, that will be ok. But I kinda like Ayumi's ballads coz it is very slow and sweet... Maybe my all- time favourite. candy: Anything that doesn't stick to my teeth... animal: Dogs are fine. I used to have a pair of Quails.  song: Pop, ya, I know. It harms you, dehydrates and kill your brains. But it liven up my mood! vegetable: No all time favs. But if you give me vegetables, I eat. fruit: Same as veg...   right now   clothes: A greyish Snoppy (really from the Snoppy shop) shirt and a pair of blue shorts. Talk about color co-ordination... mood: Awake. Just had a nap for 1 1/2 hour. make-up: None. I am in my house leh. But if I am out, I will normally put a little lip gloss over lip balm coz my mouth cracked a lot. It also helps to add a little more glossy- look. That's all. smell: Nothing. I never sweat nor came out from a bath. It's like just there. refreshment: Water and sometimes some swet drinks like honey water, Qoo packet drink or syrup with water... Am I too simple? worried: Like the money I will be getting for CNY and what exactly I should wear coz I only have two new blouses and no more new clothes... hair: Longer but not straighter any more *boo hoo* annoyed at: My stomach, cramps... *Ouch* song: 5566's Boyfriend, very nice... *dreamy look*
