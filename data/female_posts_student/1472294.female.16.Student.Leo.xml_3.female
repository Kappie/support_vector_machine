While doing, I was watching the last episode of Duke Of Mount Deer 2000. Very sad for the last three episodes. I mean, Wei Xiaobao was 'excuted', one of his wifes was dead and he had to end off his friendship with Kang Xi.... Haiz... But everything turned out quite well. But actually I already knew the ending, like twenty episodes ago... I was clever enough to surf all the lead actor's fans' website and I was so fortunate to find this die- hard fan captured all the episodes screenshots and I clicked it all the way to the end. And I told one of my die- hard Channel U friend and she did not believe me. Ha! Let's see what she will say for the last episode.... I hope I will be able to buy a Super Dollfie during my June holidays through the net. But I think I cannot accomplish the 'mission', it is so expensive and I REALLY hope I can get a Lucas male Super Dollfie.... ((o-_-o)''
