I AM WRITING/CREATING/OR WHATEVER A BLOG!!! Hmm... what should I type in... I'm lost... Well... this is my first blog(you should know by now)... I am a genius... I love Music(a bit biased - ONLY Yanni's! my msn chatmates can tell you!)... AND HARRY JAMES POTTER(referring to the book and only to the Harry Potter Books) IS MY FUTURE HUSBAND! Oh yesh: I'm a Hogwarts ambassador!     You will by now know my likes... I'm a person with a VERY narrow mind... WHAT I SAY IS RIGHT... and believe me... it BETTER BE! *smiles... I'm a genius*     I'm currently listening to the CD Dare to Dream... by: (You guessed it) Yanni... I'M IN LOVE WITH THE SONG 'NICE TO MEET YOU'!!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NICE!!! I recommend everyone to listen to his music... and I beg all those who haven't read all the Harry Potter books to go and make Dobby proud by hitting yourself with a shoe(this goes to Sian Ying too)...     Lemme go and call upon my friends to see this thingy or blog entry or whatever... and get comments!     Oh Yesh... and one more thing that YOU MUST REMEMBER AT ALL COSTS!!!: I'm a genius *smiles, stands up straight, all hail Radhika*    Ok... shall come back sooner than you think: hogwarts_ambassador :D
