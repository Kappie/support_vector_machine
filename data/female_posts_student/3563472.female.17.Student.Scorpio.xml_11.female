I've never been quite so excited to buy a book. So yay for that!  Relay for Life is tomorrow! I'm rather excited about it!! WAHOO.. The only thing that sucks is that I have to work the next morning. Oh well, I'll get over it.   Lordy I'm bored.  God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater  I'm the Queen of cheese and everything good in this world.
