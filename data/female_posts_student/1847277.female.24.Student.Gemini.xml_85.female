Now I just need to find out from whence I will be flying.  I mean, I know I'll be flying from London, but I don't know which airport.  But it means I get to travel with Dave.  Wheee!  I met with Rachel, and it looks as though I will be able to work with the Philippine collection.  So now I have to get ready to spend many hours with deformed crania and old school ethnographies/travelers accounts.  It actually should be really interesting, though.  And, it seems like I have a lot of potential funding opportunities, which is sweet.  Of course, I cannot automatically assume that I will receive the funding.  If I do, though, I will be able to fund both the trip to Israel and the trip to South Africa next winter.  Meaning I can save more money for future expenses, like weddings and furniture and maybe even my dissertation field work if I get screwed funding-wise down the road.    So, things are looking up.  I am SO glad that this semester is happy.  Of course, as always there are down points, three of which come to mind:  1) Matt still lives in Ohio, 2) the cat vomited all over the downstairs when I was talking on the phone to Santiago (cutting off my phone call), and 3) my lower back has been hurting like a bitch.    Ah well.  It balances out, I suppose.  You can't have it all...
