We're playing Orlando Ramble (I play one note for about 75% of the song.), Cocoanut Cakewalk, I kinda like that one, The Gospel medly,(for woodwinds and in which, if the other second flute doesn't show up, I have a solo which I really don't want) Gold and Silver Waltzes, LONG!!!, The Pink Panther, (I get the cool part!!!), I bought be a cat, Don't get me started, and When I am 64, which I would like to play. On Sunday I am playing the Gold nad Silver Waltzes and Cocoanut cakewalk. If you would like to come, Saturday is from 4-4.30 and SUnday is at 7 pm.  Okay. Yeah. Nathan was right last time with the quote. Read his explanation. I will provide another one next time. You're new quote is Forsan miseros meliora sequentur. And GO! Okay Well....more tomorrow after the concert of Doom. I think people will be running away from us, or perhaps playing us to stop....  "I never tire of being useful."
