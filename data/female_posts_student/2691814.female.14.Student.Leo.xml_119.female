I'll have to sit in the back with this huge dog just looking out the window, laying down, barkin at other dogs...what fun. But i guess it'll be worth it..i want to see mom but not in a hospital. I wish she didnt have to have surgery...she even said 'if anything happens always know that i'll be with you in spirit' omg..and i was watching a sad show so, ya it just made my life hell lol. Oh well, anyway, ya, nothing really going on other than what i just told you. Oh ya, I don't have a door to my room..reminds me of 'Freaky Friday' where they take off her door. Yup everytime i go to my room now im so used to having a door i just swing my arm like its there and then i feel so stupid cuz its not there. Its pretty funny tho.
