They just take quiz after quiz after quiz!  went bowling with tiffany, allie, Christy, and Brandon. It was fun. I won second place with a whopping 67 points.   although summer is quite nice, it is also quite awful. There is positively nothing to do except eat, which I will not be doing, or exercise, which I am sick of doing.   Lauren invited me to spend the night---I need a good excuse to stay home. I have to wash my hair? I'm expecting a telegram?  I suppose I'll start another necklace then..   by the way.. Do you we like the audio blogger??? Because I think it's really nifty.
