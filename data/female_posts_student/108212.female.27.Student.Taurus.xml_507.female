I think I will invest on buying another computer soon coz I swear it always lags on me. Anyhoo, now I understand the power of those darn jibberish! I don't think I'll do anything with those tags anytime soon. I'm going to have to consult with you first! ~hehe~ Thanks for calling and taking the time to once again save my big behind! Have a good weekend!
