She also said that a young african american kid about 13 years old was in the truck and he died.  I thought about it and it didnt really hit me that, that really happened I mean I thought that was awful and I cant believe that happened.  I went outside and ran a mile and then came in and took a shower that was still kinda on my mind some kid in alvarado just died today how could that happen he was a little boy prolly just havign fun why does he have to die.  Well I then went to pick up my little brother and him and my little cousin went with me to go get some apple pies.  When we got back my aunt called and asked to speak to my little brother and I thought something bad had happened b/c she nevers wants to talk to my little brother b/c she just talks to my mom so I just knew then that it wasnt good.  After my little brother got off the phone he came out of his room and you could tell he was crying so I asked him what was wrong and he said one of his friends just died and I knew that it was the kid with Justin.  I just heard from Sarah that one of the kids was the little boy who died (Bruce) brother was in the car too he made it well he is ok but when he found out his little brother died he lost it this is awful.  How would someone be able to live knowing that they survived and their little brother died.  Well I know that there is a reason for this but it is so hard to understand.  So please make time and pray for the other three who did survive the accident and for Bruces family they will need it.  Always drive safe and god bless Bruce and his brother and family and the other two.   Love ya'   Jess
