I hope those two concepts never connect.  I'm bothered by roadkill somehow. Austin delights in it. We have a snake on Lakeview at present. I won't forget the first time I saw a dead snake on the road: there were insects climbing all over it. The more I drive, the more I see. I console myself, it's natural! But is it? It isn't.  I saw a license plate that had something off-centered. It bothered me somehow, sitting at the intersection.  I couldn't concentrate in piano today. Everything was just noise in the afternoon: the Spanish music playing for the cleaners, their laughter, the vacuum, doors, the television.  Well, I know when I'm tutoring now. 7:30 and then 2-4 on Thursday. I hope I'll be able to help, I'm rusty on Algebra 2. Well, not rusty. I just don't know enough math above it to do well.   I have vocab to do. It's a blah day. Cloudy, though, which is nice. Which would be nice if I weren't so tired to start with.
