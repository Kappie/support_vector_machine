GOOD GRIEF- I could really use some excitement in my life.  Right now, it's all just band and hw.  So feel free to spice things up.  I don't care if it's something that's good or bad- I just need something to worry about or think about or talk about or do.. just SOMETHING!  *sigh* now that that's out of the way... if anybody would like to come to my sister's piano concert this Sunday, let me know- it should be super cool!  And the more people cheering her on, the less nervous she'll be!  Or so I hope...  Oh!  *siren/strobe lights*  Cool song alert!  "Liberate" by Disturbed.  This song ROCKS.  A lot.  It's got so much rock-age that I can't even describe it.  So go download it!  Check it out- I promise you'll like it.  Except for the slight profanity.... *ahem*  Alright, that's all for tonight.  I have math homework to attend to.  Until next time!
