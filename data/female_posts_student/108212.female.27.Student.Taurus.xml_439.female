I locked us all out and when we tried to get back in it set off an alarm.  I ended up having to wake one of my bosses' to get a key since I had locked everything inside including my cell phone and my keys.  It was so scary.  Now that I think about it I'm glad Matt didn't leave his keys in there or we would have been screwed, he was the one that drove me to my boss' house.  Everyone at work thought it was funny including both my bosses, and the alarm ended up being the for the business next door.  The whole time though I was thinking that the cops would be there by the time I had got the keys and they would have busted the glass doors already.  Whew!  I still cringe thinking about it.    By the way, I put Matt and Jude in our $30,000 tanning beds and ended up frying both of them.  They are still burnt and bitching to this day.  He!  He!  He!  Jenni
