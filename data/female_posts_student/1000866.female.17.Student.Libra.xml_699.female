She didn't get ANY of the three messages I sent her. So, she didn't know I wasn't coming. :( Oh well. At least it's all cleared up now and she knows. I feel really bad though. I hope she didn't think I just ditched her or anything. Well, I'm glad I called her then at least.   Yesterday was great though. I really liked Northwestern. The campus is beautiful, but it's so difficult to get into the school. I don't know if I can get in.   Loyola was nice too. It was smaller...obviously...but, it was still nice. We didn't get a chance to look at De Paul and we only got a glance at UIC so, this week I think I'm going to De Paul at some point. And then UIC sometime later. Good times. Good times indeed.   I must get going since it's father's day and...I'm going to go spend time with my father. Heh. :) YaY! It shall be fun. Things are getting better between us lately. I hope it stays that way.
