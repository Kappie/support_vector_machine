I could get my head around it anyday! *you're head maybe... but you're butt...* Grr... Anyway, go download it! It's good *very confusing* but still good. Sad at the end, but hey I didn't cry!  Black Cat Banzai (1933), in which Japanese toys defeat an evil Mickey Mouse.  *Damn I never put quotes in the right place*  urlLink http://animezone.co.uk/anime/history.htm  What a cool idea for propoganda!!!
