At one point the bear who used to be a human tells a bear cub that his brother was killed by a monster (when it was a bear, sort of) and then later in the movie the cub says that the monsters were really scary, especially when they carried sticks.  It was really sad.  Anyway it got me to thinking, and it all comes back to a quote...We do not see things as they are. We see things as we are. -- Anais Nin...What all have I missed?
