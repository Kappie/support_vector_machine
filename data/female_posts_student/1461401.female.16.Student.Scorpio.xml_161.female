I'm kinda hoping Amber will take me since she'll be up from college this weekend, but I don't really know if she'll be let in or not. Let's just say I have complete faith in the fact that no one will notice she graduated last year. 8-11, I know where I'll be. Mr. Dever really went out of his way to get the big gym this year... (sarcasm) I dunno. I'm just tired, and I still have so much work to do. I wish I had someone to really talk to...
