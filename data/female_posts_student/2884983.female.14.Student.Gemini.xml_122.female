'tis true. :3nod: apparently no one likes to read or commment on my blog either, and you know I cant really blame them. all I do is babble about nonsensical nonsense and otehr stuff. this guy on gaia just gave me 1000 gold. :) I am so special. people never give me things without a reason...*is suspicious now*  :ninja: lol. wow I am really a loser and gee willikers I bash myself alot! my goodness i have no self esteem! I think I should go jump off  bridge XD lol:)_ I love having no life. as much as I complain about not having a life I really dont mind it. it is REALLY boring and makes me feel lazy and fat but I DONT CARE!! I love being lazy, although I really am not all that lazy. like yesterday I swept and vacumed...WITHOUT BEING ASKED!! be proud of me!! weee aaarreee thee chaaammpppiiioonnsss...ooff thheee wooorrrlllddd. not really but we can hope, me gorlock, herman and my trusty other sidekick Frilly the Fridge. >. .
