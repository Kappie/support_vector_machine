And I don't really feel like retyping all this stuff I did today, so I'm just going to copy paste from an e-mail i wrote to anna some of it might not make sense, because it's like in response to an e-mail she sent me and I really can't be bothered to edit it out...  hey there,      you shouldn't have written to me i have absolutely nothing to say. My life is really really boring. Um, there's this really hot guy at camp, Billy. (i can get past the name) He's another counselor, don't worry I'm not a pedophile. He's our age.  HE HAS FREAKING DREADLOCKS. It's amazing. Don't worry, he's black so it's not dirty. But unfortunately he lives in LA, he's just visiting his grandparents here. sigh oh vell. Also today being the last day of camp and all (and there was much rejoicing, yay) we rented a waterslide. It's like a vertical inflatable slip 'n' slide. Well at the end of camp when all the kids went home like a dozen counselors (myself and billy included) went on the deflating (because we were so heavy all together... or alone in some cases cough NORM cough) in like torrential rain in our clothes. It was AMAZING. so fun. plus I got my pay check. plus camp is freaking OVER. alright moving right on along. Tonight I'm going to my aunts house because my parents are going to cape may for a wedding and my sister is going to some party thing. I would stay home alone, but we don't have a tv, or air conditioning, or food. So I opted to invite myself over to my aunts. But this also means I have to go to another wedding with her tomorrow, but that's kinda good too because I can wear my new pretty polkadot dress I got at V generation. Anyway so going back to the camp topic. All the kids were playing limbo. And like if they touched the bar the were out so we could find a winner. So that damned little drag queen riley touched the bar. And I'm like "Riley, go stand against the fence until the game's over, you touched the bar." and he's all "no i didn't" and i'm all "goddammit riley stand against the fence" only a little cleaner. And he argued with me for like five minutes and then went running crying to steve. I'm like ok WHATEVER. But then running there he stepped on a bee and got stung. I laughed my ass off. KARMA. wow, so much for absolutely nothing to say. Well at least you'll have something to do for a while. i.e. read this. I'll just wait till you get back from maine to get the cds. Wow I can't believe it took up three. I didn't think I chose that much. But then again i really did pick a lot. bahahahhahahaha. ok well i gata go and shower all the grass out of my hair. much love, allie p.s. madeline's not wearing pants.
