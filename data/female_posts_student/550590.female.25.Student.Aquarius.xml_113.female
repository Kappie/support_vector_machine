To answer the inevitable, no Workers Comp has absolutely nothing to do with my job at the Sheriff's Office and no I haven't gotten a different job.  I get CEUs and lots of free office supplies and I get to dress up all fancy on Sunday night.  That and I get out of the office for 3 days--woohoo!!  Then next week Thomasito will be in town--yay!    I still haven't bothered to put the new pictures up on my site yet.  It is, however, under construction and will soon have it's own domain!  More news when there's actually something to report.  ~D~
