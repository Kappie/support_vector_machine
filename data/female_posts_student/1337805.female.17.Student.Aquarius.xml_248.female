Watched fireworks. Got kicked out of some pizza place. Saw Liam, Ian and Kat. I missed my husband. Got ignored by Steve, Kim, Laura, and Dan. Said hi to Misha, the other Misha, Kaya, Megan and Linnea. Twas fun. I love the fireworks..so romantic and sweet and junk..ahh..My boyfriend's perfect.  Tryed to address some thing with my friends, opened up a bombshell, now the group is even more divided than it was before...but whatever. I'm taking a break from it all. Refocusing energy into Nick (hehe) and youth activites. I'm better appriciated there than with my friends. They don't seem to see all the stuff I do. But whatever. I'm still planning on hanging out with the "couples" clique, just not with the group as a whole. Toooo much effort. But whatever.  I'm hungrey. Sidekicks take a while to make. Mom bought Greg a new computer, $1200 later..he has to pay her back at least $1000 though, so I'm not jealous. She's going to be on his tail for that money for some time, so :P Whatever.  As a side note to that, if it wasn't for Nick being there to talk to today, I dunno what would have happened. Nick, you are my superhero. I love you man.
