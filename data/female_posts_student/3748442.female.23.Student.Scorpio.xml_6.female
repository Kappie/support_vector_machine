This is the third batch I've made in a week, and I'm feeling a little sinful and bogged down by a total of 6 sticks butter, 3 cups sugar, and about 250 milk chocolate chips. The dough is waiting for me in the fridge at this very moment, but I am strong, I will not break. "I know it's only 7:30 in the morning," the dough says to me. "But you know you want to eat me. It's so easy; just get a spoon and savor those crunchy chocolate chips mixed with cold whipped butter and egg yolk for breakfast. Eat me now and you're insulin levels will be spiked sky high before lunchtime. It'll be great and don't worry: when you feel like you're gonna crash, just come eat some more of me. I'll be right here waiting for you."    It's like heroin. Yesterday I gave in to the dough's persuasive calling; in fact, other than a couple bites of cucumber salad and pasta for dinner, I didn't have anything else to eat but cookies or cookie dough. Today will be different though. Not only am I breaking things off cold turkey with the dough, I'm going to exercise as well! Because it's been a very long time since I've done anything that required energy or movement, I will probably just start with stretching. Gotta start somewhere.   This is my what? Third? Fourth post this week?  Get a life, Kala , is what you're probably thinking.  Don't you have anything better to do than change everyone's name into Hawaiian and blog about your pathetic slothy existence?  Well, the answer to that question is: no, I don't. And I bet neither do you.
