Like "You Outta Know" and "Head Over Feet" and "21 Things" and... i dunno, lots more. "Jagged Little Pill" is one of the best CDs. Go feminist rock! wooot.      "Head over Feet" was one of my favorite songs when i was a kid too. like in 4th grade. i dunno...ive just always liked that song. its great.  ...the kinds of things that influence my conception of love... crazy.      "Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are / I couldn't help it / It's all your fault" thats the best. Something id think, too... haha, blaming people for things like that... mmm. :-). "i love you for all that you are" thats good too. "for all that you are." nice. cause its not just "i love you" its..."i love every part of you" thats great, man. great.      "You are the bearer of unconditional things"that too. i love the wording of that. its cool. "unconditional things"...haha, love!      "I've never felt this healthy before / I've never wanted something rational / I am aware now"...thats good too. cause...  its that "im in love and everything seems to make sense now!" kind of thing. which is nice. i dunno. im just kind of rambling now.... lalaladadi.   and " 'Good-night my---' he stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me." i love that part. thats the best part of the whole book. poor rochester!   im in such a randomly good mood.  wow, i really need to do my homework....really really really.
