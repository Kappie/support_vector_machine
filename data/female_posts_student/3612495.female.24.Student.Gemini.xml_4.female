May be she had a large pressure in her works. Don't give up, I will always support you and besides you.   And today, Gavin confirmed me that we will go to South Coast on Friday. I am glad to hear about that. I felt exciting, it the first time I go with my boy friend. Also Tim, I am happy he will go also, he is a nice person. But before that, I need to finish one of the assignment that will hand out on next Monday(my birthday), pity, but finally, I had finished that, just waiting for Eric's one and combined. Besides, I started another assignment, about contract law, its difficult.   In the afternoon, we go for chinese tea in Chinatown, the food is delicious, and we have a happy lunch time to each other. I enjoy in it much, I hope you will be there next time, can you?  今天是Florence的生日，我特意打個電話給她，她好高興。但我覺得她有點不開心，是因為她返工太大壓力。俾心機呀，我會支持你的。  還有，Gavin同我講在本星期五會同我去南邊玩。當然好開心啦，而且好興奮的。這是我第一次同男朋友去旅行。不過其實仲有Gavin的朋友Tim，佢好好人的。但去之前，我一定要做完我的報告，到最後我做好我自己那些部份，只剩下Eric的部份。而且我還要做法律的功課，係寫論文。  下午，我們一班同學又去了唐人街飲茶。好好味。希望下次他也可以去試下啦。
