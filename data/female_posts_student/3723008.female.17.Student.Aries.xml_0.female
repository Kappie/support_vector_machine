Yesterday was the usual liming day I guess, went to Stephen's.. played cards... played pool... but the highlight of my day was getting to be with Aleyya... the last time me n her were... together.. just me n her... was... hmm.. last week of the easter hols.. when we went to Marios n stuff... that was cool ... so yesterday was a lot of fun, she always makes me laugh... haha.. and we got some really good pictures to.. to add to my collection... when my burner decides to stop playing up.. I'd burn em and circulate em within the little social circle.. and I bought these REALLY cool hair ties.. ahaha.. I think every week I'm gonna buy new hair ties.. thank you GOD for bringing a Wonderful World to Chaguanas... I won't hafta go .. alllll the way to Gulf City to get stuff... yayy... Mom was sick yesterday, I didn't see her this morning so I don't know how she's feeling.. humm.. oh yeah I ate tons of chinese food yesterday, and since I AM allergic to that vetsin thing, my allergies went CRAZY last night... I was all sneezy and itchy... and that... together with being tired from romping during the day.... got me all bitchy .. =\.. sorry to the people I bitched at.. Oh well.. I don't do it often, it should be excused, thanks. For some strange reason I find myself listening to mushy music... and I'm sick.. it usually pisses me off.. *sigh*.. I was planning on studying today but I'm too sick to concentrate... "sometmes I wanna give up, wanna give in.. I wanna quit the fight.. and then I see you baby, and everything's alright.. everything's alright.. when I see you smile.. I can face the world... oh you know I can do anything... when i see you smile... I see a ray of light.. oh I see you shining right through the rain.. when I see you smile.. baby when I see you smile at me.. ".... LALALALALA.. I sing for one person only... NANANANANANANA DING DONG!!!.. thas my new song.. nananana ding dong!!.. I like it... I came up with the lyrics myself *proud*... anyhoo.. I think I should be resting.. or poisoning my mind with more... ugh.. bleh... These days I seriously analysing myself... cuz I realise there are parts of me.. that well I'm aware of.. but I don't know.. and I have no justification for being that way... so... I'm looking into all of that... Farewell, till we meet again...     Oderint dum metuant Let them hate provided that they fear
