Ttsk tsktsktskts all over the place and GWS will ask if we are old men sitting by the corner trying to suck our teeth. HAHAH. That was highly amusing. No??   sometimes i wonder why i even miss this class so much when it appears that actually none may have missed the class. well i figured out why alr. Its because we spent our time together doing things which were like SO SPECIAL example: Tsking. Yucksing. Erbxing. Burping. U noe I feel a sense of achievement and proudness whenever our class tsks and YUCKSS together in unison when LBK makes a lame joke? Or when some annoying teacher irritates us and u can REALLY hear echos of TSK TSK TSK TSKKKKKKKK like we are some parrots. The feeling was awesome.  Also, we spend so much time a day in class. On average its 8am to 3pm. Sometimes with mock tests or remedials it will be until 5pm. So its at least 7-9hrs of a day. Dun tell me we have no feelings at all when we spent so many long hrs tgt as a class?   Our habits. Our habits are the same. We like cheap stuffs but well quality ones. We like to do cheapskate things but act high class. (hahah. I rmb tertia grabbed one stack of contest forms from mac donalds just to fill in and win something............)  The way we sit for good ventilation for our legs.. The way we wear our skirts half way and LBK will be like..."GERS CAN U GO TOILET AND CHANGE??? I NOE U ARE WEARING SHORTS BUT............" The way we moodswinged. The way we eat. The food which we eat. We eat anything everything. The way we litter. The way we study. The way we passed a test paper ard and cheated. The way we slacked. The way we rush down to court and play bball. The way we suan our teachers. (we suan so much thats why we got wee suan..) The way we topped the cohort with horrible grades of E8s and F9s. The FIRST TIME we ever won something as a class was our CNY decoration of the class. we made it look like a prostitute den. HAHAHAH. The way we treat our notes like tissue paper(anyhow throw). The way we got upset together the way we shutted uped together as a class when goon scolds us. The way we thot of ideas of where to hide hps during spot checks: ceiling, in our sports bras, in our shorts, inside coloured water bottles and inside OHP machines. The way we arrived late fer lessons. The way we throw our books all over the floor cause of overflowing lockers. The way we scream in happiness when janet lee is absent. The way we laff. Its like thundering. The way we are not upset upon knowing we got F9s again. Hahah. =) uniquely fourstwo. The way we rush to mobil to get cup noodles and leave the soup lying in the class dustbin for YEARS. (yukers..) The way we throw our tissues on the floor. Just throw. hahah. The way how we always ta bao food and eat in our class. The way where our class is made up of different ple. Like ple who can counsel u.Ple who can make u laff. Ple who are nerds. Ple who are sporty. Ple who are smart at certain subs. Ple whom u can pour out ur probs to. Ple who can be there fer u.   Awesome class?      YES.
