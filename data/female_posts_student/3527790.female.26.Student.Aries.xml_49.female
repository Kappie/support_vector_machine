I really should have been analyzing data but the sun was so bright and my head knew that everyone else was out enjoy the sun and so even though I tried there was just no way that my mind was cooperating! So I gave up and called a friend and we ended up hanging out the whole day it was really nice.  You know you don't really have to do anything sometimes with some people in order to have a good time. We didn't really do anything of note. We got on our bikes and just kind of meandered along not even really peddling. We went all the way from Bay and Wellesley to sunnyside park. There were so many people that we out and I had a blast just people watching. I got a little color (as in a tan...so now I almost look like I have some color in my skin) had an ice cream and just generally really enjoyed sharing the day with each other.  Later on we met up with a bunch of other friends (we all run together) and we went down and watched the fireworks together. We ended up doing to like a 2 hour walk too! SO we weren't home until after 1 am! Consequently today at work I am VERY tired! Oh well it was totally worth it!
