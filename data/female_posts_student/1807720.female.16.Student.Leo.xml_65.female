Well I still don't really understand my math though, and well even though we get monday off if I don't understand how to do the stuff then how will I have time to prepare for the test properly if I don't know what I am doing.  I really need to do good on a test in math, but how.....HOW HOW HOW...how am I suppose to do good if I don't understand.  You know actually today I felt like she actually wanted to help me.  For once I felt like she actually understood that I really have no idea about what is going on.  I really liked the fact that she actually sat down and took the time to help me instead of how she normally acts when I don't understand something.  Though I feel kind of bad, I don't want to have to keep asking her over and over again "How do I do this, how do I do that" because I think I will drive her up the wall and I feel really bad that I don't understand.  I wish I understood and I am trying to understand.  The Chem lab was really fun and interesting today.  We got to use a molecular model kit and build different bonds that form in a reaction.  We also had a sub today and I guess I was sort of happy.  But well I still have to admit that yesterday was seriously the best lesson she has ever taught.  I get this new unit and I think it is totally my thing.  For once something that I'm good at!  Well the chem quiz is Friday but I usually do a 15-30 min. review everynight of the material so I don't have to cram it but I understand this new Chem unit.  It feels good to understand.
