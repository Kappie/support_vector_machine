Of course, in all vacation planning, it's a cost/benefit decision as well as ruling by preference. After so much of art history, I really want to go to a large museum and just stare at wonderful works all day. Also, Alcatraz, Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf -- all places in San Francisco that I want to see.  So, either Yosemite or San Francisco... hmmm, tough decision that isn't allotted much time. Grrr.
