It's quite intoxicating, whichis why I'm proud for having left the storewith my wallet only $270 lighter than it was when I came in.  Before you scoff and roll your eyes,concluding that I was sucked inby the clever marketing strategy, consider this: I bought 3 substantial pieces of furniture with which I will furnishmy entire room in my new apartment, along with my futon. I got a5' high,black,commercial-grade, metal wire  bookshelf  (with 4 shelves); a simple black  desk  (at a slim 24" wide, so it will fit perfectly at the end of bed, right in front of my window); and a set of plastic  drawers  on wheels, to fit in my closet and act as a "dresser" of sorts.  So I think I scored a great deal. And I can bring it all down to Hyde Park next week and tuck it in a corner (the roommates said it'd be OK to do that) so it will be all ready to assemble when I move in at the beginning of September.  Plus, I am working on a deal with Dave, a fellow Amherst '02 rower who is moving out to Chicago as well in mid-August, to buy some space in his U-haul. Keep your fingers crossed for me; I really want to get my futon - not to mention the rest of my clothes - out here somehow. I'm going to needthose wool sweaters in a few months...
