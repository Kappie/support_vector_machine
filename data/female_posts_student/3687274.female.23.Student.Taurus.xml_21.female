I guess it's not so fair that I'm writing this about her knowing that she doesn't read it. But I told her that she sucks at giving advice. So, it's not so bad.  I hate my job. I hate my job. I hate my job. My brother has a job. A good job. Fucker better keep it. We're moving to these apartments in Racine IF I find a good job, either third shift or bartending, and if he keeps his job. I wouldn't mind staying in RacineI guess. I'd rather be in Milwaukee, close to school and bartending. Butwho cares.  I'm reading this book called ghost hunting to prepare for my first case as a paranormal investigator. So far I've learned that...I've learned stuff. A lot. Some things I already knew. Good book.  I think that I'm just going to follow through with my original plan. I'll go to gateway and take that responsible drinking class or whatever it is and then I'll just try and get a job around here for a month. Then try and find one in Milwaukee. I just need to be away from this place. For a really long time.  I'm thinking about my bills a lot. Not as much as I used to, it's less stressful now. But I owe a lot of money to a lot of companies.I want to pay them their money, but I don'thave any. So, I was thinking that maybe I could rob a bank, or fake my death, or sell my ass, or kill peoplefor money. Well, I probably can't doany of that now...well,maybe if I kill all of you...but why would I do that? Nobody's paying me to.  My original plan was towork2 full time jobs...hey there'sa cute guy. Just one though...anyway. I would have worked 1st and 2nd, but the stupid 1st shift job wanted me to work the fucking mandatory over time. And I couldn't. Everything would have worked out fine. 6am-2'30pm. Then 3pm-11pm. See, perfect. Now, 2 months later, I'm still poor as hell and struggle more so now than I was then.  I want my mama.  I want extensions. I like my little bit o' hair. But I'd like a longer bit o' hair for now. See how that's out of the question? Sad isn't it?  I need new clothes. Well, maybe not at this exact moment. But SOON I will need new jeans because I will be a size 8 and these size 12's will have to be replaced.I have a wish list at american eagle everyone!! Go to  urlLink www.ae.com  and look for my wish list. Wish list is at the top of the page near the end of the list. I'm telling you this like you will buy it for me. Anyway... they ask for a person's first and last name or the email address. My email address is  urlLink celcebeta@mail.com . So go have a look. I have a lot of pink stuff. I ae had more nice shirts. The selection somewhat sucks now.  Well, I'm done. If there are any spelling or grammaticalerrors, oh well. I don't have to check them.
