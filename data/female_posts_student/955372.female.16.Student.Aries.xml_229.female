They're all "you have homework" and i'm like "actually not really" and they're like "shut up yes you do" so its like oh, ook. Yeah their like "you have to watch you sister" i'm like "she's already 8, i think she can take care of herself" yeah anywhat so now i'm stuck inside watching a snl marathon. that is just so sad... hmm ok lets look at the positive side to being under house arrest. My parents aren't here. SCORE. down side: my sister IS here. oh well se la vie. adios
