Well, no longer! I'm back!  On the 24th, I got an obscure message from Dad while at the Lassiter Band practice here at VSU. (Lassiter is the best high school band in the nation right now, about 350 marching, national champs) The message was very fuzzy, and all i could make out was "sister", "accident", "ICU" and "surgery". So I completely fall apart, in front of everybody. I called up Rick and he came through like a champ. Aren't friends great? It took 4 hours, but finally I learned that my sister was going to be okay, and that even though her injuries were severe, she was to be fine in due time. She ended up spending 5 days in the hospital. Mom and Dad told me to stay in Valdosta to pretty much stay out of the way.   Irene and Scott drove up from Florida, and the three of us got to hang out for the weekend. That was great. Definately a weekend of highs and lows. The Pops in the Park concert was that Saturday, and that was entertaining. Here's a big hand to my friends in it. Thank you to all the SAI sisters that came through and supported me, I needed it! SAI rocks! That covers that weekend. Its funny, you never know how much you love someone until you nearly lose them.   The following week was one of just complete craziness. Lots of class, lots of work. Thursday started the second orchestra sequence of the semester. Getting the stage set, the auditorium ready, rehersals, its alot of work, but its unique. We had two guest artists from Ireland. David Brophy and Fingham Collins. The first a conductor, the latter a pianist. It was truely amazing to watch a conductor conduct the orchestra without a score to read from. He had the score memorized. Amazing! The concert sequence went very well. 2 down, one to go!  That weekend was also Halloween, and in college fashion, we had a halloween costume party. I was too tired to do anything really fancy. So... I made a beauty pagent sash, dressed as a outdoors girl, and went as Miss Canada. It worked. We had a number of cute costumes. A quick list for the interested: Robot, a baby, the Hulk, Jack the Ripper and his Victim, the cast of Gilligan's Island, Men in Black, a devil or two, Pumpkin head, The four horsemen, the Matrix, etc. It was fun. Me, Rick, Miranda, Russ, Temma, and Beth went to Steak and Shake afterwards. It was great to chill with them.   The next day we had a football game. VSU lost. So sad. However, some guy in a monkey suit ran across the field. At least we got a laugh out of it all.  Well, I think thats where I am going to leave this for now.
