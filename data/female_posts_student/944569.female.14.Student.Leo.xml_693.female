I mix up my front crawl and back crawl and i suck at swimming.  Somehow i ended up in a swimming school.  It's more like boot camp.  I imagine the instructors/sergeants barking orders from the side of the pool.  I started reading the coffin dance by Jeffrey Deaver again.  Excellent mystery i tell you.  The perp (perpetrator) has this strange habit.  He's schizophrenic and a hitman.  He imagines this general in his head telling him to immobilize his targets and so and so.  He also imagines worms crawling all over him.  Soldier, are you good to swim?  Sir, yes, sir!  What are your qualifications, soldier?  Sir, I eat healthy, take no drugs or smoking whatsoever, sir!  Then get in that pool, soldier, and swim like you never have before!  Sir, yes, sir!
