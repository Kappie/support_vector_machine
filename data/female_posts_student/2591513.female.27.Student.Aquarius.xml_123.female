With the increased violence to Americans who are singled out and used as a means to teach Americans a lesson has really lit a fire in my soul.  I cannot begin to explain the amount of anger and resentment building in me.  I HATE these individuals.  I HATE people who fall back on their "religion" to wage war and are uncaring for the innocent people involved.  There is no country who is innocent when it comes to things of this matter...but now that this is an issue that we face I am very concerned.  I do not want my children to grow up with the knowledge of such brutality and carry this fear in their hearts.  I remember when my dad would deploy I didn't fear for his life.  I hate that in this day and age, with everything that has gone on since 9/11, we are carrying a fear, sometimes pushed behind in our minds, but nevertheless, still there.  There are much more WHAT IFS in this day and age.  what is learned by such brutality?  Maybe that humans are capable of such unspeakable evils in the name of religion.  This is a scary thought for me.  I would hate for my children to hate another person based on their religion.  I pray my children never have to witness such ugliness, even though I know it is inevitable.  GOD BLESS US ALL!
