Oh yeah, and you get nightmares too!  Last nite I dreamt I had a baby named Terrance Andrew.  He was beautiful.  I also dreamt that I fought Jeff S. inside a black SUV for being a cheap fuck.  I also dreamt that I was in this wierd orgy house and every room had different fetishes in them.  I was trying to wander out and I walked in on Jon, Missy, Anna and Randi fully clothed lying in a bed getting their feet tickled with a feather.  I guess this random thought belongs with the previous "make sure you take your paxil" thought.  I live with my grandparents, well, they live in our house with us...my grandfathers sister died this weekend and now he's the only one of his family left.  Is it appopriate to send him a sympathy card.  I feel so bad for him, I just wanna smoosh him.    About a month ago,  urlLink the fuzzy one  and  urlLink whitey's bitch  made Leon Klinghoffer jokes in my post cruise blog comments.  I didn't get them until 2 days ago when they caught the guy who hijacked the Achilles Lauro or whatever.  I never heard of Leon Klinghoffer, prolly because in 1985, when he was killed I was only 4.   urlLink This is the funniest fucking thing I've seen in a long time and Im ordering one of their goddamned T-shirts!  Go play here!   Oh yeah and if you've been living under a rock, crawl out and go check out  urlLink Homestar Runner .  This concludes our blogging broadcast day...for now.
