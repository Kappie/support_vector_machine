If I put all the time I waste going online and watching random TV shows, I would have so much time for other things.  Except I'm typing in this, which must be a waste of time too I guess.  Hopefully I'll use the next 4 1/2 hours very efficiently and get a lot of my bio project done.  Hopefully.  Yahoo was fun with the whole little sorority.  Too many bugs, but a lot of talking about Meliss-knows-who.    Oh god i just clicked on my little aim icon without even thinking about it.  I guess wasting time is what I do best.  Ok then wasted time going on a website.  This is bad.    My next worthwhile waste of time will be seeing Seth/Adam Brody get punked in a couple minutes.  Oh wow I am such a hypocrite.
