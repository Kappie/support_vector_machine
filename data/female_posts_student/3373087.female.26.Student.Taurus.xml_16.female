I noticed that when I don't do my QT and blog, I get cranky, pessimistic, rude, selfish, and start to hate school. Sounds lovely, don't it? I don't know why I haven't been keeping up with my journaling/QT.  Finals are breathing down my neck right now, but I really think that spending a few minutes here and there to reflect on and appreciate what God is doing is definately worth it.  As for finals, two down--two more to go.  This quarter is a breeze compared the 7-final nightmare last quarter. I was overly upset about how terrible I did on my Food Safety final on Friday.  I studied really hard and did my best, but I was discouraged that my best only earns me a "B".  I got a "B" on today's Small Animal Medicine final, but I've swallowed this one a bit better.  I was thinking about why after I dropped Tiffany off (about an hour ago).  I think I've finally accepted the fact that I am a "B" student and those few "A"'s that I do get are merely bonuses.  The advice that Mom gave me when I was growing up is now coming back to me, "Just do your best!".  I believe that I  am  doing my best and I can't expect myself do perform better than I am able.  I think what was the most upsetting was knowing that I have an intellectual upper limit--that is, I can only do so well, no matter how hard I try.  I think accepting this truth will help me to accept not just my grades better, but also it will help me to accept MYSELF.  God will never challenge me beyond what He knows I can bear (1 Cor. 10:13), so why should I expect more from myself than God does?  Another bonus that came out of the whole Food Safety final fiasco was that I got to witness once again how dreamy my Smoochie really is.  He was so wonderful in talking to me and encouraging me even though I could barely respond through my choking sobs.  Last time I cried about a "B" last year, Jerry actually LAUGHED at me and didn't make any attempt to make me feel better.  He actually made me cry HARDER. How insensitive....but it has made me realize how wonderful B is in comparison.  I think this incident has made me check off yet another item on my "must-have" list of qualities I want in a husband--that is, the ability to be sensitive to things that make me sad. He really seemed to understand what I was feeling, maybe because he's a student now too.
