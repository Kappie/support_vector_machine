One thing i cannot wait to do is just to meet pat again... confrontation. not that it matters. i just think its funny. OH, The Things We Put Ourselves Through, eh?! good times...id never re-live 7th grade in a million years... nu-uh. anyway... ok. ya know what. i am now a happy content person. and i have no deep thoughts that i can write in here. so i'll stop stretching this painfuly out. i'm over anything that i clung to. it could have bothered me if i let it. but im not going to. I had acutally another funny dream about that one too... mmm. i've gone back to being a content superficially-concerned person. i'm not sure i like it...
