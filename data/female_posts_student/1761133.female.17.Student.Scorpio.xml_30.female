You approach all things with a need for speed. Whether it's running a race, eating lunch, or writing a report, you finish the task in no time flat. This quality is a huge asset in today's hotwired workplace, where there's never enough time to do anything. With a little bit of practice, you'll soon be zipping about the office, zooming between social engagements, and devouring books at an alarming rate. Your friends and coworkers won't be able to keep up. If you use your powers wisely, you'll be the model of well-balanced productivity. But don't forget: Ultra-speedy superheroes have to take good care of their bodies. Be sure to eat right, get plenty of sleep and stretch regularly. Are you ready? Invest in some quality shoes and hop to it. You'll be flying through your day in no time.
