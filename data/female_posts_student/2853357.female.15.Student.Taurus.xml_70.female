Okay, so on friday I hung out with katlin and I went home and ate dinner. Then my parents tell me they're going to las vegas tomorrow morning and the flights looked bad for tomorrow night and my mom wasn't really comfortable with the idea of leaving us alone at the house over night so we had 30 minutes to pack so we could stay over at john and jackies for 2 nights.  Really wanted to strangle them just then.  So we go... and I'm stuck with Ryan and John because Jackie had gone to sacramento early. So I kinda do nothing, go to sleep... do somemore nothing until Jackie and Nikki come. And then they decided they want to go swimming. So after swimming us girls watch  Havanan Nights  and watch Diego Luna. (dammit gina, one week was all it took and now i'm starting to sound like her.)  So Nikki and Jackie took over my room and I only got 5 hours of sleep. Went to church the next morning, boring... They decided they wanted to go swimming again. Mom and dad came and I was running back and forth from the pool to the house (it was way too cold to swim). Had an awsome meal full of lovely calories.  Went home, went on my computer... and you know the rest.   Today, Auntie Cathy and (i think) Uncle Pete are coming over from San Diego for dinner, and Jennifer is coming. Jennifer's birthday party is tomorrow at Green Hills. Agg, stupid country club won't let me wear jeans. SKREW THE COUNTRY CLUB! And I have to go other wise it would be impolite especially because we live like 5 minutes away and they know we aren't doing anything (just my and my brother because my parents are working).  Um, so now I'm hiding in my room because my mom is making us clean up the house. Ya... fun. (no, I don't feel like cleaning today!)  thats all  patty
