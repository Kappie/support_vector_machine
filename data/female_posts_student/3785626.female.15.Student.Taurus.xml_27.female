He doesn't talk like he used to. Is it me or am I just boring? Maybe it's just a phase...maybe our "spark" is dying? I mean it doesn't really happen when we are together, because well durh, we're together. I just wish I wasn't so boring...or what not. I don't know...I think I'm just over reacting. Yeah thats it.
