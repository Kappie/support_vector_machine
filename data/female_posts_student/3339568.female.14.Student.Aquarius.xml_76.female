I wondered how long it would take them 2 find out about Luke. See my family is very interested in my love life (sad really - espescially mi Uncle Warren) A barrage of questions ensued. We started 2 drift onto another topic, until Mum goes "Hey! We're interrogating my daughter here!" And it continued. Haha. I think they wanna meet you Luke. Be afraid. Be very afraid. Hahahahaha. Hilarity.
