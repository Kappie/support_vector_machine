We played one of the worst teams tonight and LOST 2-1. I think alot of it had to do with b/c we were short-handed. Christina (one of the players in our power line) had to go into goal tonight since our regular goalie was absent. It was just even more disappointing to go from TYING with the best team to LOSING to the worst team. Like Dan said, we play like the Oilers (Remember how they LOST to Calgary and Nashville?!  Sick! ).  ONE more day until Friday night...oh, how I am counting the hours....
