When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.        -Thank you\Led Zeppelin  The day will come when you'll be mine But I'll just wait till that time If I have to wait forever, thats what I'll do Cause I cant live my life, without you           Although you may not love me, although you may not care, if you should ever need me, you know I'll always be there. Your heart may not be broken, Your heart my not be free, but if you ever need someone, you can always count on me  ~~Thinking of u brings a smile to my face dreaming of u makes my heart race talking to u makes me want u even more but being with you is wut i live for!~~   Never give up if u still wanna try Never wipe your tears if u still  wanna cry Never settle for the answer if u still want to know Never say u don't like him if u cant let him go  It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.  I'd give my happiness to never see u blue I'd give up eternity to always be with u I'd give up my lyfe so that yours would be new I would give up on everything--everything but u  My friends always told me That you would make me cry My friends always told me That you would always lie My friends always told me That I will find some one new But my friends never told me My heart will always want you.  U have no idea who i am, what i've been threw, or whats goin on in this head of mine...so don't talk about me as u may do..u have no idea about the person i wanna be, the people i admire, or what i'm thinkin next..u think i'm happy, but i'm cryin inside..u think i'm strong, but my heart is weak..u have no idea about who i am n some times i'm not even sure..but, for once, stop analyzing the faults i have n give me a chance for me to just be me  A smile can turn the greyness blue A smile can say i love you too A smile can melt a young girls heart Then how come your smile still tears me apart?  I wish u could see the way I love you The way your in my dreams at night The way I smile when your around The way I sparkle when I hear your sound I wish u could see the way I love u The way your in my every thought The way I long to be yours all the timeâ€¦ I wish I just wish that u could be mine.. :-
