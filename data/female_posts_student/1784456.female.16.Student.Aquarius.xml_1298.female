Eugh no, lets not go down that road and turn left because it'll probably get me crawling over a dictionary checking the meaning of things. I hate that in english tests "Why does this make the story seem scary and horrific" Umm... well what do you mean by scary and horrific? Wow, completely changing the subject!  And needing a new pargraph badly. Wow, Lemon Jeeeely! (Or Lemon Jelly for all you normal people) Thank you dadorail for telling me about them! I heard this cool song where all it says is "All the ducks are swimming in the water" in Forbidden Plannet and they wrote it! So what, do I care if every one knows this already and they're number one? NO! Some one should make a "Freak persons chart" much better than the normal one! (Mmm... the men in white coats will be coming soon) Good good.
