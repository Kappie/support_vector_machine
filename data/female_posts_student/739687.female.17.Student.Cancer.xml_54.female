What's really odd about it is that I can't translate it metaphorically, which in itself has to have some importance. Now, on to my dream. I was sitting at a friend's house, and we were just kinda sitting around(I think I'd stayed the night over there, and we were just lounging around), and at first we were doing homework(for some odd reason), and then we were watching TV. And the news was on, and it was about the Pope. This is where I concluded that there was a religious war. The Pope himself couldn't even go out in public without masses of people attempting to kill him. Neighbors were fighting neighbors. The streets were mass chaos. People had become barbaric. Then all of a sudden people started firing on the house I was at. They had more than guns, they had some pretty crazy weapons. I remember hearing my friend shout that it was a "group of evangelists," and when I somehow caught sight of them, I realized that I knew most of them; one, in fact, was my own father. Then as I looked outside at the street, I saw people running everywhere, frantically; everyone was just in this huge, chaotic state. And I realized that our society, and our civilization, was destroying itself. That evidentally people hadn't learned from the past, and I knew that everyone would eventually destroy everyone else. All civilizations come to their end, and I realized that that was the end of ours.  Yea, pretty depressing. Pretty strange, actually. I don't really know anyone else that dreams about religious wars and the ending of our civilization. Haha...I guess I'm just one strange person.
