The news broke on Tuesday. It was actually on all the local news channels. I'm looking for a new job. If any of you have any leads, I'm open to suggestions.    I took a partial day at work today. Left early. It's hard to be productive in times like these. It's like nothing matters anymore. On a lighter note, Brian and I finally got a chance to watch  Zoolander . It's hilarious! I highly recommend it. I told Brian that we have to own it on DVD because I enjoyed it so much.
