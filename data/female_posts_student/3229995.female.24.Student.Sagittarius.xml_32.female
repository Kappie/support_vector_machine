Through my readings I have discovered the following:  - Chelsea's owner will pay for him  - there is a presidential election coming up at Real and one of the candidates up for election is willing to listen to offers apparently  - talk it may be Ronaldo who Chelsea get, have read he would be happy to go if Becks does but nothing more  Will find more details as to whether he is going or not. More importantly, since the buy out clause in Becks contract with Real is so high why would anyone want him?
