And while cleaning it off I noticed a crack in my car that wasn't there before. Hmm. So I think I'll be cleaning my car tomorrow, I still have "FHS" on the back...yeah, it's been there for about 3 weeks.  I'm so lazy when it comes to cleaning my car...I usually don't care.  But now I do, because it looks extremely trashy, like...gross trashy.  Egg smells bad too *barf* at least I thought it was the egg...it sure smelt weird.    I tried some tea today...I must say I wasn't too impressed, but my mom said, "I'll have to get you some better tea sometime" Anyways, I'm tired, and I get to sleep in tomorrow.  I like that idea. Good night. ZzZzZ
