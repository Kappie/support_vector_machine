He's not quite as cool as Ross, but he's way up there. He's really nice, too.   urlLink     This one is Trevor. Sure he looks like a ten year old stoner to some, but he's actually 16 and not on drugs. He's cool most of the time, but sometimes he can be a jerk. He's also Canadian, and for that we mock him, but it's all in good fun. I don't have anything against Canada... or do I?
