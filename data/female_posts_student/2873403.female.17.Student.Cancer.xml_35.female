I went from seeing Marko every day in like August and September, then boom, shit happened, and I didn't see Marky anymore due to this shit's happening. Oh well. Tis all good now I guess. I have my first game tomorrow, which was supposed to be Friday but was rescheduled due the the ickness of the field and such.   Friday I got hit in the face with a basketball in gym class and most likely got a concussion, although we'll never really know for sure due to the lack of going to the doctor-ness. I didn't practice lax that day because my head was throbbing. Lights still hurt my head, so I just sit in the dark a lot.  I spent the whole weekend at Amy's, post head injury, since my family went off somewhere and left me behind. We went to the mall Saturday, spent $30 of my mom's money on underwear, a belt and 2 shirts, then we went to the school play (Sweeney Todd) which sucked by the way. Except that one... nevermind... All I have to say is this: Kermit the Frog + a bus = ??? You know.   Oh yeah, we watched "Gothika". It was FUCKED UP to say the least.  I hate school, yaddy yadda, Chrispy hates being penetrated in the ear.   Goodnight and Happy Chickens to you all.
