Well, thankfully they didn't come quite that early, but there sure have been a lot of loud and crazy noises--and I have no idea were they moved our tomato plant to. This more any more makes it clear that I want to own my own home, and it sucks to be at the mercy of the landlord. Now we've lost a great deal of privacy that we gained from the trees out front and the tree in back, and now we really can't walk around naked as much anymore... Also, I need to be less shy about talking to the landlord, but I've been feeling lame and withdrawn today, working on weddings and such in the office. Bleh. Oh well, at least when I type I feel like I'm getting something done and I probably look like I'm working and doing something productive. I guess I ought to work on my resume to actually feel productive.
