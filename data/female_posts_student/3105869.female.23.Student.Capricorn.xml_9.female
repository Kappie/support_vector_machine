So, why do we date.  We get all gussied up, wear too much make-up, don't eat enough the day of because we are nervous, and then go out on this farce where you don't get to say what you really think about because that's "too heavy" and have to play this quid pro quo of silly shit like where you are from and what you did that day.  What I do during the day is not who I am, but what I do in order to be who I am.  Its the means to an end.  Is an atty's defining characteristic being an atty, or maybe more to the heart loving old books, overstuffed couches, small dogs, non-fat caramel machiattos and flying kites.  Does a person's job define them so unwaveringly, that the other more intimate qualities get overshadowed by the title.  Dr.______,  ______ atty at law.  Is this all we have turned out to be?  What about the fact we like to sing sappy songs in the car at full blast, with the windows up of course, or that one of our toes is a little longer than the others?  These are the hidden less obvious things, but the special ones that make us, that define us.  Problem is, people only meet the real you after a long time, somehow these are not the topics of first dates, but they are our best qualities.  Why can't people meet me sooner?  And especially now, why can't I tell him exactly how I feel?  I know why, because he would reject it.  But, at least then I would have said it.  I think he knows, but does he care?  How much time does it take for you to become special to another, and how do you know you are there?
