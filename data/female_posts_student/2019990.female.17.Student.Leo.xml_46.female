It's currently 8pm, I had 13 hours of sleep last night, woke up at 1pm this afternoon, and I'm exhausted.  Time travel does a number on you.  Although coming this way is much easier than going the other way.  At least when you get here it's night time, and they don't expect you to start another day after 24 hours of traveling.     So when we first arrived, we actually flew into Budapest which is the only town I can spell that we visited.  We had our van driver Ivan (when pronounced it ryhmes with Lavonne) pick us up, and he took us on the 6-9 hr drive to Mykatchevo(pretty sure that's spelled wrong, but this is the town we stayed in).  On the way he took us out to supper, and ordered for us because we don't speak Hungarian, and couldn't read the menu.  Ivan only spoke a little english, so we learned a little about the country, and the landscape looked just like home.  Flat with alot of vegetation.  So for supper we had what they called Ham, and then they told us it was from a cow.  We're like okay whatever, we're just hungry, so they brought us out beef.  We arrived in Mykatchevo at about midnight, and it was two days after had left I think.  I still haven't figured out the time change thing.  I never knew what day it was.  Our hotel was awesome, we had three rooms in our room.  We had a bedroom, with two beds, and a couch, then a bathroom, and a hallway, with a big closet.  The only bad things was that in Ukraine, the sewer system is so poor that if you flush your toilet paper it would get really messed up, so you have to throw it in a garbage can, which is rather gross.  And probably unsanitary.    The next day we woke up, and headed over to Dale and Janis's apartment for breakfast.  We met everyone, and after breakfast we headed over to the Children's hospital for a meeting, because my church sent a donation.  When we got there, they were very appreciative, and are using it towards their physical therapy room, which consits of a broken swimming pool, with dirt and rocks in it.  And then they gave Christine who we traveled with (she was pretty much nuts) a really neat book about the hospital, in Russian of course.  Then htey talked about different needs of the hospital etc. for probal 20-40 mins, and then the head man in the meeting asked me if I was American, and i responded yes, and he goes OH!, I'm sorry, I thought you were Ukrainian and gives me a book and his card and everything, which really didn't help me, because I can't read either of them lol.  They then offered to fidn me a nice Ukrainian husband if I would like.  That night we went to a Methodist church in Ooshgarad (don't know how to spell that one either but's that's how we're going to spell is from now on, it's phonetic) That night, my aunt taught a bible study about the book of Esther.  It think that's all I'm going to write for tonight, but I have two more lay low days to fill you in.  And one of the days my aunt said she might take me to the Museum.  How cool is that!  And I have to say I've really enjoyed having comments and the chatter box while I"ve been gone.  Keep it coming.  Love you all.
