I probably missed more.  I know I got the question about reliability and validity.  I also know I got the question about clinicians and psychometricians and the one about how the MMPI was formed.  Well, I might have got the question about how the MMPI was formed.  And I might have got the question about a T-score.  I, uh, said that to be clinically significant on the MMPI you had to have a T-score of 65.  Well, this is wrong.  In general though I think I got the idea of it.  We'll see.  At least you can drop your lowest quiz grade. And at least I'm not the only one who didn't know the first question.  I made up some answer so maybe I'll get 1 point out of 2.    I've really got to start paying attention in class more.  The girl sitting next to me asked me if I was in love after seeing a colorful page of hearts.  It's difficult though to pay attention for a whole 3 hour class.
