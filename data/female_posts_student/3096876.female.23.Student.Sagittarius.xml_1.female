So instead we went to lunch at McDonald's.  I used the bathroom while there, and it wasn't pretty.  Errgh.  But Saturday night, that was a hoot and a hollar!  The girls and I (after copious amounts of pre-drinking chez Ky  Ames) shuffled down to the Madison for a night out.  The crowd was good, and we sat out on the patio.  In the midst of a conversation, I noticed that our little group was suddenly larger--two boys had joined the fray, and cute ones too!  After chatting with them for sometime, the group became even bigger -- they called their friends at another bar and told them where we were, and suddenly there were five guys to just three girls!  Not a bad ratio!  I was drunk.  There's no sugar coating it.  And I looooooooved the attention I got from these boys.  The most hilarious thing about this whole chance meeting is that these guys were from my hometown!  I got all the way into the Dot, just to meet guys from O-Town, guys who grew up and went to school mere blocks from where I've been my whole life.  Just too freakin' funny.  Anyway, I started off talking to Mike--cute, but young!--and then he forgot my name.  Ooh,  blacklisted ! (right Ky?)  And then I started talking to Tom.  Also very cute, but at least my age.  And we had a ton in common--music, movies, ambition--and he seems to have such a wide variety of talents... I remember saying to him as our whole group stumbled out the Madison on our way to 24/7 breakfast that he was just gonna have to marry me.  And walking along Bloor towards Mel's, didn't he just sneak in the most amazing kiss!  Ooh!  It gave me tingles, and that was just the beginning.    At "breakfast," the whole group of us sat down, laughing and talking like we were long-time friends--me, and Ky and Ames, Jordan, Mike, Mark, Tom, and ... others whose names I never heard...oops.  I only ordered toast, and in fact, Tom ordered it, chasing down the waiter to make sure that he knew what I wanted.  Sooo sweet.  Of course, I sat next to Tom, and I don't remember a thing we talked about but I remember laughing really hard!  I stole a few glances over at Mike, sitting at the end of the table.  Poor blacklisted Mike, just lowered his eyes and shook his head and covered his face, but still gave me a smile.  When it finally came time, at about 4am, after Mark's girlfriend had called four times(!) to say goodbye, Tom gave me a very nice, very passionate kiss, and promised he'd call me.  I don't think I'll hear from Mike, who I had given my number to earlier in the night, before he forgot my name  , but I sure hope I hear from Tom again.  The girls and I decided that we had a great time, hit it off tremendously with these great guys, and all hoped to see them all again.  I stayed for most of this rainy Sunday afternoon at Ky's, and thought about how much I'm going to miss her when she moves out in a week.  I know Amy will still be there, but Ky--she's our glue.  I can't believe what dumb-luck that was to meet up with such awesome female friends in the last few months of my undergrad.  I call that typical.  Faak.
