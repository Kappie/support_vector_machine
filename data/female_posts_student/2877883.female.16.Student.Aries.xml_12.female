Even the spell check wants me to replace it with the normal spelling.  That has to tell you something.  2. That our creepy yoga teacher is really Taylor Dosi from Gilmore Girls, even if he doesn't wear sweaters with leather elbow patches  I forget the rest, but they were solved today.  I've decided I must start planning my birthday and parties and such now because it actually is not too far away.
