I know I've said that before, but it's true.  Like he was listing old tv shows and bios/memories. An that old show "Are You Afraid of the Dark" was listed and the episode he was most scared of was the same one as mine, I swear to god!! It was that clown one, and I just remember green foam/slime in the microwave, each time that episode was on I would squeeze my eyes shut and change the channel. It was pretty scary..... so any way mid terms ended today with algebra, gag. I think I did ok but I dunno. Oh well. But honestly Penguin has like my same brain but a guy. It's really cool. I know you all probably think I'm crazy but he really is cool, I'd like to meet him...
