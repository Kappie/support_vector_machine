I would've been fine if he hadn't said he did love me. It was raising my hopes and then dashing them that makes me cry. Louise had actually told him to say he loved me anyway.... but she told him to only say it if it's true. It's really mean of him to say it and not mean it. It's cruel. I hope I stop crying soon, and that I don't cry in front of him tomorrow when we pick Louise up. I suppose he is only 14... he is too young to be in love really.... But I would've been okay. I was happy thinking he didn't love me until he gave me hope. I then went really happy knowing that he loved me, but then, suddenly he says he doesn't know what love is. Which means he doesn't love me. Which means he made the mistake of giving me hope and then taking it away. So now I'm crying.... I suppose it's probably just hormones again. You know what? Maybe I should just put the convo we had up here so you can see for yourself what happened... I will cut out parts that are too irrelevant. It was hours earlier that he was saying he loved me so that's not in the convo below.  "My House, My"is Chris (full version of name is My House, My Rules, My Way) "I may be an"is me(full version of name is I may be an idiot, but at least I'm a happy idiot)  [21:24:20] My House, My: do u think im ur true love  [21:24:46] I may be an : maybe... i dunno if i can be sure at only 16 tho  [21:24:57] I may be an : why, do u think i'm ur true love?  [21:25:11] My House, My: well to be fair i dnt kno wat love is  [21:25:14] I may be an : ah  [21:25:43] My House, My: id like to think u r tho [21:27:01] I may be an : so basically ur sayin u like to think i love you but u dnt kno if u love me cuz u dunno what love is?  [21:27:11] My House, My: yeh  [21:27:33] I may be an : i wish you did know  [21:27:41] My House, My: i try to keep out of emotion at my age  21:28:47] I may be an : so are u saying u dnt want to love me? :S [21:29:05] My House, My: i do wanna love u  [21:29:10] My House, My: just not yet  [21:29:16] My House, My: cus skoll  [21:29:24] My House, My: and house  [21:29:26] I may be an : :( [21:29:38] My House, My: i do wanna love u  [21:29:48] I may be an : you knowloves not meant to just happen when u want it to  [21:30:03] My House, My: i dnt kno wat it is  [21:30:11] My House, My: so i cant relli say  [21:30:28] My House, My: all i kno is that i want to love u  [21:30:33] My House, My: and be wiv u  [21:30:39] My House, My: and tlk to u  [21:30:43] My House, My: kis  [21:30:44] My House, My: u  [21:30:49] My House, My: and hug u  [21:30:56] My House, My: and tlk and kiss and hug  [21:31:23] My House, My: and love u to bits  [21:31:28] I may be an : yeh wen ur in love u just wanna be with the other person and u think abuot them all the time....  [21:31:44] My House, My: how do u kno  [21:31:51] I may be an : cuz i love you   At this point he had to go. I don't think he any idea how upset I am.  Anyway by the time I'm back off holiday hopefully I'll be happy again. This is why it's probably better if nobody says anything to Chris... I guess I'm cheering up a tiny bit... I mean, he says he wants to love me... (but not yet :(:(:(:( ) I don't know, 2 weeks away from him might help me sort out how I feel about things properly. Hopefully. Maybe.  On a different note, Lauren I miss you!! Buy credit for your mobile so you can text me please!!!!!!!!!  Bye for 2 weeks! ~Hannie xxx  P.S. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT NO1 CAN KNOW ABOUT THIS BLOG UNLESS YOU ARE LAUREN OR LOUISE OR ALISON. NEVER TELL ANYONE ELSE OF MY BLOG'S EXISTANCE PLEASE! I ESPECIALLY DON'T WANT CHRIS TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE IF HE FINDS OUT HE'LL WANT TO SEE IT, AND THEN HE'LL KNOW IF I EVER SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT HIM...
