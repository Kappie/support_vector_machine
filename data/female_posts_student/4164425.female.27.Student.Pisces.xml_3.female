We got a Stockholm number to call for tracking our X-box.  One game I need to get is  The Chronicles Of Riddick - Escape From Butcher Bay . I also want one of the Tony Hawke games. My fave game so far is Project Gotham City Racing 2. I  love  fast cars! I want to also get Need For Speed Underground... I have another one in that series called Hot Persuit. It's O.K. :oP   current music:  Rammstein ~ Asche Zu Asche
