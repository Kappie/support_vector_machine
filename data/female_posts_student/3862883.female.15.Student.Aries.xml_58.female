This is important because it is what the story is really based on. Finding this man Kurts. Hunting him down and doing the assignment they are given to follow. Also, finding out things about Kurts along the way. As in the book and the movie there are many stops along the way to finding Kurts. This is an important similarity because both the book and the movie are focused on finding Kurts.
