I really hope it's PMS. -cross fingers, toes and eyes- I think the left hemisphere of my brain is losing it. I lost most of my creativity. Damn  Couple of times I used to recall how my baby used to make me laugh with his frivolous actions; dancing sideways like a crab, making queer noises, pinching my fats (Hmmmmphh!) and his oh so adorable red red cheeks. -giggles-  Really missed hugging him and smelling his bare skin. Sighz..ok ok, I know I sounded love-lorn. But I haven't seen him in weeks. Well, though I haven't really forgotten our recent heated arguments ( I   REALLY   REALLY hated arguements), I quite tired of arguing though. Am I really some one who wants to sweep things under the carpet? Or is it that when I'm trying to be nicer and accomdate that it seems that i'm not solving the prob? Oh well... too late in the night to contemplate an appropriate answer.    Think I better head off to bed. My Fuzzy is beckoning me
