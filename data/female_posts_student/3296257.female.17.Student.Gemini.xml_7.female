It is offically genetics..and me being the expert i should know. i also believe that my unstable mental ways rub off on other people. U are being affected if you feel any of these symptoms: uncontrolable giggling, lashing out at random people, Screaming or loud outbursts for no reason at all, swating at people for no reason at all, making VERY bad impressions of famous people and feeling minor urges to injur someone. 1.My advice for myself: don't have children. 2.My advice for everybody else: step away.
