Reason started when MS JUDY NG[!!!] decided to punish us because we were late for her class. You can't really blame us, we went to com lab for our lesson before hers. Well, she made us run down to the 1st floor, to the new block, and come back up again. Not that I'm complaining. But she made us do it.   TWICE  . And, with a time limit too.  When we were outside the classroom, she asked us how long would it[the run] take. Jeffrey blabbered[existence of this word?],"20 seconds" Then Judy said, "Alright, time starts now." Then all of us rushed down. Some were slower due to the shock. Many [obviously] " wa lau -s!" rang across the corrider as all started dashing down.  As we ran down, many eyes were on us. They were probably thinking, "WTF are these kids doin'?" [Oh, did i mention some of the "eyes" include teachers as well??]I have an answer," Our screwed-up teacher made us do it!" I don't think any teacher has ever thought of this punishment.  At least they're not that lame to...   Probably Judy was thinking that she  wus  bein' creative.    Nuh uh, I don't think so...   ^^^^look, even my inner child is responding... [Did I mention that I did a quiz that states my inner child is 16?] I must be  OLD...  cuz my inner child is older than me... *starts faking a cough*  Neways, we did not make 20 seconds [ predictably , dare I say?]. So.... we had to do it again, 1 min this time. Everyone made the target.  So we went in class, restless and exhausted.[Wad did you expect? Energized??!!] I was taking loads of time to calm down because I was getting dizzy[btw, for the two math periods, i didn't recover] I felt sick, almost puke. Well, i would... If she continued with the quiz.   Let's get back.  She started on going through... Adelyn wanted to pee, but perdictably [again] she didn't allowed it.. So Adelyn started clicking non-stop on her pen. In the midst [of clicking], Judy told her,"I can sense your urgency.."  I laughed terribly loud.  But, [i hate to use this word!]  Duh!!  Do you know people that can hold pee for a long time? [excludes me]  Ade had stopped clicking, but dejavu was hitting me again. She again, started clicking non stop. This time, Wei Jun told her to " diam! " She then stopped, after a while, Judy allowed her to go. Having rather a fit, she stormed off with an raged look.  When we finally got back to the lesson, Zican was talking back to almost everything she said. She made him do "down 10" [as she would like to say] He didn't. They were at the back [or maybe it was because i was in the front], negotiating. Judy, who still insisted on the  down 10  [stubborn cow!!], wasted a lot of time forcing Zican to  down 10 . But [another stubborn  male  cow, that's why they two fitted together] he wouldn't.  Wei Jun: Ms Ng, since he don't wanna do, I do for him la.  I could tell you I appreciated this idea [since it was delaying the class's time]but nah... being the cynical person that I was, I never stopped thinking that he wanted to take this opportunity to show off his version of  down 10 .  She wasted an assload of about 10-15  persuading  [inappropriate word, blame it on my vocab] him to  down 10 . He refused, and landed the whole class with a  down 10  job.   So, reluctantly, I did it because I wanted to get it over and done with.   Zhe Rui: [continuing from whoever the fuck it was]Up 3, Up 4, Up 5...   He sounded shaky towards the end, but still persisted as the "leader" neways. I so frickin hate to say this but, through the "up-s" [lead by ZR], I could feel a tinge of class spirit. but I wiped it away as soon as it came into my mind. Not that I liked being pessismistic[sp?] and what not, but I hated it cuz I hated the class, hated the school, hated myself..  The  up-s  left me more fucked up and sick than I already was. I decided to taxi home.   On my walk with Addie[Adelyn, I realised I just invented a nick for her] towards the bus-stop, we ranted [and vulgar-ed] about maths lesson today. Oh, before we left class, I suggested we banged on the tables [I banged on Alvin's table and everything under his desk fell off. My apoplogies..] Everyone got irritated by it, but I could care less than that. I must state that the banging really helped me get it off my chest. Not that I was bothered about being shouted by other [class]mates of 2LY, since almost the rest of the bunch were fucking flirts, attention-hungry, sucker-ups..  B/N: I hate CCHMS.. If I had a second choice, I wouldn't include it in my list..  damn school!! I dread you, I hate you!!  I wonder how's ___ doing, hoped that ___'s not still sick  I'm not acting mysterious and what not, but yea.. I was thinking about it in school..so..yea
