And...yeah buddy, tomorrow's going to rock!    Yeh, so we went to FRA's graduation, and was it super fun!  Yeh, we got there and we sat down and we sat there and we sat there and then we got to do some more sitting.  But you know, we did get to stand once.  Yeh, at the end when all the seniors, excuse me graduated seniors, got up to leave, we had to give them a standing ovation and all.  Boy, was that fun or what.  Then I went around and introduced Linds to all my spiffy FRA friends...there was Brendan, Ian, Carmen, Dan, Mary-Catherine, Erica, Blake, Sasha...yeh, I think thats it.  There were other people there too, but I either don't know them or don't like them...more of the latter, I think.    Then we went back to my house and sat there...(I'm noticing a pattern) but then my mom wanted us to count how many pounds of food we got from the food drive at church.  Btw, I'm incharge of our churches food drive and after the services, we took all the food people brought, home.  My father thought it would be a really great idea if we measured how much we raised.  So he suggested that one of us stand on the bathroom scale while the other hands us food.  We then measure how much the scale reads and subtract persons weight from that number.  I thought "why do we have to stand on the scale?  Can't we just put the food on it?"  Besides, how much you want to bet that I would be the one on the scale?  So, all in all, we counted 1457 pounds of food this week, and 253 last week...totalling, drum roll please, 1700 pounds of canned and non-perishable food items, plus some open boxes of food and several cans of diet pepsi (which in my mind doesn't really count) and 1 bucket of laundry detergent.  Yeh, whoever brought the detergent is a complete and total idiot.    Well, that was a fun story.  I'm glad I told it, and so is Linds, cause she isn't paying any attention to what I'm writing.  She's playing backgammon with some Japanese guy.  (She told me not to tell you thats she's losing..."I'm not losing too bad.  Pretty bad, but not too bad." (That's a direct quote.)
