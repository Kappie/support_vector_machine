It was hilarious. I just enlarged that picture today. It's the best picture I've ever taken. Well, actually it's grainy and there are all kinds of scratches on the negative but the subject alone just makes it incredible. Everytime I look at it, it makes me laugh. I'm gonna carry this picture with me everywhere so that everytime something is crap I can look at it, and life will be better. I'll scan it and put it up here later, and then you'll see.
