I walked as far as the A this afternoon. That was awesome cause I got to see people that I hadn't seen in ages and ages. Like Jess and Lisa. I also got my pictures in from Halifax. If I knew how to put pictures on here I would. They are mostly landscape shots and nothing really too interesting thanks to my camera eating all my film! Stupid camera...  We had to have a mad hunt for my cat Kate today. My mum was on the phone this morning and she thought that she heard Kate outside meowing in a really funny way she said. So we looked around the house and didn't see her but we didn't really think much of it. Hours later, my mum comes inside and she is now really worried about my cat. I wasn't all that concerned because I know Kate is weird so why would she stop being weird just for today? But nonetheless, I still went back through the house and did a proper search. Looking under beds and tables and other things that my hugely gigantic cat would be able to fit under. Which really narrowed down the number of places because she is really fat. I think that my mum was so worried because we thought that maybe Kate had had a stroke because her face was all crooked now. I think that it is just because she is getting pretty old. Eleven is pretty old in cat years I think. Anyway, so my mum seems to think that Kate has gone underneath our deck. I am not so sure because the spaces to get under the deck are small and Kate is not. But I try to look there anyway. I can't see anything because it is all dark and gross. So my mum comes up with the brilliant idea of spraying the entire deck with the hose to see if that would drive out the cat. (!) I do not know what was going through her head. I told her no. I went inside to look around a bit more. When I came back outside she was midway through spraying the deck. No one listens to me around here. Kate is probably just sleeping somewhere. Anyway, out from under the deck comes my cat. Not dead from a stroke but soaked from a hose. Why I ask, does no one ever listen!?! Arg!!!  Anyway, there is not really much else to say. I think I am going to make some dinner cause I am hungry and cause I don't have anything better to do. Might have a nap before the end of the day. I don't know. I would also like to watch Sixteen Candles before I go to bed. But that really is planning too far ahead. I'll get to it if I get to it. Which I probably won't. Oh well. Mac and cheese here I come!  Also, my mum is playing her music insanely loud so I can't even hear mine at full blast with my headphones in. I am going now, to turn it way down.
