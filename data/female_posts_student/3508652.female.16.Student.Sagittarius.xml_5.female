Love can be compared to Newton's laws of physics - "what goes up must come down." One day you're up on Cloud 9, and the next your heart is broken. Also, love requires a lot of effort - one stupid thing said or done can ruin the relationship... *sigh* I wish I could remember these things when I get involved with someone... :-(
