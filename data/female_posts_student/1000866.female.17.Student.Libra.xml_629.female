I’m afraid someone will see me typing in my blog thing so I’m typing this on word, saving it to a disk and then putting it on my own computer when I get home. Wow, I’m such a loser46+. Bryan’s an idiot32-. Again, Bryan being an idiot. Shock shock. I promised I’d continue on yesterday so I guess I will. It sucked a lot. Like, school was alright I guess. Kind of boring until eighth hour at least. We got to hear schizophrenics talk about their lives and whatnot. It was pretty cool/interesting. Then I had to go straight to work and work until 9 though so that sucked. Oh my God…Bryan’s scary. Bryan’s trying to think of something to write in here so, this could take a while. This weekend should be alright after I get past babysitting tonight. And, I stop there for a few moments for words of wisdom from Bryan. (and by wisdom, I mean idiocy.)  Idiocy, indeed. Some may have heard this already, but I feel obligated to notify as many people as humanly possible. Currently, more money is being spent on Viagra than on Alzheimer’s research. This means that by the year 2050, we will have a large population of elderly people with large boners and peeky boobs with no recollection of what to do with them. I just feel the world should know. Go and spread the word.  OK, well, we all appreciate Bryan’s little bit of information. Kind of an interesting fact actually. Sad, too. I think it’s also sad that medical insurance covers Viagra but doesn’t cover birth control. Is it me or is that sexist? Perhaps I’m just stupid. Yes, that’s it. Not that I’m in need of birth control but it seems rather silly. Anyway, tomorrow night, I’m gonna party like there’s no tomorrow. I end work at 7:00, which leaves me a good five hours of…whatever I want to do before I need to be home. YaY! Anyway, I’m sick of writing for now so, that’s it.   OK, I guess I can let you all know how moronic I am. I was planning on saving this to a disk, right? Well, there’s this bright yellow post-it thingy on the top of the computer that says, “Disk drive A does not work.” I’m posting this anyway, all stealth like. Here I go…*hums theme to James Bond*
