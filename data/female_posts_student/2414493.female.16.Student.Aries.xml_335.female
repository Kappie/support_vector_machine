I just feel like I'm in limbo. Part of me doesn't give a shit anymore because it's just been an annoying experience, and part of me thinks, "Wait, should I look it over once more? Revise it?" But I've decided that I'm done, and despite the fact that Jenn probably has a more coherent idea of what she's doing than I do and has more pages on top of that, I'm heading over to the Science Center to print my measly five pages with not-so-MLA margins. Hey, I'm just using normal Word ones.  See, I just better stop thinking about this damn paper or something, because I start thinking about it and imagine, "What if I get a C on this? Even worse? What should I do? How do I live with myself?" I know it's not that severe, but I do want to do well. I've just thought about this essay more than I've ever thought about essays, and it's taken me forever to write, not because it requires a lot of information but because I just can't get a thesis down. I probably still don't have a good one, but I'm beyond caring. This is dumb: I'm really rooting for grade inflation right now so I can save some shred of ego. It's not like I can't write, or don't! I just complicated things for myself so that I can't even think straight now. It's no more citing other lit crits or just proving anything--this idea has to be arguable, and completely new and novel at that. Beth sent me an email back this morning with the word "tautological" in it, and it was just about the most depressing thing ever. The word means "a needless repetition of an idea." Lovely, isn't it?  It's just so weird thinking ok, I can do this in high school English and then coming here and having no idea what I'm doing. Maybe I'm just overthinking it. But honestly, essays at home were always so much easier. You had a claim you had to support or refute and then you provided your information. There really wasn't an emphasis on originality, or "What kind of insight does this give me?" But see, the thing is, expo here seems like a pretty dumbed down class, like "How do I write an essay?" But is that what I really need to learn this summer? How to write a  real  essay? It's really changed the way I look at things. I just hope I learn to adapt to it, instead of going home and despairing over every other essay I write senior year.  I had my interview today. It wasn't the most profound conversation ever with the admissions officer and it was basically, "Tell me about your town and school." I said everything that was true, but I understand now why an interview is such a nominal factor in the admissions process. I just thought I didn't tell her the whole entire story...after all, I could've been a normal kid with a 1200 SAT and blah blah blah...I know test scores aren't everything, but does that boost their opinions of people? So it was all right, but not great. My shoes chafed my feet, so now I'm to wear flip flops until it heals up.  I've spent the whole entire day, basically, at the computer, doing the essay. I'm such a loser, and an even bigger one when I receive that terrible grade on this paper. I just don't feel good about it. I'd really like to be surprised and get it back with a B or something, but who knows if they'll be that kind? If grade inflation is a fixture in summer school as well? It's really desperation now, I think. If every day of college at Harvard is going to be like this, I'd rather go to USC or somewhere less competitive.  Maybe I just need to go and read anthro until this despair wears off. I'll have the paper printed, and I'll be reading  The Savage and the Innocent , which is probably the best anthro read so far...but damn those Sherente Indians. It's funny how a whole entire society can be changed into greedy, needy, helpless, pathetic people.  I guess another consolation is that at least anthro is going ok, but I have the midterm, so who knows what I'll think after  that  trial.  Sigh.
