What really irks me is that no one really understands how deep the problem of weight is for me. They don't know the feeling, most of my friends are skinny and popular and have guys drooling over them...not me, not now. The apart from colleges and dieting, boys is one of the things i always think about. Theres this one guy, lets call him John** i have this big crush on, he is sooo cute and hott, but geuss what he weights about 40 lbs less than me, and it doesn't help that hes nice and a ton of girls like him. OH well maybe just maybe if i lose 30 lbs and get my bellybutton done he might notice me as more than the girl who sits by him in science. I have pri good features. -My nose is one of the features i most like about from my teeth. it doesn't stick out and isin't to wide -My teeth are now braces free-perfect and really white, i bleach them -My eyes are hazel, but since i have to wear contacts i might as well have colored ones. Im getting blue ones -My mouth is fine -My hair is good, im getting it highlighted agian, blonde. - I have a really clear complection most of the time, except for the very occasional pimple. So as you can see the only thing holding me back is my weight, and it means the world me me, not that i don't weight it. I just wish i had been gifted with a fast metabolism. But ive recently turned away from god and am trying my luck with budda. _jess
