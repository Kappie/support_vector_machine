Da Vinci Code is so intriguing that is just aroused my sense of curiosity in cryptology. This is such an interesting field, where words and symbols represent more than one can see with the eye.  Exploring Dan Brown's official website, I found  ambigram . Ambi means both, and gram means word. An ambigram is a word written in such a way that it is legible both rightside-up and upside-down. If you are interested in learning more about ambigrams you may visit   urlLink  John Langdon's website   . He is the man who designed the "Angels  Demons" ambigram for Dan Brown.
