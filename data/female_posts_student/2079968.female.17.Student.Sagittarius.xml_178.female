I'm not sure why my posts have really been lacking lately...I guess I just have times where I sort of like to keep everything to myself and just not really share. I'm not sure why...  Anyway, so here's some really cool news...my cousin, technically my 2nd but whatever...well anyway he and his wife are moving to Seneca, from Florida! I'm very excited...because they will have opportunities at a church there...United A/G! Stephen will be doing music ministry and Natalie will be doing children's ministry...they start in September, which is great. I can't wait to go out there to support them...  I dunno...it just seems that God is opening a door for me when I needed one most. I've been on this constant search for a church...maybe this is it for the time being. I am not sure.  My vacation was ok...we walked through this little old town, Hendersonville...it's wonderful...little antique shops and such. I know we have stuff like that here, but it's just good to get away from everything...  I think I'm doing better...I know I may not make much sense now.  School starts August 5th, though. Bleh. At least I graduate in May, though. I went for registration...the principal was really nice, which was a little shocking. She swapped my schedule for free. I just went up there for her to clarify it and she offers to change it, which, is awesome! Now I only have to go for a full A- day:AP Lit, TA, Physics, and Internship.B-days I only have 2 classes: Calculus and AP Gov't/Econ!   More to say, more to think about. Maybe I'll put up some pictures.
