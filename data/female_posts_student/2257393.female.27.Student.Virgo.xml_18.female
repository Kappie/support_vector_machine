ESotSM falls in that category.  so does _magnolia_.          i told stean the other night, as i was crying myself silly, that i feel like the velveteen rabbit.  like i'm going to be thrown away because i'm full of sickness.  stean reminded me that the velveteen rabbit was made real because of that experience.  the weird thing is, i believe that will happen to me, too.  but i have to get through this whole thrown-away part before i can make it to the resurrection.  and it feels like i have a long way to go before i get there.
