I just want the day, ya know the whole dress thing and brides maids and happyness.... I like have the whole thing invisioned in my head like the dress I want a strappless one thats really tight on top and then like kinda semi poofs out at the bottom and my brides maids are gonna be in like a chiffon purple that like shimmers as they walk and like they will all have the same color but like a different dress design.. and like I want purple flowers of all different like types but all of them purple and I want to have the Rudy theme, like when the last football game of the season is being played and when he makes that great tackle, I want that to like be the wedding march, screw tradition lol.. I want to have it on a beach ya know and the reception to take place like under a tent with like little lights all over the place, some hanging and some around the top ya know? Am I forgetting anything? Oh... a groom would be nice.... but who needs um x0x
