Coming home bruised and battered...  - feelin so tired that you dont even want to do a damned thing...  not wanting to get up in the morning b/c your so tired from the day b4 and you know that its just gunna happen again...  - Getting those weird tan lines...  Being up at 7 two weeks before school started...  - The yearn to just do it...  Having all your differences disapear when you get on that field with my favorite 18 ladies...  - The smell....                       ....what we do for the sport we love...
