Anyways, I am Lauren, I am 16 from Staten Island, New York, and this is my blog. Get ready for an interesting read, cause I mean, its my life, and reading about other peoples lives (especailly lives with all the things that mine has) is fun! Well, right now I guess nothing too interesting has happend. I just went outside to get the mail and there was none. Now wasn't that just riveting? Tonight I'm taking my friend Melanie (Melly) out for her birthday (HAPPY BIRTHDAY MELLY!) with her boyfriend (Greg), my boyfriend (also a Greg) and our firend Gerard and his girl Jen. Should be a good do I reckon (sorry too much Harry Potter). More on how that goes later! Right now I'm going to figure out how to work this blog thingy so talk to you later! Peace xox
