Lot's of deep conversations and late nights.  But back to now.  I have noticed that i start in with this slight southern twang whenever i'm down south.  I'm staying with my Grandparents, as most of you know, and today we went to the Zoo.  The Zoo yes i know but it was fun.  Wednesday I'm visiting Samford, and today i bought an Alabama Crimson Tide t-shirt (woo woo for Bama)  The Bama v. Auburn game is tonight.. and in Alabama.. this is a BIIIIIG thing.  So tonight my Unlce Bill and Granddaddy are gonna be watching the game.  Yesterday's flight went by fairly well.. i was so tired i sleept just about the whole time.  Well that is all i really have to say for now.  Love Y'all (see look at this southern influence... I LOVE IT DOWN HERE)
