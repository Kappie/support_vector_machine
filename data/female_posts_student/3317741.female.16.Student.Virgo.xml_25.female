The sudden despite overwhelmed. Someone robbed off the memory.  It's nobody's business but tell me how I should feel. Is it love or illusion? I wonder if I've been hypnotized.  Enlighten me I'm wrong all these while.  Where's the urge? Has it peeled off? Or has it been washed away by the laughters in the jealousy heaven?  Yes, I hope so.
