I think that because it was my first lead, I really got attached to the play, and the people involved as well. I felt like a little piece of me died on Sunday when it ended. I just felt like crawling up into a little ball and crying. Yeah...so...Anyway, the last performance went really well. And the last performance is never the last performance without pranks...trust me, we had our fair share of those. A lot of the guys put dresses on and danced backstage in the alcoves during Heaven Hop. That was quite amusing. Also, just to freak Noah out a bit in the Finale, I put my head on his shoulder and started kissing his neck. Lol, it was priceless. Unfortunately, I received some unwanted comments from certain people about it...*cough cough*....and for a while I was a little upset about the reactions of certain people, but then realized that I don't really give a rat's ass about what these certain people think about me. The fact of the matter is, that all it was was a little prank on a senior the last day of the show. Nothing more, nothing less. And I'm done. Moving on, we had our organizational meeting for marching band last night. As of right now, in the 2004 Lake Park Trombone and Baritone Section, we have a male to female ratio of...drum roll...5:5!!! 5 girls, 5 boys! THE CHICKS ARE TAKING OVER! Lol, its gonna rock. We can finally have our own sleepovers, too. I'm really excited. And, its John Kasper's birthday tomorrow. Unfortunately, the day will kind of suck because I have to run the mile, and we have to do a lot of stupid shit for cinco de mayo in spanish...gotta love that Spanish 1.
