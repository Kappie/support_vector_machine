That means we've now been a year together with Rico and I've been living in Switzerland that long. He had to work on the weekend on Fri and Sat evenings and I stayed lazy at home. On Sunday we spent some good time together and went then to eat to my mother-in-law-candidate ;) The food was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo delicious, I mean really, really good! She had made roastbeef with different kinds of side dishes. She also had managed to find an excellent red wine which just made the dinner even better. Rico's sister with her boyfriend was there, too. It was such a nice evening, we talked a lot and had a lot of fun. I really feel like I'm part of the family and that makes me so happy. Rico's mom is gonna be the best mother-in-law :) Oh, we're not getting married in the near future or anything, but it seems like it's gonna happen inevitably, some day ;) At the moment we're not engaged, but going to that direction.  Today's been a stupid day. I woke up 6:30 AM and thought that I'd start with studying very early. Yeah right. I just surfed the internet, looked for some Old Norse/Old English links for my presentation and then I chatted a little and played a little with the cats, drank coffee, read a little of the book "An Introduction to Old and Middle English" and went to sleep. I slept an hour and woke up about 30 min. ago. So now I'm awake and ready to study more and my honey is coming home ;( See, this is the problem with studying. Rico goes to work and leaves the work there. I go to the lectures and take the work home, since I don't wanna hang around at the university all evening. Sometimes, though, I think it'd be better to do as much of the exercises and reading at the university and then spend time with my family at home. I should just try that. Like go to "work" and come home from "work". Make a plan, a schedule, a framework. Great idea! I could drive to Zurich with Rico when he, too, goes to work and then come home with him. My lectures are in the middle of the day, so I'd have some time after that for working...   I still have no news considering our relationship ;) Everything's going fine. The cats are also fine. Well, ok, Shiva had a little accident on Thursday... She jumped on a hot cooker and burned her paw. Not bad, but enough to make her hiss, growl, hide and eventually groan with pain under the bed. It really did hurt to hear that... I managed to entice Shiva out of her hiding place with a piece of sausage and Rico took her in his arms. We went to the bathroom and held her paw under running, cold water. Well, she didn't hide again and didn't groan whatsoever so I guess it really helped. She was somewhat calmer in the evening and was careful with the burnt paw but the next day already completely normal. She, however, didn't jump again on the stove until today. It seems like the skin on one toe or sole or whatever it's called is a little broken and still healing and that makes Shiva sometimes a bit cautious with it. But it's gonna be just fine. Well, she really is the "jackass" in our family ;) Considering that she already fell down from the balcony and burned her paw... And both incidents happened merely out of curiosity.  The cats have also lost weight, they both almost a kilo! The difference by Minka is tremendous, she is so much more active and mobile. We are so happy that the diet works!  So... Gotta go cooking.
