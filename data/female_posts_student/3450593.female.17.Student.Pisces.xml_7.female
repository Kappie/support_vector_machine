We all got on really well and had a fabulous night, resulting in everyone being really drunk and then that was that. I never managed to meet up with David and Michael or fit Lisa, but I did bump into Katie and Nadine. Then after work on Sunday, ugh, I'd rather not think of that actually. To cut a long story short, I ended up on my own for quite a while pre going out and then me and Sarah barely said anything to eachother all night.  Well then I did the sensible thing and didn't speak to her for two weeks. :S Hmm then I got my new phone and suddenly had an excuse to text her, so I did so and we went to Homiesexual on Thursday night with James. She was practically begging me to come out and I though, yeah ok, we'll have a really good night. But then by the end of the night, she was being a bit cold with me again. Do you reckon it's the drink that makes her like that? Why won't she just let me know where I stand and then I can either get on with it or get over it? *sigh*  Meanwhile, I've been doing my usual paranoia thing with Katherine as well... I mean, I just think she has too many girls and I think she could be like this with all of them... I just dunno, because it's got to the stage now where I actually do care about her. I think. Plus she's a really horny minx! Haha.   So other stuff that's been happening in my life... I failed History. I answered the wrong FUCKING QUESTION. How moronic is that? I'm rather furious with myself! Ugh, I can't be arsed going into the rest of everything now, I'm not even dressed yet. Ciao x
