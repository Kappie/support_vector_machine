The blog template that it came with was this ugly green color and I used html to turn it into a nice pink color :D and it took me about four days to figure the damn thing out. Now trust me I don't know much about computers, I'm more the *look cute and smile while someone else does everything related to computer* type. I'm a cheerleader (notice the pink) I also run track, and basketball, I took this year off from basketball. Oh yeah I love sandboarding! There's nothing better than flying down a sanddune while sand blows up behind you, and then 4 months after it starts raining (I live on the coast of Oregon) still finding sand everywhere. The other day I was cleaning out my drawer and I pulled out a book and opened it up and there was sand in it *smiles* such a warm feeling. Oh another great thing about sandboarding is gum, and lipgloss! Always a hint of sand! Well good night you Princes of Maine, You kings of New England!
