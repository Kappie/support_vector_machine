She wanted me to ask mack to come over to see if he would put the ad-ware thing on the computer...so he came over and we've been messin with the computer since whenever he got here...great fun....he's sticking his wet NAPPY finger in my ear now and Im REALLY GONNA HURL!! anyway...before that he was trying to drill threw my skull with Nate's lil play drill..great fun....I'll keep you posted on the latest torture tactics of Mack!!   Well, we washed both of my dads cars and my sisters....I GOT SOAKED!! I had soap in my hair, my clothes were DRIPPING wet, but Mack had to drive home wet so I was happy!! hehe!! Mack left at like 7:45 or so....Jordan showed up around 6 and just chilled on the couch....I came in after Mack left and took a shower and dried my hair..then I came downstairs and ate supper (chicken fingers, mac, green beans, creamed corn, and something else I didn't eat) then after that I went to my room and talked to charley for a little while....at like 9:30 I took mom to the post office to mail christa a letter and to the bank to turn in something....I got home at around 10 and jordan was still here....so me and him messed around on the computer for a little while...charley called at 11:10 and I talked to him until a little while ago....Today was pretty fun....I didn't know where Jess was all day and that was scary.....*sigh* I guess I shouldn't say that but oh well......Leave a comment  **TWO WRONGS DONT MAKE A RIGHT**  wow....If you only knew how much it hurts for you to say stuff like that to me...I dont know what you want me to tell you...when I left the comment on your blog, I was ill b/c you havent seen me in a freakin month and spending time with everyone thats been here is more important than talking to me at all....it pissed me off...so sorry for that screw up, you of all people should know that I say stupid stuff when Im pissed off, the comment on jermiah's blog....I really dont know wth my problem was...stupidity is all I can say...I dont have an excuse for that one! so, jermiah, jess, and somehow brittni, Im sorry about the comments...well, I guess part of the reason I said that on jermiahs' blog is b/c he said that I fucked macks life up and some other stuff and that REALLY pissed me off...especially the fact that I was gone when he said it...that just pissed me off so I left a shitty comment on his....*TWO WRONGS DONT MAKE A RIGHT* jess, I've tried to ask you what you think you dont know...you know everything.......what might you possibly wanna know.... um 1) When I got out I cant tell you where I go...I mean it depends...sometimes I go to the square, sometimes I go to the bowling alley, sometimes I go to jana's, sometimes I go to lacretia's, sometimes we go to jay's(lacretia's boyfriends)... 2) The email to drew....yeah, I emailed him from dauphin island...the one where I told him to tell you hey...well, I wasn't supposed to be on the computer in the first place, but i managed to send you an email, then i was sending him one too and while i was sending him a thing came up and said that yours didn't send so I just told him to tell you hey b/c I didn't have time to try to resend yours.....me saying that I loved him and I wanted to get high with him and fuck him...wow...that NEVER happened!
