After that we all went to the Phoenix Rescue Mission to help feed the homeless and thoes who are just not fourtunate to have food on the table to share with their children. I believe that this experience helped me realize that all of man kind or equal but there are thoes of us who are delt a horrible hand in life. I think i'm going to go back and help out more. Maybe i'll even get my friends to come too. I'll write to you guys later. ttyl  urlLink
