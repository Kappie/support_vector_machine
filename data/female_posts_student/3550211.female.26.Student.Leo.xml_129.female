I think my eyes are going to explode out of their sockets if I look at my computer screen for even one more second. And yet, I will not let this stop me. Oh no. No way. There is just to much to do, and so little time.  How cliche is that.  Taking a break from my research I decided to read some of my favorite blogs. I had the privilege to read a few incredible stories over at  urlLink Notes From A Darkened Room . Good stuff. You should go read them to.   I'll leave you with a quote, and what is left of hot summer Saturday afternoon.   "I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me naïve or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman." ~Anaïs Nin
