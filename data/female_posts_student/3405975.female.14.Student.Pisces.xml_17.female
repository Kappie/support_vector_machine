Damn, became sucidal today, took a knife and kept caressing it against my wrist in my room... but too much of a coward to jus press it down harder on the piece of thin pathetic skin lying across my veins... Cowardly me, huh? Man, and now my entry for today is getting the despressed feeling... Well, too bad ppl, you guyz chose to read it. See the title? PMS...  Hope can see the stars today...or at least the moon. Dey help to settle my mood to a calm feeling of peace... Love de night.  Ast  - I shall come back to be seen, to be heard, and to be reborn on the first full moon...so that you can see the face of the person you killed in the bright rays of moonlight... Me. -
