Then I can start complaining about what's wrong with it.   Did you know Achilles was gay? I didn't know that. We just had this conversation: Dad: Of course we have to see this movie. Didn't you know I am a direct descendant of Achilles (my dad's half greek) Mom: Achilles was gay. Me: Really? How so? Mom: because he was. Me: I mean, how do you know. Mom: it says so in the story. In the movie he has a woman lover, but really it was a man.  I must read into this. 'tis my heritage after all. (the fact that I've run out of yaoi-y fanfiction to read has nothing to do with it...XD)
