Because it just had a series of first for me. First, I went on a road trip. A small first, I ate spam sandwiches. P couldn't tell what the big deal was. How do I explain that what I grew up on, a steady diet of Enid Blyton and the way kids in that lived was my most ultimate fantasy and was whom I wanted to be. I wanted to go be the Famous Five or sale on the Ship of adventure with Philip, Dinah, and the other two. Its part of the folklore I grew up with and cooking over a small fire is part and parcel of that.  But back to the trip. I took off with K. The two of, drove all night and finally after a small mishap that didn't turn out to be that serious, we reached Indy the next day morning. I slept. He went to the races. Mismatched pair! I went for the race. He was right, I did kind of enjoy it. It was different. 73 laps, and 20 cars. The best in the world. And all right in front of me, going round and round in circles. That's the part I don't understand. Racing must have been invented by some guy that was lost. A woman for sure would not invent a sport that involves going round and round a small track 73 times! Hey I said I enjoyed it, I never said I understood it. tired when I got back. Again K went off to work after driving all night. That guy draws out the last dregs of stamina and just manages to keep going. I don't think I could. And for sure I don't willingly do. But I love him and that's all. I didn't say I understood him either.
