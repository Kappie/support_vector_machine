Tuesdays and Thursdays are super rough as you may have guessed. i am not a morning person. i am taking my second psychology class. a part of me wishes i would have done psych. i find it very fun and interesting. the class i am taking is community psych and i love my teacher. he is fun, interesting and makes the class fun and interesting. its not easy but its fun work rather than busy work. everything thursday we have these exercises due that come with some sort of group work its lots of fun. last week was 10 sentences that start with i believe... this week was observing a place that has enclosed borders and writing about the groups of people that were under or not represented. fun stuff. well i am gonna get going to art history now (which by the way is really interesting.. not the class but the fact that the art history kids are SO MUCH DIFFERENT than any other kids in my different classes.. mainly poli sci of coarse but yeah they are hip if you will) im out.
