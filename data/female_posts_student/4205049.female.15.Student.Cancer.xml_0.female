Then, when I got to school, I hung out with Ana, Katie, and Josh at "the table" as we called it last year, but this year it is a different table, so I am  not sure if it is called "the table" this year. Then I went to first period (resource) and I didn't really dod anything in there, but do a page in my workbook and write about 8 words in my journal. I wrote "If I were and animal I would want to be a kitty-cat because. That is all I could finish because the bell was about to ring and all the people around me were bothering me by talking to me. I think me and Jacob are getting closer and closer. I think it is really cool that he is gay. I think it is cool to know a gay guy. Gay people are cool. I just have to be careful about what I say and stuff, cuz I might say something stupid or something like that and then I might hurt his feelings and he might not want to be friends anymore. He finally told his dad about the car accident. He said that his dad wasn't that mad, but he just wanted to see the tickets. Then I went to second period and I slept through most of it, but I woke up at the last like 20 minutes. We watched a movie called Dante's Peak. Then I went to lunch and hung out with Katie. During second period I had wrote this guy, Scotty, who gave me a ride to Popeyes the day before, a note, and I gave it to him, but I didn't tell him it was from me. When I gave it to him, I said " one of my friends wanted me to give this to you." And he turned it upside down and then back around and then said "ok." And I walked away laughing. Then I went to science and took my science test, which I didn't finish, but I get to finish it Tuesday during resource. I also got a 100 back. I was so excited because the is the highest grade that I have gotten back in that class, ofcourse....it is the highest grade that you can make period, but anyways. Then I went to English, where I came here to write in you. And that is how my day went...so far. I don't know how it is going to go after I get home. Oh yeah....I stopped to Devon for a while, I mean, I didn't call him, he didn't call me, I didn't go over to his house, he didnt' come over to mine, and then I ran into him on my way to second period. He was behind me saying my name. And then he came up beside me and I was like "hey", like I hadn't been ignoring him or anything and I gave him a hug and he was like "what are you doing" and I said "give you a hug" and he hugged me back. And then this girl named Ariel, who is supposedly my "friend" came up and kissed him right in front of me and 3 times at that and he kissed her back!!!!! Right in front of me and she is suppose to be my friend. That makes me so mad!!! I could have about killed her. I didn't even know that she liked Devon. But I guess I know now. And I guess that he likes her too otherwise he wouldn't have kissed her back, but that is ok, I don't need him, I have other guys!!!! Buh bye
