It was a very complex trade, but in the end Nomar is now a Cub. I'm totally excited about it except for the fact that he has an Achilles problem. The Cubs are just starting to get their guys healthy again, do we really need another awesome player that can't play because he's on the injured list? I really hope Hendry knows what he's getting into, and that we aren't buying another "Casey at the Bat" aka Sosa. These guys better start playing better fundamental baseball, or we'll have to look to next year yet again. But I'm a Cubs fan, I should be used to the "next year" concept by now.  Moving on...the golf season has progressed nicely. Yes I'm a sucker for the PGA tour. I grew up with my dad watching baseball, golf, and football. I could always tell summer was around the corner when we would have golf tourneys on the TV for background noise during dinner:) This year the Masters, which I honor every year by wearing my Masters hat during the tourney, saw one of my favorite golfers, Phil Michelson, win with a fabulous putt at 18. I teared up at that moment, and also when Arnold Palmer, my favorite golfer of all time, made his last putt at the Masters. Yes I am a sap, and yes I cry at great moments in sports. Other than that it's been a lot of watching Tiger Woods fall further into his slump. I think the little woman is wearing him out, hehe. And there have been a lot of unknowns winning majors, a very sporadic year to say the least.  Lastly, there is my most beloved sport of all...football. Yes, training camp is hear folks, and already my two favorite teams are loosing players. The Dolphins lost Ricky Williams, I'm thinking it was the drug problem embarrassment that sent him packing, and if not, that was a shitty thing to do to your teammates, to run out on them, definitely not cool. Then there is Da Bears, as if it wasn't bad enough that my favorite player on the team had to lower himself by dating Paris Hilton last year, but now Brian Urlacher has been put on the injured list. Great, not even two days in and already we have issues. I'm still holding out hope that the Bears have a chance with all the new staff this year, thank god Shoop is gone, but as for the Dolphins we'll just have to wait and see, but I wouldn't want to be Dave W. right now, yikes!  Alright, I think that covers all my bases except for college football, but I've known for quite some time that Illinois is in need of talent, and really don't hold out much hope for them either, but they can always surprise me, or not. I'd love to see all my favorite teams win, but I know I have a thing for underdogs, and I'm okay with that. Until next time...
