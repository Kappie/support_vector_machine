I'll have it sent off by Friday no doubts, just as soon as I hear confirmation that the $100 I have for being staff can go for my registration. SCREAM! And Mike was all wrong, he said we were saying at Delta, and we're staying at the Church...I'm so execellent, so excited, I wish it was May, like, RIGHT NOW! :)  As well, Laura did some dirty work for me, and I wanna know how it turned out. I think. Maybe not. We'll see. I'll prolly burst :)
