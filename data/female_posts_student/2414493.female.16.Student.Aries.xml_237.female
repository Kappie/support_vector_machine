First, there's the fact that Mom's pushing you to do it, which automatically makes it much less attractive. Then there's the concept that you should get everything together in the same place at the same time, but unfortunately, that's not humanly possible: I still need to get shorts in MA, I have to do the laundry, I can't pack certain things until Friday morning, like the alarm clock.   So I have one big suitcase for clothes and bedding and another miscellaneous one for whatever I thought I might need as well. Looking at it, it doesn't seem like much at all. I'm starting to wonder what I brought to Davis that made it such a bulky load, since the biggest thing I'm bringing this time is probably...the desk lamp. Too bad we threw away the box sometime between CTY and now.  I know there's a myriad of things to do. Little things, to be precise, which is all the more frustrating since it means running around all over in search of some indispensible but currently inconsequential object. I've started a pile of things I need to put in suitcase number two. As soon as I'm done here, I need to take my backpack upstairs, dirty bottom and all.  Printer paper would be nice too.  Ooh, I found the Jimmy Eat World CD. Though Austin's being a miser about loaning stuff again. I should've expected it. Brat.  I really don't have any idea what I'm going to do pent up all day. Besides pack and clean up, maybe. Driving Mom and Grandma nuts is the default, I don't have to try hard for that one.  So I guess this is my Thursday: I'm doomed to stay at home doing something that drives me nuts. I haven't told them that I'm going to the driving range tonight. I don't think they'll be pleased, but what the hell: Mom's going to drop Austin off at River Ridge, go have lunch with friends, go to Oxnard and drop by Dad's work.  I wonder what that sounds like.   (Hypocrite!)  Too much fun for you, Mom.
