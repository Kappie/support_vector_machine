Everyday while talking to a friend or something they will tell me what there verison of a crisis is,A failed class,a boy who dosnt like them or being grounded..."Hello!!! are you people not listening to the news? Did you not know that the world dosnt revolve around you?" The petty little problems that people have are inevitable to the crap thats going on in the world right now and untill you are on the outside of it you will never see it. Sometimes i just want to shake my friends and say "Shut-up!" "You are being so petty and stupid!" And usually its not unitll you look back from high school and see it,but lemme tell you those of us that see it while we are in high school,are going to be the ones who dont stress out over a failed 2 week relationship or a c- on a test when you thought you studided hard enough to get a B! Its like why is that a problem agian? I read some of my other friends blogs on here and i find myself laughing b/c of the things that happen in there days that they think is bad.  lol sorry guys but its true...take a look at what your writting...Making a decision not to smoke or not isnt a hard one,who cares what people think! Screw them if they dont like you b/c you dont fit into there little clique! Which justifys my point that stupidity should be painful! Anytime a person says something or does something stupid they should be smacked over the head with a stick! And yes ive had my stupid moments,who hasnt,but when your are just plain dumb in your decisions or you thinking all the time you need to get a grip on reality and mabey making it painful will scare people away from being stupid! Thats my thoughts on that...whoa that was alot of writting...I still love my friends but guys,seriously,you would be a whole lot more fun if you lots the pettiness! Kayla
