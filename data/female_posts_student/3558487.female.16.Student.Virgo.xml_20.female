So anyways, this is my schedule for those of you who would like to know... if you have a class with me comment on here and then we can be excited together!   Also... i'm only putting 1st trimester on here because 2nd and 3rd are messed up and i need to get them changed eventually.   BAND - Mason GOVERNMENT - Hogan BCIS - Redding COMM. APP.. - Kunkle FLEX!!! (which will be spent doing band related things anyway...)   I'm thinking its guna be really easy because i only have one core class. I shoulda just taken AP Government... oh well. Maybe i'll just practice a lot or sleep or something.   Well... band is really hot and i have spend on average 9 hours a day there this week... its crazy. 7:30- 1... and then 4:30-8:30. Oh well... tomorrow is wednesday which means after 1 o'clock.. the rest of my day has nothing to do with band!!! yay!! wednesdays are my new favorite days!!!   Adios!  -Lisa  Song: "Gone" - Ben Folds
