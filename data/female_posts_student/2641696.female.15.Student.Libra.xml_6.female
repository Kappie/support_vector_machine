Been thinking about what to write my personal essay on; I've had a few ideas. Here goes:   1. What I learned as a hillbilly at the farm :) You know, how to be happy with the simple things in life, what I learned from the animals, the 'slight disdain' (read: disgust/hilarity) I feel towards people who are terrified of frogs and insects, working hard, traditions, memories, etc. Also about what I learned when I left the farm; the farm would be my childhood, and moving closer to civilization (heh) would be growing up. I'm still not sure if I like this yet.   2. What I learned from my Camp Arowhon trip. Or however you spell that. I hated that trip. I loathed it. No offense to those who were in my homeroom last year, but I loathed you all. Every one of you. The few friends I had made were way off in different cabins, and that entire trip was sheer torture for me. In fact, I'm not even sure what I learned from that trip; it's just such an awful scar in my memory that I figured it must have  some  meaning.   3. Make some shiz up, tell 'em it's the gosh-darned truth, and come home with $1000. lol.   So, that's what I've come up with so far. Right now I'm closest to choosing the farm-related idea; in fact, I had come up with this awesome first paragraph in the shower last night - except then the power went out, and I forgot everything. All I remember is that it was beautiful, sweet and mildly amusing. Other than that, I'm clueless. So that's no good. Fortunately, I've got over two months to think of something and then write it up. Yay :)   I've just come across this  urlLink hilarious blog , written by a 'queer' (as he likes to call it) Asian. He's so clever and witty! And it's not just about being gay, either; he writes about all sorts of crazy things. I feel like I'm promoting him, but it's just mad funny... go read it! Now!
