Keep in mind that I mean nothing except love and question by these words...     Lately, you have seemed really distant, I hardly even talk to you anymore! and we don't e-mail like we used to either.  Was it something I did or said? Or do you just feel the need for some distance? (i can totally understand that) Whatever the reason, I hope you can tell me and I hope I haven't offended you in any way. Please write back in complete honesty.
