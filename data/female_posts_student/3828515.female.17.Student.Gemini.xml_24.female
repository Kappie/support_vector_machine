I'm feeling kinda grungy right now, so I'm going to go take a shower. Tomorrow's my mom's birthday, so we're going to the Chicago Botanic Garden for the day and having a picnic! Fun stuff. Ta ta for now.     Last song I listened to:   Squishy  from the  Finding Nemo  original soundtrack.    Last album I listened to:  Soundtrack from  Finding Nemo .    Last meal I ate:  Fish sticks and fries. Yuck.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I listened to October by Eric Whitacre today.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  No sé, mis amigos.    Last person I talked to:  Erin.
