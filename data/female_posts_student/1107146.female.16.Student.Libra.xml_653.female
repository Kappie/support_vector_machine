I'm Just A Bastard  by Stranglebox  I am what I am And that's a bundle of faults I can't really explain But what the hell, after all? I'm trying to laugh While I'm fucking up again I'm laughing so hard, I'm killing myself within I'm trying to tell you That that's not what I meant So now that you know Can we just up and forget? I'm yelling so loud I beat my face in a mirror It's fucked up I know But now it's getting so clear  I'm a bastard and I know it I'm just sardonic, brazen, sugar-coated Um, so what? "Fuck it" psycho-focus My life is over, concerned? You're duly noted again  I drink too much caffeine And I don't pay any mind I'm move way too slow I'm always second in line In times feeling down I'd be the last one you'd call I'm fucked up and boring Scabby knees so I crawl I'm hating myself  For every second I breathe I'm trying to tell you Can't you fucking believe? You never would know it Til the time came to be I'm going to blow it Then you'll see the real me   Chorus   Wait!!!111   Chorus  to fade  Badass. I like that song a lot.   Chained  by Stranglebox  Tell me, you said And where do I begin Guilty? Hell yeah But who's to call it a sin Filthy past tense defines What I call self So kill me, cuz I can't Ever make this well It's not that swell  I'm sorry, I can't explain I'm sorry, I didn't say that I'm sorry, but I'm all chained and I am a fake and this is a waste  No more, no more I can't take it No more, no more I can't  Window portents The outside looking in It makes no sense But circles start to fin Timely forceps have Pulled this skin aside Bangs on, doorsteps And now I cannot hide It's do or die   Chorus   No more, no more...  Solo   Nomorenomore...   Chorus   These songs are really repetetive, non?   Painpainted  by Stranglebox  I have said a thousand times That everything is going fine Everyone's so fucking nice And all good, no between the lines So I have lied to make you reach And pull the darker part of me I don't know much, but this I know It's time that I was letting go  They force my head below the ground I scream in pain, they let me drown  My gray world is so Far gone, I don't know Pain paints all I've found (Just like the rest, the next brings me) Down  I have tried a thousand times To tell you that it's quite alright And all the while the parasites are Eating from my fucking mind So I will sit and bang my head And hit til me or them are dead I hate the way you've hurt me so And why you do I'll never know  They saw me open and let me bleed I scream, the pain sweeps over me   Chorus   My colour scheme is pain (All the world is black and gray)  If I could take it all back To the second that you Snapped me in half I wouldn't waste another second Facing any of that I know it's not right And I know it's not fair Blinded, walking through the shadows Razors, fire, and blank despair I wonder when all the abuses  Became commonplace The painpainted memories are never Leaving a trace of you resentment Or of your hostility Congratulations on the kill, And now we leave him to bleed  They're closing in, I can't escape They're closing hands around my face I whisper soft so not to breathe Such pain, to death they strangle me (x 2)   Chorus  x 2  It all brings me down  And that one is considered our heaviest nombre...I love it.  And more latré, bcuz my faingers be ti-red and I'm not sure which ones to put, really. Look, I didn't split an infinitive. Take that, Calhoun.
