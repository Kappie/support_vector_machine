Well, story of my life I spent time knitting when I should have been doing other things. I started a wrap a couple days ago got pretty far on it too...just didn't like how it was turning out so I frogged it all and started over. Here's the pic of the new one...I'm not sure if i L:ike it either but o well maybe I'll make a gift of it.
