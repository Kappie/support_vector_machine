I have so much on my mind and I just got home from work. So when he got home, I wasn't expecting it. I am happy to see him but at the same time I had so many things that I wanted to do tonight. Nothing big and exciting but just stuff like cleaning my room and stuff like that. Anyway, I am here and hopefully we will have a good night before I have to go to work at lonestar tomorrow.   Well I am worried about bills. Everything will be fine as soon as I get my first full time paycheck. The problem is just making it till then. Everything should end up fine but you know me all I do is worry, worry, worry. Well I will keep you updated on that as things evolve.
