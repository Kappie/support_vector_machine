I haven't seen her in so long. I guess she's playing with us. Fun stuff.   I filled my gas tank today. It was the first time I've ever filled a gas tank haha. And then my hands smelled all icky and it was cold, and...it wasn't cool, but it's ok because Iit's really nice having a car.   I think I may just go lay around for a while now. Who knows? Maybe I'll do some reading. I have a looottt of time on my hands now! :) YAY BREAK!!!!!!!!!!
