Derek is going to have a tuff year but i know that he will xcel in what ever he puts his mind to.  I love derek so much this summer has prolly ben the best one eva bcuz i had the opp to spend so much time with him it was great! lol just being with him makes so much sense to me now,  i wouldnt have it any other way!  (sub-chg) i finally talked to kristina its ben awhile but hey this gives both her and i enuff time to "catch up" oh yay! i have to clean . . . again! :
