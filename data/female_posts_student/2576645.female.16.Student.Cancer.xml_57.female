Especially the part where I put on Stas's bra, stuffed it, wore her high heels, and pretended to be a hooker/hooters girl/ Hef's 8th girlfriend. Also, I got a haircut. It is a little bit shorter than I would prefer, but my bangs are cute. I wanted it like Ashlee Simpson, even though I can't stand her. I just can't respect someone who doesn't write their own songs (however much I like thier hair).  What else? Oh... thats right... My birthday is tomorrow!  I am getting this http://www.restorationhardware.com/page.jhtml?type=product=prod2220033=cat290015 from my mom.  (If that didn't turn out to be a link, I am gonna be really pissed. Blogger is being a dumbass and made all the icons for bolding, italicizing, block-quoting, and linking disappear. Needless to say, I am not too pleased.)  My birthday party is on Saturday, and I am really excited! I made it 50s themed, because A) the cute 50s invites at Great Party were on sale, B) I wanted a theme, but couldn't make up my mind, and C) I just love the 50s, as many know. It shall be fun.  It is officially past midnight, so that means it is officially my birthday. That means: I am officially 16.  Odd how I don't feel like it.  But its nice to say.  "I'm 16!"  Yes, has a mighty nice ring to it. One more time.  "I'm 16!"  Ahhh... sounds like sweet tinkling bells.
