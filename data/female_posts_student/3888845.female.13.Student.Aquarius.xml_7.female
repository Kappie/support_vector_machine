Then to make the day even more crap we had to play Danish long ball in P.E! (I really hate the game it does my head in!) While we were playing that I told Kelly I would write about them in my Blog so " Hello, Kelly and Lizz!"          Right now I'm sat in front of the computer eating chocolate and wasting a lovely sunny evening! :O) Well that's what my Dad said any way! Yeah! I've got to take my Spanish student to the sealife Center or swimming tomorrow!          Mmmuuuwwaaaahhaahhhaa....I now have my revenge!!!  Right this girl I really Hate at School called Hannah Keeps calling me names and making fun of me, so I told Kelly and Lizz that I would one day get my revenge, (This was about 2 weeks ago). Then What do you Know today I was walking past her and there was a big fat bee on her for head!! Everybody was screaming and me I was stood in the back ground going, "  Mmmuuuwwaaaahhaahhhaa....I now have my revenge!!!" People kept staring at me but ohh well!         See ya all later.                Bye x x x
