Haha the new ride is real cool it goes from 0-72 in 2 seconds. worth the hour wait. Oh hell i got these nuts...they were $4 but they were sooo worth it because they were roasted cashews with cinnamon and frosted omg they were the most banger things i have ever tasted!!! Anyways, great day now i'm real tired. Me n Dass slept the whole way home n i guess we looked cute according to matt n justin...oh well at least it looks good when i'm dead and drooling. Haha! Hmm...sleepy time i think i'll skip dinner. Oh yah, i got a little tan today so be happy. love ya darlings!!
