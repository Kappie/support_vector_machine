A lot of writing though, the script is coming a long very nicely.  Went to Michelle's house during 6th hour with Gareth to find her half naked and passed out on her bed. Gareth was happy.  I got to work and planned out a new schedule. Left at 6 to talk with my dad for an hour. I'm officially grounded from Kettering, after talking with my mom while going clubbing with her last night. Father agrees. Dad, Opa, and I went out to dinner and then to see my art project. My dad has turned into more of a dad recently. I like the change. I've never really had a real dad before... *sigh*  Hung out with Josh, went out for a drive and talked about the shit going on in our lives.  I'm so sick of this broken feeling. It's forever lingering in my rib cage. And it's turned from painful to annoying. I just need to get my aggressions out some how. I'm so pissed...  --- EDITED ---  I had to delete that, I'd ruin so many things going for me. I'm too weak for this.   ... and the crying begins. I wonder how long it's going to be this time...
