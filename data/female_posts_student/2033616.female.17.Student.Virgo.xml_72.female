It was beautiful, it was just clouds and light and water I know, but still it struck me.  The night before, I was lying awake in bed and asked, "God, is it possible, is it realistic, could it be, how do I know?"  I completely forgot about my prayer till I saw the moon.  Then I looked up and my memory returned.  I don't know if it was some coincidence, some fluke, but I wasn't pondering anymore, I was just... Peacefully gazing.  20 minutes later, I was standing at the mirror in my bathroom.  "Was that it, was that the answer?  How do I know what you mean?"  And once again, the only thing that I could feel was this sudden feeling of peace, like I had just been hugged and told everything is going to be alright.  So, is it a sign?  "Is it? Is it?"
