Lying in bed this morning - I'm bunking with my mother because my sister and her kittens have taken over my room - listening to the too-loud radio, I heard that in New Orleans it is going to get up to 96 today, but that it will feel even hotter - well over 100. Of course, my sister is having her  outdoor  engagement party today, starting while the sun is still relatively high in the sky. Hopefully, I won't pass out or anything.  I'm back from the doldrums of law school life, able to be lazy and not feel guilty about it for a couple of weeks.  Lastly, I'm back to blogging. Sorry for my prolonged absence, but it is a difficult life I lead, at times, and it becomes impossible for me to do all the things I like and or want to do, especially those that require energy, since much of my free time is spent doing that which requires as little thought as possible.   Upcoming highlights: details of my adventures in flying, my review of  Farenheit 9/11,  random musings on the  Law  Order  universe, and much much more. I promise not to disappoint, 'cause now, I got nothin' but time.
