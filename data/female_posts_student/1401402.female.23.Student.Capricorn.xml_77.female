Even tho it has been seven years, (Seven... fuckin... years), I am still hurt. Yep that’s rite, I have this wound that could never heal unless he tells me his sorry for what he's done.   I was on my way home from work today, made a complete stop at a stop light and spotted Michael. At first I didn’t recognized who he was, he called out my name and asked me where i was going. In a complete stunt look on my face, he said he’d follow me. Stupidity, I didn’t want him anywhere near but after seven years it kinda faded away.   Pulled over, we’ve hug, reminisce about the old dayz. What else is there to say you fuckin idiot. All I could think of at that moment was to bring up that subject "The Valentine's night", but I didn’t say a word, I went with the flow, as how every body talks when seeing one another after a very long period of time.   He said that he heard a lot about me through one of my girlfriend. Thanks a lot Linda!!! We had a nice time talking even tho it was short. Back then, I see him as a lost boi who doesn’t know what the hell he want in life. Now, he’s this grown attractive man. Yet, a bad boi type, which isnt my type. I was being hit on but it’s not gonna work sonny.   He's got my number and I didnt really care because the number I gave him was my work number with no extension and without the extension, he'll never reach me. lol. Go ahead and call you bastard. Why am I blogging about this guy??? I dunno!!! He’s just that somebody that hurts me. I will be able to forgive him when he says "SORRY".  After three whole months of guessing who’s that guy that has been stalking me, I finally know the answer. Yep, it was Michael all along. Vivian told me that it could have been fate. Haha a lil too late for that sweety.   This quote shall do tho...   "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but they will never forget how you made them feel."
