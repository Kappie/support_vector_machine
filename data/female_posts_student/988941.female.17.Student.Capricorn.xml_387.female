Yes it was nice seeing  a boy from my primary school that i havent seen for 5 years ! It was nice seeing him after all that time.  Hehe. Mwahahaha. I loved the film. I don't think it was better or worse than the first. I think its partly because of the way the directors designed the triolgy. As with most trilogys the first film like X-men introduces you to the characters and the story. In this case its helping us to understand the Matrix. Now the 2nd and 3rd films will be jam packed of action as we see neo work out he reasons why he is The One. Btw, Neo is an agagram for one. Hehe.
