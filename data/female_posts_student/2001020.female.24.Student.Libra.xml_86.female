I don't know why...I'm not overly emotional or anything, I just assumed that he would always be upfront and honest with me, but I feel like he's playing with my feelings.  I like him, he knows that.  Maybe sometimes I don't even know that, but he does know.  It's just that I'm cautious with my feelings b/c I know he's going to hurt me.  And he already has, and he will continue to do so.  It's so fucking complicated.  If I knew that he wasn't just spitting game at me, I'd probably melt for him.  But I know he is and I know he will never stop doing that as long as he knows me...so what am I supposed to do?  Fall for him and get hurt every time?  I don't think so.  Ugh, I am not even making sense to myself.  I need to rest some more.  I am just crabby and pissed off and frustrated with the way I reacted.  Ugh ugh ugh.
