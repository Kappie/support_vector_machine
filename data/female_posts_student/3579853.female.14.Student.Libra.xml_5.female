It's correct title is The End of the Trail.  During this last family vacation, we went shopping several times, but I only bought a few things.  One of those things was a little figurine of that Sleeping Indian.  Just in the past couple of years, I have started a very eclectic collection of figurines.  So far, it includes a set of three red stone horses, a crystal swan, a glass fish and turlte, and the indian.  I know, it's not much, but these things take time.  Most things I see are expensive and let's face it, I'm not rich, or anywhere close to being rich.     When I was little, my mom bought me rocking horses.  So, I also have a collection of rocking horses.  Zillions of rocking horses.  Okay, maybe not that many, but I have at least four shelves of them in my room, and I have a rocking horse christmas ornament for every year for eleven years.  The christmas ornaments are from a series, and I was supposed to get one for every year I've been alive.  However, when I was twelve, the series changed, and we stopped getting them.  All of the rocking horses is my room have nothing in common, excepting that they are rocking horses.  Some are wood, some are plastic, and some are porcelin.  I even have one that's made out of cloth.
