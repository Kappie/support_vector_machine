I don't have any problems...yet. :) Well, this is the only extra time I have to visit my blog (I don't have classes coz our teachers are having their retreat). Uhm, FYI: my dad's not here, he's in the states because there was a tragedy happened... I don't want to tell... I'm getting too emotional... SOB! Anyways, I'm over it already, my dad will be back on July 11. And I told him to have pasalubong for me... :) that's the good part. Back to the topic, my senior year is really weird. I have weird teachers (not really weird, I just find them though...) For English class, we have to memorize one shakespeare sonnet (its only 14 lines so its ok) -no duplication (there are hundreds of them so its also ok), we have to have our book report(Bestseller-no dulication) by monday--June 28 (which is not so ok). And we'll study about Greek Mythology, Yeah!!! My sched is alright. My classmates are alright though we're not that close yet. My adviser looks ok :). My grades are doing fine?! he3! Breakthrough! My brain is working on a normal mode again! coz since classes started, my brain went really weird, it's not functioning well... I'm like: what's that?! how did it come up with that answer?!(Algeb) Huh?!(Algeb) Ahh... I get it...(Algeb) again...(Algeb) hehehe... I used to like Algeb a lot. But these past weeks were not my weeks... my brain and algeb don't jive together... ;) But now, I do understand it! yeah! And last week, I can't bend my left arm coz it did hurt badly (PE Classes), we had our PPFT (Philippine Physical Fitness Test)--from curl-ups, arm span, sitting height, chest pass, sit and reach, standing long jump to the dreaded... PUSH-UPS! Yes! You read it right! PUSH-UPS! name it we have it! I did 50 push-ups... which is not normal because the average is only 40... I went overboard... hahaha! my arm is ok now. what else?!, we had our paraliturgy a.k.a. senior meeting underground! very exciting! hahaha! blame it all to Karen! hahaha! nothing much exciting about my first month as a senior... got a lot of work to do... especially that El Fili thingie... I have to summarize 5 chapters... believe it.... hahaha! ok, well then... bye!
