I have attempted many times; unfortunately, I lack the inspiration to write. I no longer have the drive to play with words like I used to, nor do I have intense emotions about some thing. I am just idle.   Even now, I turned on the AC since it is soooo hot in here the past few days, and I’m currently listening to disco music so I won’t be tempted to lie back in bed and sleep.  Sleep…the only thing I have been doing lately, well, except for my afternoon badminton play. ?   But, my day started great though since I’ve chatted with a good friend of mine whom I haven’t seen for a while, on the net, I mean. He’s pestered me about my blog or my lack there of. Hehehe. As if he’s updating his.   Photography…one of my favorite past times, but, I lack the gadgets. Now it seemed it’s his hobby…and the shots he took were…ehem…MTRCB R-18…hehehe. But like he said, it’s all for the sake of art. :-D Mukha mo!!! I know I am no expert on photography, but for an amateur like him, he certainly passed the test for his shots were good, albeit rated. Bwahaha.   Oh well, the shots I took in Bohol aren’t as vivid as his, but, they’re wholesome and family-oriented. Hehehe. I really miss chatting with this guy since he always manages to challenge my fighting spirit, and never a bore to talk to. The problem is, he’s just too busy with his nth businesses that he lacks ample time with some of his friends. Like me, for example. ?  Anyway, till my next blog. And the Bohol pics aren’t scanned yet, tinatamad akong pumuntang Butuan, so that means, they’re still unavailable. Thanks for the great conversation earlier, kinda missed the challenge. Till later.
