I have huge amounts of homework (almost reaching critical mass), but the thought of school getting out in less then a week is keeping me (somewhat) stable and alive.  While I was walking back to my locker after school, I saw a boy (I am not going to say his name, since I do not want to get in trouble for my light-hearted mockery) who appears to be growing side burns.   Now, normally, I would be supportive of this venture, since many know about my affainity for side burns and buddy holly glasses, but in this case, all I can say is this:  'Dear Lord, Man! Why the hell are pubes stuck to your cheeks?? Did you forget to look in the mirror for this past MONTH? Did your mother drop you on your head while you were a child.... numerous times? Growing side burns is an art form! How dare you desecrate this sacred practice? It takes skill, and only certain guys can get away with it. You, my dear sir, are not one of them!'  If I had any kind of balls, I would have grabbed him by the shoulders and shaken him, while screaming my insanities in his face.  But, alas...   I do not.
