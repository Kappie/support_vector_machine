And her favorite band is Nickleback. Lol! Marc was liike "Wow..i;m impressed"  Then in science we did this tuning fork thing where we would bang a tuning fork and make pretty noises...thennn while the fork was still vibrating we put it in this water and it would splash EVERYWHERE!! Hehhehehhehehe. It was so much fun! By the end of the period we were all soaked but eric cleaned up all the water for me. Yay.  Then in Spanish..well nothing exciting happened. Yeah.  Then we had lunch because it was am assebmly schedule. ANDD..at lunch I got Heather chips. AND  The guy with the music note tatoo was at school!!!!! Heather was like "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!" It was quite amusing. But Sara missed it because she is in Canada :(  In math we were supposed to have a test but we didn't because it was a shortened period.  At the assembely we were learnign aboooooot security. It was funny because the speaker mainly said "You can't be secure with out God." and these two girls behind me were like "SEPERATION OF CHURCH AND STATE!" I laughed..  Probably because I am ignorant ;)  Just kidding. We were discussing this in english...it had something to do with eggs and emily's brother.  :)  Then today my mum took me to coldstone for some odd reason.  ts was cool. They gave me free topings. The guy who was serving us was like "Whats your favorite desert?" and my mom was like "Cheeeeeeeese!" and he was like "Okay.."  I got lemon sorbet with gummy bears. MmmMMMMMMM!  Then we wint to Michaels and I got some purty blue ribbon. :D  Then we went to Winco and i saw this person and I couldn't tell if he/she was a he or a she. Haha. He/she looked a lot like a girl but then when he/she talked he/she sounded exactly like a guy... :/ he/she was hitting his/her poor kids :( It was kinda depressing.   Purty soon I am going to improv practice. Muy interesate.  You guys all have to come and see my perform at the showcase next thursday and the memorial day picnic ;) Fun Stuffff!!!!  Buh byes!
