I'm so happy right now and it feels like nothing is wrong in my life and maybe I can start being that happy person I used to be again. I have hope for myself again and I don't want to constantly cry anymore. Thank you to those people that helped me out of this for atleast the rest of the night. You know who you are. I just don't know what to say but thank you a million times over and over again.   I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new and the reason is  you   -The Reason- Hoobastank
