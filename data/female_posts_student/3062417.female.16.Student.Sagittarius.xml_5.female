But it kinda makes me upset because I'm now the only person in the limo who doesn't have a date. It doesn't look like I'm gonna find a date either. How much of a loser am I? Anyone have any ideas who I should go with?  Jazz band sucked last night. And I have to do it all over again today too. The soloists on all of the singing songs blow big time (except for sarah shes the best!). And I don't even like over half of the songs we are playing. Two hours of non-stop playing the saxophone is seriously murder on my back and my mouth. My freakin neck is killing me today. I can barely move it. I feel bad for Kristen. She has it worse. Hope your back feels better Kristen!!!  This week is the week from hell! Here is my schedule: Today: jazz band from 7-9 Tomorrow: lots of projects and studying for 30 week tests and can't forget swimming in gym Thursday: homework as soon as I get home from school then jazz band from 6-9:30 (probally later) Friday: Cabaret Saturday: filming AP project w/ carol, kayla, and allison from 2-4? then cabaret Sunday: Palm Sunday: church then the annual trip to Chester's florist w/ my mom, emily, and paige (crazy huh?)  Well I guess I'm gonna go now. Gotta look up info on some president's wife for AP and japanese immigrants for English. Hmm it would help if I had a working printer wouldn't it? Wow this sucks.
