So I changed the quote and now will babble uselessly for a few paragraphs.  Hmm... What's happened in the last month? Not much really. I got contacts and had a lonely boring Valentine's day. Didn't even have a babysitting job to take away the bite of being alone. Ah well.  I'm going up to phoenix this week with my dad and I'll be staying until Saturday. Acdec State competition. I really want to go to Nationals next year, so I have to work extra hard to be on the team  Next year's theme for Acdec is Ancient civilizations, or, at least, that's the rumor. I hope it's true because I love that topic, but that means a certain bitch will most definitely be in Acdec again next year. I may kill her.   But yah, that's basically what's happening. No great revelations about my life. I'll check in later. I added this thing to my toolbar, so I may update more often... Nah....  Faylinn
