(later, i made a comment about it to a girl who sits in front of me in a class and she said,  "he's that mean?  i've never known him to be mean like that."  i hate that guy.)  between that time and band, i was just kind of in a daze.  and then, during band, i found a stand that i could use to take the exam.  i had looked behind me and saw a chair.  well, i sat down, and a half a second later, i was on the floor half laughing, half crying.  and of course, the guy who sits next to me was a total ass about it.  nobody even tried to catch me.  i just wanted to get out of there.  and then my band director yelled at me for asking a friend to get my pen for me.  and i still had no chair.  i had to stand, crying, for almost 5 minutes before someone got a chair for me.  it's nice to know that there are people (outside of my 4 really good friends) that care.  fuckers.
