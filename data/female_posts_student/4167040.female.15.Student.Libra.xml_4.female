People always say..."Oh...it's going to be soo cool because it's all new." Well, because it's all new...no one is gonna know what's going on...they are gonna be trying new stuff on us, and all this crap...like I feel like I'm not even gonna get the 'high school experience' that everyone gets because I'm the 1st class to go through this high school. If I hate it after 1st sememster, I'm switching to a diffearnt school, I'm not even joking.
