Next summer I will have to make sure I have the kids signed up to go somewhere 2 days a week or so if I take any classes. It will be nice to just do something fun without that feeling that I should really be studying.      And this week will present the perfect opportunity. The boys are having a visit from their grandparents this week so I won't have them at all. I can spend time with number one son (first born, I'm not choosing favorites) and also do some things by myself. I can read! I can go for a run in the morning or read my newspaper with no interruptions. I can sleep as late as I want! And from now on, when my in-laws are in town I won't have to see them!!!      OOh, I could go see a band downtown and drink a margarita and stay out as late as I want. Sigh. Some day I'll live in a house all by myself and will be able to come and go as I please and not have to always bring somebody with me who doesn't want to be there. The children wrestling and arguing in the grocery store won't be my responsibility. Any males who want to fight for my attention after that glorious day will have their own homes and someone else will be doing their laundry and packing their lunches.  If they try my patience they can be left at the doorstep. Some day I too will have grandchildren who can be enjoyed and then sent home.      It's the American (mother's) dream.
