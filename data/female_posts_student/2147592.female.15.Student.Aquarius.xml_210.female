We've actually got relationships now, mines Steph Menzies lookalike and hers is Sam, I was jealous of her at first because I really liked Sam, but they had already fallen in love so I just left it. On a more serious note, I really like John. And Rik. I dunno why I like Rik though, he has permanent bov for me and it's starting to piss me off! Well me and Tab keep going up Barnstaple it's pretty cool I suppose, made quite alot of friends which is cool. On Saturday I am going on holiday up North for 2 weeks, so no more blogging from me for a while! Well happy reading and hope y'all have fun. Toodlepipxxxxxxxxxxxx
