[That site has kinda gone down the hill now...]  In exchange for a Gmail account this guy named Guillermo promised to send me a bag of coffee from Costca Rica. I hate coffee, but my dad and my brother love it so I agreed.  After almost a month it didn't come so I was just like whatever...liar face!!  But then today, it came!!! Surprisingly, it smells very good. It was acctually sent from costa rica!! It must have cost a lot to send it from there, I am eternally grateful. :)  Today I just took a shower, it was very nice. I feel clean!  Then I checked the mail and got my "tasty" coffee.  Now I should be cleaning my room is preperation for the visit of Mandy tomorrow.  I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!  She is leaving tomorrow from Cali at 5 AM!!! She should be at my house fairly late the same day.  *so excited*
