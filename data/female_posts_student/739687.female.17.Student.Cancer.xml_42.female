It has an absolutely amazing point, and it's so accurate too. We suffer because we desire things we can't have, or things that won't last forever. Nothing on Earth is permanent, and we rely to much on that. I mean, haven't we all made ourselves miserable desiring something? I do that all the time, and it ends up tearing me apart. I desire something so badly, so completely, but the truth is, what I want isn't always what I need. It made me sad to realize that I can't have what I want in alot of situations, because I'm a stubborn person and I always have to have whatever I want. Having to let go of dreams and goals because they aren't plausible isn't an easy thing to do, but I think our society is too blinded in the sense that we think if we try hard enough we can have whatever we want. And that's not true. You end up trying so hard that you make yourself miserable, and therefore you suffer horribly because of selfish, shallow desires. I'm not discouraging trying to reach for your dreams, but make sure your dreams are within reach. Sometimes what you want seems so close to your grasp, but when you look at it from another perspective you realize it's soo far away. I guess life is just about moving on, and not clinging to something...because it'll destroy you. I personally believe that in return for stopping chasing the things you want, you might end up getting something you really need. And then you'll wonder why you wasted your time in the first place. Everything has it's way of working out in the end...or so I tell myself.
