Anyways, about Bali.. it was a great place. however, the first night was rather shocking. there was a flood after we touched down at about 10pm and my sister, cherryn, lost her luggage. things got worse as when we were on our way to our hotel, "kuta paradiz" (aka kuta paradiso hotel)...the jeep we were in broke down cos water went into the exhaust pipe (due to flood). it was an eye-opener..seeing people who live on the road sides sweep water out of their homes because you NEVER see that happen in Singapore. fortunately, a few teenage boys came around to help us. they pushed our transport about 200m to our hotel and ironically, seemed to enjoy being drenched.   The next morning, we received news that my sister's luggage was found and was on its way to Bali in a Singapore airline. it wasn't removed from the cargo and was flown to Sydney. 2nd day was more of a relaxation thing..cos we strolled at the beach, went swimming, played pool, went shopping and all. we also had dinner by the beach. it was simply relaxing..  3rd day was pretty much hectic. we managed to get this really nice taxi driver, uncle wayan, to take us around Bali. he drove us in a huge toyota jeep to many places. we saw the kecap dance, went to silverware shops, art museum, the monkey forest, some mountains which was terribly cold. haha. so we were out for more than 12 hours today. so bumped out! ;P oh yes, we also went to the specific area of the Bali bombings, also known as Ground zero. am i right? it was crowded..many vehicles. there were tee-shirts hung on gates with the words "F*** TERRORISTS". we also met an australian lady at the beach who had that tee-shirt on. they sell it at every market in Bali. built at the memorial site was a huge wall which had the names of the deceased carved. * sniffles * i feel for them.  We had breakfast the next day as usual and went for a swim before departing. wenta' Pacung mountain resort at a mountain. it was cool. about 22 degrees celsius. we took about 2-3 hours before arriving. the scenery is absolutely amazing. again, it was an eye-opener! the resort and our bungalow over-looked the padi fields. and unlike the pictures depicted in the lower sec geography text books of the terrace thingies, the ones that i saw at the mountain was nothing like that. it was just undoubtedly....BEAUTIFUL.  At this point..i was already sick. i had a sore throat and runny nose. so my mom could only feed me with heaps of vitamins. haha. i think i've never had so much...fun before. we spent heaps of quality time together as a family. teehee. i wish those moments would never ever end. we all just layed at the couches at the lounge and talked and talked. then we could hear the farmers singing at 9pm + at night. the ambience was incredibly awesome. soo amiable :) so sweet. so relaxing. so pleasant. so positively-everything.  The last day of our tour approached quickly and it was time to leave Mount kinta-something. haha sorry i haven't got all the names of our destinations right (except for Bali) cos' i'm still in a state of being nauseous. anyhow, we left for the airport and then arrived in Singapore at about 6pm.  HOME SWEET HOME! i was really glad to be back cos' i needed to see a doctor urgently. unexpectedly, my sisters and i started passing out u-know-what and vomitted many times. my mom brought us to the doctor at about 10, 11pm + and the doctor confirmed that i had a flu virus and food poisoning. * double sigh * so now i'm just resting and recuperating at home. i didn't eat for 42 hours..just drank water and glucose. haha. quite an accomplishment i would say! but the abdominal cramps are really..like pain until wanna die that type. yeah.. but they always say,  "there will always be sunshine after a rainy day."  (quoted by mr lee. teehee) hence, i assume that something sweet will be coming my way.   This trip has been one of the most enriching so far. i believe it's because i've grown up. okay not exactly but i've grown a lil' more as compared to the past years. i've seen, with my own eyes, the lives of the extremely poor Balinese and those who have an average-income, just like uncle wayan. i guess uncle wayan is already quite fortunate to secure himself with a job. though so, he has to support his family (2 daughters) by working as a taxi driver (day time) AND a cashier at a hotel (night time). he has only 5 hours of sleep daily. he  really  is a good man. anyone going to bali in future, give me a ring and i'll let you know his contact number if you need a ride around Bali. anyways, i've learnt much more..but it'll take me forever to type it all out. i presume you guys know what i mean. all these takes true experiences to comprehend. no matter how horrible or how kick-arse my written reflections are in my blog, you will unable to understand the TRUE meanings..  On a lighter note, take care my friends, and have fun, as...TIS' THE SEASON TO BE HAPPY! :D
