Just a lot going on, and I'm not used to it yet. But, time will fix that.  Mom has been dropping hints that she wants me to go a community college lately; I haven't been completely oblivious to that fact, though I've pretended to be. I just am not ready to admit that all of the work that I have done over the past 3 years has been for nothing. Not having study halls, juggling all of my classes, extracurriculars, and a job to accomplish "satisfactory" grades. And then to go to Kent? I sound selfish, I know. Picky, selective, high-falutin, sure. But I know that I am a smart girl, and I think that with my intelligence comes more choices. And I want to take advantage of those choices more than you could ever imagine.   Marie is making me really angry right now; truthfully, the situation is not even worth typing out. What's new, huh? When are we not arguing? I just know this whole John jealousy thing is getting a bit old. Tiring.   I love Eliza so much. I've gotten to know her a little bit better than the average bystander, and have gotten to see the person that she is behind the facade that she falls back onto as a defense mechanism. I just wish that everyone else would look past the choices that she has made, and pay a little bit more attention to the person that she is.   I want ice-cream. But I guess I'm leaving that one up to Ben.
