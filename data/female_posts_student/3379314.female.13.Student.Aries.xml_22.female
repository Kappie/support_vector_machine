No doubt about it — you're the sweetheart of your crew. Always looking out for your friends, you know that they've got your back too. Loving and loyal, you see no difference between friends and family, which is why people always feel comfortable coming to you when things aren't going their way. They know you'll be there. You're always willing to put yourself in other people's shoes, a trait that helps you understand where people are coming from. This is what makes your friends trust your judgment and advice — they know you'll love them no matter what happens. And that's what friends are for. ________________________________________  Does Your Self-Esteem Need a Makeover?   MY self-esteem is In Great Shape! Good for you! Your self-esteem looks pretty healthy to us! Maybe you don't consider yourself a total rock star, but our guess is that others do! Regardless of what other people think, you know that you're pretty darn great. You also know that a big part of feeling good and looking good is taking care of yourself and treating your body right. The key is in your attitude and not freaking out when you don't get the greatest grade on a test or when someone else has the same outfit on as you. You take it in stride and see that it's the big picture that matters most. Your mature and confident approach will surely take you straight to the top in anything you do. Congrats! Keep it up! ________________________________________ so yeah. Sam
