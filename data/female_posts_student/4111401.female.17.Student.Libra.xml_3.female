Doc Martens; the guy from the shop in bairnsdale; my planned holiday; but mostly my cunt of a brother. Im sure anyone else reading this simply doesnt care about how i feel, so i gotta get my thoughts out somehow, so i guess i will write it here. So rick... 21 going on 10. Alcoholism. Depression. Bi-Polar?? I dont really know, but i do know, he ruined my birthday last year, he makes me feel shit... the yelling, screaming, pain he causes just arent very nice. I dunno, i guess my birthday was a blessing in a way, i guess i did get one extra nite with matt, but all in all, i wish he was a good big brother. I love him, but i have to. Hes my brother. I dont love him, or even like him as a person. If it wasnt for the same blood ties, then there is no way i would even tolerate him.                         * i cant live... with or without you...*
