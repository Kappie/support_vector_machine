Finding him half dead from starvation and exposure, the people of the village nursed him back to health. He subsequently lived among the people for some twenty years. Since he could not speak their language, he could not confess his faith or preach any sermons to them.   However, when the people were sick, he attended them. When they were hungry, he gave them food. When they were lonely, he kept them company. He taught the ignorant and came to the aid of those who were wronged.   One day missionaries came to the village and began talking to the people about a man called Jesus. After hearing what they had to say of Jesus' ministry and teachings, they insisted that He had been living among them for twenty years.   If you have experienced the miracle of God's love and grace, you may be anxious to share that with others. Just remember that your words will never be as important as your actions. Those around you will know that what you have found is real by witnessing the difference it makes in your life.   ------------------------------------------------------------------  if you want to find out about my weekend then go to xanga.com/aajunkieintrainin.
