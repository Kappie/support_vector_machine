I know that it probably went out of style long long ago, but I really do love it.  and the music video is one of the best as well. They just don't make things like they used to.  Okay, so I can't even remember when that song came out, but thats beside the point.  Unfortunately I left the worst of all my summer reading books nearest to the end of my summer.  I worded that sentence funny because there is one other that I have to read but I haven't decided if I'm gonna read it or not.  I read it for fun during the school year, so I was hoping that my memory of the book would do me justice in the classroom.  Ugh, school starts on the 30th of this month.  And band camp starts on the 18th.  What really sucks is that I have to be in band camp on the day of my birthday.  (the 25th, I'll be 16 and well on my way to getting my drivers licsense [I lack the knowledge at this time in the morning to know how to spell that word]) I visited my grandma today in Grayling.  She is one of the littlest women that I know. I bet shes only 4 foot 7.  Really short.  Anyway...I forgot the point in saying that. I had a thought that was going to go along with that statement but I completely forgot it. While I was with my grams we dropped off my step-cousin's birthday card.  I must say (I haven't seen Justin in probably the better part of 2 years) that he has bloomed as a man.  He is my STEP cousin so I'm allowed to say that.  My grams thought it was funny that I was the same height as him.  Have I ever mentioned my height in one of these things before?  Eh...I'm about 5 foot 8 or 9.  So Justin is pretty short for a guy.  Hes a super good artist.  But then, if I do say so myself, I'm not bad.  I can take a pencil to paper and come out with something quite decent looking.  Once I get my scanner hooked up I'll scan some of my sketches and put em up here. I feel incredibly tired.  I'm neglecting grammer every other sentence and it is absolutely driving me nuts. I went with my dad and Vicki to look at a house today in Roscommon.  It was a beautiful house, and Vicki really wanted to buy it.  With Vicki's two kids and me and my dad and Vicki, of course, the house is just about the perfect size.  It's this enormous log cabin on 11 acres with state forest on three sides.  There is a huge barn for horses and the like, another smaller barn for wood and such, and an even smaller barn that would hold a boat and just basic storage.  I called the loft if they do buy it.  I think I got my commitment issues from my dad.  He thinks, even though he won't admit it outloud, that buying a house with Vicki means that he is completely tied into a relationship with her for the next 25 years.  Well yeah, buying a house is a big step and it would take a lot of commitment, but I don't think my dad can do it.  It's not that I don't have faith in him its just that I know the man, and he won't be able to part with $350000 easily.  It would be fun to live in the house though. Ahg, I have this enormous weight looming over me and threatening to crush my head.  Its called a math book.  I'm skipping a year of math, so I'm sort of going over the year I'm skipping during the summer so I'm not behind when I jump into precalc.  Well I'm supposed to be doing math over the summer.  I haven't done a thing yet.  and school starts in like 20 days.  I should really be flipping out right now and not worrying about my stupid blog thing. I was pretty unhappy with this thing earlier.  This stupid woulnd't let me sign on and kept telling me that my password was wrong and that it sent the password to me email and to check it and reset my password so I did all that, and then it asked me to sign in to change my password and I'm like "What the hell?" so I tried again and again and again and again. Yeah you get the picture.   Then my friend Kaitlin suggested that I restart my computer seeing as I've had it online for the past 3 or so days.   Yeah, Kaitlin the genius was right.  So I suppose that's good for anybody that reads this. I remember the point of me bringing up me visiting my grams.  She was telling me that the Princess Di beany babies were selling for a pretty penny on ebay.  I laughed when I remembered that I had one sitting on my desk next to my computer.  my cat likes head butting it. I got two goldfish on....Saturday.  I named them Lois and Clark, yes, they are named after the characters from superman.  Origonally I named them Louis and Clark after the adventurers that hung with Sacagaweah ( I have no idea how to spell her name) but then I kept saying Lois instead of Louis, so the name changed.  They're just a couple of goldfish in a nice shiny bowl.  I bet they think that they are tropical fish.  They hide on the bottom of the bowl like they are cold or something.  I thought they might be so I stuck my finger in the water, and sure enough it was pretty darn cold.  So I sat down at the computer and wondered why the water was so cold for a while.  Then I realized that my toes were freezing.  I mean, hello people, this is summer, its supposed to be 90 degrees right now.  But noooo, it has to be 40.  I suppose thats what I get for living in Michigan.  I love this state, its so perfect.  I love being cold too though, so I shan't complain anymore.  My bedroom window has been open for as long as I can remember so my room is pretty much whatever the temerature is outside.  My cat thinks its too cold too.  She likes burrowing under all the comforters on my bed and dripping her snot all over my blankets.  Its really gross. I had the most horrible dreams last night, and I couldn't wait for the morning to come.  I was dreaming that I was breathing toxins in the air and they were slowly killing me, and I wouldn't live to see the sun the next day.  When I woke up I realized it was because Corky, one of the dogs at Vicki's house, was sitting next to me and she got sprayed by a skunk the other day.  God she stinks.  It hurts my nose and makes my eyes watering whenever I'm around the dog.  Because of this same predicament I discovered that I completely lack any talent whatsoever at putting eyedrops in my left eye.  My eyes hurt so bad that I was loading up on eyedrops to make them better.  So I put some in my right eye successfully on my first try, then I tried my left and completely missed.  I tried again and missed again, after a few unsuccessfull tries and a few jabs in the eye I gave up and submitted to the tears of pain...from one eye.  What a sight.  One eye all red and puffy, and the other a pretty crystal grey. Well...I really ought to get to sleep seeing as I have to start getting back into the school routine here shortly.  Good night, and fare well until next time.  Brie
