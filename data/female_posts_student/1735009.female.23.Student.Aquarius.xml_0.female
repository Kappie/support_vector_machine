We arrived at the Rolling Hills Country Club in Peters Township (very very  very  beautiful, by the way) a little before registration and breakfast ended - in plenty of time for the conference.  Glenn Miller, the president of the Pennsylvania Library Association was the first to speak.    The title of his piece was:  Library Funding Crisis: Would You Like Sausage With That?   It was interesting.  He's very knowledgeable and funny.  Good talk.  The second speaker was Robert Schnick from LECOM. His talk was titled:  The Convergence of Technology and Health Sciences Librarianship.   He was a little difficult to follow since he kept switching topics very very quickly.  Then there was the 25th anniversary of the Center for the Study of Rural Librarianship.  Good times there.  Lunch.  And after lunch was  Creating a New Order of Librarianship  by Bobby Player, the president of the Black Caucus of ALA.  He was very interesting.  Very smart.  At the conference I met a few librarians.  Had lunch with two librarians who are also childrens book authors.  Met the librarian that works with my mom, as well as a librarian that gave me an email address for another person who could set me up with a job in the Pittsburgh area.  He was super super nice and very awesome to talk to.  We talked about English!  He has his Ph.D. in English.  So very very awesome.  :o)
