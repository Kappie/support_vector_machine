I don't think I've ever done that bad in anything. But I really should just let it go. Do you have any idea what that will do to my grade? A C probably. Ha..and I was worried about getting a B. I cried a lot on Friday...just couldn't make it stop. My mom told me that it was OK, and that it's not ruining my chance to go out of state (sure...Northwestern is probably out of the question but I've been leaning more towards Portland now anyway). Oh well, I just need to get over the fact that I thew away being the 4th in my class. That's ok. Education shouldn't be about being better than anyone else. I just don't want to stay in Arizona. I don't know. I think I'm over it, well...I'm still dissapointed, but I can't do anything about it now.
