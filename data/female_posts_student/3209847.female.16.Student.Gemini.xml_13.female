Sarah's so excited about my excellent test today and the fact that i am getting out of school tomorrow. I'm excited for her first quarter of northwestern. Those classes sound AWESOME! I wish they had those at Oakridge for juniors. Hehe.  Finals so far:.. History, Relatively easy. The multiple choice was hard, but that's it. Pre-cal today. Hmm.. Well i tallied it up and i think i missed 21 points on the test, but i did 34 bonus points which i am pretty damn confident on! Also i have 4.2 bonus from the review we did earlier in the 4th 9 weeks. We'll see.. I REALLY hope i did well.   Tomorrow's Finals: Chemistry. You know, i'm never sure if i am going to do well on one of her tests. Its basically, you either remember this section, or you don't. I did all of the review. I could feel a LITTLE more prepared, but oh well. I think i should do alright. English. I think i know my vocabulary pretty well, got the essays down, got the romantic, victorian, and 20th century down. I think i should do fairly well. I want an A- or above on both of my tests tomorrow, but if I don't, that's okay too!  Then after our finals tomorrow, we're Juniors! One more year closer to getting out of Oakridge and living with Sarah! woo-hoo! I cannot wait! Juniors.. so young yet so old. I'm not going to think about that yet. hehe. I'm going over to swim at sarah's house tomorrow. It should be a LOT of fun. This weekend I'm going to Scarborough fair with Sarah and Lisa. I just cannot be separated from Sarah. I haven't gotten sick of her yet. Odd, eh? Yeah that's what i thought! hehe  I got the new Avril Lavigne cd for sarah and its actually pretty good =X. aah! I liked it! Its better than her first one! eek! lol. Well i'm tired and i should go to bed. I have to do well on my finals tomorrow! Everyone have a great night! *hugs and kisses* to sarah!
