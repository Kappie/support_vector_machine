Bear (who is much more bare sans long-ass hair that had managed to grow and sprawl from all angles on his head...) spent two hours this afternoon...resetting, rebooting, calling the cable company, and generally cussing out and messing with my computer. To some avail...but its not incredibly different. The internet moves at a snails pace on this thing for some reason. All day monday and tuesday up until my computer was over hauled i could barely get a page to load. It was very frustrating what with homework deadlines upon me and whatnot.  My husband (see above) got his hair cut Monday...it was quite a relief. It was longer than mine is now!!!! It was a frizzy mess on his head and it looks soooooooo much better now. Trust me.  I will try to continue to wrangle with my cpu and keep posting. Hopefully some permanent solution (other than throwing my laptop out the basement window) will become self-evident.  All the news in fits of print... Mack
