But then when the woman asks "is your son really dead" the fat man had to htnk or know that his son was really gone and that he would never see hin again. And he had asuch a strong emotion in telling the story of his son and the things that he had felt. while he was wayand finally relizing he would never meet with him again caused his breakdown while talkng to these passengers on the train. Why the woman's question " Then...is your son really dead" affects him. His son probably recetly and he, being stil emotional broke down. And with all of these emotions inside him and the way he looks tells you that he is very emotional already and is bout to burst any ways.
