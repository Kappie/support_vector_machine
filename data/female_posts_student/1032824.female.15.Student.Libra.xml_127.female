Mrs Chua's lessons are so incredibly fun-filled.. every word she says cracks me up. In addition, Geetha and Martin are such corny jokers.. Ms Shelley Low's lessons are so interesting too. We're so blessed to have such teachers in CT. Brian embarassed me yesterday during Mr Lee's lesson. Aahh.. I knew this day would come! That nuthead, pinched him like don't know how many times after that. =P   I have been staying back til evening almost everyday to practice the Chinese New Year performance. I can't wait for the audition! Btw, I'm the Squad IC for Sec 3s. Congrats to Staff xiongster who's the NCO head! The first few weeks of school sure is hectic, I hope the next few would be a lil' more relaxed..    (: Yoshiko>Nanoko>Kyoko :) Lotsa' love.
