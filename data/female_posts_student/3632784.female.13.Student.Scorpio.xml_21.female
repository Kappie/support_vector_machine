" so i said:" i'm a snowball running... running down into the spring that is coming on this love... melting down the blue sky... melting down the sunlight... shimmering love..." haha... i have got some words wrongly... cuz i am not sure of the correct words... so dun come and scold me... haha...   i hope the guy still remembers me... the first guy i held hands with... the first guy who gave me a teddy bear... the guy whom i still remember till now.. the guy whom i met just a few days ago... but he did not seem to remember me... i'm soo sad... even though i do not like him... i still feel this attachment between him and me... cuz i always hug baby to sleep... and baby reminds me of him... baby misses him too... i wonder if he will come back into my life once more... and give me happiness... well.. it wasn't really hapiness... but he was the only guy who made me feel like he was sincerely loving me... and he said that he will love me forever... but i guess i must be just listening to lies... cuz i heard that he just got a gf.. and he does not message me anymore... but never mind.. i can live for 100 years... i'll be waiting for you...  DARIUS PHEE YI RONG!!! you idiot asshole... why are you ignoring me? why do you treat  me like i am nth... i hate it ok... i hate .. hate it.. hate it... whats wrong with you... i feel soo sad now.. i wanna cry... but they can't come out... its all ur fault...
