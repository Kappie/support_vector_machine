It all came up when we were talking about the fact that I keep having repeated dreams about Amsterdam and CooCoo-Clocks.  Anyway, he asked me if I believed Prostitution is unethical.  I told him that I didn’t think it was necessarily unethical, that it was a business like any other.  If a woman chooses to sell her body like a T-bone that’s her prerogative.  That being said, I DO have Religious issues with it…a topic for another day.  It got me to considering all of the things in this world that may claim the title “Pretentious.”  Escort services and Vegas Nude shows top my list.  I have to say that I have far more respect for Prostitutes and Strippers than I do for Escorts and Vegas Dancers.  Of all the things in the world, being a Stripper cuts out the glorified mask.  If a woman says, “I’m a stripper” you really don’t have to wonder what she does, she’s not trying to pretend she’s something that she’s not.  On the other hand, if a woman tells you she’s a “Dancer in a Las Vegas Nude show” then she’s trying to hide the fact that she takes her clothes off for money behind fancy costumes, sequins and boas.  It’s ridiculous!  Likewise, if you find out that a woman is a hooker, you know what she does for a living and she’s not trying to hide it.  If she says she an “escort” you know she’s really a prostitute in disguise!    Now I realize that it is socially acceptable and politically correct to be Pretentious, but what the HELL!  Several other things that top my list of annoyingly pretentious are: Lap dogs that parade as cats, local bands who think they’ve made it big because they made a CD on their Karioke machine, fad lesbians, and Democrats!  ~Kristyn
