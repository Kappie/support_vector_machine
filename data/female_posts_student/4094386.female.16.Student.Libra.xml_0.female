I know no one would read this, why would they? but I'll write it anyway, since I don't have anything else better to do... I'll try to write this whenever I have the time... until I get bored of it-ofcourse.  So, what should I write about today? hmm... lets see... Why don't I start by telling about what's been happening to me recently...? ok... first, I recently got dumped by my boyfriend. It hurt a lot! I can still feel the pain, but I'm going to be okay... (i hope) I did love that guy...i think. but then I thought, if he loves me he won't hurt me, and he did... and I don't want to be wasting my time for a guy like that. hey, I'll continue writing this later coz i really got to go....  to be continued.....
