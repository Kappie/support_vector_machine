And a painful one. Damn parents who except you home early. Or when your siblings have to go the bar, but then end up not doing so. I feel odd right now. Like im not sure if im happy or not.  Like nothing seems to be going right. Well it is, but at the same time its not. So im just listening to Sparta. Its beautIful. while sitting wishing i could be drunk at the moment. though i know a wonderful best friend of mine who i would not be here in this world would be so mad at me saying that. I am not a drinker so much. I have only been drunk a couple times. And i would have tonight. For its not the whole popularity thing about drinking for me. because thats just stupid. Its for having a good time. letting go of thinking to hard. Its a good feeling, to an extent.  Haha. i hope my friend doesnt read this, because her opinion means much to me. Just think though if you do read this friend ( I dont like mentioning names) Maybe you do say "Drinking is for people with no personalities" But i have been your best friend for a long time, and you know i have a personality, does me wanting to drink or having done so, say that i dont have a personality? Maybe it is to vanish my sorrows. Be happy, have fun. so i hope if you do read this, you still love me. haha.  I was thinking wouldnt it be nice living out in the woods like a nature person and to build your own little hut. and be away from civilation. Away from people. Away from thoughts, thinking. Wonderful hate.  Hannah  P.S whats your opinion on guys who act nice to you out of school, then in school act like he doesn't know you? I ask myself i do continue to talk to him?  p.s.s or is it p.p.s? I am just happy i dont like anyone.
