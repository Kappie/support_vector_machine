I still dont know why he did it, or whats going on over on his side of the fence, but some things are better left unsaid i think...or at least untill one tells it on his or her own free will. so we've been talking like the old days again, nothing has changed, but even though he came back, and apologized, i still feel  KIND OF  ...hurt i guess i dont exaclty know....oh! emotion!...its such a complicated thing, you wouldnt understand.lol well, im off, im playing SURVIVOR with myself to see how long i can go with out eating! whee!!!
