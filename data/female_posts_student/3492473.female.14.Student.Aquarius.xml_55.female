I was just so bored I decided to at least make a post so you  hooked readers  out there wouldn't freak out if I didn't post one today. I got up at 2 PM today, yes,   2 PM   becauseI went to bed around 4 AM. And I didn't have to go to my Grandpa's today (I'm going Tuesday) so I could sleep in.Then I just cleaned and watched the Bug Juice marathon on Disney til it was time for soccer. It was really weird, I hardly ever watch Disney. All I watch is MTV except on Tuesdays for America's Next Top Model. That show is  really  good! And it made me really miss camp and all of my friends there. I won't see them til next summer. And it sucks because I live so far from them whena bunch of them all live in Boardman and one lives in PA by this one girl's dad so they can see each other. ThenI went to soccer. It was fun, as usual. I mean it's one of my  "escapes,"  it better be fun. But while we were scrimmaging I was cheering because John had the ball and you knew he was gonna score, and Dave was like,"Why are you screaming?" He was on the other team so I don't know if that's why he asked me or what. But I didn't wanna say I was cheering so I just mumbled, "I have a tendency to scream like that..." It's so hard going from captain of the middle school team to some freshman nothing. At the beginning I was scared to even talk! I never called the ball or said good job or anything.  And you all know how outgoing I am.  That's how  intimidated  I was. I'm coming out of my shell now but I'm still in there a little. It's just I don't wanna say the wrong thing because I don't want the rest of the team to think badly of me. I guess I'm just out there to prove myself. But people frustrate me on the team sometimes. Like some people think they're the best at the game and others get big headed. But it's part of the game. I hope I do well this season. I hope I get to play a lot. I didn't play much in 8th grade because Sobul made me C team captain because "I'm good with the kids." Well, damn me. But today at practice I got hit in the face with the ball from like a foot away. I really don't know what happened. It didn't hurt, my contact just got screwed it and it was hard to see. But it's good to know that Nicole, Carly, and I are all getting along good. We're " the " girls who play with the  big boys.  And we wouldn't want it any other way!! It's good to be a girl sometimes. But for the record, John Gulden is   NOT   hot! Sorry Car!
