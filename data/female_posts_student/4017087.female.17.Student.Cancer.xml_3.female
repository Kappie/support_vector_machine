I can't stand to be corny or "38" when I'm in my ordinary self.   I've been back from the mainland for a week (got back last Monday). Why haven't I updated since then? An insincere thanks to the creator of the bug that crippled my laptop for days, leaving me immobile to the e-world throughout that period.   Hopefully, I can get some research done today. I've made sure that I appear  invisible  to anyone on my MSN and Yahoo messenger lists, so I don't get bombarded with a load of messages like I was yesterday (not that I'm complaining...).   I'm so glad that Tony Wu and I are friends again! Before graduation, I stuck my nose up in the air and refused to talk to him anymore because I thought our friendship was getting nowhere, just worse. Fully appreciative that he mustered up enough courage to talk to me again on our A-level class trip to Tamshui, Taipei, I will give him a hug next time I see him! We talked online yesterday night... he broke up with his girlfriend 小綠, but is extremely happy that we're best buddies again.   Speaking of breaking up, quite a few people have been reporting to me of breaking up with their other half! Excuse me, if I'm not mistakened, Chinese Valentine's Day is nearing -- are you guys just too broke to splurge for that ultra romantic candlelight dinner or is Cupid playing tricks on ya?! Gosh, this is sad. It is sad because many break ups are not of mutual agreement; someone (if not both) gets hurt in the process. Oh well, at least there's one person to be happy for: Jay. Jay is terribly in love now :) Go Jay! Haha :)   Anyway, I am supposed to go to Cashbox KTV today. But I'm not going. I'm terrified by the prospect of singing in front of a room full of people, even with the lights dimmed and everyone woozy from the alcohol. I'll go next time though, I kind of enjoy laying on the couch, eating tiramisu and listening to my friends belt out their off-key version of "Fly Away," even if it means wasting $300 NT :o)
