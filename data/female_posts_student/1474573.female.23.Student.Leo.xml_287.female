It stands for What Would Jesus Do?  i.e. Live like Jesus and all will be good in the world...or some shit like that.  But, see, I'm not a good Christian so I'mo change that shit up for today to: What Would JACK Do?  Jack being Special Agent Jack Bauer, Head of the Counter Intelligence Agency for the United States.  Sorry, are there others?    So lets see... we've seen Jack pick up a heroin addiction to get an 'in' with the drug lords... He has been tortured to the point of death (see Season 2), he's been shot at numerous times, his daughter was kidnapped, his wife killed by his old partner who turned on him, his last girlfriend was also killed trying to save his partner from torture, um... oh yeah, his partner got tortured and he saved him, he had to KILL another agent (see one of my previous blogs) because a terrorist willed it so, and lastly he had to chop off his partner's hand.  Why?  Well to save the country, of course.  Well a few things happened to save a Presidential Candidate, but still...  So basically, yeah, 24 was really f'in good last night!!  The biting the pillow because you know what's coming next (see above about chopping his partner's hand off), and the Gasps of disbelief about it all.  Gael is dead.  The President's wife is dead.  The terrorist is dead.  For now, Chase is handless, Tony is going to jail for treason after saving Michele who should be dead because she was exposed to the virus but turns out to be immune, then gets kidnapped and he tries to break her out.  Um, yeah, the show is kinda jammed packed with shit.  But you know what really got to me?  After everything is all over and he 'saves the world' so-to-speak, he goes into his Ford Truck (yes, even 24 has product placement) and fuckin' just starts breaking down.  Like, the kinda breakdown that's worthy of an Oscar (or an Emmy).  So of course, you know my ass was bawling too.  I mean, hell, it was a long fuckin' day for the guy!  Of course it didn't last that long because he was being beckoned to debreif some mo'fos somewhere else, but it was quite poignant if I do say so myself.  sniffle.
