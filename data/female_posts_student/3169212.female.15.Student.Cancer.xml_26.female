Nothing in particular, some might make it and others won't. Although, I do think they'll all make it.        Kurama: You didn't answer my question.        Baka: Oh well.        ***    (date unknown)        Dais Games: Chapter (not determined)        (Spirit detectives and Dais somehow turn up in a pitch black cave, maybe teleported in, or some other-worldly apparition from Dais' past leads them there to uncover something; I'll work out the details later)(They know she is a fire adept)         Yusuke:  You know, it would be nice to have some light, like a torch? *turns to glare at the barely visible silhouette of Dais (Kurama has been using one of his plant concoctions to illuminate the cave)*         Kuwabara:  Yeah, that would be nice.         Dais:  *the general spiteful attitude it in place here* 'If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets.'        Hiei: *sideways glance at the taller demon* Who the hell says that?        Dais: *very annoyed* The disembodied entities that people credit phrases to because they don't know or care who really said it. Why do you think I know?        *Hiei doesn't respond*        *Kuwabara stops for a second trying to make sense of Dais' statement*        Dais: It's not that difficult, dumb-ass.        ***    (date unknown)        Random Idea        I think I'm going to make Dais like Sohma Hatsuhara from Fruits Basket. I like the idea of her having two personalities, however, I'd prefer that she works progressively up to the darker side.        I was also thinking of putting in a scene like at the beginning of Saiyuki Volume 3 where an evil demon from Dais' past removes and obliterates her power limiter and she reverts to her ultimate demon form.        That evil demon could be named Yisou like that fellow who has it out for Hakkai at the end of Volume 3.        ***    (date unknown)        Dais Games: Chapter (not determined)        (The group is in the depths of the forest surrounded by shikigami of the evil demon, Yisou [why let a perfectly good yin-yang master go to waste])(Dais' glare is fixated on her ultimate enemy, unaware of what he is about to do)        Yisou: *eyes shining with insanely devious pleasure at his greatest scheme) You wandered right into my trap. How utterly stupid of you.        *Dais' narrows eyes*        *the other four glance at one another wondering about this mysterious demon*        *Yisou motions to one of the shikigami nearest to Dais*        *it grabs her arm and throws Dais before the demon's feet*        Kurama: *worried* Dais...        *she risesto her feet and meets Yisou's gaze*        Yisou: I suppose they don't know about your awful secret. Shame you can't be honest with them. All of you will learn the hard way.        *Dais, finally realizing the demon's plan, thrusts her claws at Yisou's chest*        *he grabs her wrist with bone crushing force*        *Dais gasps at the immense pain*        *Yisou smiles even more wickedly**he grabs the solid gold arm band above her elbow and squeezes it until it shatters*        Dais: No...        *for a second she looks as though she is about to faint**her eyes turn a blood red color and she sinks to the ground trembling in agony*        ***        Baka: That's all I really have for this particular entry.        Kurama: I can't wait for the ending.        Baka: Saying that just makes you sound like a perv, you know?        Kurama: Don't spoil it for everyone else.        Baka: You're starting to sound more and more like Sohma Shigure.        Kurama: Who's that?        Baka: You'd have to watch and read Fruits Basket.
