My mom and I go alot to see deer an what not. But tonight was a bit different. We went for some band called like Black Jam or whatever. Supposedly every Wednesday night they have some band. We first pull up and park, duh. Then as I am walking down to the Marina, some teenage guy comes up to my mom and Iwith a sign on his stomach and says I need a hug or I will die. I look at him with some freakish look and say "suuuure why not." And so I hugged the guy. Yeah, what a weird experience. Anywho, so my mom and I sit on a bench looking out over the reservoir. That was nice. The music they had was like a bluegrass genre. So, I enjoyed it. Then as the sun began to set my mom and Iget up and leave so we can venture around the park before 9 when they close the gates in on us. Well, we are driving around and what do ya know, there are two deer just eating away,how cutesy. We conitnue the journey to find so scavangers-also know as- raccoons digging in the trash-can and the baby coon climbs up the tree. Such a Kodak moment. Then cruisin' more,some huge thing swoops in front of the car. This creature was an owl. So we pull over and I start hootin' at it. It was kinda scary. I thought maybe it would come peck my eyes out or something. So by that time its time to leave. We drive down 56th Street where we see even more deer,and they are even crossing the street. I sooo can't see Bambi getting hit. But anyway, overrall the outing was great. I really would love to live in the country just so I can have all the creatures living in my yard and then I wouldn't have to travel to a park to see them.        Today, yeah, believe it or not, I did do alot. Not only did I have the outing at Eagle Creek, this girl got busy. Busy on searching for a job. I had previously applied at Petco. But those people must not have known what an animal lover I was since they never hired me. So, I have made it a goal NOT to work at fast food. That is when I come upon the sign at the Dollar Tree. Yes, I know its a dollar store and I won't get paid squat. But at least I will have more money than what I have now. So yes, I applied there. Then my neighbor works at Pearson Education. She explains what she does and says she makes good money. So I went there today also. I went in and the people at the front desk tell me I have to sit down to fill it out the application now. I was like uh oh. I need my mommy. But I was a big girl and sat and filled it out on my own. The questions asked were hard, well for me at least. So I finally get done and turn it in. But as I hand it to the lady at the front desk I ask" Do you have to be at least 18 yrs. of age to work here?" She replies with,"Yes". Then my next words are,"Well, then you might just wanna go ahead and throw the application away now." She laughs, I leave. Word to the wise: Ask how old you have to be to work anywhere, BEFORE you sit and fill out a huge application. But, good news, on the way to Pearson Education, I remember GFS (Gordon Food Service) was hiring. So I walked up there to get the application while 3 girls stare at me with disgust. They are just mad because I am going to take their jobs, well hopefully. So I sit and fill that application out, walk back in to ask this guy where I turn the application in at. He then says that he will take it. Good news, he was the asst. manager..hehehe. So I made sure I showed my pearly whites! He looked over it alittle while I stood there, and made some comments. So, I really think that place might be a winner. I did see a hiring sign at Tuchmans (sp?)Cleaners. They are paying up to $9/hr.WOWZERS Buuuut, you have to be 18, see..I asked first! So yeah that was my business experience.        By the way, I kinda sorta found this new store. It's on 38th Street in the shopping strip where CiCi's Pizza is. The name is Total Fashions,I think. Anywho, I asked Leah to go over there so she said sure. Well, I am glad I did. They have some stylish clothes, some formal dresses, wigs, hats, and other accessories. Then they have like this wall of stuff for a dollar, yes, 1 DOLLAR! So I almost got nail polish and black eye liner..until I saw earrings, toe rings, and anklets. So yeah, I spent some money.        Ok, well well well, I think I wrote an awful lot. But hope you learned something such as the 'word to the wise' part.But yeah, shoooo my wrists hurt so I am outtie!
