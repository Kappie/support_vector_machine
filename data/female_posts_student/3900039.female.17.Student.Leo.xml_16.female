It didn't really hit me until I went to hung him goodbye and it's wierd to think I might never see him again. Hopefully, that doesn't happen. He is an awesome, hilarious person and I love him dearly and will miss him tons. The picture is of Carol, Christina, Mo and Mark at New Years. Come back and visit Mo, and if I'm ever in Germany, I better see you! We have so many great memories... New Years at Justine's, getting pulled over by your house(thats the best one! HA), your belly, dancing, helping you write essays with proper grammar, so so many... I'm thankful to have had you in my life :D
