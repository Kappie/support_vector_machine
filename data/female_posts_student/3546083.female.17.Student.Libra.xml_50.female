He promised me the moon; I got loneliness instead. Broken dreams lay in tiny shards wedged deep within my broken heart. So i condemned myself to a life of isolation. In sad loneliness I would await salvation. And now like a fool I've fallen once more For this same old feeling That deceived me before. And those same old words that proved untrue, and left me alone with my tears which the rest of the world was deaf to. It's the same old feeling, but different somehow, allowing me to hope and feel like i feel right now: Like my heart is safe, and this time things will be different, like I may finally find relief  from my inner torment. Should my heart again be broken and my hopes be unfounded, I will return once again to despair unbounded. Please be gentle, for the heart is a fragile thing. And only love can finally give it wings. So here's my heart-- Do with it what you will-- containing all my love, and everything else I feel.
