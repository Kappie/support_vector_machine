I want to ad a comments portion to this page and, unfortunately, I must use a blog template instead of one I created in order to do that. Too bad I'm not more computer savvy. I can create the template, but can't get the comments to work. Heh. Ironic. You'd think this would be easier. Oh well, this is a farewell message to the old colorful way of blogger way. I'm a fan of the color black, as many of you should know, and so...here goes. Here I come black blogger page. I shall miss you colorful one. :(
