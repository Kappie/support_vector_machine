Some people were like - "Wow it's great" and others were like "Oh my god what have you DONE?"    Well apparently Sami's been on this and just to see how carefully she's reading it - HI SAMI ... anyway...   I have one last rehersal tomorrow before tuesday and I'm a bit scared, but not as much as Jen seeing as she busted her hand up yesterday and can't actually play! Oh dear.    I'm also a bit scared seeing as Kes and Laurapoos have been talking about how they're going to make my birthday present tonight...I managed to catch something like "they've got to go in the thing..." or something like that but I'm a little confused. It's a bomb isn't it? Or a jackinabox or something where you open the lid and something leaps out and grabs you... or not.
