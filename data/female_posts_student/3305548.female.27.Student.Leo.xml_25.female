It has minimal dialogue, and this makes it have the feeling of a short that grew legs. The comedy is consistant and very enjoyable, the plot has its bizarre and enjoyable quirks, and there are stereotypes present that play out very well. There are several unique characters in the movie - not the least of which being the title triplettes. I have never seen such creative use of World War 1 grenades, nor heard such thoroughly enjoyable abstract music. Actually, I take that back. There was a man who married a dancer from OU *tries to remember either of their names* and he produced this piece of music using a typewriter hitting the Q key only. Very interesting and rhythmic. The triplettes would have loved it. Anywho, I like the fact that none of the characters are perfect in this feature, and that the main characters are all "old biddies" - none of which I would want to meet in a dark alley :) Old biddies will someday be ruling this planet - mark my words.   Throughout this movie common household items and common occurrences take on extraordianry meaning. Everything from a bicycle to a refridgerator or vacuum are almost worshipped for their various uses. And sometimes not used in their ordinary ways. The passing of trains seems to give meaning to the canine character, and french cultural references in themselves seem to take on a greater meaning as well. The dog, Bruno, has some great dream sequences which I really thought were well done. They were abstract, well visualized, and perhaps most remarkably in black and white - an eye for detail that was perfect. So we have a sleuth case with an old lady solving it - but this is no Murder She Wrote.  No no no, far too abstract for Angela Lansbury and far too French for any British Biddy Sleuther. Ah, French. The music, the artwork, the mood, the almost philosophical reinforcement of day to day life as consistant and habitual and filled with individual obsessions. The surrounding characters and artwork were at times more or less characactures of French imagery stereotypes. The mafia men were all great play with stereotypes - from the wine slooshing to the red noses and berets. It was done perfectly. The animation artwork in itself was very French...that certain 2D style applied to 3D work - reminding me of many things...Lyle Lyle Crocodile, the Aristocats, a set for a version of Tartuffe I very much enjoyed that played at OU..not to say that the animation was in anyway flat...oh no! Rather, it was classic.  There was one great moment of irony that I just have to mention before telling you to GO RENT IT...During one scene/interlude the triplettes are going to bed for the night and they are watching TV...They are animations watching a live action comedy on TV. I thought that was so funny and enjoyably ironic. The only part I did not enjoy of the entire movie was a certain lack of poetic justice for a certain frog. But ceste la vie. Ceste la cine de francais.  Before the movie we prepared dinner for my mother in law as a belated mothers day gift. It went well and all was enjoyed immensely. Which is a good thing.  After the movie we were semi bored and whipped out this card game we have had for ages and never played. It is a version of Mystery Rummy - Dr. Jekkyl and Mr. Hyde. Now the Jack the Ripper set was alot of fun so we ordered the other two versions that were out at the time (the third set being Murder at the Rue Morgue.) However, these other two versions were set up very differently and they just never quite caught our attention to play them. Well that changed tonight. My husband kicked my butt royally as we played four or so hands of the Mystery Rummy game. Needless to say, we had to work out some kinks of rules we had missed and cards we didnt read closely enough...but I would say tomorrow I shall exact my rummy revenge.  Another Sunday gone. I dont like Sundays in general - of course they are alot nicer if you sleep halfway through them like I did today. It helps them go quicker.  We also added the rabies shot tag to Henry's collar. This means he jingles adorably now as he trots through the basement, or scratches, or shakes his head in befuddlement of the jingling noise that now seems to be haunting him. Poor kitty. He has an ID tube that will go on his collar once we receive it - that will add to the jingling, but hopefully he will be ignoring the sound by the time the order gets here...Most impressively he allowed me to take off and put back on the collar with no incident whatsoever. There was no "run away while shes got the collar off!! ha ha she will never get that contraption back on me now" moment. He watched with some curiosity as I attached a red heart shape rabies vaccine tag that we got at the vets this past Friday, and then let me put his collar right back on him. Sometimes I wonder if our cat is stupid or civilized. I really cant tell.  --Mack
