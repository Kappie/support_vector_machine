Because I like to pretend I'm still in high school, I have to create a fake name for the guy I'm interested in. In fact, we call the whole operation to get me to hook up with him "Project Phoenix." I'm aware that this is also the name for some scientific thing. My friend the astrophysicist came up with it.)        Anyway, went to see  Spiderman 2  with a bunch of people today. The movie was at 12:30. Why would anyone go to a movie that early? So that's why I thought I was being bitchy. But then we got lunch and when we got to the theater and met up with everyone else The Phoenix was there, so I obviously put my best face on and was all smiles and giggles and batting eyelashes.        After the movie we all went our separate ways. Rob  Vix went to do their shopping, James and his Vikki went to do their shopping, Peter J. went to Pizza Hut, and The Welshman went to the Orange shop (no doubt influenced by Mr. Dresden and the greatest series of movie advertisements in history*). The Phoenix was going to the library. I, conveniently, was going to the post office - in the same direction as the library. Poor Dan made the mistake of asking if I wanted to wait for him to get a cable for his iPod and walk back with him. My rare blend of desperation and hormones shot him down in a particularly bitchy fashion.        I hadn't even seen The Phoenix in over three weeks. We are star-crossed. Just being able to walk back from town with him was enough to make me squeal with glee. (Text I sent to Rob afterwards: "Eeeeeeeee!") So we walked back and chatted and it was lovely. Apparently now he lives, like, an hour's walk away, which explains why I never see him around town, and also  sucks . But we'll be writing together next week which is cool.        But the point of this was my bitchiness, which apparently Dan had only gotten a taste of earlier. Rob, Dan and I got together later to do some sketch writing and, as per usual, Dan and I were clashing on some key issues. I bitched him out but good. I basically told him next time he condescendingly over-explained something to me we would have some major issues.        And the perfect way to end this? I am, of course, watching  Degrassi , and J.T. and Toby are buying condoms. Toby comments on the different flavors, and J.T. says, "Too bad they don't have bacon!" What a great show.          (* The Orange Ads : If you live outside of the UK and don't have the privilege of the Orange pre-movie ads, I don't know what to tell you. They're brilliant, Spike Lee rocks, and don't let a mobile phone ruin  your  movie.)
