You know, the one where your required by the law of magazine laws to stay put for something like two years. This is all I ask. Oh, this and to be eternally happy doing something I love. But thats it. For now.  But on to more immediate matters. This weekend is the Folk Festival. I didn't go last year and I feel poorly about having not supported my local music scene. But I will go this year, come hell or high water (which might happen in this port city). And I promise not to embaress my best friend in front of Hawksley Workman (this time), as long as she promises not to embaress me in front of the cute bass player from the Trews. This time. I think its a fair deal.  Does anyone else feel that the upcoming U.S. election is overshadowing the more important matter that we have the devil as PM?  And did anyone see the Oprah where she talks about her time in South Africa (I realize she talks about it more than once). I"m passivly watching this one right now and I"m realizing that I was in Cape Town the same time she was there. Not that it would have mattered had I known at the time...but its a 'humph' moment for me...an 'I didn't know that' moment.
