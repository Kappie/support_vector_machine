She was bored, so I told her to come on over. Well, turns out that today was the day she could LEGALLY drive ppl around, so we decided to go out for a bit. In order for it to be ok with my parents we said we'd just drive around town. Amanda's parents actually wanted her to get some errands ran, so we did that. Then when that was done we decided to just drive around...well we went up into some roads that we didn't know very well and were just driving around listening to music. It was really fun but Amanda was a little nervous since she didn't really know the roads that well and cuz it was dark. Also, it didnt help much that I was talking about serial killers and rapists. We decided to go back into town, cuz Amanda wanted to get something to eat. So we went to mcdonalds and we decided that she would eat in front of our friend Alex's house. So we go to Alex's and Amanda is eating her food when she notices that Ethan's car is in the driveway. We start laughing and wondering why it's there. Being the brilliant ppl we are, we decided to tap on Alex's bedroom window, so we do that and then we run and hide. Well Alex and Ethan come outside and Ethan starts pretending that he's mad (well he was acting like he was mad, but me and amanda kinda thought he was joking but not...so we arent really sure). Then it gets kinda weird, cuz its just the 4 of us standing in alex's driveway. Me and amanda felt really weird, so we decided to leave.  When we got into the car and drove away we decided that was a really stupid idea. Ya live, ya learn. Omgsh...at the store I saw Jory! I am like in love with him! He is way hot! But anyways...that was basically my night. Oh, when we got back to my house I showed Amanda my permit, and she was in shock. good times. Dammit, my mom is nosy. She just came into the computer room, and started reading this. Good thing the part about me and amanda joyriding wasnt visible. She would have had a cow right then and there! Freakin A! That's it. Bada-bing, Bada-boom!
