Yesterday we had our last dress rehearsal, which for me, was horrible. I performed like I always did, like I've been rehearsing for the past 2 weeks, but suddenly, my acting isn't good enough! I need to laugh more, have more chemistry with Noah, I need to gesture more here, blah, blah, blah. I love how she waits to tell me these things THE NIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW OPENS!!!!!!!!! Dammit! I was so mad. Ugh. Anyways, we got our results from wind ensemble back. Hehe...yeah. Last chair, woo hoo! Looks like we'll have about 5 trombones in w/e next year. I wouldn't be that pissed, but Miller beat me! What the hell?! Ga, I am so much better than Miller! Not fair. I'm going to challenge like no one has ever challenged before! You watch, I'll be second chair before the month of September is over! Muhahahaha...ha. Anyways...I'm going to see that drama thing at Westfield today. That is, if Laura decides to pick me up...we'll see. So yeah, come and see Anything Goes, Friday April 30, at 7:30 and Sunday, May 2 at 2pm. Lake Park east campus auditorium. Yay!
