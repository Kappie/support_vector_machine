Ok i sound stupid trying to talk in bio terms. who am i to use biowhen i hate bio...To put it simply, 4s2 is like my stead lah. The company i get, i enjoy. The jokes i hear, i laugh heartedly. The advice i get, i put it to use. The help that comes, i cling onto it like a log. I dun mind seeing my buddies everyday, i cant get enough of them.   I get my joy peace and laughter from my buddies.   Separation is not sweet. Yet I am addicted to my sweet buddies.   I sure do miss my buddies in 4s2. U ple do also right?
