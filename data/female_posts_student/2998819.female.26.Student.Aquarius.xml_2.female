When my brother and I run together we start off together but after a mile we start to drift apart then by the end he is waiting for me at the car.  On our second mile my brother was a few feet ahead of me but we were having a conversation as if we were right next to each other.  This lady noticed and made a comment on the distance and thought it was weird that we were carrying on a conversation.  As we past her on the last mile Steve was quite a bit ahead of me, and I screamed to Steve.  The lady thought we were nuts.  I get a kick out of watching people's reaction while I am running.  Great fun.  Weight: 176 Body fat: 38 Quote: I may not be fast, but I am faster than I was yesterday
