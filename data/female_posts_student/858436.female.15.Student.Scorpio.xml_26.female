First, I talked to some middle Eastern guy I could hardly understand, and he didn't help. Then I talked to Melvin, another middle Eastern guy that I could understand, and after an hour on the phone, we got it fixed. Don't waste your money on AOL!  Today I sat around the house and did nothing. It was boring.  I'm not finished on anyone's Christmas presents at all! Well, I have my sister's and my mom is getting my brother's for me, but that's it. Yikes.   Mmm... peppermint stick ice cream.
