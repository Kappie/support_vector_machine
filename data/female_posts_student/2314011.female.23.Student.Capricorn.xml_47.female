Also thought I'd let you know this could very well become my sole mode of communication for a bit, unless you contact me.  I mean, I'll totally talk if you call me, and I'll read and enjoy any comments/emails sent in, but don't feel hurt if/when I don't respond until the week of Christmas.  Feel like I'm entering (or have entered) a Zone...of what exactly, I'm not sure, but one I don't plan on returning from for two weeks.  Coming of it out a bit for some Thursday night TV, tea and Grandma's home-made cinnamon rolls.
