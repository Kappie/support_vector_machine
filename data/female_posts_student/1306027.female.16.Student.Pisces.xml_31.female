The expierence was like an ominous cloud that sat over top of my head chanting, "I'm gonna drown you, I'm gonna drown you!" I may sound like I'm exaggerating- But your not from *insert city and state here.* This city just so happens to be caught in a continuous time warp bubble thing while the whole outside world is poking it with it's advancement needles. Meh, so I had a bad time, do you want to hear about it?     Well your going to anyway  You know how most tragic stories have a underlying event that seems to lead in the cascading of all events? Well, on the second day of my arrival at *insert city and state here*(Notice how I skip straight to the second day- this may be because on the first day we had just arrived at 6pm with a false hope that we might have a nice vacation.) we are sitting in my grandparents house discussing what my grandfather had learned from a set of Creation Science tapes when my grandmother recieves a call. Actually it was three calls- you know how bad things come in threes? Well this was one of those times. On the third call my grandmother's face twisted into a vortex of bad tidings as she screamed, "WHAT, WHAT, KEN, TREE??" I shouted for silence and the tv and computer went off. As we sat there thinking, "Who is possibly so deaf that grandma has to shout?" my grandma got off the phone. "Kenneth got hit by a tree," my grandma said. "A Tree?? How the heck did he get hit by a tree?" was the unanimous thought traveling through every family members mind but alexs (his mind was in the computer game). I sprint for the cheeseball and the crakers and we make for the hospital. While on the way, we call my aunt who calls my cousin who calls someone else and they all agree to meet at the hospital. Everyone is there and we are all waiting for my uncle to arrive on the stretcher. My great uncle's wife and daughter arrive in an array of nerves and tears. "They think he's broke his back," my great aunt says choking at the own realization of her words. Finally he arrives and they dont think he's broke his back. The long process ahead were the xrays which took about 2 1/2 hours to complete. "He's gonna ok, they know now that he only broke his leg", says someone. Alex is getting really anxious now- we've been sitting here for 3 hours. I decide on affirmitive action and take him to get something to eat. Soon, we left the hospital and headed to the hotel for some rest which we did not get.     Wow, that sucks.  Yeah it did. And the octoberfest sucked too. The prices were high and the bee's were attacking like the Bats in  Bats  So all in all, my vacation sucked. And that is the end of my complaining today.
