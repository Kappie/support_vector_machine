I just had an awesome weekend... today me and my little sis saw Harry Potter, and of course, it was good.. and then we went to Mongolian Grill and I ate so much because it was like the first thing I ate all day because I woke up around 1... I was up until almost 4 last night, cause of prom. Which was SO FUN and one of the best nights I can think of. The place was great, the food was great, the company was great ( ;)  ). Best night ever.  Oh also yesterday, I think I did pretty good at the SATs (math's gonna kill me though).  TEN AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL
