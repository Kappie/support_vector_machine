Eugh, I'm so glad we have the holidays no more putting up with the WSLs! Yeay! We actually have freedom! Weirdness to the world! Hehe... but we don't have to be judged and put down for every thing we do now! If I see her during the holidays I think I seriously might have to restrain myself so I don't punch her... we've gone over it. Yeah, slightly obsessed - but passionatly (spelling! aargh I'm trying, sorry!) so! And darn proud of it! Hmm... I'm in a freaky mood... COOL! Ok, so 10:30, Thursday, Superdrug got it every one? Good! I'm gonna go freak the world! ...Wait a minute... done that already damn! (Well I beat Izzy to it!) Bisi!
