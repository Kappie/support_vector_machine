Now I only have  4 days left of school and still tons of homework. Its so stressful. On top of that I'm going to be gone this weekend; to my boyfriend's Graduation in Audubon. Plus next Tuesday, I have my very first piano recital. I have been playing for like 2 years, but i've gone through 7 levels of piano in 1 year. I'm very nervous for that. PLUS I also have Semester Finals next week! ahhh I just want to scream!      I've realized in this short amount of time of Using Blog, it's allowed me to collect myself, and my thoughts. I'll write more later. I have to do my Geometry and Biology.
