I think the most interesting part of the day was when I got to talk to Nick and Chelsea....I live a sad life, or so it seems. (lol) Ooh, this is my first post, so that's why it's so uninteresting!!!!...yeh, that'll be my excuse for today's post. Well, that's all for today...or maybe it's not..? Tootles!--Shannon
