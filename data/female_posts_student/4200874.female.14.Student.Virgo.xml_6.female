Really, really LOVE this track. Anyhow, wasted my time last evening lookin for his songs. Didn't manage to find those that I like. Maybe I was mistakened. Oh well...;(      Anyhow, spent the whole of today, after I did my Amath homework that is, which I managed to do ALL : GO-ME, ahem, helping my sister with her IPW project. Sad to say but she's seriously HOPELESS. Together with her friends that is. I'm probably REALLY nice you must think. Coz even despite her pestering me to use the computer all the time, there I was spending hours doing something I had ABSOLUTELY no mood for! I do enjoy doing such things, it was just that I wasn't in the mood. I think it was passable though.       Learning Journeys tommorrow irritating me! Track-pants sucks...  all of us have to wear 'em. And PE T-shirt as well. GROSS!! Anyhow... I'm wearing denims so not too bad!! To hell to those who aren't too happy with that. I hope it'll all be fun. I'm doin it with 3Z, not with 3S... sad. :( suck it up, i know.       Too tired for anything else...       -G'night-       sometimes I think that you'll never     understand me     but something tells me together     we'd be happy          (baby)     I will be your father figure     (oh baby)     put your tiny hand in mine     (I'd love to)     I will be you preacher teacher     (    be your daddy)     anything you have in mind     (it would make me)     I will be you father figure     (very happy)     I have had enough of crime     (please let me)     I will be the one who loves you-     until the end of time
