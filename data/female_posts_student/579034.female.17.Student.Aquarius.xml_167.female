About 20 minutes ago I just went to the last 8th period of my hight school career (seniors only have 7 in my school). It's just like.. this all going by too fast. Heres an artical I wrote for the school paper and I'm really proud of, hpoe you all like it:  We never fully grasp just how fast time flies until we experiance it for ourselves. Many of us are laboring under the delusion that we are going to be young forever; that we are going to live forever and this reality that we live in called "high school" is going to be the most domiant aspect of our lives till the second coming of Christ. The real truth is that there is a whole other world out there waiting for us. There are so many other things beyond Staten Island to experiance. For the longest time I have been waiting for the moment when I can get on a plane and get out of here. To get off this island and see what else the world has to offer. I'm beginning to see just three years ago I walked into our school and thought to myself, "Wow, so this is high school." Now, itr seems like these past three years were so much more then just high school. It was lost elections, rumors, new friendships, broken friendships, stressful nights studying for tests, annoying teachers, annoying classmates, and college preparation. Three years ago I was worried about what sophomore year would bring, and now im worrying about what college I'm going to apply to next year. It's amazing. A few months ago, we drew up our senior schedules. A few weeks ago, we ordered our senior sweaters, and in September, the junior class will become the class of 2005. Little by little our senior year is coming closer, looming before us like some great pair of golden gates leading us to our futures. It is time for us to come out of our delusion. It is time to realize that youth, while still always inside us, is being rushed by time, tests, teachers, and parents. I am just now coming to terms with the fact that I only have one year left with the... interesting... and... diverse people that attend SJSHS. There is only one more year with each other till we all go away. Even if you aren't BEST friends with EVERYONE in the school, you've got to admit, it's a sad thing to have to say goodbye to the people you've spent every day with for the last four years. I know next year when I go away, I will miss all of you terribly, even if I don't KNOW all of you. Every student in the school - freshman, sophomore, junior, senior - is bround together by the force that is the name SJSHS. We are a huge family, though we are divided into our own little sections, and it's always hard to say goodbye to family. Excuse my emotional moment. Just a few closing words and that's it, I promise. Seniors, good luck out there. Juniors, let's make our last year together great.
