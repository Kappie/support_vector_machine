I don't really have much time because we're leaving for the parade shortly-ish, and I really can't go into detail on everything right now anyway.    Friday night...  Everything got all messed up, stuff almost didn't happen, Lainie couldn't come, but in the end it was me, Beth, Crazy Katie, Robert, Sam, and Heathy.  Heathy and I scared Robert when we were waiting in his car after he got off work...  We originally had everyone in the car w/ arms and legs hanging out so it looked like we had a giant orgy, but then Beth, Sam, and Katie left so we wouldn't miss the pizza guy when he came.  But yeah... the biggest part of the night was the Spin-the-Bottle game which everyone except Beth played.  At first it was: guys shake hands, otherwise same sex kiss on the cheek, opposite sex kiss on the lips.  Then after awhile it was changed to: same sex on the lips, opposite sex w/ tongues.  We started counting when two people were kissing to see how long they would go for -- Crazy Katie and Robert seemed like they'd never end, and Sam and Heathy went for awhile a few times.  Robert and I went for like, 10/15 seconds before Katie jumped up and pulled us apart, and I'm not really sure about me and Sam.  But then shit went downhill and lots of people got quite emotional, and... Yeah.  Then Robert and Sam went back to Robert's house around 3ish, and the rest of us sat up talking a little longer then we went to bed at about 4.  Poor Heathy... she had to get up at 6...  But yeah... Argh, I don't want to post any of the other shitin here, b/c I already vented to Heathy about it at Beth's, I'm going to talk to Lainie today, and I REALLY don't need the entire world knowing all the details.  B/c some of the details are things that I want to keep secret...  Plus there's stuff that I want to talk to Sam about, but I can't tell him yet, and there's stuff I REALLY need to tell Ken and make him see and accept...  Not fair not fair not fair...  Yesterday...  it started off really shitty b/c I woke up and George thought it was cool to stop by in the middle of the night, and then I had super bad cramps.  I really wanted to talk to Lainie, and Thurs. I thought she told meshe worked 12-5 on Sat (which I must've heard worng...), so Beth and I walked down to the Red Rooster.  Now, walking from Beth's to there w/ cramps, a headache, being tired as hell, and feeling 150% shitty makes it a damn long walk, and I wanted to just collapse halfway there...  Then we got there (1:30ish), and Lainie's van wasn't there.  So right then and there I think I lost half of my grip on everything, then I went inside and Ghandi was working and he said Lainie didn't come in until 4, and I started to freak out and he looked at me weird and asked me if everythign was okay, and that's when I just totally lost it.  I ran to the bathroom and sobbed for 5 mins, called my dad and said I wanted him to pick me up, then I sat by the b-room crying until I saw his car pull up...  Went home and sat in my room for god knows how long, and took a nap...  But then around 8:30 ish I called Robert (he and Crazy Katie were supposed to go up to R in Madison, and I wanted to make sure he knew it was postponed).  Anyway, he asked what I was doing and I said nothing, so he asked if I wanted to come over. So he picked me up and me, him, Katie, AJ, and Richie went to his house and lit off fireworks in his backyard.  Robert was putting stuff in potatos and blowing them up, then throwing little potato chunks at me... Grrrr...  Then at 10 Jenny came over, then everyone except Richie went to Kayla Shaapveld's grad party.  It was a little akward b/c I didn't know/get along with a lot of the people there (Scott Boie...), but it was fun anyway.  Then Katie and I left and went to get Dunkin Donuts, but there was a bunch of creepy looking people stanging outside the door so we just left and came back here.  Talked for awhile, then Ken called and I talked to him, then I came back inside, and blah.  Katie left at like, 8:30 this morning.  She wants to cancel her backpacking trip, and her mom is going to freak out...  Idk...  "Are you going to the parade?" ... so help me god, if either of my parents asks me this question one more time I'll shoot myself.  YES, I AM!  Just like I said the last 6 times you asked...    I think I'm going to call Beth now, and Lainie.  Then get in the shower.  I'll see everyone at the parade or tonight at the fireworks or whenever I see you...
