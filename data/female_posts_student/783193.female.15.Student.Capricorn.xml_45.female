I turned in my application for Sulphur Creek volunteering on Tuesday, and my physical checkup form for volleyball tryouts. There's an open gym on June 24, from 6:00-8:00 pm, if anyone wants to go. Jenny Lin began, if I didn't mention that previously. In Shipbuilders, we started our summer Metamorphosis project, and are having a little graduation party at 6:30 on the 27th. Kumon is still going on, and Mrs. Choi wants me to participate in a math competition (yuck.). That's on July 13th. Piano lessons resume on June 25, and I have to get ready for my violin recital, which is also coming up. There's also convention, but I already mentioned that. I'm looking out for a Latin tutor, and maybe a dance class. Discipleship is also going on every Sunday. Ummmm... I think there are a couple missing things. I'm starting to lose track of them. If I remember any more, I'll post them later on. Right now I'm going to head over to Cissy's house, and then a big group of us is going to go to Fuddruckers and then to see 2 Fast 2 Furious. The movie was not my decision. I'd rather see Finding Nemo over again...
