Then the usual...class after class. Haha, I'm proud of myself I finished my whole photography assignment in one class! :p  Emily's been gone forever! She comes back early July I think? I hope, it's still weird not having her around, can't wait to see her.  Anything going on this weekend? YAY, the movie priemere of the Band Trip!! That should be funny...yet...embarrassing! Well not much else to say, except my msn is screwing up. Apparently I've just signed in on another computer...GREAT! Just Great! Ahhh Leadership presentation tomorrow Alana, YIKES! ANNNNNND...musical auditions for GRRRRREASE (yahoo!) tomorrow Kt, ah we'll do excellent! LoL. xox muah.
