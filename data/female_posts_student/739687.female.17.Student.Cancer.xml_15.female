I'm really picky about jeans; I have to find brands that fit PERFECT. Like LEI, Express and Lucky Jeans fit me really well. But Lucky Jeans, for the most part, are too expensive for my liking. I like all my jeans to be low-rise bootcut, because I like them to ride low on my waist and hips, and I think flares look so cheesy. Wow...cheesy? I don't think I've used that word in...ever. Even straight leg jeans aren't that bad, cuz you can roll em up and that's always fun...but why flares? I know, I used to love em in like 6th grade, and they're coming back now, but why?!? Say yes to bootcut! O wow...I'm campaigning jeans...I'm a sad story. HeHe. Well, again I need to find something constructive to do. I might go rollerblading tonight once it cools down...of course if you go too late you can't see a thing...ah well...later yall...
