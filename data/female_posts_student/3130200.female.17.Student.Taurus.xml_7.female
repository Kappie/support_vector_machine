It's not that I don't have things to write about it is just that there is so much that I want to get out it feels overwhelming. I mean, where do I start...the death of my mom, my non-relationship with my step-mom, Sarah, depression, wanting to just leave, college, my feelings, politics, unemployment, love, lack of love, goals, hopes, dreams, feeling unfulfilled and unappreciated. Which of those holds precedence over another. Where do I start? Do I really want to express myself on all of those subjects? Or will that just end up being too hard and ultimately causing more pain than it was worth? Is it better to keep things inside like I have been doing for the past 17 years, or do I start wearing them on my sleeve? I feel like I am walking on a bridge of glass...at any moment everything is goingshatter beneath my feetand I will just fall. I think I am only trying to protect myself when I don't express myself. I don't want to get hurt and telling the truth about how I feel could do that. I don't want to write anymore, maybe later.
