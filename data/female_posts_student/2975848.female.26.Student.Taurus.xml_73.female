Your body next to mine Our warmth shared I chill at every touch Time freezes around I feel you… You feel me…  Lost in this lust I get closer and closer I hear you breeding I listen to your heart beating Stronger and stronger I read your movements Knowing your willing I close my mind I just feel you I’m burning desire I taste you in a kiss So intimate So strong So “never want to end” You hold me tight Eyes in eyes We’re closer, as we can get Sharing the pain  I hear you voice I understand the tone Not the words Words are meaningless When we are one Unified by the loss Like this we remain Away from everything around Away from the world Sheltered in our dream
