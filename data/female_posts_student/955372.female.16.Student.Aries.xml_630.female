So for the past three days i have been working at the camp and it is official... i will kill them ALL. small children are so annoying.. and clingy. And the relatives left this morning. Omg yesterday me and my family went to fellini's and my uncle, upon seeing us getting some of our meals wrapped up, says, AND I QUOTE, "ya gatta eat hard" ok there are three things i would like to say about that. 1) gramatically speaking, i'm not even sure that is a sentence 2) that doesn't make any sense 3) so we're supposed to follow YOUR dietary plan, Fatty McButterball.
