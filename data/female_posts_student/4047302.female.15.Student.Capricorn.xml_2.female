I close my eyes every time your face comes into view  You don't like the way I look, you don't like my attitude  I think your pretty different from the way you used to be  You wanna make it seem like you still have feelings for me     Chorus:  But I'm gonna tell you  This is not how it should be  You coulda saved me  Don't show a bit of sympathy  Cuz I'm goin nowhere  Yeah, I'm not how I should be  You coulda saved me  Do anything you want just don't breathe     So we both know things might be better left unsaid  I don't want to ruin that, But I'd rather see you dead  Sometimes I wish that things could go back and just rewind  And I know this isn't the place, and this isn't the time     But I'm gonna tell you  This is not how it should be  You coulda saved me  Don't show a bit of sympathy  Now I'm goin nowhere  No i'm not how I should be  You coulda saved me  You can do anything you want, Just don't breathe     When people ask me how you're doin baby I just laugh  It's nice to know they wanna break me and bring my memory back  If you could just take the time to grow up we could be  But untill that happens baby, I'd like to ask you to get away from me  Cuz you coulda saved me  This is not how it should be  Yeah, I'm gonna tell you  Don't show a bit of sympathy  Now I'm goin nowhere  Oh I'm not how I should be  You coulda saved me  Do me a huge favor.. Don't breathe
