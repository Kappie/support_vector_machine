Lately, things have been like that. I've been questioning alot, most of all questioning the soul reason I exist along with who I am and what I stand for. I'm not sure who I am particually who I think I portray. Everything I see a movie, or act I become a related character...in some situations good, most of the time bad. (It was not attractive to see me in tights trying to portray Robin Hood)  But the main question to me is who is Katie Sleeman? I'm looking for a resume to submit of me. Who I was yesterday laying in bed trying to sleep is not the same person who sits here. I think I am the perfect example of change considering I am a constant mutation. A constant mass changing never disapearing considering mass can't be destroyed but I float from decision to decision changing experiencing learning trying and being confused.  My friends are a god sent and their constant support always seems to make me happy. I always seem to get in this mood when someone writes messages in YPM or YP documents. Thank Ya'all who signed.  Can I still like or lust? I'm not what my emotions are like anymore. I guess that I can only just exist and try.  Lonelyness is not a factor anymore cause God can't possibilty find it so funny to leave me without a better half. My mind is like a strainer...it's quickly draining.  Well...if you would like to...you know. Wait no you don't know.  It seems that every couple of months I re-evulate everything I stand for but...this "month" the flavor is as follows: -folk music -the giem (the gym) -afternoon naps -learning how to debate -smiling (rare) -swimming nude -my friends -being what I think I am -being loved
