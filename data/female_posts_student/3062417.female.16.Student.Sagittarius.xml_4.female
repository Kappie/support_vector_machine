I had to swim for gym today. Water polo was fun. I scored a point! I had a double lunch today cause Ischia wasn't there. I threw a cookie down Kim's shirt on accident. 6th per study hall was fun as always. We had a pen war. Kim was the loser. lol The rest of the day was boring. Atleast I don't have jazz band tonight. It's kinda a bad thing though cause now I won't have anything to do and I'll just set myself up to get hurt again like I always do. Why do I do that to myself? I'm so stupid. I was happy earlier today but then I got bored and I kept thinking all the "what ifs" and it upsets me and makes me feel like shit.  I hate thinking. Everything would be better if I could just clear my head and escape from this messed up world. Sometimes I hate myself so bad for acting like this. I'm a loser and I know it. I have no life. I sit at the computer and wait to talk to the only person I actually want to talk to ever and the more I sit here the more upset and weird I get. What is my problem? I think I need to see a therapist or something because I just get more and more messed up every day. Sitting here I feel so empty inside. And please don't tell me I'm messed up or phsyco of that I have problems because that doesn't make anything better for me. Pretending to be happy every day is hard enough. I'm getting good at it though. Sometimes I almost fool myself into thinking that I'm happy.   Happy 18th Birthday to Gavin!  Song- Twenty Three- Yellowcard
