Its super sad. Its not like I am rich or anything but whenevr I go there I feel really weird...like all these people are looking my up-and-down then they like glare..  *sigh*  While we were there these kids were causing like chaos in there store. It was so funny. They had to send in security. Hahahha.  I got these really cool cough drops...they Halls Fruit Breezers..i think. They taste like candy! Yumm  Well. Ya'll may think I am super weird...btu I am so what can I say. I have reaally wanted to start a bible studying thing on my blog. I have been thinking about it a lot.   Its going to be called "Ultimate Purity"  Its gonna be fu...so stay tuned for more details!  Well..I am out like a light!   Loveeee  Laura.   P.S. Operation MNH is a GO! :D
