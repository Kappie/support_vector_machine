That's how bad it was. And now I have to practice for solo fest and go to some stupid mother-daughter dinner tonight and worry about my AP History test tomorrow.  All I know is that I'm worse off as every day goes by. As I look back at happier times I realize that I don't even know who I am anymore. I'm living in this body but I am not a part of it. Who am I? I don't know.   Listen to The Early November. They are an amazing band.   Song:  Tonight is a story of love Two broken hearts set by one   And all he wants is a sign Of how she's making her mind   All we ever wanted was  Love and love and happy afternoons    Watching TV from your room While you're laying in my arms    And I know it's not fair to me To see this love walk right by me every day    Will we ever meet the right way    Again, again   Tonight I will sit next to you To see if you act like we're through To make you laugh is all I want I'll hold you while tears fill our eyes   Again, again -All We Ever Needed- The Early November
