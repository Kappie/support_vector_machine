Tomorrow is monday..I am supposed to go running and start putting my nose to the grindstone (grindstone?or is it grind your nose to the stone? or to the limestone...???) well, whatever. Anyhoo...(been saying that word a lot lately) Tomorrow I think I might call Mary. Don't know. I still can't believe that it's summer. It's not hot enough yet. Guess I just haven't gotten into my routine..well tomorrow's my chance.   Tomorrow is my birthday. In about 8 mins I will be 14. Well, not technically until like, 4 in the afternoon, but poo on technicallity. Omg, I just said the word poo...I really am losing it. Whatever...(been saying that word a lot too..hmm..). I am gonna wait and see if anybody remembers my birthday tomorrow..I doubt it. Nobody really cares. Erika might remember, but I don't care if she does. To be honest, I kind of want people to forget so I can blame them. That's so mean, but I guess it's just me. I don't know, I am trying to figure out who I  really  am, but what if I don't like that person? I most likely will, seeing how I surround myself with people like me..I don't know.   Corey's still on my mind..deciding whether or not it would be a good thing to see him much this summer. I don't know...I mean, I don't want to get any closer to him. I am already freaking out with the way things are. I mean, it's like I just break down around him and I don't hold anything in! Isn't there something completely messed up with that? I don't know, I just don't like people to know me...I feel limited and they form their own assumptions and I am no longer free to be just me, which is dually hard when I don't know who 'me' is. Anyhoo..I don't know. It's like he has this wierd control over me. I can't put my finger on it right now..maybe later. But I mean, I dont' really get mad at him, and if I do (which has happened like, twice) It's just because I want to be, and because I am really stupid. Grrr to you COrey Shotwell! I guess I will just have to deal with it. (Feel more sorry for him- he's got the end wehre he has to listen to me complain and whine :-P).   Well, it's 11:59 on the computer clock. Waiting...   12! Well, I am unofficially 14 years old. Omg..that's really wierd..anyway. Got to get to bed and stuff. Write later..most likely tomorrow.   -lyss-
