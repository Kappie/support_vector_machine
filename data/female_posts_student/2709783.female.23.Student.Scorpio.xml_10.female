Kind of like a Keifer Sutherland TV series, only with promissory notes and credit reports instead of dirty bombs and hostage situations.  I have a confession to make.  I have the maturity level of a prepubescent boy, which many of you know already.  This was confirmed by my inability to not snicker when certain professors discussed religious “sects” and especially when anyone referred to the “oral section” of a test, despite my being a college graduate and presumable adult.  I also cannot make it through a discussion about the erection of a building.   This sense of humor makes it difficult for me to complete my “Time and Attendance” paperwork at the USDA, due every pay period, since everyone refers to this form as “your T and A.”  The most humorless of employees will ask, “Have you got your T?” with no hint of irony, and I can just barely contain myself.  I mean, has no one in the higher levels of bureaucracy noticed this?  There are plenty of non-funny alternatives.  Attendance and Time comes to mind, and I’m sure there are plenty of other semantic shifts that would prevent possible misinterpretations.    Of course, I could just grow up.
