It Freaks Me Out  You hate the way I'm always watching videos Eleven-thirty and you just can't sleep You think whatever I've got playin on my stereo Is so pathetic that it makes you weep  And the beat goes on when I get back home And I run stright past you to the telephone And my feet don't fit in your sensible shoes But you just won't quit until you've killed my groove  Wooo it freaks me out I've got to scream I've got to shout Wooo it freaks me out like Halloween I've got no doubt  I think your weird, it's writen on your resume You and I'm stupid and your best freind too And if I smile you think I'm doin it to get my way And if I don't I've got an attitude  And the beat goes on when I get back home And I run stright past you to the telephone And my feet don't fit in your sensible shoes But you just won't quit until you've killed my groove  Woo it freaks me out I've got to scream I've got to shout Woo it freaks me out like Halloween I've got no doubt
