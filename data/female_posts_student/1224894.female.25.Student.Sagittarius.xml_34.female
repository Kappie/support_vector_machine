Ma and her choir are going to sing in Triangulo Cemetery for the 4 pm mass, I’d be there of course, together with my pamangkins, and most probably meet up with my cousins once more. I just hope everything will turn out OK.  It might rain, but, honestly, I prefer the rain, than the heat…  Oh. JCR texted...i wished we could have met too...but don't worry, we still have next time to look forward to...i just hope it will be soon.
