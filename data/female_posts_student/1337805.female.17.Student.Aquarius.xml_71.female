It was great. I wish I took photos, I had my camera and everything... Magic. Pure.  Shit monkeys and cheese, Luke and Ian are hot. Hooooooly monkey farts.   I'm thinking of doing a site for our youth group. I'll have to talk to Mike about it. See if that'll work. And if we can snag someone with a better camera than mine to take photos with.
