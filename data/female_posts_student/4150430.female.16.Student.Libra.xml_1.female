We couldnt handle him anymore and even though he was a good dog, he just needed a better home. So despite the fact i couldnt sleep tuesday night, i woke up real early on weds. I kept lookin out the back door window watching Gizmo lay there sleeping...oh man it was rough...  My dad came at 2:30 and i told him i wanted to go with him so i could say good-bye. Nick took it the hardest tho...he cried and cried and i felt so bad... Gizmo and i rode in the back seat for, what seemed like eternity, was only about 20 minutes. He sat there next to me as we watched the city slowly turn to country side. He kept sticking his nose out the window...ohh it was cute. I wondered what he was thinking. I held back all my tears as we drove to the spca...the whole ride there i kept petting him and the big hog kept sitting on me and scooshing me against the seat while i kept gettin fur in my mouth, lol. But soon we pulled in the parking lot and he knew something wasn't right...he started panting real hard and looking all around. My dad told me to stay in the car while he went to fill out the papers...  So it was just me and Gizmo...for 2 minutes...i had to say good bye to the fuzzy little puppy who was placed in my arms as my birthday gift...just 10 months ago...The puppy i had to take outside to the bathroom at 2am...the puppy that chewed up ur shoes, the puppy that ate ur socks....the puppy that loved attention and every time u pet him, he sat down, leaned up against you and placed him paw on your foot....like he was hugging you. I had to let go of the dog that made you so mad at times...but then u just look at his face and ur heart melts.  But how do you say good-bye?? How do you tell a dog that everythings gonna be okay and that we don't hate it and that this will be the last time we ever see each other...  I was at a lost for words...i kissed him good bye and my dad came and took him to the door...  I sat there for a few seconds...the backseat, and my clothes, covered in fur...(he was sheading like crazy). All i could think about was how the last time we were in the back seat together was when he had to get fixed...that was his first night away from home... I remember walking into the vet's office and i could hear him wimpering in the back...he missed us and he was scared. He was sooo happy to see us and i felt so bad to have left him...  Now we were doing it to him again...leaving him...only this time...we aren't coming back....
