There were some moments of cheese in this one, but not so much that I wanted to hurl all over myself, thankfully. And Tobey Maguire and James Franco are both incredibly attractive, so that is definitely a bonus.  Towards the beginning, there was a lady who was at the scene of a crime. I can't remember exactly what was going on, but cars were getting thrown around, as usual. When one stopped right above her head and the heads of several other moronic people who decided to just stand there and watch from a street corner, the very intelligent woman said "Oh! It's a web!" Wow, really? Thanks for telling me, I wasn't really sure. Is  that  what that white rope stuff is? That stuff holding a police car up in the air and keeping it from falling on you and crushing you to death? Amazing, I would never have guessed, especially since you live in a city where the local superhero is called "Spider-Man." Wow! I feel enlightened!  Still. It was a great movie.
