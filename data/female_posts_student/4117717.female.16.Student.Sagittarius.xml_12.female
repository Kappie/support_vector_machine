We first went to the Providence Place Mall and for my Colorado friends...(who would be..reading this....) It's this giganitc huge mall. Bigger then South Glen. That's why it's in Provdience I suppose. It has like...what? 3 levels? Something like that. And they have this huge confusing indoor parking. Which you have to pay for which I always find funny. I don't know why though. Anyways we went there first where I got DAIRY QUEEN!!! Cause yes, this is the only place in Rhode Island that I know of that has Dairy Queen...And Orange Julius. You should have seen how happy I was after the Dairy Queen. At first I couldn't eat the blizzard I just stared at it in awe. ...Hah yes cause I am a loser like that.  So we walked around a bit then walked over to the place where the concert was right across the street. There, this girl who rides my bus like..jumped on me. I saw her in the mall and said hi but she didn't see me, but I guess she saw me then! Her and Dean where there. Now Dean hasn't really ever talked to me unless Alison is there, which obviously she never now cause she moved, which is sad cause Dean is a nice kid. Well...that I know of. So I talked to them a bit, and Deidre (bus girl) I think scared Sean and Scott. She's very outgoing. I like her cause once she gave me a cigeratte when I really needed one. DONT WORRY THAT WAS MY LAST CIGERATTE. Considering I've only had like what? 9 in all? so yes nothing to worry about there.  After they left we hung around a bit more, the first band was horrible so we eventually just went back to the mall and looked around some more. It's a nice mall. They didn't though have the Freaks and Geeks DVD set that I wanted that Sean saw once in a store there. Tis sad. And we discussed about how Hot Topic is way to scary to go into and I shared my brave story about going in there with everyone when I was in Colorado. Oh, we also walked by this one store...umm...you know with all the funky stuff? Like weird chairs? and really pointless gadgets? Yeah so there is a pillow like near the window and Scott goes "Kate feel this pillow."...So I do...so does Sean. Scott says "Doesnt that feel like a boob?"...and I say "Well mine don't feel like that.".... DAMNIT why the hell did I say that???? The second it came out of my mouth, I was like "GOD."...That's just not a thing to share. They both kind of looked at me weird and we none the less moved on pretty quickly. But I must say that pillow definitly did not feel like a boob. Cause if all girls had ones like that then they'd be insanley bouncy and annoying. And that's all I am going to discuss on breasts at the moment...Ok for awhile, cause this is just not a topic I really feel the need to discuss. ANYWAYS, oh yes and Sean also saw Desiree and her friends in the mall. I kind of feel bad now cause I didn't really say anything to them, but I didn't really know what to say. Like I would have said hi, but I wasn't positive they knew who I was. I was pretty sure they might have, but I didn't want to take chances. So I smiled. What can I say, I was kind of nervous. Umm...then we went back out to the concert, listened to the second band...whose name I can now not remember. They were ok. We missed the one song we knew by them. Then hung around some more...I saw Deidre again...she smacked me on my ass. And it hurt!!!! Like afterwards it stung. ...And I dont know why she did that. And I dont really want to know....Um...anywaysss.... Finally the Lost Prophets came on. They had some sound difficulties at first but they managed to sing some good songs. All of Sean's favorites so that was good. They were the best obviously out of all them. We saw Desiree and her friends again, and they hung out for a little bit, and once again me being petrifiably nervous did not say a word and smiled..... :) Hah..Um, oh yeah there were a bunch of people from school there. That was weird. So Lost Prophets were good...very good indeed...we went back in the mall after they finished...Sean and Scott got clothes. I got an Orange Julius. Then it took us about an hour to get out of the parking lot.......... And now I am home.  And Katie is going to Canada. :( OOO! And Colorado starts school tomorrow...hehe...umm...Good luck with that! Remember to tell me all the details on the first day....
