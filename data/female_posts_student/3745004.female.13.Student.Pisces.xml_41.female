I like to log things, so that at later dates I can look back on these records and say 'Hey! I did that!'.. yadda yadda, you know. Oh well.. it makes me happy, I suppose.  Well, yesterday was the Comicon. It was my first time going and, needless to say, I  loved  it. I would've stayed longer than I did but.. I think the friend I went with was getting bored.. she's not as into anime as I am, although considers herself an anime artist.. enh, very confusing. Anyway, so we (we, being my dad, Katrina, and I) got there when the doors opened, but had to go get tickets. Noo problemo. So, we've got our tickets, dad leaves us with a cell phone to go wander around. Finally we find our way downstairs, to the exhibit hall. Wow, what can I say about the exhibit hall.. it's HUGE! And  VERY  busy. So, Katrina and I start to wander the booths.  First purchase: A deck of Cowboy Bebop playing cards Cost: $5  Although the cards are starting to scare me with a few of their pictures. (If you're over at my house, ask me to show you what I mean..) So tomorrow since I'm going again I'm planning to get the Princess Mononoke set, just to be safe. XD So, more wandering. Swag, free stuff, = happy Bekka. I get a free painting in traditional- Chinese, I think it was -art style, with bold brush strokes. FREE! I love it.  Second purchase: The collected Tall Tails volumes 1-3, just because the furries are cute, and Egoraven because according to Daphne Lage there's only 25 copies out Cost: $15  This was pretty much a feel-good purchase. I liked the art, I had money, I bought it. Nothing really special to it. So, we wander on a bit more, and come across a LotR booth selling authentic-looking elven knives. Katrina just HAS to get one, 'cos she's such a LotR nut. I HAVE to spot her 11 bucks, 'cos she's low on cash. e_e;; But I don't really mind, so long as I get paid back. I mean, the knife is really awesome. XD Wander down to the other end of the convention hall, by now my bag is STUFFED with swag. Which made for a very happy Bekka ^_^ Apparently we missed the Megatokyo store the first time, so we figure out its number and go to visit it.  Third purchase: Megatokyo 'ph34r t3h cute ones' poster, autographed by Fred, Sarah, and Dom. Cost: $14  This is probably the thing I loved most. I mean, AUTOGRAPHED! Besides, I've been wanting the poster. What better time to get it? I was seriously considering getting Boy a shirt, because I'm a nice l'il sister, but- c'mon. Nineteen BUCKS?! I'm not THAT nice! So I didn't get him anything. ^_____^  Got lunch, ate lunch, went upstairs to watch anime until around 3, when Katrina wanted to leave. I had a complete and total AWESOME time. Seriously guys, it was so fun. There was even someone cosplaying Tsukasa (with paper mache staff and everything!), and two old ladies as Vash and Inuyasha! (I might add, Inuyasha had toilet paper stuck to his/her sandal.. >_>) It was so fun, I can't wait until tomorrow. I get to go again!  G'night, internet!
