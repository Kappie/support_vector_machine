For the night is safe And withholds the light Of painful memories Of Malice and Spite But all too soon The night starts to fade Caused by the coming Of the new day And all of my angers Fears and despairs Are exposed again By the sun's cruel rays So Little Candle Burning so bright Should I destroy you? Would that be right? With one little puff You would be away My dark side hidden Until the next day But your light that flickers Gives me solace tonight Withholds all the pains That give me reason to fight So while I battle Against memories and fears I'll allow you to burn To dry up my tears.
