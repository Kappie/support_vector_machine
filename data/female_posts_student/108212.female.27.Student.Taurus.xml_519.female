I like the idea of being able to respond to the guestbook post. In regards to the webcam, I think I'll think about it a little more. I sometimes use my webcam to chat with Jeff through yahoo messenger and I do that while I blog. I am not sure if I can do that anymore if I had the webcam in my blog. Anyhoo, did i just confused you? Well good luck with your job hunting. Thanks a lot for all your help! :)
