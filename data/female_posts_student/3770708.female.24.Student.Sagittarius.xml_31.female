My mother was surprised to find herself with mini-celebrity status, receiving grins and waves from all the peace-loving neighbors as she would walk by. We were somewhat dismayed to see that one of our good neighbors had had enough and put her house up for sale. That makes two houses for sale within two doors from us, and who knows what wildcards may move in next.  Today we had a family outing to the pool, where Gavin dunked and jumped and splashed merrily with his Grannie, and Mike and I wrestled and floated and smooched until we made the surrounding children barf. Afterward, we drove down to Kailua to see Mike's theater and go to dinner at Maui Taco. Stuffed full of delicious cilantro-laden food, we waddled over to the health food store to buy tea and cookies. Gavin narfed half a dozen organic chocolate-dipped animal cookies in the time it took us to drive home again. It was a really sublime afternoon. Gavin and Mike are now amusing themselves by popping the packing bubbles that encased my mother's delivery of the Lord of the Rings trilogy on audio cassette. Life is good.
