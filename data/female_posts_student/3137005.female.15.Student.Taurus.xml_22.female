They don't make films like that anymore...it's very uplifting..)  ('Down with love let's liquidate all its friends  Moon and June and roses and rainbow's ends  Down with songs that moan about night and day  Down with love yes take it away, away') Full lyrics ------->  urlLink Here   and now to my piece of literary wonder....*fanfare proceeded by shriek of 'get on with it'.  Five places to visit before you either die or get into a 'I wanna die mood', and are thus unable to visit the places on the list due to your inability  to order tickets as you are seemingly incapable of uttering any word but 'meh' (P.s. Get a life)  The following is a list of places that I have been that I deem good enough to merit a trip for everyone at least once.  5.In fifth place we have...Dunham Massey. This is a national trust property in the Manchester countryside. It's so groovy. It has a deer park that you can visit, and see all the purdy deer. It's a historic building obviously, and is therefore packed full of history, just ask the staff if you want to know some really interesting old stories about the house, as most of them are like experts. It has pretty gardens with bits that seem to attract butterflies and bees, plus it's really colourful and purdy too. There is an ice cream stand that serves delicious national trust ice cream...try it it is gorg! There is also this grass thing (like in Stratford) where people just sit to read and have picnics and stuff. All in all, a really great place. 4. In fourth place we have... Lindisfarn (sp?) or The Holy Island, The north somewhere, England. This was possibly the best trip I have been on in my entire life so far, but this is also due to the people who went with me. I went on a pilgrimage here with my church about 4 or 5 years ago. We all waded barefoot across the sea bed to reach the island (it was low tide). Me and my mum walked with the vicar (the most friendly man I have ever met), and he helped me when I accidentally stepped in quick sand. We then went to communion in the ruins of one of the old monasteries (my third ever communion). Then we all just looked round the shops. There are no new buildings and all the shops are all old and stuff, I may go and live here when I'm all old and wrinkly, as it is the most friendly and peaceful place I have ever visited and I hope it stays that way.  3.In third place we have...Skiathos town, Skiathos, Greece. This is such a busy little place. Everywhere you look something is going on. It's pretty boring during the day but when night falls (at around 7-8pm) The town comes alive. There are shops everywhere. The buildings are all very traditional and the streets are all narrow, even the main one. There is one road around the town and you just have to walk all the way through it. It completely rocks! It's like a little maze and very now and again you find a little courtyard with a garden restaurant or a open air shop in it. There is also a roofless cinema, that is projectile onto a wall, and the roof looks like it just fell off rather than being built that way.  2. In second place we have...Statford upon avon. This just soo cute all the houses are all tudor and stuff...and the shops. Shakespeare was born here. And there is like a theatre. Fit guys from all the Uni's (inc. Oxford) just wander round willy-nilly for no apparent reason. There is a little river with willows by the side of it(which has members of the fit Oxford rowing team in it from time to time practicing). People just sit in the park and read, so when I'm waiting for everyone to finish up in marks and sparks, I don't look weird sat on the grass on my own reading a book, someone once even struck up a conversation about the book I was reading with me once (when I first got into Austen). It's just generally a great place, with really cool people, and nice people our age, who always have the really good idea of going to pizza hut and clubbing together to buy stuff. Another thing, there very few/no townies, It's like a freak of nature town. Barely any moshers either...hundreds of skaters though ;)  1. The number one place in the whole of England to visit is........... where else? International Departures lounge Terminal One Manchester airport. I love this place, all the facilities are within a few feat of each other. I have lots of money when I go so I can have a shopping spree in whsmiths for last minute holiday reading. You can watch all the planes taking off e.t.c. You can sit for hours and hours (like when I get delayed which is often) and just watch everyone. It doesn't matter what you look like at all coz no one cares as most everyone has been stuck there for hours too. You just start talking to everyone and anyone, as there's so many people in like a mini world that by the end of a four hour delay you feel like you know everybody you're about to get on the plane with, as sometimes you can just go and stake out the gate until it finally opens. Overall it is just the best place on the face of this earth that I know of.  I'm on my grandad's computer now, stupid computer. It lost all the tech work nearly, coz that's what I was working on when it all went kablooey. I hate my computer....grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, bad men with virus (in classic Narri style) I damn thee thrice to hell!!!!!!!  Yours for now, Dani
