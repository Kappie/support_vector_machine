Of course I will be subjected to relentless criticsm about my weight, but I know it is all in concern of my health.  I just have to keep reminding myself that, sometimes it is just too much.  Anyway, it will be so nice to be able to see him and be able to spend some time with him and to watch him with the kids.  I love when he is home, our family is complete....but there is the feeling of awkwardness too.  So anyway, if I don't blog as often it is because I am enjoying whatever time I have with my dad and hoping that this visit doesn't just fly by like most everything does.  You guys have a good weekend...I know ours will be super...  OH AND YES I AM A VERY DEVOTED LAKERS FAN!    GO LAKERS!     Let's kick some Piston butt!
