I'm a little lost, a tad void of any clue (hark...a double entendre) so I'll just wing it and see where it takes me.  I hope all are doing fine, as I attempt to integrate myself with the city that I have missed (and the summer I have missed) for the past few days, and ah school rears its head.  Umm....I read a comic book today, it has a few entertainingly worded lines in it (and they say that those things rot your brains) so i suppose I'll share 'em and see where the wind takes it from there.  "...To have my life mean something.  And I think, for the most part, I sucdeeded. I flew high.  I flew well.  It's just that, when I finally failed...I had such a long way to fall.  I go over it and over it and over it.  What was it inside me that shattered?"  and  "...There are some who claim that life on earth is nothing but pain and suffering.  That  people  struggle through brief pitiful lifetimes and die...frightened and alone.  No purpose.  No meaning.  Look at the world one way...and the viewpoint's understandable.  There is terrible suffering.  There is pain and madness that seems inexplicable--if not simply evil.  But there are others who believe our suffering is a doorway to something better.  That our pain helps wear away the masks and lies we've come to identify with...and reveal the radiant authentic selvesthat hide beneath our personalities and egos. ...And I think there's truth in that"  so there ya go...If you took the time to read that, well then, I hope you enjoyed it and I hope you got something out of it as well.  I suppose I'm done for now, talk to you all later, I'm off to go rally the masses (as a General may do...non?)
