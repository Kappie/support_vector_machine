"Like a giant swap meet in cyberspace, itâ€™s a very simple and effective way to network with others in your community for the purpose of giving and getting stuff, eliminating waste, reducing consumption, and conserving landfill space." Isn't that neat? You don't have to be an environmentalist to join; you just have to be interested in getting something for free.     I've just joined, in hopes of getting rid of this huge beige recliner that my mom dug out of someone's trash just before I came to grad school. (You can tell that the whole "free stuff" thing runs in the family.)
