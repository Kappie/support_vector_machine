Let me explain. Shimron will go on, be happy to live his life, settling for what's given to him, be happy with the house, the kids, the minivan, and he will continue to edit his life for television. Dont show any real anger or agression, dont work out the problems you have in your life- just be happy to live your humdrum life. There was once a time when you were passionate about the feelings you had for ppl and the way you felt about things. I'm not alone in thinking this way- ask Hortencia, she asked me what the fuck happened to the Shimron we knew. Beats me. I know we used to be a lot alike, and as we grew up we grew apart, but I never realized how much. My thoughts are better shown on paper. Just the fact that I have yet to meet the woman he loves so much, and we are really good friends he and I, kind of lets me know how much things have changed. All my other exes and I have pretty good friendships, and I've hung out with them and their wives, but I feel like I get cut off if I even ask about his (now) wife. *shrugs* I dont know if he thinks I want to start something or if I"m a part of his life he'd like to keep to himself, but it kind of hurts my feelings that I cant meet her. But that's him. My life just happens to not be so humdrum. I know that he's not boring because we like different things, but I refuse to settle just because it's the right thing to do. Some ppl are happy to do that, but I want what I want and that's it. I couldnt live the humdrum life with a husband, 2.3 kids, and a dog... it just doesnt go. Maybe you can, but that isnt something I look forward to. That's boring to me. Maybe it is that we just like different things, but hey, this is MY life story. :D
