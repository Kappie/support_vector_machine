Figured it's as good an opportunity as any to start filling in some gaps and clarifying some statements/allusions/what have you.    It's been a bit odd being back this time, the journey and luggage issues aside.  And I'm not even going to pretend to wonder why.  I know it's because I'm not talking to Lorraine.  Realized while on the phone with Levi that this is the first time in 6-ish years we haven't spoken on a daily basis.  Suppose it was bound to hit sooner or later.  Everything here reminds me of what it was like when we both lived in the same town.  Knowing she's an hour away is another thought to be pushed away, along with how easy it would be to just say "Happy Thanksgiving" or "Made it home safe."  So let's back up a bit, shall we?  Lorraine is...well, she's Lorraine.  Simply put, she was my first, and as yet only, love.  She's my best friend, my pal, my goofing-off buddy.  We go fishing and laugh big laughs.  She's the closest thing to a soulmate I've ever met.  So why aren't we together in as-wedded-as-we-can-get bliss?  Well, circumstances, mostly.  Such a lousy excuse, I realize.  But we both made choices and must now abide by them.  Basically, neither of us were willing to cut off our relationships with our families to ride off into the sunset together.  She was also my first relationship, and there was always a part of me that wanted to explore more....normal dating situations, not wanting my life to be consumed by a shroud of secrecy and/or isolation.  So, while we were together, it was kept secret to protect her from public shaming and me from public institutionalizing.  And we pulled it off for a long time, while living in the same town and, later, when the entire state separated us.    Soon enough, however, it was time to reexamine the situation.  My brother would soon be joining me at school and as much as I wanted to start traveling to a mid-way point for secret monthly trysts, I didn't.  So, something had to end.  We told ourselves it wouldn't really be an end...more of a change, really.  And as of August 11, 2002, the change began...only not.  We still spoke everyday, in the way lovers do, and things carried on as they always had, only without the visits.    Then, in the Spring of 2003, she met someone:  Jan.    Before you jump to conclusions, it should be stressed that I was (and am) very very happy for her.  For years, she convinced herself that should our relationship ever end, I would find love quickly and just as quickly forget all about her.  But as it turned out, she found someone who made her happy.  A Mormon housewife with 3 kids and one grandchild, but still.  I expected things between us to change further, but Lorraine was adamant about not letting her new love drive a wedge between she and I.  I was still her best friend, and woe be unto anyone who asked her to part with that.  So, after more than a few conversations and one group meeting, we all were on the same page...kinda.  You see, Lorraine and I never really got around to figuring out how our relationship really ended.  We just kinda went along, doing what we always did, knowing it was "different" but not really changing anything in our ordinary course of dealing with each other to reflect that difference.  So it was bound to happen, when she visited (alone) in July 2003, that we'd blur the lines more than a bit.  And sure enough, I was left feeling incredibly guilty and not knowing what our "re-connection" meant for our friendship.  But, we worked through it and again, nothing changed in our daily discourse.  Well, nothing except for the fact that she couldn't seem to talk to me with Jan under the same roof.    As more time passed, and dealing with the reality staring me in the face kept going undone, I grew more and more frustrated with the feeling that I was nothing more than an obligation...something she checked off her list at the end of each night.  All for the sake of maintaining the last contact our friendship still afforded us.  All the while, I never resented the new girl or their life together..honestly.  I merely resented the fact that I was now a supporting character.    As a last-ditch effort to gain some clarity/perspective on the issue, I consulted a couple of wise lesbian sages for their advice.  My own approach to giving advice came back to haunt me as they told me exactly what the problem was without pausing and without reservation.  I wasn't getting over her.  I wasn't moving on.  And I wasn't being reasonable in my expectations that everything could continue smoothly from one relationship's manifestation to another.  There was only one solution: get over her, move on from our relationship, and do it alone.  Only when I no longer needed/depended on connecting with her on a regular (not even daily) basis should I attempt to maintain a friendship with her.    So that's where we are now.  It's been about a week and a half since The Conversation and as you can tell how it's gone from the previous entries in this blog.  Some days are easier than others.    She emailed me yesterday.  It was a forward of a cheezy Thanksgiving joke-picture, but an email nonetheless.  Had it reached me during a time of strength and resolve, I probably would've smiled and moved on to other things.  But it didn't arrive during a time of strength and resolve, and as you can tell, I haven't entirely moved on to other things.  The feeling of guilt for not responding has passed, but I'm just thinking about her more than ever now.    Big Sigh.  So yea, not a new story for some of you, and perhaps an enlightening one for others.
