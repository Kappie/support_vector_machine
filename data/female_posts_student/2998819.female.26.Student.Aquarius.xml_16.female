When i stepped outside the heat grabbed onto me and i wasn't prepared to run in the high temps of 106.  I didn't bring any water or anything to dehydrate myself, so I walked back into the casino, up to my room, and layed on my bed thinking about my next run.  Today, I made up for the run I missed yesterday.  The temperature was much more comfortable to run in.  I did my first 4.4 miler since my injury back in November. I started off pretty slow and picked it up a notch on the last mile.  It was a good work out.  I finished in 44:30 (10:07 pace).  Thinking about running is no where close to actually running!
