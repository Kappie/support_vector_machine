Anyway, i guess thaty's why I'm at home, cos I don't know what I'm doing today! Nah, I did take the day off not because I am ill, but I couldn't face over 2 hours with a certain tecaher, but I can't even remember her name now! Silly me. But anhway, thursday afternoon i will be happy and smiley JO (or as happy and smiley as I get, ha ha), and I will be until parents evening, when meine mutti is gonna turn the tables on that teacher whose name I can't remember, and i don't remember what she said to me yesterday either. It's all done and dusted.  So, basically I went back to bed having got up for breakfast, and slept in until about  10am, got up and wandered around for a bit. Had lunch at 12,  toastie cheese!!!  Um, then did a bit more of nothing, then watched neighbours, then put some very loud Eric Clapton on in my lounge, until my mum came home. She actually suprised me today, cos she thought I was actually ill, wheraas my dad got suss straight away (usually he doesn't pay any attention to my 'illnesses', but today he came to 'chat' cos he knew I wasn't ill). However, he wasn't cross or nething, I just said that I was entitled to take days off now and then, and he said as long as I am not gonna start doing it all the time, like a certain other member of my family. Ahem. So yeah., I oh crap. no. I was about to say I have just come back form my music lesson and am cooking my tea, when I suddenly remeber that I put my potato in the oven, and never took it out again. So I now have a very solid baked potato. Never mind. Charcoal, all the same. Um, and I am off to panto and 7.30, to help shift scenery around! I shall be doing that all thsi week, so I won't be on messengert after 7.30 every evening, nor will I be blogging or answering my e-mails. Just to warn you, in case you think I have all dissappeared.   not that ne one would notice, of course.    So, see you tomoorrow guys. I think it will be safe to put in an appearance tomoorow. As long as I am not going to be head hunted.
