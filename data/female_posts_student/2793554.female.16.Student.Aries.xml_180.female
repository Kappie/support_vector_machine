It really made me think. there were people yelling out in the theatre and at the end everyone clapped and stood up. I guess that would be boulder.   anyway, people should go see it, but with an open mind.   i'm eating cake, cause theres no good food in my house. i dont like cake. i want some pie. pie is so much better.  um. i dont know what to say... i feel really lonely today, i guess. uh. i made cookies?  ever since i got back from london my life has been increasingly boring.   i miss dylan. im pathetic, i can't not talk to him for one single day.  sham 69 kicks ass.   ~abby
