But of course I tried that once already, and twenty minutes later I just turned it back on.  Sigh.    I suppose if nothing else, I should be glad that even if things are crazy busy, they're still going pretty smoothly.  No major hurdles thus far.  Maybe I'm jinxing myself by saying anything.    I learned how to add a comment section to my blog, but then at the last minute I decided not to do it.  My guess is that no one would comment and then I would just be depressed.
