All I need now is a second job so I can actually spend of the money I'm earning something other then college. OMG! I didn't tell you, I got hypnotized at senior lock in. It was pretty funny. The guy had us put our hands together and did this thing and told us to try and get our hands apart. Yeah, mind wouldn't come apart. It was a good experience. He made us relax then he was like I'm going to tell you a joke and it's going to be the funniest joke you've ever heard. He said the first word of the joke and I started laughing SO freaking hard. Man...Then he would say think of something sad...Then he would say Indian and we would all crack up again. Hahahaha...I'll have to tell you more about it later because I have to go take a shower.   Peace and Love, Melissa
