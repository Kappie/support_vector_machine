People ask me why i'm cheering for Team Finland instead of Team USA and this is my answer:  my Niko Kapanen (aka future husband) is playing for that team and the USA has no chance in this Championship.....its not like they were going to the Gold Medal round or whatever.  Oh yeah, Niko's got 2 goals and 1 assist on the sheet so far, hopefully he'll score some more!!!    Alright so i need to update for the past 4 days.....  Sunday: i studied with Sarah for the AP World History Exam.....it was superfun! not really, but we joked around alot.  She made me awesome notecards.   Monday: hmmm....i watched hockey Tuesday: STUDY PARTY AT CHUAN'S HOUSE!!!! It was fun, we got alot of studying done for the AP test.  While me and Taylor ate Oreo's and Chips and joked around, Chuan and some other people were hardcore freaking out about this test.  Around 9, all the guys went upstairs and played ping pong while me, Mary, Taylor and Stephanie tried to continue to study.  Then we got on the topic of hott seniors such as Adam Havens, TJ Drinkwater and Jordan Roach while drinking coca-cola and we started to discuss how the class of 2006 got totally gypped on hott guys.  We all agreed the the class of 2004 has the hottest guys ever.  Chuan and Sunny tried to make us get all offended by talking loudly about how the class of 2006 got gypped on hott girls.....but we told them that their statements didn't bother us because we already know we're hott.  Then we started to claim guys for our Pre-Prom-Pacts, i was going to claim Chuan as my third pact but Mary got him first last year.  So now i'm secondary pact owner, if Mary gets a date, then all rights to Chuan pass to me.  Taylor got tertiary pact.  Anyways, then we decided to teach Chuan how to dance which scared Chuan to death.  We searched madly through his house for a radio and when we found one, it was IN CHINESE!!!!  So we had to mess around with it until we figured it out.  Then we found another one and it was still IN CHINESE. But we finally got our music and we were all dancing.  The funny part is that the guys were too involved with their computer game to even care!!!  Taylor was like "You know you're a nerd when you've got 4 hott girls dancing in your room, but you'd rather play your computer game instead of watch".  It was fun fun fun.  And today was the dreaded AP World History test.  Lemme put it this way, it SUCKED.  bad.  and when i say bad, i mean really bad.  The multiple choice questions were hard and the essays.....omg, i completely BSed the last 2!  I had no idea what i was freaking talking about.  I used what little knowledge i had and then elaborated and made things up.  So yeah, i'm probably going to fail.  I know i at least got a one!! Jokes from the test: * Corbin "giving birth before the essays" * Lauren: *hugs me* it'll be ok Taylor, i'm sure you did fine.....    Me: *collapses into Lauren* Lauren, when i'm in your arms, i feel safe.....its like when i stand next to you i feel safe, hehe    Lauren: HAHAHA, its my pleasure * what the hell is this!?! * "Hold me Kendra!" * oh yeah, i got sick! * "hmm maybe if i fake a faint, they'll let me out of the test...." * Taylor Connection.......haha am i getting smarter yet? Anyways.....so it sucked but maybe if i make a good grade and they realized that i never took the class, they'll let me into college better!  yay!  alright.....Cinco de Mayo Party now!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
