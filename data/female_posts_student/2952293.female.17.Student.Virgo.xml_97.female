Okay, so even though it's 3 AM and I leave in like five hours, if I don't blog now, I'll forget everything. That's right, I'm leaving for like 3 weeks. You better miss me and call my cell to keep me company.    Tonight Anna and I drove to Cleveland to see MAXEEN. We saw two houses on trucks on our way up. Then I saw this car that was driving really badly and had Bush stickers. The girl driving was eating ice cream that looked like a "dildo" according to Anna. Anna was calling her mom and she goes, "I hate it when people lick their ice cream so it gets all tall...hey mom!" AHH I think it was like that, well it was pretty funny at the time. When we were almost there we saw all the land markers, Anna was like, "There's the restaurant, there's the club, and there's Shannon!" Shannon is the guitarist in Maxeen who only wears black. We got to Pirate's Cove and paid $10 to park. That's freaking highway robbery! Then we met this kid from a local band that was pretty hot. Then we went and waited in line. You have to enter the pizza place to get to the club, yeah, it's messed up. These girls there were horrible! One was obsessed with Hoobastank and goes, "We hang out with them and are on a first name basis!" OKAY! NOBODY SAID YOU WEREN'T!. She was such a bitch. Then Anna told me these two girls apparently ate with the Early November, but the guys didn't have any money, so the girls had to buy. Okay, you were totally used. Anyways, every five minutes I heard her talking about Ace, and I got really pissed. Finally, they let us in. That's where I met the guy who works the door. OOOH this guy! It was $3 more for being underage. I go, "You know, since you make me pay more, it makes me really want to try and get alcohol!" He didn't respond so I go, "Okay, you really don't care." and he goes, "No, I do care." But he didn't. We got some good seats. Then these two random bands played. I don't remember the first one, but the singer looked like Ashton's friend in  The Butterfly Effect  who was also in Boy Meets World. He was really screamy (bad, cause all the other bands were pop/emo) and this club was freaky. There were stairs leading up and the windows were black, but random light came through. I thought I was going to die. The second band was Rebecca Have Mercy. They were just okay. But they had this cult following. One boy, a friend of theirs, jumped onstage during a song and started screaming with them. Then he straddled the amp and writhed up against it. WHOA. Limbeck was pretty good. They are really funny when they play. Patrick said, "Hells yeah!" and "For reals!" he makes everything plural. It was funny. Maxeen was amazing. Tom is a beautiful, beautiful man. But, he had on this shiny, black vest that was not so attractive. We left to go find Patrick for the interview and see Maxeen. Good thing we did, because we also saw... TOMMY FROM THE NEWPORT! Yes, the one and only Tommy Laudermilk (don't know if that's exactly right) and he was wearing his good hat! We talked to the lead singer from Limbeck and he gave us stickers for free since we are "nice people". Tom was good looking and I love him. We told him he played our favorite song, and he asked, "'Poison June'?" We were like, "How did you know?!" and he said he just did. Then I said, "Well, I originally thought it was, 'poison a jew'". And this girl got all defensive and Anna was like it's not true and Tom was like, "Yeah, it's not true!" Jay was super sweet! They're going to Japan to tour with blink 182! I freaked out and asked to go with him! I didn't hear it, but Anna said that Jay said, "Yeah, we need a merch girl!" He also said he liked my Matches t-shirt, asked if I saw them on Warped, and then was like, "Well, how are they doing!?" So I told them that they had lots of fans and seemed to be doing pretty well. He was really interested in hearing if they were doing well. He asked if we'd seen The Format, which I hadn't, and he told me I had to watch them and that I'd like them. Anna grabbed Tommy and we talked to him! He was AWESOME! He's only 24... totally fine for Anna. Jay came back over and told us they had a 9 hour drive and were leaving. I told him good luck with the Japan tour and to tell Tom DeLonge I said hi. He goes, "Right, I'll tell him that this girl in Cleveland said hey!" and I said, "Yeah, he'll remember." Cause in my dreams, he would. Then he pointed at me and said, "Watch The Format, you'll love them!" We watched some Steel Train and I saw this kid who looked like Jeff from TEN. Then we found Patrick and went to do the interview. That went pretty well. He took us back inside through the back entrance, since the guy at the door hated me and wouldn't let me leave to get a drink. We watched a lot of The Format, but we both felt sick so we left. We said goodbye to Patrick and then encountered two homeless men on route to our car and another at the gas station. He started to pump my gas for me, so I gave him $2. He goes, "Can I have food instead?" Uh... no. Then he asked for all my change. Jesus, take what you can get. He goes, "Just hope that you are never homeless and have to pump gas and wash people's windows. It's so degrading." I was like, "Well, at least you are trying to do the best you can." But, stop asking for more! That was pretty much it. Oh yeah, I almost ran off the road, but it's cool.    Don't miss me too much when I'm gone. I know I won't miss you. Just kidding. Peace.
