Although it may be true I do not have a computer, I should be able to get to doing this more than I do. Yet another thing to add to my list of �Things I need to kick myself in the ass for.�  I have been working a lot, as usual. They just hired a new fellow to help me out on the counter by the name of Peter. I am very happy and excited to have some help, but at the same time I am distressed that they have fired two people and another one will be quitting soon. I am starting to take some control over some things, making it more of an environment to work (happily) in. The absence of the people fired and soon to be leaving will greatly affect the moral and atmosphere�for the better. Work at the moment is like a live action soap opera, everyone in everyone else�s business�it gets very tiresome very quickly. I am seriously contemplating taking night school at one of the local trade schools to become a nurse. More research is needed before a decision can be made, but if I leave United I want something to immediately go into, none of this waiting to find a job crap.  I am actually thinking about a second job as well. I need the money. I am thinking that being overdrawn at the bank every week is NOT a good thing. Something else to research�  Then there is  urlLink Brenden . Over two months now we have been together. Truth be known�the whole experience is nothing but �new� for me. I have never felt this way about anyone�it�s new. I have never had a long distance relationship such as this before�it�s new. I have never been so attracted in so many different ways by anyone before�it�s new. I have come to find I am more paranoid then previously suspected. I have spent the year since my last relationship contemplating what went wrong, what I didn�t see�and this has led me to watch what I do and say very carefully. Brenden�s history and the states his ex�s were in only adds to the paranoia. His last girlfriend did a number on him, and I am doing everything in my power to be better and make him happy. I probably (I do, there is no question) think about it too much. I think too much in general, but I have mentioned that before.  Otherwise things are good. I have a roof. I have light. I have groceries. All is well.
