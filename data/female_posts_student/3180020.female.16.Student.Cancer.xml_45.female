Thursday           I got up at 10:30 this morning and came downstairs and sat around and watched the hunting channel with daddy for a lil while...at like 11:15 I started to wash my car, then I came in, got a shower and got ready.  Jason came over for a lil while and then I left to take back the movie me and jonathan rented and then I went to see tray at city park....I proved to him IM NOT a liar and then I left.  I rode by jana's and her car was there but she wasn't.....I came home and started vaccuming and dusting...Now Im bout to pick up my room.         Wednesday         Ok, I woke up this afternoon around 12 b/c I went to bed at like 3. I got up, applied a green face mask, just cause I felt like it. I picked up some clothes in my floor and took them to the dirty clothes basket in my bathroom, then I got in the shower. I got out, dried my hair. Came downstairs, got on the computer for a while....fixed some ramen noodles....ate about 12 bites and didn't want anymore. I went to my car and got my horn and then I started memorizing Amazing Grace. After that I put on my make up and found some clothes to wear...brushed my teeth, and then I left around 2:35....I sprayed off my car before I left so I drove to wal*mart instead of turning at the high school. I was gonna make a U-turn at wal*mart but there were too many people so I just went up and got on the over pass thingy and then came back down....I passed matthew and his dad b/c they were going slow and I was trying to dry off my freakin car..anyway, I got to the high school, put my crap down.....looked over Amazing Grace, then I went outside and waiting for someone to pass me off....FINALLY ster did and I passed off everything....I went back in the band room, socialized then ms. Bates came in there and we played Jesus Loves Me and Cadillac and then we went outside....we did the last part of the opener set by set a few times and then we came home....I went to the bowling alley for a while and left at about 9 and went to the square, came home at 10:15 or so and jonathan came over and left around 12.       Tuesday    hmmm.....I dont really know what I did until band, but we had band from 4-8...I came home, changed clothes and went to BV with......tracey, ster, josh t. josh t.

About 15 minutes later I was gonna leave so I drove by the courts agian and I met tray in front of whatever that store is beside the church, so I turned around, and when I got to the square, he was no where to be found.....Patrick asked me to give him a ride home so I did and come to find out he just wanted to show me where tray was...so I took him back to the square...and then I came home at around 10:20...Jonathan followed me from the square and came over for a little while till he had to go home!        Monday      ok....we had pictures at 8:30 and that took forever....we got done at like 10:30 or so....I came straight home...took a shower, got ready, ate lunch, and then I was back at the high school at like 12:50 to get something..i cant really remember what....we had the party from 6-8...I hung out at the civic center talking to mark till about 9:15..then I rode around the square for a lil while and then I came home....
