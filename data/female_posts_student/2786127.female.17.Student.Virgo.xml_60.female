I went shopping today. yeah. shopping and i, I guess we don't mix. I feel like the uglyiest person alive right now.  ...  UGH!! I HATE THIS!!   I'm reading  The Handmaid's Tale  and came across this excerpt.    Falling in love, I said. It was, on the contrary, heavy going. It was the central thing; it was the way you understood yourself; if it never happened to you, not ever, you would be like a mutant, a creature from outer space. Everyone knew that.     Falling in love, we said; I fell for him. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely...   I wish i was in love...
