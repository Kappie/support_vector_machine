Oh, yeah,  all  humans would be gone. Like that could happen! Gimme a break! No one knows where  all  the galaxy's humans are. And because of that cell organization of the human race, you'll never,  never  be able to say that  anyone  could or would kill  all  humans.      T-Guru? Is that the official Guru of Togo? Leader of what? You're going to have to be more specific when you say stuff like that. I don't blame him. I might kill a demon just for looking at me if he caught me in the wrong mood.       "Despised demon gods"? I think I know who you're talking about. (Doesn't that sound like them to you, Jack?) Though I've never heard of any of them disguising themselves. 'Cept for Nirrti, of course, if you want to call an invisibility cloak a disguise.       Koo-ra-ma? Hmm. I've got a picture of him sitting around somewhere, I think. Doesn't he wear teal ('c, right Jack?) and have gray-ish hair? Not the connotation of gray hair connected with old people, but... a...  vivacious  gray.       Join forces? Excuse me, but for one, what against? I havesome enemiesin mind, but I probably can't tell you about them. For two, how do you know that I'd be any force to be reckoned with? After all, I basically sit around my house all day and look after my friend's son. And Garshie. Garshie's such a cute little husky!
