Oh well, if I want to get a good mark, I guess I have to, right? *Sigh*, then I should probably be studying right now, instead of doing this, right? No! Wrong!     Ok, maybe I should be studying...     I have trouble studying when people are over, unless they aren't studying for the same subject. I find it hard to get back on task when someone asks me a question. Lol... Ok, I'd better get back to work. I've been contemplating writing a post about Braleigh Nelson. I think I will.
