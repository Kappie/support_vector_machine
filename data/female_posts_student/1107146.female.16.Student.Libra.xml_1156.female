But I may come Sunday, because I really do want to see it.  I don't have any ice creams, so I guess we'll have to indulge in the Godiva.  Maybe before the coffehouse or something.  I don't know.  I have e-mailed Mr. Frag yet, but I will right now.  I'm just going to tell him that he should have listened to me, and that he's missing out on a great opportunity. Are you still kinda weireded out by the whole Travis/ T.J. thing?  Hope everything is going better with Kyndall.  If yall "break up", there's going to be practically no point in going to FRA next year...and there's all of us, and Travis at BHS... Hmm...  All right, I'm going to e-mail Travis now. Buh-Bye.
