(thats not hard)          3.we need to encourage more members...especially you MAX (b 'cos of ur 5m3r connections you can make this work)....          4. and finally... IF THIS DOESNT WORK, TEAM WIN WILL BE SHUT DOWN AND MOVED TO A PAID,REGISTERED WEBSITE...so help our team and let us live!    if you cant tell,this is a plead.. a plead to comply with team win and let it be free.dont let the team down..  p.s. you will be sent a letter of discust for every week you do not publish,so youll be reminded... :(
