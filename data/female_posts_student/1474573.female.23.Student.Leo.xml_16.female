My stapled tongue reeked of profane thoughts and Counterfeit expressions. My buried words, All jumbled up in a large, steaming Pot of Gumbo,  Put her to sleep like 800 mgs. of Valium.  If I dropped  The Hammer  in Las Vegas, Would anyone in China notice? Will the Wall crumble? Will small Eskimo chlidren say  "Farewell" to their sisters before banishment? And will I be able to hear the  Silent applause from handless railbirds?
