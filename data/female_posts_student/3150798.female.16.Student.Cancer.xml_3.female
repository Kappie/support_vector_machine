Most people are really psyched about it, but I'm totally depressed, and I wasn't sure why until I really thought about it.  First of all, my summer looks pretty boring. I will have Young Life camp, for which I have worked hard to earn money and almost wiped out what I had saved. It's going to be an awesome week, and I look forward to it. And hopefully, I'll get some extra hours at work. But other than that, my summer looks pretty bleak. So, I suppose that may put a damper on my summer joy. But there is more than that.  Last December and January, before I started school, I made a careful list of my priorities and expectations for myself. One was to be a straight A student. That dream faded in algebra class. Second, to make friends. Unfortunately, I found that just being a nice person really isn't enough, even in the world of "mature" highschoolers. And the third, and probably most important goal I set, was to be a shining witness for Christ in every situation. Three strikes, I'm out.  This was the one where I really messed up. As far as grades and friends went, I put out almost my best effort. But I feel that if I had put more of a focus on my spiritual life, God might have prospered me more in those areas as well. I screwed up.  I'm not really sure where it started. I am in a great new church where I have no right not to grow. I have a strong knowledge of scripture, and I have a God who has seen me through all kinds of tough situations. I had this awesome oppurtunity to let people see what being a Christian should be about, and I've blown it. I go to school with the same attitude and the same priorities as anyone else. I talk about people the same ways anyone else would. I spend virtually no time praying, except for a few hurried words at bedtime, and whenever I happen to need help with an algebra test. And in the few areas where I have succeeded, I have failed to give God the glory. I have not been a glowing example of God's love-I have been a typical high schooler. I almost regret that I've let anyone know I was a Christian, because it can't be good for God's reputation.  In short, this year has been an utter dissapointment. It's all been my fault. I can only hope and pray that i do some serious maturing over the summer, and I know that will only be possible if I spend some serious time with God. I pray that this school year will end another unsuccessful chapter of my life, so I will have a chance to improve for next year. And I pray, most of all, that people will be able to forget what a lousy Christian I was this year. I'm sorry, Father, that I failed you again.
