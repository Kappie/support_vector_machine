These events can be best summed up in her words, so here's an extract from her blog:   "I like the authoritarian figures in my life. Like Helen. I blessed her carpet with a bout of fizzy drink not once, but twice on Friday night at small groups. The first time it was just a shaken up bottle of coke. The second displayed my soccer genius, when I kicked the empty coke bottle into Helen's glass of solo. But she was very nice about it, said she had something funny to blog about for the night. So yes, we like her. Tom's nice too. I accidently-on-purpose pulled his chair out from underneath him at Ernie tonight, sending him sprawling. But he laughed. Yay for Helen and Tom not being tightarses!"   hehe, ur funni Rach...
