I would order the same thing every time and all the time, Homemade Sesame dumplings and grass jelly ice. Its so weird that now I talk to my desserts before I eat them. Stupidity, but yeah I do that a lot now, matter of fact I have shallow conversations with everything that I eat and even clothes and shoes too. Don't ask me why, I cant explain.
