You know, BBQ = fire, bonfire = fire, fire = fire so BBQ = bonfire! Ok, ok, so it worked in my head! (Every thing works in my head) Really it does! Pink bunny rabbits live in harmony along side cool killing machines that make 'pe-ch-ow' sounds! (Uhuh...) Ok, I really shouldn't share what's inside my head should I? BBQ time! Bubi!
