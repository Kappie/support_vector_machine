The sky is not cloudy, just that full-over whitish color that hangs low and oppressive over everything.  It's late afternoon, but has not even started to get dark yet.  Summer... the sun sets late this time of year.  Although, I'm looking at this summer in a different way from all the summers that have come before.  There's no school.  It may sound strange to you, but that's a big change from what I'm used to.     The bleeping from my family's answering machine sounds intermittently belowstairs, but it's not a message for me.  I should know, because I listened to it.  It's a message from my brother to my dad, asking for help with a computer problem- something my dad knows all about.  He's one of those computer engineers who knows just about everything about computers and technology and all that jazz.  Comparatively, if my brother even gets near a computer, it spazzes.  There must be something his makeup that just makes computers impossible for him.  It is probably not that surprising though, for he is my half-brother, so he did not get any genes from my father.       The wind's picked up a little now, rustling through the trees in the front yard, and there's the front door opening.  It will be my dad, for he called just a few minutes ago to say he'd be home.  He says he's picked up my clarinet from the shop.  Several weeks ago I dropped it, and just a week ago we were finally able to take it in to be fixed.  It was messed up pretty bad, but luckily I could still play on it.  However, I need to go check on it now because I start lessons tomorrow with a new clarinet teacher.  He wants me to prepare music/solos to play so he can evaluate my level.
