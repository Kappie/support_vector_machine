But I had my whole music list written out on a newspaper (because that was the only thing around when I was watching fuse the other day) and... *cough*  Well, anyways.  My mom is recycling it, so I'm just gonna post this up here super fast because I can't find a pen. MUSIC TO DOWNLOAD AND/OR BUY WHEN I MIRACULOUSLY COME INTO MONEY: The Corals (probably just download) The Shins (again, probably just for Kazaa) TV on the Radio (that music video kicked my ass) The Unicorns-- Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? (MUST HAVE THIS CD) Of Montreal Starlight Mints Green Day Motion City Soundtrack (remind me to email him again, please....  AND RANDY.  God, I keep forgetting.  And I need to email Squid... and Mitch... GAH!) Reel Big Fish The Strokes  *reviews list*  Yes, I think this will do to remind myself.  These blogs are very handy.  I WILL NEVER FORGET ANYTHING EVER AGAIN!!!  WOOOHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!  And tomorrow's monday!  HOW CAN I FAIL TO BE THRILLED ABOUT THINGS???  I am, however, apprehensive, becuase bad luck must catch up with me eventually, right?  Law of Balances, right?  MAYBE I AM AN ANOMALY IN NATURE!!!!!  How utterly cool would that be?  Pretty damn cool.  Yep.  Yep, okay.  I'm gonna go do my homework now.  Much love, Lily
