My day has been shit right from the start and that's how it's goona end. I'm bullied continuously about my hair, yeah I have a blokes haircut and yeah my voice is weird, but I don't ask you to critisize me. I have no friends and the only ones I do are after the guy I've fallen madly in love with. I can't handle anything and I just wanna get off this fucking earth. Why does everything seem to be bad in my life. It seems like everything is poured out on me. I really don't wanna have to go through anything else, I cried through a maths lesson. I need a fag. I need a life. I need a reason to go on and I sure as hell need a decent haircut.  Here's the lyrics to the most perfect song in the world. I think it describes me best at the moment: The Young And The Hopeless   Hard days make me Hard nights shake me I don't know this soul must save me And i know im making something out of this life they call nothing Take what i want take what i need they say it's wrong, but its right for me I wont look down Wont say im sorry I know that only god can judge me   [Chorus] And if i make it through today Will tomorrow be the same Am i just running in pace And if i stumble and i fall Should i get up and carry on Will it all just be the same Cause im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this im going nowhere fast thats what they say im troublesome im falling im angry at my father its me agaisnt this world and i dont care i dont care   And no one in this industry understands the life i lead when i sing about my past its not a gimmick, not an act These critics, and these trustfront kids trying to tell me what punk is but when i see them on the street they got nothing to say   [Chorus] And if i make it through today Will tomorrow be the same Am i just running in pace And if i stumble and i fall Should i get up and carry on Will it all just be the same Cause im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this im going nowhere fast thats what they say im troublesome and falling im angry at my father its me agaisnt this world and i dont care i dont care i dont care...and now i dont care oooooo ooooo oooooo   im young and im hopeless im lost and i know this im going nowhere fast thats what they say that im troublesome and falling im angry at my father its me agaisnt this world and i dont care i dont care. i dont care. i dont care.  And this is the most beautiful song in the world. It's without a doubt the most beautiful song I've ever heard and if anyone ever disses it I will die.   GOO GOO DOLLS     Iris  And I'd give up forever to touch you 'Cause I know that you feel me somehow You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be And I don't want to go home right now And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life 'Cause sooner or later it's over I just don't want to miss you tonight And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming Or the moment of truth in your lies When everything feels like the movies And you bleed just to know you're alive And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am (break and solo) And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am And I don't want the world to see me 'Cause I don't think that they'd understand When everything's made to be broken I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am I just want you to know who I am    Well gotta go now. I need some sleep, I've got college tomorrow with the friend that always calls me "fat ass". Well bye
