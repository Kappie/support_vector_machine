Personally, I prefer the rubber band because it won't stick to your hair like tape does.  =)    Gimme a break, Daf !  I feel tubby because I'm so short.. I'd need to be a "0" to look right !  Wouldn't want to be as skinny as my sister is, though.. She looks like she hasn't eaten in months !  Street drugs will do that to you.. Kidding !  I don't know if she's still using. I really despise her lifestyle, but we've all given up at this point.        Hey !  Check this out !  This is a drawing of Brian's that his friend Josh is getting tatooed on his back. It's so cool. I've seen it partially finished (just the black out-lines).. Josh will return to get the colors filled-in shortly. It's so huge. There's going to be lots more he says.. He's going to put a background (a heavenly backdrop on one and hellish one on the other) and everything.. He will be a walking mural soon.
