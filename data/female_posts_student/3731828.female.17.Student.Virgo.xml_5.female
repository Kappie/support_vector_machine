It was the same group of friends (with couple of exceptions) than in that summer cottage at juhannus. We spent those two festival days drinking, listening to good (live) music and enjoying the sunny and warm weather along with other 20 000 festival guests. Again, I can't wait to see the pictures I took!  I spent all of my money there, the food was a bit more pricey that I thought. It was good tho, there were lots of different kinds of food booths (Chinese, Vietnamiese, vegetarian food, hamburgers etc). And of course the drinks cost some money too. :P
