I thought about and discarded the usual muffins and pancakes. I craved something different, but I wasn't quite sure what. This morning, while surfing recipe sites on the web, I came across a blueberry pudding cake. I was intrigued. It looked good, but I felt it needed something .... like a good shot of lemon. I never could follow a recipe.  Lemony Blueberry Pudding Cake:  A light lemon cake topping with a luscious blueberry sauce underneath. I don't like my sweets very sweet; so be forewarned, this is on the tart side.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees C.  Lightly spray an 8" or 9" square baking dish. Tumble in 2 1/2 cups of blueberries and spread evenly over the bottom.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, stir together:  1 1/4 cups flour [I use 'whole' white flour with the wheat germ left in] 2 teaspoons baking powder A good dash of salt Grated rind of one lemon  Stir in 3/4 cup of water or soymilk. Pour the batter over the blueberries and spread to cover. Batter will seem sparse and berries will peek out, but that's okay! Sprinkle 3/4 to 1 cup of sugar over top [I use the lesser amount].  Squeeze the juice of one lemon into a measuring cup. There should be about 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Add boiling water to make 1 1/2 cups of liquid. Pour this hot, lemony liquid over the sugar-topped batter. DO NOT MIX! Carefully transfer the whole sloppy-looking mess to the oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the cake topping tests done.  Let cool slightly and then dig in!  Serves 4
