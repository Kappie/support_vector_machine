I believe I really did fuck everything up this time. The  only thing I can do right now is to not think about it. I want to read my book but Christine has it. Christine is (actually, was) my best friend. She is a great person, but I can't do it. To her, I am always depressed and emotional and I keep bringing her down. I refuse to do that to her anymore. I know she does't deserve it. I'm starting to cry angain so I cannot talk about it. I cry a lot. Over the stupidest things, too. I guess all I really want is attention, but I never get it. So I cry. Even my doing that I just get yelled at. No one wants me here, but all I can do is my best and don't listen to them. I have to go by a more possitive mannor. I'm drinking Orange Soda. I love Orange Soda.     I looked at my arms yesterday. Actually LOOKED at them. Stared. It's scary because they're all covered in scars and they'll probably be there forever. I am ashamed. That's why I am trying to keep this journal a secret. So no on ewill know about it. Hm. I am extremely tired. I went to bed, say 2:30? And I woke up at like 5 something. I really wish we got that weed on Friday. I really need it. .  It was about $20-30 worth. Not too much, but enough.   Okay, well I'm done. Bye  -Kat
