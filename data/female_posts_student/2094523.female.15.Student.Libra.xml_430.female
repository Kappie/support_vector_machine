I guess watching movies, and television kinda gives u a stereotype as to what high school is like. coz as far as i know.. high school is NOT going to be the best yrs of ur life. i made it thro gr 10 i can only hope next yr gets better. If not then whatever, we all make it thro somehow. Its friday night and i have nothing to do. not much of a partyer anyways sometimes id rather be left alone.
