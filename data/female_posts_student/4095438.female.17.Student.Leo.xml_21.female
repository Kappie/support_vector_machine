I'm Stef. I'm a 17 year old girl volunteering in a hospital gift shop. We do about $1800 sales in a day = a lot of customers. About 3-4 times a day, someone will be paying for their purchase, spot the  girly tubes  and say one of the following things:  "Oooh, these are pretty. What are they?" "Oh my, these are bright but whatever are they for?" "Dude, what the hell is this?" "Oooh look mommy, I want one of these. What's it for?" "*picks up tube* Is this... no. It can't be.. tell me this isn't for _____!"  Now let me tell you what they're all looking at. It's a bunch of long, thin pink tubes (looks like test tubes) with "tres femme" (or 'very woman') scrawled on the side. Fake crystals, pearls, gems and various other bright, sparkly things adorn the tube, with the icing on the cake an eye-catching pearl or sparkly crown sitting on the top. In other words, they're both ritzy and gaudy enough to catch  everyone's  attention.       Still can't figure out what it's for? It's to  carry your tampon around in .   Yes, I'm serious. Yes, I wish I was kidding. Don't you feel sorry for me, having to answer the "what" question to all of those customers, including men  young kids? Well, I feel sorrier for John, the 14 year-old male volunteer having to answer the same questions! Oh and before you Australians say that it's "too long", know that Americans use applicator tampons. Maybe that's an overshare, but it's also a frustrating fact of life for us anti-applicator girls who struggle to find a normal tampon.   urlLink Want one?
