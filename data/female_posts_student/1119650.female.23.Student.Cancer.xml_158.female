She's put into words almost everything I've wanted to say to them.  So  urlLink Joe B  this link is for you...but a certain someone has been up my ass lately so this blog entry is dedicated to you....  Dear T, "It's been awhile since you came around Now ya wanna see what's goin' down Tryin' to tell me how ya want my time Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind  See it never had to be this way You should of never played the games you played Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame Knowin how the situation changed  Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, now I can smile and say Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say Ain't it funny  I remember how you walked away Even when I tried to call your name See at first I didn't understand Now you're lookin' like a lonely man (lonely man) I remember how you did me wrong And now you're hurtin' cuz my love is gone Everybody gets a chance to burn You can take it as a lesson learned  Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, now I can smile and say Ain't it funny Baby that you want me, when you had me Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say Ain't it funny  I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce Tryin' to blind me with your bling bling Thought I told you love don't cost a thing Hope you realize that now I'm through And I don't ever wanna hear from you I had enough of bein' there for you Now I'm laughin' while you play the fool Ain't it funny?"  From, Gwen P.S. Your junk is  really  little...sucker!
