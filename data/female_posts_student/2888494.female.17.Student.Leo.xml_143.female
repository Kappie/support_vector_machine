The blinding heat almost drains one automatically; the energy expels itself out of the being and surrenders to the intense warmth. AAaahh!!!! Run away!!  Yes. Summer in Utah is terrible. Truly it is a purgatory in every sense of the word and stereotypical belief. It is so incredibly hot and sticky and blazingly desolate outside that one barely dares to journey up to the upper level of the house, let alone outside in the middle of all the furiously hot commotion.   Why, Oh why? It came so quickly, yet it will last so long! AAaahah! How I long for a semi-moderate climate already!
