As I was going through my planner, I realized I only had 2 mods (2 sets of 18 day classes) left in my schooling... Which means I will be done with classes this upcoming September. So to all of you suckers who laughed at me because I was going to school all summer and would be miserable.... HA! To you! As everyone else is going back to school... I will be starting my new job, working in the medical field... THAT, my friends, is what has made me happy today. Peace, Melanie
