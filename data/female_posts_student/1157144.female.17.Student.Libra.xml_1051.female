Anyway, we realized that Saturday evening is basically the last day most people are around. (minus Bryan)      SO we need to something big  good, for use of the simplest kindergarten-vocabulary.      Kasso-- would it be a good night to do your party/shindig/hooplah thing? I know it is kinda short notice- that's why I/we are asking, heh.         What do you guys think? Can you be available Saturday night? Even if we don't do something at her house, we have to do SOMETHING !
