I have been real busy with exams. i just got done taking my history and i feel great about it. no matter what mr. metcalf says. he doesnt scare me. anyway now i have to prepare for french.  i have done well in that class so i am not too worried about it.  nothing much has happened since i last updated.  i spent my entire weekend studying so not much there.  Oh but today i gave mr. metcalf my $300.00 deposit to go to EUROPE!!!! i can not wait to go! i need out of this place and as far away as possible.  No place better than germany, austria or switzerland.  I could not BE more excited.  anyway back to Francais.  i should study. A demain.
