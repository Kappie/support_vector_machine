Finnaly back to the computer again! Geeze I was going totally insane. I have really become dependent on this thing...oh well...might as well feed it! right? Yes well I made my typical quilt in a week. My obsessive compulsive side came out full force. It didn't do to much for sleeping. I went and hung out at the lake on Friday which was fun. I think I may have gotten what may be suficable as a tan! And i went shoping in Missoula...got really coolio stuff. I was so insanely happy. Poor me the shopaholic....Yeah well other than that...I fell there is nothing else more excting to say about my week other than it was boring and I finished the once and Future King for English...which actually was quite good...so yeah bye people!
