Anyway, I'm sure your wondering why I won't be able to post. Well, I'm going back to Nashville Rescue Mission to present them with yet another $1000 check.  Man, I thought I was done with that whole food drive thing.  My parents think that they might offer me a job sometime soon.  Then I go straight to handbells.  Wahoo, what fun.  An hour spent with my 2 favorite people, Becca and Holly.  I can't wait.  Oh joy.  Please stop me before I explode from the excitement.  Yeh, at least Emily, Betsy and Frances are going to be there.  That should make it a little better.  Then the service (haha, I NEVER go to that anyway) and youth group.  Please come Linds.  It'll give us some good "catching up" time.  We have a lot to talk about.  Then home.  Food.  Homework.  Bed.  Yay.  I cannot wait.    Any word from Megan?
