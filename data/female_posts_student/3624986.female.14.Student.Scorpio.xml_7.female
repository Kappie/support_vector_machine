Pro's   Bush :  + Bush does have an advantage over Kerry in that he has more experience in the world of politics, having been governor of Texas and the son of a former president. + BUSHISMS, of course!  The best part of George W. Bush's presidency is his speech.    Kerry :   Sorry, folks, I couldn't think of any pro's for Kerry.     Con's    Bush :  Bush isn't the most intelligent person in the world, and his motives for going to war are in question, or at least that was the impression I got from my buddy Devin (Wolf That Cried Man on Blogger). Bush probably  shouldn't  be voted president in the following election, but he started a goddamn war, and he ought to finish it before he gets out of office.    Kerry :  From what I hear (that's all ya have to go on in politics, s'far's I can tell), Kerry is a questionable character. I've heard about medicare issues raised against him, as well as other problems that have raised eyebrows. Also, Kerry, being from the political party he's from (Democrats), would more than likely pull back arms and apologize, then reduce armed forces like Bill Clinton did a few years back. That, undoubtedly (in my mind, anyhow), could allow for another 9/11, and that's not a happy thought for  anyone , nor is it a risk worth taking.   Alright, alright, I admit it! I don't favour John Kerry, alright? I'm sorry, but I want Bush and his Bushisms to finish the war and pull our troops out of Iraq.
