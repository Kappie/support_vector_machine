Feel free to invite new people while I am gone (as long as they are from Saint Mary's). I am giving you all admin status (at least until I return), so that if something needs to be fixed or you want to invite someone, you can. If I happen to die over my vacation, please put a whoopee cushion under my coffin, so when they lower me down it sounds like...   Any ways, enjoy your time without my constant badgering and sexual innuendo. Love, Pierce I mean fuck you.  P.S. w00t.
