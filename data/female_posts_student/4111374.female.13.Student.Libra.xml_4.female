(one posted every monday)   Ok, so I went to the movies with Julia and Kiera, and then Julias mummy picked us up, and you know that carpark on the like top floor bit??  And you can walk around the corner of the box office to get to it???  Well yes yes yes, she parked there....and it was summer, so I was wearing a skirt that was made of material that wasnt heavy...IT WAS LIGHT, OH YES, OH YES OH YES IT WAS LIGHT MATERIAL EASILY BLOWN UP BY THE WIND BUT THATS NOT ALL!!!!!   So yes yes yes you can guess guess guess what happened (well actually you probably cant because if this happened to anyone else they would probably die of shame and then there would be no one to tell the story of embarrasment, so it has never been told so you have never heard of it) so we were walking out the door into the carpark to get to the CAR and then we walked out the door and suprise suprise my skirt blew right up and now my bright pink (and  ever-so-slightly  see through undies were now visible to the whole world, BUT THATS NOT ALL....   The amusing part is that I didnt notice that my skirt had even blown up until we had walked halfway across the carpark.   ba-doom-cha!!      (and to all those people who are wondering if  "the wind between your legs" really feels as good as they say, I am here to tell you..................yes, yes it does.
