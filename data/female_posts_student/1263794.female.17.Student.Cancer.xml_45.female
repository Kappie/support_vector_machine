Nowadays you can't relax and just "be sick" because your (or I don't know about everyone but this is how it is for me) too uptight worrying about how much work your missing. I was actually arguing with my mom today about how I need to go to school tomorrow and can't miss another day. (fyi I didn't win, no sharon at school tomorrow) I never thought it would come to this. I lived for sick days when I was little.
