I had to restrain myself to not answer it right away so as not to appear too desperate. I am so so so so excited. I asked him about days to meet. I wonder if he's going to think im pushy. It's like we're dating. Or something. OH GOD i didn't think that Graduate school could just sneak up on you like this. I am such a geek to be so excited, but what can I say? Im an uber geek.
