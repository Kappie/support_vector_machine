Second, there's 14 school days left (not counting weekends) until graduation. Thirdly, ... uh... there isn't really a third, but no one's gonna read this blog except maybe Allie sometimes if I make her... Kidding :P  So I feel very left out and very excluded and hurt and worthless because of how the two people are making me feel right now.. :( i want high school to start REALLYYYY badly... :(
