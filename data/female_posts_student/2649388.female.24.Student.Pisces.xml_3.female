(BTW, that is the whole point of this blog -- I can blab out all my complains/bitterness without getting people annoyed.  If you are interested, read it; if you are not interested, don't check this site; if you did check and get annoyed, tell you what you can do -- did you see a little "x" on the top right hand corner of your browser?  Yeah -- click on that, then I will be out of your face immediately.)  Besides, complaining is good -- it does your mind good like milk does your body good.  It's a healthy outlet for your bad/bitter/negative/sad emotions.  Therefore, my friends, bravo to anyone who is healthy enough to complain -- but don't complain to me, get your own blog to complain away!
