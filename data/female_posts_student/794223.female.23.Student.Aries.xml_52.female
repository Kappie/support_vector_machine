If you're truly bored and feel like reading it, go  here .  An update on my cousin (I'm seriously considering adding a page to my website, dedicated to her and her ongoing battle with cancer): there was yet another delay at MD Anderson, but a final appointment has been re-scheduled with one Dr. Yung on Tuesday--who just happens to be one of the top neurosurgeons in the country.  Our family feels confident now knowing that Brandi literally could not be in better hands.  If, after doing everything that is humanly possible, God does indeed decide to take her, we will at least know that we did everything that was in our power to keep her around.  Over and out.
