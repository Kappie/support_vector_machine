You gatta just keep swimming around feeling for a spot where there's no fucking fire. Then what if you found a circle where there was no fire, but the second you came up a big dude just punched you in the face. 'Get back in the firey water. You don't come out of the firey water. Cover up that whole with some fire, now. GET BACK IN THE FIREY WATER'"   "If got to a house and it was fully on fire, Fuck that. I quit. I would just stand outside and watch it burn with everyone else. And the woman next to me would be like 'Please my son! He's screaming in there.' I'd be like 'Well he's probably on fire.'"   Both from Dane Cook. Incredible.
