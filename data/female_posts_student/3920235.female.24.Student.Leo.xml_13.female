    
       I am so fucking  sick  of doing homework.  That's all I've done this weekend, besides housework.  I swear to God I'm going crazy...  This paper I've just finished writing is one of the hardest I've ever had to write.  Well it wasn't really the hardest in terms of topic (it was just a comparison paper between the NCTM National standards and the Indiana State standards) but it was the hardest for me to put into words.  Ugh.
