She can get up to go to the bathroom but that's it. I feel awful because i can't do anything. Well my dad is looking into getting First Class tickets all the way home so my mom can fly comfortably or somewhat comfortably. She's def. going to have surgery when she gets back home. Now that all this has happened I'm SO glad that i decided not to do the Boston University thing. The $5000 that was going to go for that is now going to go for the first class tickets.   I am so incredibly ready to come home. I go to bed every night with an empty feeling in my stomach..aching to be back home. I have loved my stay here and have enjoyed every minute, but for once i'm starting to feel like that 10 year old girl that goes to Summer camp and gets homesick and calls her parents crying.."Mom, I wanna go home!!"  Sometimes, I feel so alone here. Even though i'm not- my mom, aunt, uncle, and cousin are all here. But I only know how to speak Bengali, and here they don't speak that..most people speak Hindi. SO most of the time i feel really left out and i feel like a dumb mute. It's frusterating because i can't do anything on my own. I couldn't even help my mom at the hospital cuz i couldn't converse with anyone there, my uncle and cousin had to do everyhthing. and it was really hard for me, so there in the hospital i had an emotional breakdown. it was bad. But it's okay, i'll be coming home soon ( hopefully). It's really sad here also. Poverty is everywhere. It's like poverty came and hit me in the face and gave me a bloddy nose. It's so depressing and it depresses me even more that I can't do anything about it. There's no compassion in the country. It's one man for his own here. Here it really is a dog eat dog world. If i could describe USA with one word it would be COMPASSION.  Jenna-I'm so sorry you're having to go through all that shit. I feel so bad that i can't be there for you. I love you girl and now that you are the best.  I would also like to thank a man named Bernie who did a small thing by writing a short uplifting e-mail, but meant so much to me. I'm all about the little things in life and that little thing made me feel so good!
