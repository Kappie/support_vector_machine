So he went to the mall and i met him there and he had terri and ben with him. Terri i hadnt seen scine like last fall or even longer then that. Ben i hadnt seen since the summer when i met him which was like 3yrs ago. Even though thomas acted like an ass the WHOLE TIME!! It was nice to hang out with ben and terri. When i got home from the mall jackie came over and then brent called. Then aroun 4:00ish ben and terri came back over while thomas and his lil hoe went somewhere else... gawd i hate her.... but anyway they stayed until about 6:15ish i think...then they left and jackie stayed the night. Brent came over about 10:30ish and i got to talk and hang out with him.
