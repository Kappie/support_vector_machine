Nothing was resolved, but I am ignoring things, therefore so are others. It's a nice little cycle, which just defines to me more and more the reasons for myexcitementt about moving.  So, today I opened the mailbox and found 2 items pour moi (it's actually ironic that I say that in french). The first envelop was from Philemon containing my report card (46% last term in french; hence the irony.) and the second was from Dawson-finally. That made me feel better.   THen I babysat. That was ok...but I am so over-exhausted for no particular reason. It's emotional I suppose.   But anyways, I got home and had a long chat with Ash, which was nice because it's been a long time. I guess they got over whatever they had against me last weekend. We tried to start organizing a camping trip.  Im still having mixed emotions about the Cottage. It was fun, but for some reason I can't fully get that sorted out in my mind. I just wish that I had a boyfriend.  I realize that that last statement has consumed my thoughts over the past what-5 years? It's just I suppose the reasurance that I can count on that best friend to be there for me when I need them, and that they'll come to me when they need someone. I realize that it's selfish, but wouldn't it be nice to have someone specifically special to you, and to whom you are specifically special? I guess it's just easier to say that I want a boyfriend rather than I want a best friend. It's more conventional at least.   But also, for some reason I find it much easier to talk to guys than girls. I suppose because they are more easy going, and they judge me as a girl in general as opposed to girls who think "she's so strange and most definatly NOT friend-worthy...let's not talk to her around certain people so that they don't know that I'm friends with her". This is not to say that I haven't experienced guys doing this either.   Actually, I'm going to go off onto that for a bit. So, I was finishing Generation X last night, and I can identify SO much with Claire. She talks about Tobias in a way that my thoughts are decoded and written out. The way that she knows that she has an obsession and comes to terms with the fact that she can't deny it. The way that while he can be such a jerk to her, she still longs for him. The way that she really is interested mainly for physical reasons. After 2 1/2 years of well everything good and bad, I sit her some days and still think about those summer days, "studying".   Which is I guess why I find myself in the situation that plagues me now. My thoughts are bombarded with short stories that I think up in my head, involving me and others-other specifically- to help me not think about those times, days, moments where bliss was acheived. It is much easier than trying to remind myself of the bad days, they just make me upset. It is easier to defer thoughts with the silent longing hope that one day these short stories may become true because in my world they are realistic.  My world...what world is that? Does everyone have their own world, or am I the only one with such a large misconception of day to day activity. For everyone else's sakes, I hope that they have their own worlds. The universal one is awfully boring. I would go crazy without an imagination, but is that just because I am more of a creative type?   Inspiration is the key though. You can't shut off that universal world, as much as we sometimes wish to. Everything around us, no matter how "out there' it may seem was someone inspired and influenced by the universal society that we live in.  Have you ever had a friend that was like a tv? Well, I admit it, I am friends with a TV. I mean, how am I not? Have you ever tried converse with a television? Chances are, you'd find our voice getting lost, bouncing back at you. You are bombarded with images, stories, annectdotes and the most useless infomericals...despite what you say. I was going to try to come up with an example conversation, and while I could just copy and paste an msn conversation to perfectly illustrate my point, I have decided to leave the fragments of anonymity that may still be left and end this statement like this.   I think that this is a good time to publish a disclaimer:  What I write here is not in the intent to bad talk someone, to hurt them, to downplay my relationships with anyone or whatever other feeling that could come from it. Rather, it is an outlet for what is going on inside of me so that I don't turn around and hurt others. I feel like a can of beer being shaken and shaken and shaken until it is about to explode, and this is just allowing the can to be opened a little to release some of the built up pressure. If every someone were to stumble across this and were affected, insulted or even just mentioned, then well-I'm not sorry that I said it. At the moment,this is how I feel. I'm not going to hide it. But these are feelings harbouring inside of me. Isn't it better that I release this here? Would you really rather that we release this to our mutual friends so that perhaps they develop similar feelings? or to you directly so that you can be hurt? If I have made peace with my friendships, then why bother disrupt them?  I am friends with who I am for specific reasons. Every single person that I care for as some redeeming quality that makes them special to me, and of course, there is some specific thing that really really just bugs the hell out of me about that. But that's life, right?  And next time that you ever have the urge to get mad at someone because they pointed out one of your flaws-stop and think. Have you ever said or even thought someone not so nice about them? Chances are pretty good that you have. So just shut the fuck up and stop being so goddamn hippocritical all of the time. It's not money, or religion, or language which cause so many rifts in our world, it's hipocrasy. If we'd all sit back and reflect for a second, I think that we'd all realize that this is pointless. Why bother act so stupidly all of the time. Actions have consequences, so think before you act.   Goodnight.
