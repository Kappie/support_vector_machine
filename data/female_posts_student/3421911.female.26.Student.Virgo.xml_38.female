After graduating from college I thought I’d be slave to the corporate pigs for a while and then when I’m like high up the food chain, I’d do my own gig.   It obviously didn’t happen because there was this big recession in 1998 and I went straight to law school. I stayed in this particular school for two years before being pirated by my beloved law school ( translation:    I got kicked out because they didn’t want my money, I wasn’t cute enough for their standards and I didn’t make too many friends from the higher ups  ). Anyway, still, no delusions or illusions of magnificence, I just wanted to get it over with. You know, I just modified my dreams a bit. Instead of being slave to the corporate pigs, I thought I’d be slave to the lawyer-crocs for a few years and when I finally got the hang of what I was doing, I’d start my own practice. I’d only hire the gays and lesbians and the chubby short people, because I’d probably have the same difficulty finding a job myself, being the short, chubby person that I am.   I was always having these conversations with myself and with God, in the church and I’d tell Him that it didn’t really matter to me if I didn’t have a love life, for as long as my grades were good. It didn’t matter to me if nobody ever thought I was beautiful for as long as I could answer what the mean lawyer-professor would ask me in class correctly. I even had this sign, this 20-word line, which would only be uttered by, “  The One  ”. That’s how I’d know it’s him/her. Till then, I’d be submerged in my studies.   Then I transferred. My old school was fag and dude heaven, this new law school was full of lesbian promise. There were hardly any cute single guys and the only yummy people worth paying any attention to were the lesbians, the butches. I think I’m gonna like it here, I thought. So I did.   I met this girl. She was really nice. She had a best friend who was also nice. They were both cute and hot and they were both attracted to me as I was to them. Little did I know that they have this history of fighting over the same women even before I got there.   I first went out with A. We were together for two months then she broke up with me because she had to fix her life and take care of other people and stuff. M entered the picture weeks later. They didn’t talk to each other for years because of me. Of course, the relationship with M lasted for like three years. It could probably be the longest rebound relationship on record, if you’d consider it a rebound relationship. It ended the same way the relationship ended with A. Tragic. (   Funny, the music playing in my PC right now is The Smiths’ Please Let Me Get What I Want from the Pretty in Pink OST, which also happens to be a love triangle   ) The lying, the cheating, the crying, the backstabbing, the horror of it, it’s all so telenovela.   They’re back together now, I mean, they’re friends again. Kinda makes you think they were just trying to prove a point: they’re studs and I’m a slut.   I’m tired of this Dawson-Joey-Pacey hoopla. I love them both in different degrees. In two different occasions I saw myself spending the rest of my life with either of them, but it doesn’t mean I played with them. I want to think that they didn’t set this up to play me, either. I still have faith in people, no matter how little. I just hate it that friendships have to be ruined and that I’m the one doing most of the damage. It hurts to not know who in the end will be singing “Power of Two” with me. Maybe I’m just better off alone.    It makes me kinda wonder all of a sudden:   Lord, am I only appealing to lesbians?
