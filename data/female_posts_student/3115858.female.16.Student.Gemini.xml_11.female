(i'm pretty sure that i do.)  i think that they broke up because the guy is very concerned about our little japanese friend and wants to hang out with her.  the girl thinks that the little japanese one is a threat to her status as his girlfriend.  not the case.  they are merely friends wanting to spend some time together before our japanese friend leaves at the end of june. not much time left.:'(  i'm still really bummed about the get-together at the track meet.  but i've realized that i think the same of him now as i did when i first met him: booo--rrinngggg!  he doesn't even know what mystery science theater 3000 is!!!!!! aaaaaaaa!!!  muy mal. tomorrow will be much better.  my best friend and a potential significant other--the three of us out for coffee.  yay:]
