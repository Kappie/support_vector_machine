Went to Chili's with dad and Nick which was actually bearable seeing as Nick and I put three lemons in Dad's drink causing him to get this funny look on his face when he took a sip.  Muhahaha . Had the chicken platter which has restored my faith in the Chili's franchise. Have yet to try the chocolate cake...  Headed to the Wolfchase Mall to walk around and got Randi to meet me there. I talked to Sallis on my cell phone despite the noise of the ever-crowded Wolfchase and even found him a birthday present!  Hurrah :).  Randi and I also bought a shirt for her bf/ soon to be fiancee ( I'll explain that one later, Sallis ).   Then, it was a few hours of boys. Randi and I ran into Macaroni Grill looking for Brad, but sadly he was not there. Instead there was a snooty female waitress who looked at us like we were nuts. We left and headed to see Johnathon who shot those little snappers at us with a slingshot.  Scary stuff . Randi also did a slightly illegal job of parking...  we'll never tell ...   We then headed to Wendy's, where for some reason, we could not stop laughing long enough to order three frosties.   Mmm.. frosties  . We headed to Sallis' place with frosties in tow and managed to do legal parking this time in his driveway.   Long hair la dee dee...my brother's watching wrestling.  Blecch squared .  Might have to go to Florida.  Randomness cubed . Not that I don't love it down there. Freedom from Nick would be lovely. I told the Murrells I would find them seashells. :)   Once I get back, I'm dragging you out to my house. Muhaha. To make cookies with no nuts. Besides, who needs nuts when you have Robin Williams? He's nuts enough.    MUST....FIND...JOB...   Especially one that doesn't make me say " Would you like fries with that ?"  It's a happy day, my friend.   "Life is a tragedy for those who feel and a comedy for those who think."- Chinese fortune cookie.
