Because my family is going to Eurpoe the day after home concert.  Yay!...But I won't be getting back until a week before my school starts.  Which means, I will have NO SUMMER AT HOME.  Seriously, I've done the calculations.  I had this week, I have next week.  Then I'm going on a beach retreat, camp and a mission trip.  Literally hours at home between those.  Then I have a week at home and off to Lake Junaleska (or however you spell it).  Then practice for choir tour, and choir tour.  Then Eurpoe and school.  Thats what?  4 weeks at home?  Boy howdy....and most of this stuff I don't really want to go too (not the stuff with you, Linds, the other stuff).  Well, off I go.  I'll talk to you guys on Sunday, or Monday...or something.  I don't know.  Whatever.    Happy birthday again!  Btw, I want to hear my song...haha.  Germs, my invisible dog is a song that I saw performed by a bunch of really cute little kids.
