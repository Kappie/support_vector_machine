Thrills I get when you hold me close  Oh, my darling, you're the most  I love you but do you love me  Oh, Diana, can't you see  I love you with all my heart  And I hope we will never part  Oh, please stay with me,  Diana    I'm standing on the edge of time I walked away when love was mine Caught up in a world of uphill climbing Tears are on my mind And nothing is rhyming Oh  Mandy   Judy's got the lips I love to kiss And when she walks she's got the cutest twist She's grown up before my eyes and all at once I realize  Judy , Judy, Judy I love you  AND MY NAME AT LAST!!! =D   Winnie the Pooh  Winnie the Pooh Tubby little cubby all stuffed with fluff He's Winnie the Pooh Winnie the Pooh Willy nilly silly old bear  AHHHHH..!
