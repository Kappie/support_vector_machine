They always have very interesting articles for example as many know I am a true fan of Survivor, God only knows why, and there are many interesting (and incriminating) facts on several of the cast members of the upcoming Survivor season.  But even if you dislike the Survivor show there are all kinds of incriminating discoveries on various people.  It's not a useful site but it is entertaining.  So if you're bored, check it out.
