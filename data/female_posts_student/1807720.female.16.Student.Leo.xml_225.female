My muscles just hurt a little from too much weight lifting. I went to see Spiderman 2 on Sunday - believe it or not I really liked it. And I usually hate comics and thought the first one sucked ass. I liked Kirsten Dunst though, she is one of my favorite actresses besides Lindsey Lohan and Elisa Dushku. I wish there was more time for Summer too. Summer School caused an entire month to go to waste. I could have been having fun. I guess on the positive note I am DONE SOCIAL 30. DONE DONE DONE DONE. Oh yeah........!!! And I found the best song by Lindsey Lohan - Ultimate, listen to it sometime cause it's good. Yesterday besides working out and watching Ellen, Chels and I went for dinner. We went to Jack Astors cause we are sick of all the other restaurants around here. We have been to them like a thousand times (we eat out too much) but yeah it was pretty good. Chels thought the meal wasn't big enough, but like it was pretty big. I usually don't consume that much food for dinner, but whatev. So we also got dessert cause Chels wanted some (I honestly would not have eaten chocolate if she didn't want it) I mean really, honestly I was trying to be healthy :) It's alright though, cause I toned my body and stuff and well lost some weight, so I look good. Chels and I then made new truth and dares for my Jenga and played. I had the best time cause we are way too a like. We are wild, fun, and crazy. I can't believe some people think I am shy and reserved!! Now that is seriously funny! Yeah, it was a fun night. We were so loud my mom probably thought we had been drinking, like she thought last time. I was trying to ask her something but I mixed all the words up, and like everyone I was with was laughing their ass off, even me once I realized what I said. It was funny. No wonder she thought we were drinking, but she knows I would never drink and drive. This morning I went to the gym again - yeah like that is a surprise. Then my mom and I get went to South Centre and got some Chinese fast food. It was good. I love that new place - Bourbon St. Grill. Love it!!! After trying it at Market Mall with Melissa I wanted it again, and then go figure it's in South Centre. I also went to guess and my mom bought my this belt I wanted for my b-day (Well I think my b-day is like a week from today) but she can never surprise me anyways. Now she just buys half of my gifts when I am with her. And later on I think I have to take the papers and cardboard to recycling then we're going out for Coffee with the neighbor's. That's my day!
