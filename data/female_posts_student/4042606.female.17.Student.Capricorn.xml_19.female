Maybe I will put a picture of something I like, or of something I have encountered today. I do not know yet, I will ask Ian what he wants me to do, I don't want to ruin his website with my bad topics (just kidding Ian). I will figure something out though, maybe I will try and talk about what Ian does for me, likeIan was being really nice and said he was going to send me a birthday present,you probably don't know it but it is onmonday. Ian, you really don't have to.  It is almost 3:00 in the morning, and Ihave to go to sleep soon, this is the latest I have been up for a very long time, and if I don't get to sleep, I will get into trouble at work tomorrow. I really love my job, so I guess I need to sleep. See you (whoever is reading this) later and maybe I will be able to post tomorrow night.  I think everyone should also visit this  urlLink website , It has some cute things on it that I like.
