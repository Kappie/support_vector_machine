Baggage, the stuff left over from other relationships--it weighs us down, it colours our decisions, it interferes with our ability to forge new relationships unmarked by past hurts.  And it's definitely a factor with me and AniRandom.  He just got out of some thing with some chick Jennie.  The impression I've gotten from AniRandom and his friends is that she is a hateful bitch, deserving of zero pity, and played a brutal game with my Ani's heart and head.  Yet...  They broke up over Christmas, and were together for just over a year.  This is the first point.  Ani  I have been chilling together since September, and he never mentioned her.  He said she stayed at his place, like every other night.  I was at his place a couple of times through the week, how is it that I never met her?  Never heard him on the phone with her?  And there was also the crazy couple of weeks when Ani and I first starting feelin' stuff for each other, then when he kissed me, then later when we had sex.  They were together then, and I had no idea until after the sex.  Hmm...  When he finally told me about her, he told me that he already knew she had been cheating on him.  So why are you still together, I wondered?  He's brutally honest about things he's not afraid of, but things like, well matters of the heart, they scare the shit out of him.  Or they must, why else would he be so hesitant to be totally honest with her?  With me?  It concerns me a little.  I mean, they were together a YEAR and he had no qualms bringing me up to the lair.  We've only been seeing each other a couple of weeks--what happens when he starts getting better-than-luke-warm feelings for some other little cutie-pie he's chillin' with?  At any rate, she must have done some pretty nasty stuff to play with his head.  He never met her parents, he said she never invited him to her home.  That's kinda odd.  I was stoked for him to meet my parents, and unfortunately, with the way the timing all worked out, it was just too late by the time he showed up.  But he brought flowers, so that says to me that he wanted to make a good impression.  Ironically, even though he didn't get to meet Ma  Pa, he still made a pretty good impression... on Mommy anyway.  Bubbs doesn't fall for stuff like flowers so easily.  Money also seemed to be a pretty pertinent issue.  Or like it was the source of a lot of ... discomfort.  My AniRandom is a lucky kid--he comes from a stable, affluent family: they provide for him whatever he needs and never question it.  That's great.  My parents did much the same for Ally and I--we've never gone wanting.  Even this year, I'm 23 years old, I've got a decent job, and minimal expenses associated with school now that my last round of tuition is paid for...yet, when I've needed a couple of bucks my parents have totally helped me out.  Granted, they have yet to hook me up with a sweet-ass condo in the heart of downtown in addition to paying tuition, but that's something else.  When we went out to the James Joyce, he paid for the drinks.  When we went out to dinner the next night, I paid.  I wouldn't let him give me money for the cab I had to take from the train station.  In fact, on several occassions he's offered money as the solution to whatever mini-problem popped up, and I've defeated it everytime.    "No, if you aren't going to come to get me, I am NOT taking a cab, I don't care if you're paying."   I'm trying to reinforce my side of the value vs. price debate.  He thinks that everything has a price, and that price is definitive.  But I think that value is flexible, insubstantial, subjective and that this is truly definitive.  I don't care about appearances, insofar as they are monetarily defined.  AniRandom has a really hard time understanding that.  I care about appearances only insofar as they are a manifestation of self-esteem.  Do you care about yourself?  Enough?  Too much?  That's it.  But plenty of things he's said have indicated that he's used to, and not overly comfortable with, paying for everything when he's with a girl.  We had a brief, and sort of awkward conversation about jewellery.  The only piece I've ever worn from a boy was the amolite ring and earrings B gave me for my birthday a couple of years ago.  But otherwise, I don't wear any.  It's just a coincidence really.  But when Ani asked what I would do with jewellery from him, I told him I'd refuse it.  That absolutely flabbergasted him.    "What???  You wouldn't keep it?  Why not?" Because if you know me well enough to be giving me gifts, you'd know what to give me.  And you'd know that it's not jewellery.  A real gift of affection should be just as much proof of how much he cares as well as how much he knows about me.  Money doesn't do anything for me.  He doesn't get it.  I kind of like being so unlike anybody he already knows.  I don't think he's ever dated a little skater-girl like myself.  Although, I think the term he used to describe me was GAP-skater.  I didn't appreciate it.  I've spent a lot of years  ignoring  the GAP, and I'll not have all that boycotting done for nothing.  I don't think he's ever gotten together with a girl who played so hard to get.  Even now, getting together for "dates" is a tricky task.  He's starting to understand that this has a lot more to do with the schedule I already had in place pre-Ani, and less to do with playing games.  I still have my wall up.  He's still hard-pressed to get little gems of Mag-isms.  And of course, there's also his testiment to never dating a girl he was already friends with.  That probably has a lot do with the way things have worked between us.  It feels to me, that he feels very comfortable with me.  There's almost no subject too taboo to discuss, we can get naked, stinky, even go to the bathroom, and nothing seems to unnerve him.  It unnerves me a little!  He's opened up to me, told me some pretty secret-sounding stuff.  I'm not sure what to do with it all.  Sometimes I think he trusts me a little too much, and I can also sense a subtext of dependency there: he really  needs  someone to open up to.    I'm torn between twin desires to fall into his arms and to run far, far away.  I have a very real feeling that he's going to hurt me, and I think he has that feeling too.  Like, this relationship can only get better, and he likes abuse!  He's going to get sick of me living so far away (he's already whined at me on several occassions during late-night phone-calls about how far I live, about how he wishes I was there with him...) he's going to get tired of us not being able to be spontaneous (distance + 2 schedules), and he's going to get horny sometime when I'm not there.  Yow, that sounded really jealous, but I think it's actually realism.  For example, on Saturday night, I went to a movie with B.  He, on the other hand, had a chick he works with over to smoke a joint (I advised that he may want to be careful about giving girls the wrong impression [as he did to me, only a few months ago] as they will get the wrong impression,) then he had his best female friend over (no qualms there, she was around long before me,) and then he had a chick from Montreal over, Liz.  Now I know he Liz go way back, and they're cool and probably totally platonic, but she brought a couple girlfriends with her.  And here's a great indicator of his comfort level with me: he told me the girls asked him to strip (!) , that they went to this mega-posh lounge for drinks (where he spend $100+ on boose for these little sloots!), and then they asked him to come back to his hotel room with them.  Yeah, I wonder why...  OK, but none of that actually makes me nervous.  I think that given his recent experience with Jennie, he's not going to cheat on me (anytime soon) because he knows how crappy it feels.  But eventually he will get comfortable me, and forget the pain, and he will hurt me: he will think about how he hates the distance between us, and he will do something to bring someone else closer, to fill the void.  I guess that's my baggage.  Automatic distrust.  I will refuse to trust him until it is too late, and he is no longer deserving of my trust.  It will be interesting to see how this works out.
