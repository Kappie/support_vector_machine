So at this time, teachers are trying to pack in as much homework as they can. Therefore, i don't have a lot of spare time, because this is my last chance to boost my grade. Secondly, my birthday is coming up, the 22nd, and i'm turning fourteen, so i've been caught up in that. Also, i have been spending quite a bit of time with my friends, because i need to. and today, i found out that i made the finals for the middle school speech competition. So now, i don't have to perform it just in front of the grade, but in front of the whole middle school population. Plus some parents and faculty. Great! yepee! i'm freaked out of my wits. You know, its 1030 and i probably should be in bed, but margaret won't let me, because she has to download songs onto my computer. In this case, i'm going to have to wake up at 610 so that i can take a shower, because my hair is all grubby and stuff. So tommorow i will be really tired. Now i have to go to feed my pet carrott (just kidding.) bye! -Jonesy -- Jonesy is the new nickname that margarets friend came up with. Its rather catchey... Jonesy. hee hee.
