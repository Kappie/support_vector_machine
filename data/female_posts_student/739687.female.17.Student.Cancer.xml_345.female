Gah my life is so crazy. Some day when I'm much older I will write my twisted memoirs for you all to see. Boy would that have mixed results. Because no one can imagine just how crazy my life really is.  Mostly because I'm having a hard time opening up to people. About certain things in my life. Certain aspects that I can't share with people. Not that it's like "my life is a negative dark little hole where I hide in shame", but it's just crazy. CRAZY LIFE.  And I love it. :)  Haha. Wowza. Yeah. yEa!!!!!~  Don't try to understand me, it's alright.  Ahhhh damn incoherence.  Damn english outline. Damn french class and being really really really really really far behind because I'm a lazy, ADD dumbass.  Lates crazies.
