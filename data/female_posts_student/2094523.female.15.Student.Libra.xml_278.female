You can only wonder what goes on in ones mind.. u can only wonder what the shit they were thinking ..u can always question but u can never answer. When you think about how possible it is for you to lose the only thing that kept you alive.. the only thing you live for in a matter of one fucking night.. it tears you up and you can no longer keep your sanity, you can no longer see the bright side you can only ponder the darkness. What if the only thing you needed, u had, u wanted, u loved, u lived for was gone. If i came close to that day i wudnt be able to live.. hell i wudnt want to live.  Funny how it takes so much before people can show how much they care, how it takes one fuckin person to be in pain before anyone really gives much of a shit. What can i say?  no longer can i take everything for granted, no longer can i look at life the same.
