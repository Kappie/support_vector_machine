We got Hit! I was like, "Mom, what the heck just happened?" Seriously, I started to cry. But now I am better. And no one was hurt, so that's good.   Yesterday and today were fun. So I went to the 4-H fair with my friend Jess to go and watch Krystal. Well, onMonday night Krystal gave me the directions to get to the fair. (I had been there before, but I forgot the way) So we start going, and I realized I forgot the directions at home. We figured we could make it there okay though. Anyway, we got lost and we had to call Krystal's mom and ask for help. She laughed at us. We made about three U-turns that day!Finally we got there. She was showing pigs yesterday. She did pretty good, but her brother won like 3 trophies. So anyways, Jess and I hung out the whole day, and then AI took her home and went back. And then today, I went back again, and I helped her wash her steer. It is the second biggest one there. It is FAT!! And then I keep hering that there were going to be severe storms around three today, but nothing happened. So when I went to work, I thought it wasn't going to storm at all then. Well all of the sudden it started getting really dark and really windy. I got scared and freaked out. So later when it was rainy really hard, Krystle and Sebastian dared me to run out to the dumpster quick. Well I didn't trust them so I got the key from Krystle just so I could get back in. Well when I came back, Sebastian was holding the door shut and I was locked out for ever. I was drenched! My hair frizzed out, but I didn't care. and then we had a Windex fight and they got it in my face! Ugh...! WOW, this is really long. I hope you like it Heather!
