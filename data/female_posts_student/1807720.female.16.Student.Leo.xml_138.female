And well I gained some weight too, so now I have to like cut back on the eating.  The we went bowling and then back to kari's house.  We had so much fun!  Earlier that day I just practiced my monologue for my audition for the play and then I was bored so I studied Bio cause she said we are having a quiz soon.  Nothing too exciting.  And today I am going to review the bio stuff we learned and maybe do some research for the Model UN thing I am doing.
