Our rehearsals have been running from 4:00 and well they are suppose to end at 7:30 but we always end up going to at least 8:00 or 9:00.  Usually we order or bring food.  On thursday we got pizza and yesterday we had chips, cookies, and pop (well I didn't have any pop *by the way I have a story bout' that*) and yeah Megz and I bought a 2 lb bag of animal crackers!  We bought the zoo!  Yeah so Friday's rehearsal was good and we got soup from timmys and a yogurt parfait from McDonalds (that is like the ONLY thing I will eat there) for lunch.  Oh and who got 100% on their Bio quiz - ME!!  It was the easiest all year but I still have to do good on the unit test coming up cause my last unit wasn't so hot.  Anyways like 100%.  Like I literally studied in the theatre during rehearsal and while watching the game.  Maybe it's because I wasn't so stressed out.  I usually study for hours on end and don't end up doing good.  I find that actually when I just relax and take it easy, the marks seem to come easier.  I guess it makes sense though.  Also the gym riot on Thursday was so much fun.  I was on team white and we came in 3rd, but we weren't last because there were four teams.  Team white was pretty pathetic though, because I mean c'mon you know how hard it is to decorate with the color white when half of the gym is already that color.  We got to do a balloon stomp where everyone got to tie balloons around their ankles and stomp the other teams color.  Matt Clearly did the pie eating contest.  We got to make up a team cheer and like I said decorate.  Then there was a refridgerator box relay where three people on each side had to go under this giant box and to the other side to pick up other people from their team.  Then Chels got taped to the wall with duct tape in 3 minutes and we actually came in 1st for that one.  There were many more.  Also for the grab bag re-lay pulled out a can of Pepsi, but I like never drink pop.  At first I started to chug in really fast but I got like this rush of carbonated drink going down and I had to stop cause I couldn't breath and then my stomach LITERALLY felt like it was going to explode.  After I was done I thought I might actually throw it back up because I could feel some muscles or something in my stomach trying to force it back.  So I am sure that wasn't exactly too safe to chug pop, but whatever I did it for the team.    Yeah white! Alright! We look like snow We're ready to go We've got the flow We're white, alright!  Go White!
