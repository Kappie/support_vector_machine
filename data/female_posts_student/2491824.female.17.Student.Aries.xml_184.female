It died at least two months ago while I was washing paint brushes because I had let a little too much water get to it.. I gave it a few days to come around, but it didn't. So, I just put it on my desk and forgot about it. However, I checked on it today out of curiousity and found that not only was it working, the time was only about 10 minutes behind and the date was a day ahead.  Yay! I'm so happy.  And just Sunday I was complaining about having to find a new watch.  Wearing a watch feels really weird though....
