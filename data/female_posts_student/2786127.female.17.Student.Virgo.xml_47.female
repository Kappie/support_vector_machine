Dad's girlfriend was in the driveway getting ready to go up and watch my dad race today. And then Danielle and I saw a car pull up with two guys in it, and we're like, shit, we both look horrible, we'er not answering the door. So we ran to the back of the house...haha...and then they just drove away. Stef came in and told us that a "dan and kelly"...meaning dan and kellan, showed up and that they would be back in a bit. DAMMIT!! Its now an hour later, i'm now fully dressed....and they haven't come back yet. DAN!! Genie understands.   mahhh!!!
