I was thinking to myself and was asking what is wrong with them..maybe I can help, but life isn't like that. We have to accept the way everything is. Everything you see around you was meant to be that way or had its own purpose. You can't change a certain thing because you dislike it. Just accept it...  That's what I've been telling myself for my entire life. I know somethings aren't all fair in life, but what I learned to do was to appreciate it. Some may think I'm crazy, but it's true. I always tell myself that "it could be worse". I've gone through some rough times in my life too..but I've learned to overcome them and that's how I became the person I am today. I remember a year ago a really close friend of mine and me got into this huge fight. It was all these rumours flying around that got to her, but I accepted it. As long as I knew I didn't do anything wrong I was a-ok. I knew that she'll realize soon that I'm not that type of person. And here I am today with my best friends ever: the o4 (krystal vivian and ashley) also can't forget about nima. I can't forget yasi, she was always there for me no matter what and was there through all my problems, shes my sister, and joey shes my advisor. And I just want to thank elayne because she helped me be with someone special. There the ones that got me this far and I know that their my motivation.  Over the past few days I was thinking about a lot of things. You see, I love this person..and at times it just gets to me that maybe in one point in our lives, that he might not love me anymore. I try not to think about the future and think about now. I have to admit at times I get messed up and it's because of him, but I'm not complaining. I remember I told him how I felt about flirting. That day was great I was finally able to get something off my chest. Days after that the same topic came in my head. It confused me. Everything seemed to make me confused. I talked to him again..but this time everything turned my world upside down. We didn't speak for a while, and that really killed a part of me. I knew that it wasn't going to change who I was or the person I would become, but a little part of me was just tored apart. I remember after that day ended I talked to Nima and he comforted me as always, and I was thankful.   I had a talk with him, and it took a while, but we got through that phase together. I now it's dumb or stupid or whatever, but sometimes I feel that he doesnt care for me. I know he does but it seems different sometimes. I know I'm being really picky and paranoid, but it's like all this time I was a nobody. When we have time to be together, we aren't together. Instead we're apart. Him with his friend and me with mine. I'm not saying we cant be with our friends, but his schedule is different than mine. This is dumb but it seems lk all the time in his life is devoted to his friends. I don't have a problem with it, but, I wish their was time for me, and their probably is but I'm too dumb to realize it. If his schedule was out of ten, I would be o.1 of his time. I know I'm lucky to even have someone to love me, and I truly am...sometimes I just don't feel that I could handle it. However I still keep telling myself that what I'm doing it right, to be with him is right.   Even through all the doubts and all the troubles, I know we can get through this together. All I know is that I love you Safee..
