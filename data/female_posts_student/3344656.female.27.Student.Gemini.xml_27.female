I've been scouring the area for good ones, and so far have found 2 (note: typically stay away from open mics in bars, especially if you're near a college... the frat boys tend to do a lot of dave matthews covers, and since they're drunk, and dmb is hard to play, it doesn't turn out well).  I'm looking for ones wherein they don't chastise you for playing covers, but where there's a decent amount of original stuff, too.  But last night, I drove up to Boulder (it's about 1/2 hour), brought my knitting (see Mary, I haven't forgot the scarf which is only about 6 months late!), and a book, and settled in... There were only 2 people playing, both of whom didn't interest me much, and then they had a featured performer (which surprised me at an open mic) who played jazz guitar with a drummer.  I listened to him for about 30 minutes, and once the fabulous thunderstorm that I was watching for a good portion of the evening subsided enough, I went back to my car, and drove home watching the fantastic lightning show and trying to see the lines on the highway.  As far as open mics go, it was a little of this, a little of that.  I purposely went this week because a lot of the CU students would have gone home, and I'd get to see a bit more of the local talent.  I'll probably go again in a few weeks.  I'm going to the one at Common Grounds again tomorrow night.  I'm undecided as to whether I'll play or not.  I have a job interview Friday.  cross yer fingers.
