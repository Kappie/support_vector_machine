But anyways...did anyone think about who the real loser is in that story? Morally, sure, the boy faces the guilt of losing the sheep. But what about the townspeople? No wool, no...other sheep stuff...all because they had so modified their outlook on the "boy" that they didn't bother to come check what he was bitchin' about.   Someone should redo that wonderful piece of folklore and tell about the massive economic backlash that struck the parentals thereafter. Sure, the kid's a biotch, but shouldn't it be their duty to come look if he says, "Wolf?" Who gives a kid a boring job like looking for wolves in a sheep pasture all day anyway? Who's to blame for that one?  Those stupid dingleberries. Heheheh.  ABBY IS SICK! I hate myself and I want to die...augh...such sentiment of depression therein. WHY, to her, of all people?  I'm sure she'll be better in about two seconds tho...lordy, am I an EMO kid. Heheh.  Farewell warriors.
