'It's something that really makes me nuts,' said Cokie Roberts, an ABC News correspondent who spoke out about the problem on Capitol Hill several weeks ago at a gathering of Congressional interns. 'By setting up unpaid internship programs, it seems to me that without completely recognizing it, it sets up a system where you are making it ever more difficult for people who don't have economic advantages to catch up.'  Dalton Conley, a sociology professor at New York University who has studied how people get ahead, said: 'It moves the clock back when you need connections. It makes it doubly hard for social mobility and equal opportunity, because of the connections that it requires at an earlier age, the financial sacrifices and also the culture savoir-faire.' While half of internships nationwide are paid or have at least a small stipend, according to national surveys conducted by Vault, unpaid internships are concentrated in the most competitive fields, like politics, television and film. 'The more glamorous an internship, the less likely it is paid,' Mr. Oldman said. 'Washington in general has high-demand internships. In most cases they don't have to pay or they don't have to pay much.' "  This is totally true.  It was when I was trolling for summer internships, and now it looks like things have gotten worse.  The problem is that cash-strapped non-profits and government agencies (Congress, White House, etc.) will always offer unpaid internships for two reasons: 1.  They absolutely depend on this labor to function under their limited budgets. and 2. There will always be plenty of people to fill these positions unpaid, like the kids of their wealthy donors.  So having connections leads to more connections, while those who can't afford it are left out.  And anyway, how else would all those envelopes get stuffed?
