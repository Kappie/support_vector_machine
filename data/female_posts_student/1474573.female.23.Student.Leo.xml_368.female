We didn't have much planned, really, but getting an extra day after finding out you're going to be working for the CEO and the owner of the company starting next week was like a breath of fresh air.  Don't get me wrong, I actually really like these fellows, but having them dropped on my lap without discussion was a tad bit annoying.  We're going to work out the kinks on Tuesday...I'll keep y'all posted...  Yesterday, my mother and brother came over for an impromptu barbecue... overall it was uneventful (which is VERY GOOD with my family).  The neighbors came over soon after and we hung out with them in the late afternoon through the evening.  Saw the fireworks in our town which was way cool on many levels.  We were hanging out in the parking lot of a school nearby the park that was doing the show, which meant we were close to the action but not too close to feel like we are going to get hit by something or whatever.  Also, it was just a bunch of towns folks hanging out, drinking coffee with Bailey's and shooting the shit in between ooh's and ahh's... Afterwards we went back to the neighbors house to play this dice game called Pig with them and their two youngest daughters.  It was such a hoot, I tell ya.    Today I went to the mall with the neighbors and their girls to get a new bathing suit and some other shit that I really don't need.  I succeeded in doing just that, ah'thankyou!  Did absolutely nothing else this HOT ASS afternoon except watch a marathon of  urlLink Celebrity Poker Showdown  on Bravo.  Steve and I were glued to the tv!  But anyway, that's about it for the weekend, I guess.  I do have to end this post saying this...and, yeah, I know I have said it a billion times but why not just once more for good measure... I LOVE MY HOUSE, I LOVE MY TOWN, I LOVE MY BLOCK AND I F'IN LOVELOVELOVE MY NEIGHBORS!!  Life ain't really so bad, y'know?    By the way, I still want some more comments for my previous post.  Come on people, categorize yourselves!  It'll be fun!
