Think today, tomorrow and the exam will go well; it's just a matter of doing it.  In my mini-counseling session Thursday with Academic Support Oracle-lady, she said:  "What I'm sensing from talking with you is that you're very aware of what you need to be doing, that you've been keeping up with reading, studying, reviewing all semester, you've been doing everything you're supposed to and you know what you need to do to prepare.  Now you just have to go do it."  That's always the clincher, isn't it?    Watched The Fellowship of the Ring last night.  It's been a while, and it was a nice little refresher.  Seems like forever since I first saw it New Year's Day 2002.  The world was dark and scary, and I was the emotional equivalent of a sniveling-Gollum-like creature, continuously shifting between Smeagol's "Come along, Master, we'll show you the way!" and Gollum's "Murderer!" (I realize those are lines from The Two Towers, just go with it for now.)  Okay, not really, but the swings in my optimism and trust in the universe's plans were huge and frequent.  Frodo's scenes with Gandalf were the best and the worst.  Usually reduced me to tears and uncontrollable wails...right there in the movie theater.    "Shut UP Gandalf!  You.Don't.Know!!"  But knowing he really did.  So it was interesting to watch it again and look back, now that I'm on the journey I was afraid to take then.  The thing that really struck me was how all the characters thought their jobs were done in the first hour and a half.  They all get to Rivendell and think that's it.  They have no idea what they're actually about to do.  Or maybe they do and are trying to talk themselves out of that knowing.    Then we get to The Towers and it's all downhill from there.  I really didn't intend this post to be a treatise in comparing the Lord of the Rings to my life, but what the hell.  The day's gray and wet, a good one for studying...
