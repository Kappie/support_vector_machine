I t was really hot yesterday and my church was packed as we ahd 3 christianings and 3 comfirmations so we all spent time sweating it out. I sawone of my nephews on saturday along with my brother and girlfriend. Micheal is really getting big now and is crawling everywhere, he is trying to walk but hasn't quite got there yet. I am hpefully going to be spending the day with my nephews tommorow and then going to watch oldham in the first home match of the season. They need a win or they will be at the bottom of the table as they have already lost one match. Soul in the city went great from what i have heard from people and God has really seemed to have moved through London. Soul survivor is happening next week so if anyone is going to that have fun. I leave for athens on sunday, i'm quite nervous because i don't like flying and there is a high terroist threat but i'm sure God will keep me safe and i am going to try and make the most of the experience and enjoy watching the olympic events.  God Bless  Katie
