We've all been pretty worried about Brandi; yesterday morning, she got up because she felt pretty bad.  She must have fainted, because she woke up after hitting the floor.  The local doctor seems to think that it was probably a slight seizure, and increased her medication a bit.        This morning, she had a meeting with Dr. Fitzgerald--the neurosurgeon who performed Brandi's first brain surgery (and gave us the original horrific news about her brain tumor being the most malignant).  Dr. Fitzgerald thinks that Brandi should have radiation as soon as possible to remove the remaining 10% of the tumor, but Dr. Sawaya and Yung at M.D. Anderson wanted to hold off on that; you can have only so much radiation during one's life, and they don't want her to regress in her speech therapy right before starting her teaching job.  What's frustrating is that M.D. Anderson, the top cancer center in the world, is arguing with the pathologists at Methodist hospital regarding exactly what to do about Brandi's tumor.  It's an extremely rare one, and I don't think anyone knows exactly sure what to expect.  But the doctors at M.D. Anderson are the ones that removed a majority of the tumor--and they also gave Brandi a completely different diagnosis than Methodist (benign vs. the most malignant).  Overall, I'm going with their expertise, though Dr. Fitzgerald has been wonderful in helping us out.  As Aunt Rite put it, she's thinking of the glass as half empty, while M.D. Anderson thinks of it as half full.          So today was the first day in 2 months that Brandi had any negative news whatsoever about her brain, and I know that bothered her quite a bit.  She wants to feel that she's normal again, and can take on the world.  I don't care what the doctors say--I know that Brandi will overcome these temporary pains, headaches, and set-backs, and she will be the best kindergarten teacher in Texas.        Today is my Aunt Rite's birthday, and all her old co-workers at Brookwood threw her a big party at Los Amigos.  She had no idea that everyone was going to be there, which is funny b/c news gets around this town in a heartbeat.  It was definitely the pick-me-up that she and Brandi needed.        I've been so wrapped up with family and moving that I'm just now realizing that I'm leaving soon.  Exciting, but scary at the same time.        I need to write this stuff down, or I'll forget it:       Call Richmond Bone and Spine Center regarding Mimi's water therapy  Call Tulane's Financial Aid Office  Go to Walmart to pick up supplies for Cuba  Change driver's license address online    Pay bills  Start making packing list
