Someone out there must seriously hate me, to punish me with long hours of thinking about the terrible, tedious things that go on in my life... Yes, someone out there, whether they be human, animal, or an unknown creature, surely dislikes me.    For some reason, the topic of religion is bouncing about in my mind right now. As a Roman Catholic I am supposed to believe that Jesus is my savior and that God created the world and it took him seven days... Yet, every day I find myself questioning my faith more and more. There are so many flaws in the stories told in the Bible. On several websites, I have read people's answers to other people's questions about God and they have written on how you're not supposed to take the Bible literally... Sorry to say, I want a religion that I can take literally, I'm not all that good at reading inbetween the lines...   I have SO many questions on the Roman Catholic religion. First of all, where did God come from? He couldn't have been there all along? And something can't come from nothing... And the Arc story... There are over a billion different species of animals on this Earth... How in world could he fit two of every one of them onto one Arc? Sorry but it's not scientifically possible...    Most of you religious freaks (no offence of course) are probably thinking that I am one of those scientist people who believe in evolution or the Big Bang Theory... I'm not. I don't really believe in any science theories about how everything was created... To me, they are as impossible as some things written in the Bible.    I'm not exactly sure what I believe in. I do know that I do not believe in God... All I really want to know is the truth of our existence. Actually, I don't think I do. There are some things that people should just not know. Sure, it is fun to guess, but hey, what's the point? I guess I don't really believe in religion. I think that other people do because they find it nice to imagine a world after death... It's not so scary to die if you know that you're going somewhere afterwards... Oh, well...    I'm outie.
