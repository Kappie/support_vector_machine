I realized, after a few listens, that I may want to start listening to the track list a few times, tinkering with songs and such before actually calling it good.  Never was one who came by revisions naturally.  And so, for months, I resigned myself to the fact that I'm not a good mixer.  Decided to leave that to The Boy and just help with brainstorming possibilities.    But, as promised, that not-too-forgotten pang of creation, the one that's been rolling around in the back of my mind for over a month, finally took hold; just not in the form I was expecting.    But hey, I'll take it.  And now, it's in Sam on its maiden playing.  iTunes doesn't mess around, I tell ya what!  3 minutes, tops.  Jeez!    Madge's "Intervention" didn't make the cut, even though I was dead-set on it yesterday.  But as Stephen King once wrote, we sometimes have to kill our favorite babies for the sake of greatness.  It still doesn't have a title, which is a bit odd, but don't think it'll stay that way for long.  Any suggestions?
