I was tossing and turning, thinking, listening to the fireworks and my parents blasting the tv, until about 4am. Of course some of that stuff drained out like the fireworks and the tv. That was horrible.   This morning I wasn't woken up by the alarm I must have set wrong. I was wakin up by my mom saying "Shouldn't you be up by now" I glance at the clock to see that it was 6:00am. Emily had come to my house at 5:55am and thought I forgot about work and left me here. Still half asleep, I run around the house trying to get ready. Which I did get done in 15mins. My mom offered to drive me, and woke my dad up so he could drive.   I get to work on time thank gawd, but I'm still tired as hell from getting only 2 hours of sleep. I got to work in luggage. I asked people what color their baggage tags were, and SO many people discribed their actual bag, or I'd say "Hi, which color baggage tag to you have?" their responce would be "H". So I'd have to look it up and send them off in the direction of the bags with that tag color which was usually packed full of other confused people.   YES! Finally done with that...15 mins til check-in. Check-in isn't too bad. It hurts to stand on concrete for 8-10 hours, and when people don't have all of their information filled out. That sucks because you have to sit there and wait 600 years before they are done, and then tell them what they did wrong.  Of course, at peak hours the computers go DOWN. That's always fun to deal with. Checking everyone in manually. The passengers are usually okay with it. Then there are some that are like "What...computers...they did what? how? can you fix it right now?" lol. Well I'm gonna go..  ~Bayz
