I don't even want to get online anymore because I can't stand talking to you. You hurt me so badly over and over again and I just can't take it anymore. I want to be friends with you, I really do but I just can't do it right now. I'm sorry. I'll come talk to you when I'm ready to talk. Just let me have this healing time that I need and then we can be friends. I don't know how long this will take but, and this is a promise, I'll talk to you as soon as I'm ready to. How could I not be friends with you? You are the one thing that made me happy and made me want to wake up in the morning for a year and a half. Don't ever forget that. I hope you are happy, I really do because that's all I could ever hope for you. Even as unhappy as I am all I want for you is to be happy. And remember, no matter what happens, I'll always love you (as a friend only) and I'll always be there.  You know those people that say they hate everything but you know they don't mean it? Well, I'm not one of them. I truly do hate everything and everyone for screwing me over so badly that it's practically unbearable.  I don't even want to talk about what I've been doing because it's not worth it. I fill my time flirting with random guys that I meet and don't even care anymore. Look at how pathetic I've become.  Sure, I have my fun, but when I look back on it, a second of fun doesn't compare to the hours of hurt, loneliness, anger, and crying I've gone through to get to this place. I look in the mirror and don't even know who I am anymore. I'm not the person I once knew. Looks like it's time for some major soul searching.  It's time for a change, a big change. I can't go on living like this. I deserve to be happy as much as any girl does. (Why can't I believe what I'm typing right now?) Steps to change: Step 1: Have fun at the concert on Sunday with Carol, Kate, Mike, Bill, and Allison and don't think about you-know-who at all. Step 2: Cut hair. And I'm thinking drastic. Maybe even dying it. Step 3: Just have fun and go places. Don't mope around all day feeling sorry for myself. Step 4: Smile on the outside even when I'm crying on the inside. I don't ever want to be conceived as weak ever again. I am stronger than you think I am and I can handle anything anyone throws at me. Step 5: Just continue to love life even if it sucks ass. Step 6: New wardrobe and get license and car by the end of the summer.  I have a feeling that I'm only going to be posting around once a week now, twice at the most. And I'm going to start posting some things I write. That is if I remember.  Countdown to concert: 6 days Countdown to Molly's party:12 days Countdown to Carol and Kim's party: 14 days Countdown to first day of preseason for field hockey: 17 days (?)  And I'd like to thank all of my friends, especially Carol, Kim, and Molly, for helping me realize that life doesn't always have to suck and that I can be happy again. And thank you so much for always being there. I love all of you so much.  The world doesn't stop when I'm depressed. Life goes on and days go by and I shouldn't waste those precious days feeling as bad as I have been lately.  No matter how bad things get, it's not the end of the world. The sun  will  rise tomorrow and everything will eventually be alright again.  Listening to: [Time And Time Again by Chronic Future]  Inspiring, shining, rising And when you're in my way I'm not dividing me from you cause we're working together Perfect in its splendor like the currents of the weather The splinter in my center hindering all of my pleasure Is me manifested as you in this endeavor Once responsibility is taken I can render Experience to be however I want to remember  Time and time again we fall in to the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find  Put yourself through the scariest of scenarios Enter experiences you normally wouldn't dare to go It's all for the character and the aroogant afterglow Of knowing it's appearance according to your patterns of growth And what your parents handed down to you to handle Make sure you carry torches when their puttin out your candles Prediction can be unkind but unwind them still Don't erase the part of you that's responsible for your will  Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what wou're trying to find  Well I've seen you and those things you do And the way you hide that shadow can't be good for you Your dark defines your light There's some utterly damaged particles to deal with And if I stutter I'm sorry but it's hard to feel swift When stuck in my stomach is a cannon ball anchor to life I've been pushing it down pretending it doesn't exist Well this is what happens when you're pissed about being pissed You dig yourself so deep you resist just to resist And there's no way to get back experiences you missed So start right now today and risk furiousness for bliss  Time and time again we fall into the depths of who we are But you can't keep running away from what you're trying to find
