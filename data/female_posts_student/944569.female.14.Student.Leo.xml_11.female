The expression i used above is a hy-per-bo-le ( u know, watching anime 24/7).  I have a life u know.  I bicycle, read books, type stories and study (no i dont). hmmmm... Does anyone here actually watch anime here or am i a stick in the mud? Love Hina? Inu Yasha? Ranma? Prince of Tennis? Read or Die?  CardCaptor Sakura? Any of these sound familiar? well, i know u know Cardcaptors everyone does, but i am talking about the real thing.  CardCaptors SUCK! CardCaptor Sakura is a lot better cuz it hasnt been changed into a lame, sappy cartoon that everyone hates.  Ok that's it.  I'm done 4 the day. Peace out.  animedreamer
