Kurama: When did you get here?   Dais: You should have known it wouldn't be long, I don't trust Baka with you.   Baka: *blinks a couple of times* ...Right...   Um...anyway...everybody, this is my cousin Dais. She's a demon and she can control fire. *puts arm over Dais' shoulder*   *Dais grabs Baka's wrist and twists her arm behind Baka's back*   Baka: *has a look of both shock and pain on face* Ow...   *Dais lets go*   Baka: I don't know how temperamental Khala is, but I definetely know that Daisuko is double that! She not only has one spiteful personality, but two!
