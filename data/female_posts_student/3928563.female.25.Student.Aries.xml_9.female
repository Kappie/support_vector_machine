I feel like this must be related how regularly I have sex, but since I haven't dated anyone and had regular sex for a really long time, I'm unsure. The pain isnâ€™t inside, definitely on the surface, like the skin right around the entrance to the vagina. What do you think? Do I just have to suck it up and get over it?  -------------------------------------------------  I've definitely had mid-sex soreness before, especially with those special boys who just seem to last and last. I think you're probably suffering from too much friction. A lack of lubrication and a tight fit are the two main culprits in this horrible scenario.  The easiest culprit to vanquish is insufficient  lubrication . Even if you think you're using enough lube, sex with condoms (you  are  using condoms, right?) can get awfully tacky. Those rubber things just seem to suck all the moisture out of you. Try the following:   a) use lots of lube. Reapply a few times, and give a good dose of saliva to the proceedings in between (spit in your hand, apply to cock, repeat);  b) pause for some gooey head every 10 minutes or so (for you or him);  c) if you are using glycerin-free lube because you are scared of yeast infections, try switching back to a lube with glycerin. Sadly, glycerin-free just isn't as slippery. One lube to look out for is  O'My , my personal favorite. It has some glycerin, but some natural antifungals to combat yeast, too.   Solving a tight fit:  if you're a bit small like me (which definitely can happen if you're not having sex often, which I'm not) friction seems to be more of an issue. Sometimes all the lube in the world just wouldn't be enough, and sex involves way more pain than it should. You can try any of these tips:  a) switch positions to something that allows for less vigorous thrusting and less deep penetration (you on top, for example, or from behind but with both of you lying on your sides);  b) limit vaginal intercourse to 10-15 minutes at a time and while the rest of the time away giving head to each other;  c) remember that you are a delicate flower, and that some parts of you are naturally more delicate than others. There's nothing wrong with a little finesse--unless you like it rough, of course;  d) incorporate more penetration into your everyday masturbation routine. I think doctors like to call this "dilation," and it WORKS. It does take some dedication, though. You have to be willing to fuck yourself (GENTLY) with fingers, veggies, or dildos at least a couple of times a week. When I was working through my own vaginal pain problems, I started with a buttplug-- because it was conical, I didn't have to force a big fake penis head into my poor little lady. After I could get all the way to the end of the plug (and this took a few months), I invested in a size small dildo--as smooth as I could find. Eventually I worked up to a pretty big, very attractive glittery orange guy. You have to be patient, though!   Most of all, you must to think positive and sexy thoughts about your vagina and the dildos you're using. That's because this condition called "vaginismus" really aggravates vaginal pain. Basically, your VERY strong vaginal muscles, once they start associating pain with intercourse, tend to tense up whenever you try to talk to them about having sex. Sadly for you, those tense muscles contract, block off the first third of your vagina, and make intercourse even HARDER and MORE painful. You have to seduce those muscles and make them feel at home with strangers in your poon. Try alternately tensing and relaxing them to gain control, Kegels style (one way to practice contractions is to make like you're stopping a big dump and a big pee at the same time...then relax slowly out of it).  I hope this helps, dear reader. I also want to caution you that vaginal pain can be a symptom of underlying health conditions. This includes mild yeast infections (where you wouldn't notice the symptoms) and some sexually transmitted infections. So get thee to a doctor for a checkup, just in case. And remember, you're not alone! I believe pain with intercourse is one of the most prevalent and least talked-about sexual problems of our time. Fuck Viagra, let's talk about making sex with men better for women.
