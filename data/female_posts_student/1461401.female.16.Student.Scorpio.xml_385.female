In the morning I got to go help mom with the medieval fair (cassie you dirty liar you never came!) and all the kids thought I was sooo pretty in my dress. Then after that I got to go visit steven at boyscout camp, and I've come to a conclusion. I wanna be a boy scout!!!!! Camp Pioneer is soooooo beautiful, it's not fair! And they have all kinds of fun things to do, it puts camp Libby to shame. TO SHAME!!! His mom, meara and I had to leave early though because meara was running a temperature. I was really sad that I had to leave, but I really really hope meara's better. But yeah, it was fun to see him again since I'm leaving tomorrow and won't see him (or anyone else for that matter) for like two weeks! Oh well, vermont, she calls to me. *says in cheesy french accent* As for now, however, I am very tired, and looking forward (ha) to a full day of packing. But at least I'm in a good mood. Yes, I feel good today.    ~Kristin    (Later)  Or at least, I  did .
