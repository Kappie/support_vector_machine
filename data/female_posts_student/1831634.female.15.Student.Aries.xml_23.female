I do hope he doesn't go talk to jack.  I do hope that if he does, jack will think him an idiot.  oh holy crap.  this is a potentially explosive situation here.  jack likes perfume.  or, according to him, only that one kind.  okay.  he's gay.  right.  anyways, I don't seem to be in a blogging mood right now.  I keep writing kailing notes.  and I want to call meng, but my mom's on the phone with her mom.  my grandmom.  grandmom.  lol.  she's too conservative of a person to be a grandmom.  she's the pricipal of a school.  she's a grandmother.  lol.  wahahahaha.  anyways.  both my grandmothers are principals, actually...  tho the one on my dad's side is definitely 100% a grandma.  or maybe even a granny.  anyways.  my fingers are all stained now with the markers.  lol.  I'm so careless.  now.  for some interesting parts of my convo with jack!  beD XTC: you really suck dilapidatedshack: oh! dilapidatedshack: did you tell ning she sucked? dilapidatedshack: because she was really confused beD XTC: it was spaz dilapidatedshack: spaz? beD XTC: I did it to like 10 ppl in the hall dilapidatedshack: .... dilapidatedshack: you are really really strange beD XTC: she let me borrow paper for the dbq beD XTC: =) dilapidatedshack: ... dilapidatedshack: and so.... she sucks?  beD XTC: Mrs. Campo is going to hate me beD XTC: =) dilapidatedshack: and you're happy...? beD XTC: sure beD XTC: why not dilapidatedshack: lol beD XTC: I hat eher too  dilapidatedshack: guess what? beD XTC: hm/ dilapidatedshack: I got an 88 on my stupid math test dilapidatedshack: because the teacher told us that the second part was so much harder than the first part dilapidatedshack: and it turned out to be so much easier dilapidatedshack: so all three questions I missed were on the first part dilapidatedshack: the first three questions of the test beD XTC: hahahahaha beD XTC: lol beD XTC: I got another 100 dilapidatedshack: .... dilapidatedshack: argh dilapidatedshack: you annoy me sometimes beD XTC: lol  beD XTC: why the hell is there a reading assignment? dilapidatedshack: because... dilapidatedshack: they want you to read? beD XTC: screw stanton  haha.  there we go.  that buffered up this pathetic entry.  lol.  am still worrying over the potential explosive situation of my neopets userlookup.  =/  ++sunny
