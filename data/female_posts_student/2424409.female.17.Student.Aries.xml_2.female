I heard that word almost1 year ago, but its still in progress... my parents separated about 2 and a half years ago now, and it was a good thing, but that doesn't make it easy to deal with.. I mean there's kids involved, ones that get caught in the middle, there is a lying father, who tries to be there now that he's not part of their lives and a mother who does everything in her power to keep her kids safe, even though she only works1 job, and if it wasn't for child and spousal support, she'd never be home. But no matter how every 1 tells me divorce is a good thing, I can't help thinking that there is an easier way, its not that I want my parents to get back together or anything, its just that if my dad could see how his lies and deciet are hurting his kids, then maybe he'd understand that we love him (even if we don't like him at times) and maybe he'd see that we have good reason for not liking his girlfriend...for example, we may like her if she hadn't ended a 4 year friendship with my mom, rudelyI might add, and kept my father and her's realtionship a secret, which hurt the kids in the long run, because she wouldn't have my brother for the weekend as she was guilty for hooking up with my dad, then maybe we would try to tollerate her, but she took this family for a ride, and deserves every look we give her, good or bad, thats the price you pay, and she has to except that.  And it doesn't help my dad by putting his girlfriend in front of his kids, which he's proven, by saying we have to tollerate her, and that he won't goa weekend without her, and the fact that he gets home on weekends and spends them with his girlfriend instead of calling his kids or comming to see them for a couple hours...I know what your saying, some people have every right to see their boy/girl friend, but not at the expense of blowing off his kids....my brother and sister are gonna rebel one of these days, and there isn't a damn thing he'll be able to do about it.  well i gtg, leaving  ttyl  ME!!
