"Hello Miss Cai, this is Tom Baker from British Gas and we are conducting a survey on - " "No sorry I have no time please don't ring back later I'm sorry good bye." She cuts in hastily. Five minutes later. *Ring ring* "Hello?" "Jane!! It's me, Naz Baz.. Do you wanna go to Mike's party on Saturday? Remember to bring a partner! Oh my god and I'm finally going out with james!! And - " "Erm maybe sorry I can't talk now somebobdy important might be trying to get through you know what i'll call you later ok bye."  Ten minutes later.  *Ring ring* "Hello?"

"No, sure, that would be great." "Oh. ok," he says with a grin that shows through his voice.
