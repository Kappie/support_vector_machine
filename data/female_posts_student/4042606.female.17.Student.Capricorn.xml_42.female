As the clouds in the distance were forming, not the usual dark gray that a normal heavy thunderstorm would have; the clouds were pure black, as if someone sucked the very light out of them. There was no light no shine, no hope that a normal cloud would bring. The only thing that these clouds brought was an ominous feeling, and a sinking in your stomach. 	As the sun was beginning to be covered by the black sheet of clouds, a police car moved down the empty road towards the beach houses. There were calls the night before of screams coming from Isabel Katertil’s summer home. In the car there was Sheriff Wallace Gleyson, the most honorable man in town some called him. Sheriff Gleyson had always been liked ever since he arrived in the town 6 years ago. He moved up here when his mother became deathly ill, as he was up here he needed a way to pay the bills, so he joined the Sheriff’s department. His mother died 4 months after his arrival, he just never left. 	In the seat next to him was Deputy Mark Carls. Deputy Carls was not only Sheriff Gleyson’s partner but was also his best friend, he was particularly worried, because calls were coming in that there were screams coming from his girlfriends beach house. That is where he wanted to go the night before, but Sheriff Gleyson needed him down at the docks to help tie down boats. Isabel was always worrying that Mark would get hurt; he never thought it would be the other way around. 	“You shouldn’t worry Mark, you know Isabel knows how to take care of herself, she was probably just frightened that the power was out” Sheriff Gleyson said as he turned and looked at Mark. 	“I never thought I would be the one worrying about Isabel… She was always the one telling me to be careful, and now we get a call to her house” replied Mark without even showing a hint of emotion. 	“Mark, she is alright. Trust me” Sheriff finally said after a period of silence. And he then turned into Isabel’s drive way, and parked right beside her station wagon. 	The two officers stepped out of the car only to see no motion in the yard. Not only that, but, there was not a person on the street or any sign of life in the entire neighborhood. 	“It’s nearing noon, and I don’t see anybody Wallace” Mark said with a worried look on his face as he quickly looked around the street. 	“I don’t want to make you worry, but, this whole week has been strange” replied the Sheriff as he walked up the steps of Isabel’s summer home. 	“Isabel! Isabel! Are you in there?” Mark screamed as he banged on the front door. 	Sheriff Gleyson decided to take a look around the back of the home. Wallace slowly walked across the deck and looked down the side of the building, where the deck continued until it reached the back of the house, were it ended in stairs down to the beach. 	The Sheriff slowly made his way across the wooden patio and peeked in the windows as he made his way out back. As he was walking he could here his Deputy Mark screaming out front, still banging on the front door. 	Wallace looking around for any sign of anything found his eyes wondering to the wooden floor as he made his way to the back porch. What he saw, was a dark stain, as if a puddle of some sort had laid stagnant for a extended period of time. 	“Mark! Mark! You might want to come back here and see this!” the Sheriff yelled as he kneeled down to get a better look at the stain. 	“What is it? Did you find Isabel?” Mark frantically yelled as he ran around the house. 	“I couldn’t even break through the front door, it’s like something is leaning up against it!” Mark continued to say as he reached the Sheriff on the back porch. 	Mark looked down at the stain, and kneeled down with the Sheriff, as he looked, he face went pale and he looked at Wallace. 	“That’s blood!” Mark exclaimed as he quickly stood up and looked at the porch door. 	“Hold on Isabel! I’m coming in!” saying that, Mark jumped into the porch door and busted right through. 	Deputy Carls went through the door surprisingly easily, as if the door had been broken down earlier and had been placed back in its original spot. As Mark went through his feet hit something, and he hit the kitchen floor hard. Mark lay on the floor moaning for a brief moment, and then realized where he was again. He put both hands on the floor and propped himself up and looked around the kitchen. He then felt something on his hands, like it was sticky or just had been mopped. He looked down at his hands to find a red fluid all over him. The focus of his eyes then went from his blood soaked hand to the rest of the kitchen floor. 	As Deputy Carls went through the door Sheriff Gleyson quickly moved in after him and got a good look at his surroundings. The first thing that he noticed was the entire kitchen floor was covered in blood. This sparked him to withdraw his gun from its holster. 	“Mark stand up now” Wallace whispered as he pointed his gun towards the hallway. 	“It’s blood Wallace! What’s happening” Mark said in paranoia, usually Mark was very professional about situations. Today though, he was not ready to handle anything. 	“Get a hold of yourself Mark, I’m sure there is a reasonable explanation for this” Wallace explained, but, in his own mind he had no hope that Isabel was still alive. 	The Sheriff and his distraught Deputy slowly made their way down the hallway with their guns drawn; their destination was the front door. To discover why Deputy Carls was unable to break through, and hopefully find Isabel alive. 	They made their way down the hallway, sometimes looking at each other. Sometimes checking doorways to see if there was anything there, but, as they made their way further down the hallway, they knew they were not alone. As the Sheriff was leading he put his hand straight up, signaling that they were to stop. He pointed his handgun at the front door which was not very well lit. The shades were all pulled, and a gloomy yellow light was radiating through the whole house. It began to get darker as the sun was finally blocked out by the looming black clouds. 	Mark looked over Wallace’s shoulder to see what he was pointing his gun at and why they had stopped moving, when he saw a figure standing at the front door. Facing them, the figure did not move. Only standing there looking back at them; Mark couldn’t make out who it was, or if it was male or female. All he knew was the whole situation was scaring him, and he just wanted to find Isabel. 	As they stood there in silence Sheriff Wallace finally spoke up and said “Hey you! Put your hands on your head and identify yourself immediately”. 	The figure made no acknowledgement of hearing the Sheriff and continued to stand there. 	“I am not going to say this again! Put your hands on your head and identify yourself now!” the Sheriff yelled now apparently irritated. 	“Do what the Sheriff says!” Mark then broke his silence and yelled after the Sheriff. 	The figure then made a slight movement, as if it was growing tired and had to shift its wait from standing in the same spot for to long. 	“I will shoot if you do not follow my orders!” the Sheriff finally yells as he stares at the figure with extreme interest. 	Mark then pointed his gun at the figures leg and readied himself to fire upon it. 	Then as the stand off continued, and Marks finger started to press on the trigger, a bolt of lighting hit somewhere close by and in the flash the two police officers closed their eyes from the bright flash, and when they opened them, the figure that had been standing at the front door for five minutes was gone in a flash.
