In a response that I have not yet heard from others, and one I felt myself, but couldn't articulate, she writes:   The pictures that television appropriately mostly did not show and the Internet inevitably mostly did were horrifying in a way that was reminiscent of the first still pictures of the Trade Center victims of 9/11. It was like seeing people in business suits falling through the air again. It was as if someone pointed a camera at evil and actually caught it in the act.   It goes without saying that I see this as more evidence that we need to continue the fight.  No one said it was going to be easy, and here's more proof that it isn't.  But the only things worth fighting for sometimes are the difficult battles.  And this is perhaps the most important and difficult battle at all.  I'm not even sure it can be completely won.  But still, all that can be done must be done.  Sides must be taken.  In this, the President is right.  This isn't the time for nuance, for rationalization.  It is a time for action.  Carefully, thoughtfully planned action, of course, but action nonetheless.  Things like this must be stopped.  I do not know how many reports of such violence, from whatever part of the world they might occur, and upon whatever group of people they might be perpetrated, that I can bear being witness to.  We are all witnesses, and we must never forget that which it is we are fighting for.  I witnessed 9/11 firsthand.  I heard the loud boom and felt the low rumble as the planes went into the towers, and I looked out of my window, and I witnessed the towers on fire.  I was impacted personally in such a small way - aside from seeing it personally, I was inconvenienced so slightly, in comparison to what others went through, in comparison to the victims and their families.  But I felt so much anger afterwards, and a part of it was specifically based on having seen the event.  And that anger has never gone away.  It has settled, so that it is like a numb pain that every now and again rises to the surface.  Every time I see something like this, despite not witnessing it firsthand, I get a little resurge of that anger.    This is why I worry that Americans are getting complacent, because I see the evidence of it, yet I don't and can't possibly understand how it could happen.  I suspect that some of it is a defense mechanism, because it is still too painful and difficult for a lot of people to even talk about 9/11.  But I think some discomfort is to be had by all, especially given that there are men and women out there right now fighting for us, specifically because of 9/11.  So I have deliberately not pushed it out of my mind.  It is not always on the surface of my consciousness, but it indeed haunts all my thoughts.  It is always with me, even if it goes unspoken.  I can only hope that others feel the same way, and that they are just not openly expressing their feelings, yet they are bubbling below the surface, and they are conscious of all that has happened - and that, even if they don't agree that this war is the answer, they will never, ever forget why it is being faught.
