I think for the month of May I have about a hundred...It's terrible.  But now enough talking! The photos:    I was sort of playing around with macro...I dunno. It's an okay picture, I guess. I took several shots of the flowers that grow near our house...this was one of the better ones, I think.    This was sort of accidental...I didn't mean to get such a close up, haha. I was trying to get my dog, Molly, to sit still but ended up with this. Thought it made for a very interesting and amusing picture!   So there's some pictures...I'll put up a few of my town later on if I can't sleep...I was supposed to a few nights ago, but those who know me well know that I forget to do stuff. A lot.  "I'm really gonna have to get up a webpage for my photos soon..." thought the procrastinator.
