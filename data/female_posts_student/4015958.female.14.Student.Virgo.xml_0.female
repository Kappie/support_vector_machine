Ok, I need to stop making these lame excuse to make me feel more secure and feel like he still cares, when deep down I know he doesnt. I need to let this all go. When I do finally see him or at least talk to him. I'm teling him off. He deserves it. I keep thinking i'm gonna do this but I know that's wrong too. He'll probably give me some lame reasoning, say something sweet, and i'll forgive him. No! I'm not doing that. Not this time. I just need to remember he doesnt deserve me, because he doesnt. Oh, this is all just making me so angry. But i'm hessitant to talk to anyone about this because who knows if it'll make me sound like a fool. Oh, but who am I kidding, I'm acting like one. Come on, I'm just being an idiot. Well, I wish i could solve this, but I can't. I could try to start something with someone else, but what good is that gonna do? It'll make me feel good for like a second, and then i'll feel guilty about cheating on Andrew. Oh well...      ~*  D  ANIELLE   C   AILA  *~
