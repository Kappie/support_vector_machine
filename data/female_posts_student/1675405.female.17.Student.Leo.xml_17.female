Ahh! The frustration!  I got my paycheck yesterday, and although I am requiring myself to save half of it for a car (if I ever get past being lethargic and actually go get my permit), I have like $80 for homecoming.   I iced my wrist all weekend, and I thought that it would be somewhat healed by now, but I guess I thought wrong. My forehands suck, and if I get 4th at NECs on Saturday, I think that would just be too bad. I have expectations for myself, and I worked too hard this season to let it slip out of my grasp!  But yeah, other than that things are good. I'm making a lot of new friends, and I have so much fun at school these days!
