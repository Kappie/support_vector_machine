I hate food ave. and that is the only thing that they are scheduling me as anymore.  Wait, I am a cashier tomorrow for three and a half hours.  Big woppie.  Then I work Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sun, Mon, Tues, Wed. and then vacation!!!!  Going to South Carolina for like 6 days.  So that should be awesome. Nick, Ashley, and her bf Tommy were over here last night.  Tommy cooked... he is such a good cook and we watched some movies.  After Tommy and Ashley left, Nick and I hung out for a while.  We used to date last year for like 6 or 7 months and it had appeared last night that we were going to start up again.  Which would be awesome... cause I like him a lot.  But, he wants us to start out as friends and then build up to a relationship.  Which totally makes sense, cause that was probably what screwed us up in the last relationship.  I am just scared that I am going to be "hung out to dry" as you might say.  All of my past relationships after Nick's were... we would go and hang out, kiss, and it would appear that they really liked me.  They all led me on.  Which blows, but hey thats life.  And it always ended with, well.. "I don't want a relationship right now" or "I am too busy".  Yea, you weren't too busy when you were over here the past four or five days.  Errrrrrrrrrr.  I just really don't want that to happen with Nick.  And he is scared too... I do know that.  So, I will wait for him.  He means the world to me and I would do anything for him.  And Nick, if you are reading this I hope that you realize how much you mean to me.  And we will do the friendship thing, I know that it will be hard for both of us... but I also believe that it will be good for us. And you better not forget to give me a call whenever you get off tonight!  :-)
