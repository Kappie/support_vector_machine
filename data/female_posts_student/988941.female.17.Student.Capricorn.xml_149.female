Most of my grades from last year have gone down but i beleive that is cause last yea it was what we were attaingin in lessons not in bloddy exams when your under pressure ! I think these acedemic review days are a total waste of time espically for ur parents cause most of the time they just sit there and dont acually say anything unless they have a load of questions to ask. I got a phone call half way through my interview but me being good ignored it ! This years targets are to improve my science result to a B and to make a Structured revision plan and STICK to it ! lol Sod both of those targets ! Anyway enough said about bloodly school, i went to the cinema today to see catch me if you can, no offence nicki but it was quite boring although the storyline was good, it lacked action in my opinion but some films are like that so im not gonna complain. Question for you all : Who do you think you are most likely to stay in contact with after we leave school? For me probably Darren buts thats cause we live so close to each other Anyway byebye
