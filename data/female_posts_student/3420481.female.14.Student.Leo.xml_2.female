So I went only to realize that Kirsten was sick today. No fun. Actually it really was fun I just missed Kirsten. Kirsten... you have to come to school tomorrow no matter what. So I went to first hour science with the bitch Mrs. Thompson. She's such a ditz. Are rapid and fast the same thing? Because I got one marked down because I had fast and not rapid. Duh she's got some issues. I mean she has a little kid lunch box. And flower pens. What a geek. I'm sure she thinks she's cool though. Second hour foods was fun besides the fact that the MCs really got to me and I could barely stand up. I couldn't cook. We made these rice krispie treat things. We also got to eat the banana pineapple freezies we made on Friday. I think I aced my math test third hour. It was really easy. I got a bit confused on one part but I think I did it right now that I think about it harder. Fourth hour is health. We've started our values and choices unit. God kill me now. Today we learned about dating. Hello... it's not like we haven't dated already. Lunch was kinda boring. My MCs came back full throttle again so I felt pretty crappy. During chorus I didn't sing because my voice kept giving out. I just lipped the words mostly. When I got sick I just read my book. She doesn't really care what we do. She's a cool one. Sixth hour was gym. We had to do the bowling ball toss. I sucked... I think I got four feet. What a record! NOT! English with Flanagan was seventh hour. We watched a movie today. I wrote down this site for Tiffy but unfortunately I left it in his room and when I walked by eighth hour from Social Studies it wasn't on my desk. Oh no! I hope he respects my privacy and doesn't come. I'd be pretty happy if that would be the case. So that leaves social studies. It was pretty boring. We watched CNN and had to write a type one on it. Spare me the writing... PLEASE! After school we had track practice. We like did absolutely nothing and the time went by so slowly because we wanted to go see how the birds were doing. They are doing okay but I think one is going to die because it won't eat and it's really mellow. It barely even moves. We named one Pip. Pip is the hyper one who likes to jump out of the basket we put him in. The other two really don't have names yet. Our hobo party wasn't really a hobo party. Everyone was gone by the time I got there. I felt really bad. I hope they had fun without me. This was like our final hobo party and now I feel really sad. Katlyn was still here when I got here though. We took pictures for the Eighth Grade Recognition Ceremony. Wow do I look very ugly in them. Then at like 5:30 Kristine brought the birds down for some fresh air. They seemed pretty hyper and happy about that. When Katlyn and Kristine left I came inside and fiddled on the computer. I also ate dinner and watched T.V. I watched Colonial House on PBS. I'm kinda into all the olden day stuff. It just seems cool.  We had like a major storm during it though. Trent called me and said he needed someone to talk to because his computer shut down and his electricity kept gowing on and off. Apparently his basketball hoop was like spinning around in circles because of the wind. He also said that a tree limb like hit his house. I'd be terrified. And he was the only one there too. How scary? Katlyn told me at lunch that she thought Trent was going to ask me to the recognition dance. You know. I think I'd say yes if he asked me. I really do think I still like him. I just don't want to have to ask him. I'm sick of doing all the asking. But I really do still like him as a boyfriend. I wonder if he will ask me. Now I'm getting all excited. Okay I need to stop now.
