When you are done posting, and you are in the text box hit "Tab" "Enter" and it brings you to a different screen where you can put other nifty things in. I do not know, maybe it is something old that I just discovered, again because I am slow...   Whatever.   Today I woke up early, called my mom to discuss a very important issue, then headed out to McLean's park. I walked up to the summit and then waded around in the brook. It was sort of cold, but it felt wicked good on my feet. Then, sprawled out in the parking lot on a towel doing the shorts/bikini top things in order to tan a bit. The heat of the sun was so relaxing.  Then, basketball. I have not lost my touch :-D I was proud of that. Again, napped in the sun a bit. That is why I sleep with my space heater. Something about direct heat on my back or something, it is just relaxing. I know something else that would relax me and finally allow me a truely good nights sleep, but that may take a while. I am willing to wait.   Last of the precalculus final tomorrow, this is good. I am looking forward to it! I am getting out of school early tomorrow :-D. Hopefully I will be on my way to Boston with Robbie and whomever else. After I get there they can do whatever. I just want to see my certain someone :-D. This means that I am going to spent the night cleaning, but that is okay  Not sure what else to post. Had a pretty good phone conversation with Tycho. I was so happy to hear his wonderful voice again, I missed it immensely!  Have a good one,  -J9
