Then Carol, Kate, Danielle, Sarah, Heather, Kayla, Bill, Mike, James, and I all went to Grandes for lunch. After that Kate, Carol, and I went back to Kate's house for a second and almost got killed by Bill throwing pizza at the car and passing a Corvette on a hill. Then Carol, Kate, Mike, Bill, James, and I all went back to Mike's and hung out. It was..um..interesting. The boys locked us out of the house. That was not fun. We went swimming and played basketball and tons of fun stuff like that. Then I came home and ate dinner and now I'm online.   Tomorrow I'm not doing much of anything that I know of yet. Then Sunday is Remsen graduation and Gavin's and Jon's graduation parties. I don't know if Carol is going to go with me so I might have to go alone to both.
