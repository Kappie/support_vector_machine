So yeah...theres basically my problem, is i know that i have a boyfriend, but at the same time theres this guy who i've known so long and i'm getting REALLY strong feelings for... Yes my boyfriend is an idiot, had a nice talk with his father, whom also agreed that he ain't the brightest star in the sky when it comes to common sense.  Now for me, the number one thing in a relationship is TRUST, and i finally heard out of the mouths of my "boyfriend" that he doesn't trust me...i just felt like someone stabbed me in the fucking back, that hurt like a damn bitch! He hasn't had a REAL gf before...so i guess thats an excuse. But yeah, now see Bren, when it comes to situations where its about friends and what not, he doesn't have many, although he may say that he does, he doesn't, he's always likea buddy of mine and this and that, but he doesn't have many friends, he doesn't have a best friend at all...which is weird for me cause i'm quite a social person, and i flirt with guys, but it doesn't necessarly mean anything...its just flirting, nothing serious, i may grow feelings for them but all in all i know that Bren is still my boyfriend. He goes all silent when i tell him things, like if i'm talking to a guy or something....blah...mom in the room...gots to go...oh wells i shall write later
