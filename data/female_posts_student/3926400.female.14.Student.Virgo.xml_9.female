I haven't decided if I liked it best yet. I'll always have a certain fondness for my notebook. Pen and paper is the best.   Today wasn't so productive, that is, unless cleaning counts. bleh.   Man, I can not wait until band camp! I'm starting to feel dance deprived because I wasn't able to attend ballet last night (the concert). Next Tuesday I can go though. Then, on Wednesday, band camp starts.  *crowd goes wild* he he he.  I'm a dork, I know.   Ok, enough for now.
