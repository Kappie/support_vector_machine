So today the weather has taken a turn and its in the 60's I believe with some wind, not hot at all. Amazing since it has been so hot and humid lately. Today I am suposed to clean up the kids rooms and then tomorrow I am going shopping to start school shopping for the kids and I.      School.....wow, yeah school. It starts in almost a month, September 1st for Mikayla and Jordan and the 7th for Daunte and I. Mikayla is entering the 2nd Grade and she is so excited about that. Jordan is starting Kindergarden and he is more than excited about that. Daunte will be starting his first year of preschool at Head Start, so no more Early Head Start for him. I am starting my last year in college to recieve my Medical Assisting degree. So no more messing around for me, I wanna get this done and over with.      Kimo has just been working and in about 2 weeks he will be going to the morning shift which is 5 to 1:30 instead of 11 to 7:30. Hes gonna like it better but will have to go to bed earlier and stay off of those damn video games he likes to play all hours of the night.      Well other than that not much is going on. We are suposed to decide on a day to go to Funtown/Splashtown soon which needs to be done before school starts so I might just have to take the kids down someday cause I really don't want these tickets to go to waste.      Well off to do some cleaning and see what else today has in store for the rest of the day.
