First of all, there are too many pop-ups, secondly the most frequent writers are probably the most vapid teenage whores I've ever come in contact with over the internet, *AND FINALLY* I'm still bitter about my blog being genitalia bombed.  Damn them all for all they're worth.  Best wishes to Betso tonite at her recital.  You'll bring down the house.  Are you gonna play any Ben Folds for an encore?  That would be pretty cool...  I straightend up my room a little bit today, but it's not so much as a noticible change as it would be under normal situations.  Almost a full quarter of my room is dedicated to my growning collection of dorm life supplies.  I have a Rubbermaid container filled with towels and blankets, a basket of sheets, a couple pillow shams and a bedspread, and other various items.  Techinically, it almost doubled in size yesterday, b/c my mom and I bought a mini-fridge at Home Depot for only $99.  It's a good little fridge, too.  Shall it display my Frodo magnet with great pride.  *smiles*  Dorm stuff is too much fun.  Mia got a lime green bedspread, I think that's really neat.    We gave you everything,  Manda
