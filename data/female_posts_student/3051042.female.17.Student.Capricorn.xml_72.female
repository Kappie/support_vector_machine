I just remember a lot of crying and running. The halls were those of my high school, yet the people that lined them were those who, I had thought, cared about me. I was tripping over my own feet as I passed by Leah and Keith, Michelle, Jessi, Q, B, a few of my co-workers, Todd, Nick, Jeff, Paul, Henk, Mike, teachers and parents, family friends. Just everyone staring at me, all slightly blurred due to my fast pace, standing in silence. A myriad of people lining a hallway with doors at the end. I never got to the doors.  It was then, that I'd been jolted from my nightmare, if you should call it that. It was 2-something in the morning. I flipped out because I had passed out with Tiki at my side, I was suppose to take her home at midnight. I ran downstairs and talked with my parents (who were drunk off their asses and didn't particularly care about the tears that I just realized were on my face). My mom had taken her home earlier. I feel like such a bitch for passing out. I guess I got what I deserved, a horrible dream.  Earlier in the day, Michelle and I hung out. We went to Mother Fletcher's and I bought a black shirt and a strip of purple satin cloth (possibly a head band in a previous life), it's my new belt.  Tiki and I got stoned at Q's house, Q fell asleep. We left before he woke up, but B and Ryan kept us company during the time previous to that.  Today is Mother's Day. I have no clue what I'm going to do. Michelle and I have to return bottles, pick up our pictures, and we were planning on making a trip to Anthology (Anthologee? I think the store may spell it funky or something). After that, I do believe my mother and I are planting flowers and cooking dinner. Henk's not home yet... he's going to get his ass beat when he finally arrives.  As you can see, I do have shit to get done today... I'll write more later or something.... or something....
