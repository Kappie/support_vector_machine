Here´s a copy of a correspondence from Peter McLean and some other people including someone named Jenny, none of which I ever recieved.  And not included in this posting is the latest email from Peter McLean the housing company which says, " I don´t know where you are....I called your phone and the # is disconnected..blah blah.."  NO ITS NOT, MY STUPID CELL IS ON VACATION MODE FOR THREE MONTHS, I HEREBY MAKE THE DAMNED ANNOUNCEMENT THAT MY #S ARE ALL THE SAME AND SHALL REMAIN SO UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.  If the idiots that did housing would just take 3 seconds and read all my damned forms, they all say in huge writing that I will be (Have been) in Europe since May and will not be able to be reached.  Plus, aol does not support their emails, it took much effort and help to be able to open this one and finally it had to be done in HTML.  FUN FUN FUN STUPID.  SO please feel free to get pissed at this woman.  I emailed VJ at school about the sudden increase in price and he is in turn contacting dittfurth and ariens to have them deal with it.  VJ said he had not been aware since the program started in 1986 of any student having to pay more because their roommate failed out.  Sure, time will tell eh?!  Anyway, so I have finals starting on Friday, its wednesday, and I leave for london on Tuesday.  I feel a bit of a time constraint.  here´s the email, which refers to me ingoring them/her/whomever...which is not, never has been, and will not be the case, are they so incredibly super-retarded they thought my embellished writings declaring my absence from the US were by some means a joke?   *****Please note that anything I put in Bold, I wanted to be emphasized for self-evident reasons.  Hi Jennifer, I have a single available in the hotel at $1,417.  Rachel has never respnonded to my e-mails or calls-she's in a half a twin and I don't even know what she wants to do. Please advise-I have only 1 single left. ----- Original Message -----  From: "Parks, Jennifer"   To: "heather"   Sent: Friday, June 18, 2004 4:35 PM Subject: RE: St. MAry's Law Innsbruck-Karwendel   > If there is still a single room available where Amanda Carroll and Sarah Thompson are staying, I would prefer to stay there.
