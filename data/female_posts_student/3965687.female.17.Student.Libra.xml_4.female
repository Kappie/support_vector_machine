For his own privacy, I won't go into any more detail than that, but what's really getting me is that I'm honestly concerned for him. I barely know him. Heh. I guess I'm a nicer person than I originally thought. Another thing that gets me is the fact that I'm not even thinking about including this in my story. I'm learning a bit about the psyche of the vampires he's describing through the travail A* is experiencing, but I feel no desire to make a tale or documentary of it. It's rather like taking a picture of an old woman stumbling inelegantly; it would be a blow to his pride, I'm sure, but patently indecent. I've known about my inner set of morals, but I hadn't believed that they extended this far. Axyl
