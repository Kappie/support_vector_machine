I hope that you are well. you will like San Diego, it is awesome!!! the beaches are the best. I pray that God will bless you and grow your skills to lead worship someday and write wonderful songs of worship...i pray that He will also use and grow your theatrical skills. God is AWESOME!!!!!  hey, if you don't get to go to Creation, don't worry about it...other opportunities will come your way in which you will be able to see great bands and hang out with fun Christian people. He is faithful. take care.  -JeswES     He's my hero.  :)
