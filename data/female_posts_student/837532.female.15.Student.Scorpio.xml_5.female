I'm 15 and STILL haven't taken driver's ed, I dont have a job, and I'm usualy locked away in my house!! how fun...What few friends I do have I rarely see, and what VERY few BEST friends I have...almost all of them are ignoring me currently. You see my one best friend I haven't seen all summer because she was supposed to move away, but didn't, and her parents are really strict and dont get along with her really. Well I usualy talk to her via MSN messenger, but lately when she's on i'll say "hey what's up?" but she'll never reply to me. So i'm guessing she's just ignoring me....when school starts things will be interesting...my other friend who DID move...is currently in AZ. We used to talk ALL the time on MSN then a little while ago she signed on and I said "hey" and she replies with a "Go away! Leave me alone!" then "Bye!!" and she just signed off. I e-mailed her, but she hasn't e-mailed me back, and now SHE wont talk to me. And I have no fucking clue what I did to either of them. so yeah two of my three best friends aren't talking to me for reasons I dont even know! My other best friend is on vacation, but we're gonna do something when she gets back! ^^ which is the only plus to this whole  WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO TO GET YOU MAD AT ME?!?!?!  Situation. *long sigh*....I've actually come to realize I really dont have that many friends at all. Plenty of acquaintances...but very few friends. Not that it matters much...but still. Though it does make me wonder if I really am that pathetic a person/friend??...who knows! I really shouldn't care, and to a certain extent I dont....so yeah. On a lighter note *cheesy smile*......*long silence*....erm....well I guess I can't think of anything on a lighter note. Only that my life is boring aka I have no life. I have friends who hate me/wont talk to me right now for reasons I dont know. I feel like crap today. I dont have hardly any close friends. Anything I'm remotely good at i'm failing at miserably (aka writing and playing piano). I see no future for myself. I have low self-esteem. And on top of that i'm supposed to be this "always happy and willing to help oh so perfect angel" girl...when i'm probably totally opposite of that!! grrrrrrr!! plus I think most of my life is just a lie, but hey, ITS ALL GOOD! *note heavy sarcasm* anyways. I'm bored so i'm going to go surf the net! laterz!!  hrmmm...now that I think about it. I dunno why I complain about my pathetic life here, or anywhere for that matter. Its not like the human race should/would/could give two fucks about my life. wooo you know my dad yelled at me and called me stupid for using the word "fuck" today. But he was getting me annoyed and pissed off so i cussed. Mr. "Oh i'm so perfect" is just a little more than annoying about 24/7 of the time. *sighs*...is it bad when one wants to actually BURN their own house down??? it is?? err....perhaps I should keep my thoughts to myself ^__^ but that wouldn't be any fun! I enjoy making people who've never seen me or know me think i'm a complete nutcase! Mind games are fun! but really I'm nothing like that, I'm actually a really nice person once you get to know me! You really shouldn't judge someone by a bunch of words in an online diary...they could be a bunch of BS or total flat out lies ^^ for me...who knows which are which. But I'm no liar...well...most of the time lol haha...am I confusing you? and who am I talking to? guess it doesn't matter! I can talk to myself so there! *sticks out tongue* =P haha.....well enough of making you think i'm totally insane and should be on medication! Bye....
