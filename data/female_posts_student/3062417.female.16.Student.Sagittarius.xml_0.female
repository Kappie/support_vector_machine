Intermission was fun hanging out w/ a buncha people (Molly, Dave, Justin, Carol, Kim, Sarah, Kristen, and everyone else). I got home around 10:30 and I went right to bed I was so tired. Tonight should be better. I can't wait.  Well right now I'm looking up information on Jackie Kennedy, listening to Mest, downloading Rooney, and waiting my mom to get home for buying doughnuts so I can eat some! Suprisingly I'm awake for the lack of sleep I got last night. I just hope that lasts until tonight.  I wish I had a job so bad. There are so many things I want to buy. Here's a few: 1. Tons of new clothes 2. A pair of Vans that I like 3. A skateboard so I can learn on my own since it looks like Gavin won't be teaching me anymore 4. A car 5. insurance and stuff for a car 6. tons more stuff  Song:  What went on last night  Was it just another stupid fight  Will we be again  Or will we both regret this in the end  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  Consider me your friend  Until you do that stupid shit again  I believed all you told  Then you left me hanging out so cold  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  Why can't I forget you and everything you do  It's so hard to do  -"Forget You"-Mest
