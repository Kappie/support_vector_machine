Alisha and I both think it's true because hello!  it is  Theirs a convicted rapest roaming the halls of RHS.  I really don't know what to think of this for two reasons.  It is gross and so wrong and I feel so bad for the little girl and he deserves to be punished for what he did.  But on the other hand I know him and know he's not a bad person.  In fact he's one of the last people at RHS that I think would do this.  I feel bad for him because of how the media is handling it.  They make him sound like a mad man when that isn't the case.  I was so bewildered by it all when Jessica revealed the name to me.  The pieces just don't fit.    I have a pile of homework sitting next to me on the floor.  I find it easier to look at it then actually do it.  Right now my main thing is finding a job for the summer which is proven to be more difficult than I first thought.  Damn you American Eagle!  Renae told me Ross is quitting his job as a shoe salesmen to become a lifeguard over the summer...Maybe I can have his job.  I mean I have loads of shoes, if I can buy them I think I could easily sell them.    Oh, I heard this wonderful band called Armor for Sleep they are good...You need to listen to them!    A few moments ago it hailed outside which is funny because I could see the sun coming through the clouds.    Oh, if anyone else was concerned, I got out of my previous engagement for the 29th so I'm free to go to the Lyndsay Diaries/The Spill Canvas show.  Which I am extremely excited for!  28 more days!  I really wish Time and Distance would stop in Sioux Falls.  They have their unfinished tour schedule posted on their web site and in late July their in St. Louis and than like four days later their stopping in Aberdeen.  So I think, as the rest of you should, they should stop in Sioux Falls because it's on the way.  And what the hell is in Aberdeen anyway?  Renae is super excited because Recover is coming.  Plus, she told me that Gage told her that Rookie is coming back on June 22!  OH, that will be great!  RENAE WE GET TO SEE HOPPY AGAIN!  I wish blogger had insterted smiley faces like xanga does because they would be all over this paragraph!  I'm off to do another from of procrastination...Watching TV! ~Kay
