MOON I was just listening to the song Chanson Pour Les Petits Enfants by Jimmy Buffett and it talks about Mr. Moon and his best friend Magnus and they fly away to a magical land and meet Princess Leia, lol it sounds like the guy was on crack when he wrote the song, and maybe he was, but the chorus is all in french and it translates to say something like sing for the little children, sing for all the world. But anyway, wow crazy times these past few days, i wont go into detail because well, certain people might read this. YesterdayKyle Buck had another party, it wasn't as crazy as the one before. Christina almost beat the record of how many people you can fit in a car, it was crazy, Stina was driving, Stephanie was shotgun, Coty, Kari, Cameron and I were in the backseat and Josh was laying across all of us, we couldnt fit his legs in all the way so the rear right door was open a bit as we were driving around Josh's neighborhood. I spent the night at Karis with Christina and there was alcohol involved, lol. Triple Sec is really easy to take by the way...you like don't even need a chaser. I was kinda tipsy and so Kari and I stayed up till 4 talking about who we would make out with, lol. Lets just saywe would make out with quite a few people. Tonight was Kari's SURPRISE PARTY!!!!! WHOO!!! That was fun, Kari was making me mad though! She wouldnt leave her house! Her mom had to like hold her at gunpoint to get her to get in the car! The good thing was she didnt expect it tonight. Tomarrow I leave for SOCAL!! *southern california* Get myself a surfer boy, mmm surfer boys are so cute! Too bad they'll be like, uh oregonian, get away! Hopefully there will be someone cute sitting next to me on the plane! I'll be all by myself! Anywho, I probably won't write when I'm in Cali but when i come back there will be stories, hopefully! KARI AND CHRISTINA...WHAT DOES L STAND FOR!? good times... *kate ~i have seen the others, and i have discovered, that this fight is not worth fighting
