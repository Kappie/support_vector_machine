It's raining outside... if they're really at Wonderland I hope he's okay... don't want him to catch a cold. Guys always get sick carelessly. Gonna go shopping for some tanktops or tshirts next week. Sunday Worship tomorrow. Ew, what if Marcos comes like he said he might? Scaryness~! Nima said he'd ask his mom if he can come to Sunday Worship but I doubt his mom would let him anyway. So blah. It's okay... I want him to come though, 'cos I wanna see him. I miss him... didn't get to talk to him at Bethel... blah. Girls... like to talk. Weird... so yeah. Talking to Kryss and Jay on MSN. [Kryss = Krystal, Jay = Jason] I wanted to go outside but raining~! Blah... MSN's fine. Haha... Jay goes to Seneca College. Hmm, didn't Doris go there? Blahhh~ Funnyness! We talked about "bubbly cheeks" and IngiEE. He liked IngiEE's cheeks. They were BUBBLY. Haha~~~! So funny. Gotta tell IngiEE. Anyways... Hmm, maybe I'll get to go outside on Sunday after church... Fresh air... still a little tired right now but I'm okay, I guess. Miss Nima... *sighzZ*  I wish I could give Nima a hug right now... I wanna apologize to him for not going over beside him when he played the piano and talking to my friends instead. My fault. Shouldn't have PMSed over that. Blah... I miss him so much... Talked non-stop about him during lunch... haha... I'm so dumb. Couldn't stop thinking about him. I'm making stars too... one for each day we've been together... but I'm making some extras. I thought about making one for each time I think of him but it'd be too much. Not enough jars or whatever... I think about him non-stop... not possible for me to make stars non-stop. My fingers are fucked as they are... Blah. Hopefully I'll get to talk to Lisa... Hopefully. I missed her a lot... *sighzZ* Oh well...
