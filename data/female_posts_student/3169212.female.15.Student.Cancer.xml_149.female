And FYI if you listen to the Yu-Yu Hakusho episode "The Human Race" in Japanese you would hear my name.  Kuronue:  Of course, Kuwabara was calling an eleven year old psychic idiot...  Baka:  Do you enjoy living in a paradox?  I mean, you watch the show that you're featured in.  Kuronue:  Technically, that's not me.  That's an imposter.  Baka:  Still...  Kuronue:  In fact, I'm not even in the show as far as I can tell.  Baka:  Well, your old partner is featured in it.  Kuronue:  Okay, I'll give you that one.  Baka:  Good.  We finally agree.  Kuronue:  Don't get used to it.  Baka:  Oh, come on, can't you feel something developing between us?  *takes Kuronue's hand*  Kuronue:  Let...go...of...my...hand...you...rodent!  *pulls hand away rapidly*  Baka:  Come on you big tease.  Kuronue:  *runs off into the distance*  Baka:  Got rid of him.  Buddha:  You were lying the whole time?  Baka:  Not the whole time.  The first four sentences are true.  Buddha:  I'll never understand demons.  Baka:  I'll never understand FLCL, but, hey, it's still awesome.  Buddha:  That doesn't sum up most demons, however.  Baka:  *picks up empty rum bottle*  Did you drink all the rest of this?  Buddha:  No.  Baka:  So, Kuronue ran off into the distance completely drunk?  Buddha:  Yeah, I guess he did.  Baka:  I hope he has a high tolerance for alcohol.
