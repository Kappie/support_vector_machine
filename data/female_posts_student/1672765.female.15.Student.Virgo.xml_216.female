Saturday me and my sister went to see the Village. Afterwards she asked if we could go to WalMart so she could buy some SweeTarts. I was like fine...whatever. We do that often after seeing movies and we get into WalMart and to the candy aisle and Sarah expects me to carry them for whatever reason. And of course I do because I'm nice like that. 	We are walking out of WalMart and Sarah says she's hungry. I told her I know...she's said that already. I said, "Knowing you, you'd want to go get a Whopper, Fries and a Drink and we're going to be eating dinner in 2 hours." We got into the car and was sitting there and everything and I wasn't saying anything. I didn't want her to go to Burger King because I knew she's get that and I know we'd be eating in 2 hours or less. That's not right. But eventually after sitting in the parking lot not saying anything I suddenly say (not very meanly, just in a I-give-up kind of voice), "I don't care, do whatever you want." I didn't really finish saying this because Sarah had slapped me before I could.  	I must admit I'm sick of her being mean to me and I think that was when I decided I wasn't going to put up with her today because I'm tired of being so submissive and everything. So I asked her why she always has to hit me and everything and she was like, "I'm not going anywhere." Blah blah and we started to drive away. I don't know how it came about but Sarah stopped in the parking lot and told me to get out. Get out? Fine...So I did and walked to WalMart. 	I went to the bags and looked for one, to see if I could take anything to the show but didn't so I went to the CDs because I knew she would find me there and I knew she'd be come crawling back. 	I'm looking around at I see her coming up and she is angry. Boy is she angry. She grabs my arm and tries to drag me out. I threaten to scream, I tell her she knows I will and I know I will. This struggle goes on for a while and eventually we are in a corner surrounded by sound-systems and TVs and Sarah hits my face, my glasses go flying behind some TVs. She tells ME to go pick up my glasses. I tell her no and try to walk away but Sarah won't let me get away that easy.  	I tryed not to, I really tryed hard not to but I started to cry. Really. My face was all red, more from trying to hold in my crying. I put my face in my hands and tryed so hard not to cry. Sarah goes looking for my glasses. I take this chance to get away. I nearly run over some guy that works there. I'm walking through WalMart, can't see much and my face is all red and I'm trying not to cry. 	This is a very pathetic scene. I can only imagine what people thought that saw me. Sarah catches up to me, gives me my glasses and once again uses brute force to convince me that we ought to be getting home by now. I manage my way to the produce section where I tell Sarah I'm staying here and I'm going to call our parents for a ride home. She tells me she'd be in so much trouble if she came home without me. GOOD. She should be in trouble. I was still red in the face, half crying, really holding back.  	This always happens. I don't cry but when I do I cry like nobody's business. It's because there are a lot of times I could cry/should cry/need to cry but don't and I think something sort of big sets me off and everything comes crashing down at once and everything catches up to that one cry. It's pretty awful. 	Anyway. I was so appalled at how cruel Sarah could be. She was making me CRY in front of all those people and still she was being so cold and heartless. I once again told her I would scream. I asked her if she really wanted to get the police and security involved in this, because anybody can see I'm in no fault here. She had me in her tight grasp, my arms were red from where she had grabbed me and she had my arm bent in a painful fashion. She said, "Deep down I know you care, you say you don't but I know you care about making a scene, but I don't." Oh? So I say, "LET ME GO!" Loudly. She backs off a little. Looks like someone does care about making a scene, but it's not me.  	Eventually she tells me to come on once again and I'm not stupid so I go. We walk in the parking lot and this is when I really start to break down.  	We get in the car and it's all over. I sob for a good 15 minutes. I know it's a stupid reason to cry but I really couldn't help it. The times I cry are always stupid times to cry.  	I'm sick of putting up with Sarah. The entire time I was in the back of the car pitifully crying away, wiping my snot on my jeans and all that jazz. Not one apology. Not one "are you okay?". Nothing. We get home. Guess who's still mad. What the hell? So I go to my room and everything and my mom eventually comes up, asking what happened. I told her she can ask Sarah. She tells me Sarah told her and was coming upstairs to ask me for the real story (ha ha). I told her I'm done with it, forget about it, I don't care anymore. Really I was far from as upset as I was.  	I eventually gave in and I started out so apathetically, like I didn't care and everything but when we got to the part where I started to cry in the middle of the store I started to choke up again. I told my mom how I don't understand how someone can be that angry, and stay that angry. I don't stay mad. I stay mad two seconds then I'm over it.  	My mom talks about how Sarah always thinks she's not the one to blame and nothing is her fault when really the truth is everything is. Sarah is a complete...something. I don't know. It's horrible what she does and what's worse is what she doesn't realize. My mom said she was looking into sending her to a Catholic convent but it was too late in the year to enroll. Oh man oh man! That sure would have killed Sarah. Why does it have to be too late???  	I'm sick of Sarah's shit and that's all I have to say about that!
