My mom just called and said that I'm going to the ortho on the 19th and he's gonna start taking my braces off, then I'm going back on the 27th and he's gonna finish taking them off!!! So, I'll have them off before I go back to school, bitches! And then I gotta go back in on September 13th and get fitted for a retainer.           4 days, ho!
