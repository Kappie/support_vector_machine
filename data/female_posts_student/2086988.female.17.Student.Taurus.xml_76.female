It's ok though, it's what is in NE that I can't wait to go ;) I just hope Kiera can go with me, since all that happened, I don't know if her parents will say yes, they better, because without her, then I don't know if I can go, but no worries.   AHHH I gauged my cartiledge this morning, from a 18G to a 14G, omg that hurt sooo much! Lol, it started bleeding and it was just all sorts of pain. But it'll get better eventually, I was just sick of wearing that fake diamond ring, so I put my barbell through it, lol it looks so like me! Not really, I just need to get some different colored balls for it.  YAy SuPERboWl TiME!!! Let's all confrom to society and watch this American football tradition!   But when you touch me like this And if you kiss me like that And you hold me like that I just have to admit That it's all coming back to me When I touch you like this And I hold you like that it was so long ago but its all coming back to me now
