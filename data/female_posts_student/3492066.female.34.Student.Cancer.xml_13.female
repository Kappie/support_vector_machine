I got the job up at the YMCA working at the front desk, and as part of my training, I must go through the CPR and First Aid program. So, after 3 p.m. today I will be Red Cross Certified and be prepared to be a first-responder in case someone takes ill or has a heart attack at the Y.  To sum up the past week: I've registered for classes over at the university, so it's now official...I will be taking Latin, Ancient Greek, and German II this autumn. I'm debating whether or no to go to National Irish University in Galway for a semester come spring on the grounds that I'm not sure if they offer Ancient Greek or Latin, and as that at my university it's the same professor for both...even if they do, it's going to be a challange trying to get her to accept the transfer of hours. That, and there's the issue as to how both classes are only offered once in autumn, with the follow-up class only being offered in spring.  Meanwhile, I listen to the BBC World Radio broadcast and wonder what it is that the Irish protesters are saying specifically, wishing I could get a listen. President Bush is meeting with the European Union heads at a castle in the west of Ireland, and with a quarter of the Irish police and 700+ security people from the US, the protesters aren't getting anywhere near the castle to be heard. Frankly, I'm of the opinion that they have the right to protest, especially against the U.S. on the grounds of the lunacy that is called our "foreign policy." The U.S.S.R. collapses, and now, a little over a dozen years later, the U.S. is becoming the big world bully.  And what about the U.S. soldiers slaving, er, serving in Iraq? Dare I ask how many of them don't have appropriate weapons let alone bullet-resistant vests (nothing's entirely bullet-proof). Although it's rumors I've heard, rumors are powerful things, especially when there's a seed of truth to them. It's bad enough that not only is the U.S. military forcing individual troopers to stay, reinstating their tour of duty eventhough their time has run out, they're also now pulling back in those who had just left. It makes me wonder when the retired soldery will be getting phone calls asking for them to join again. Desperation and lunacy, all by men who consider themselves in control, think they have power, and yet what they don't realize when they step into their suits in the morning is this...power is an illusory thing, and it can be taken away or disappear with a puff of wind. People only have power when it is given to them by others. The president is only the president only because it is agreed to by the population of the U.S.. The executive and judicial branches of our government only have their powers because it is given to them and agreed upon by the populace. What would happen if the populace en mass decided to nix all of that? Change their minds and pull the power plug? The heads would think that there would be chaos in the nation, but there wouldn't.  Needless to say, you can tell my perspective on the Iraq "war." I could have done a better job. :-)
