I decided to drop my Medieval Studies class last night after reviewing the reading list, and actually setting my alarm for 7am. And considering how much trouble I had getting up this morning by 8:30am, I think it was appropriate, especially since I barely made it on time to my 10am seminar. I ended up taking way too long drinking my coffee, eating cereal and chatting with Lisa (this has become our morning routine), and had to rush with everything else. I didn't get on my bike until 9:46, and partway to class realized that the quickest route to the Social Sciences building is under construction. Damn! So I had to ride my bike all the way around the quad in the midst of mid-class rush. It was a small seminar of 16 people, so I felt especially conspicuous breathing hard and sweating. I peeled off all of my jackets and sweaters, and spent the first 15 minutes of class recovering, having gotten quite out of shape over winter break. My sits bones and my quads are so sore.  This seminar sound really interesting, though. It's about memory and war, post-1945. It deals especially with the Holocaust, but also with the after effects of totalitarian rule... I think I'm really interested with European and American views of colonialism, and totalitarianism and imperialism often intrinsicly linked. Hopefully I can explore something of this in the class with one of my papers. And it's my New Year's resolution not to half-ass my way through class work this year, and actually take the time to get really into the assignments and enjoy being in school and thinking about such far reaching topics.
