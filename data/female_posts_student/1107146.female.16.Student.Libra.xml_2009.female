But before I get done, I just wanted to say that my psych paper is done!!!  w00t.  I'm very proud.  Also, did anyone else get their Youth Leadership Brentwood forms back?  I got in, w00t!! I know that Lumley and Jacob did too. Ok, so I haven't officially read the letter.  None of the rest of it interested me.  I just read the "Congratulations,  welcome to Youth Leadership Brentwood" and let my mom take care of the rest.  This should be fun.  I hope our English project is ok.  *Sigh* Poor English project.  Poor computer...  And I'm feeling much better for Josh and Abby, who I'm sure are wondering.  I think I just needed sugar.  Stupid hypoglycemia.  Oh well.  I got my psych paper done early, and now I'm going to bed, w00t.
