There were some pretty bad bands there. One of them was sooo bad I just wanted to scoop my ear drums out so I couldn't hear them anymore. They were horrible! A band named Fade won. They were awesome. They are getting signed so watch out for them! I would listen to them...that's how good they are. Well I got home around 10 last night and watched some tv and then went to bed.   Now, I'm looking up directions to David's Bridal for Carol and I'm going to be going there with her in a little while.  No song for now.
