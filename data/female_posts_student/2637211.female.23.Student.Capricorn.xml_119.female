I was inspired by analyzing weird comedies about WWII, especially children's movies set in WWII, like Bedknobs and Broomsticks. But I can't find anything else, and I'm freaking out... I have no idea of where to go with this idea and it's horrifying. I know I can pull it together, but it'll be a lot of stress until I get there.
