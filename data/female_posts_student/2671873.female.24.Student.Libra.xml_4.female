However, I have come to realize that it is through this thought that I have grown, matured, lived.  As I was in bed unable to sleep last night I began to think of this world we live in and all its complexities.  Here I am in the North West part of Ireland (known to many as Northern Ireland) studying Peace and Conflict, yet I have discovered the essence of what I study is right before me (not in the form of a national problem, rather one that is intrapersonal)  The peace and the conflict.  Is it possible to help others deal and solve their conflict when you aren't able to solve your own?  I'm not sure.  Can you strive for world peace when there isn't even life peace in your life?  Still unknown.  But what I do know is that I want to make a difference in lives, and recently have discovered that maybe I need to start with my own...rather than looking from the outside in.  It could be best summed up by an illustration of my Professor, Dr. Paul Arthur, you need to get off the dance floor and into the balcony.  Only then can you truly make a difference to your life and others.
