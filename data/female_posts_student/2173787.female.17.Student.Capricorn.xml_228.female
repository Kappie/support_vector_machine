So much has happened in these past 3 weeks, so many stories, so many new friends, so much unchartered territory.  As I sit here tonight I don’t know where to begin.  My mind seems clouded and every time I try to find a place to start everything that settled out reemerges and becomes part of the picture once again.  Maybe I’m still too close, too entrenched, too tired to even attempt to sort through what has happened.  As I sit here I think back to last night’s devotion and the particularly insightful point that we cannot go back and change the past, nor can we control the future.  All we have is the present.  The problem is that I do not know what I want to do with my present, where and how I want to spend it.  There are so many options before mw, yet the second I step forward I know that the rest will be lost.  Each one entices me, each one draws me to it, yet I know that I must pick only one.  To try anything else would not only turn into a failure, it would hurt me and negatively affect those around me as well.  It is so much easier to sit passively and let time and other slowly take away option after option, taking away the decision, tomorrow I return to Kanata, not as a trainee but as a staff member.  Already that simple decision seems to be guiding my path; closing doors that I never even knew existed.  Yet at the same time I hope that it will allow new doors to open, leaving me with precious memories and new paths to take when it is over.  Tomorrow will take me one step further into the woods, and while I may be apprehensive I look forward to tomorrow.
