Sorry, I've just been drooling over some things... like Planet Ladder #1 you can get from a ebay shop wich only charges like £1.40 for postage! WOW! Ehe... just ignore me then. Oh, I'm not gonna tell you where though cause I want it. :D Aren't I nice? Ohhh Izzy you have to finish Mr Fopple! Think of our millions of nonexistant invisable readers who need the next chapter! (Ehe)
