There was tackling and, in a separate incident, somehow a kid accidentally got punched in his face while my back was turned.  As the kid put it "he was reaching for my kappa and his  fist  accidentally hit my eye", not his hand his fist.  It's shocking what we do to each other "accidentally" when we forget to pay attention.  Although its been a long time since I've physically hit anything except inanimate objects, I can't help but wonder how many people I've figuratively hit, just by not doing my share of something or ranting about them.   I guess I just need to watch myself more carefully, because that way even if I do screw up (which I will inevitably do) I can at least have some idea of what happened instead of having my back turned to the situation.
