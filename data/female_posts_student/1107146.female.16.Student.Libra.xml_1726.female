But really I was ALL of you there/here/whatever because it wouldn't be the same without you ALL. Dinner will pizza (for those that constantly ask about food) and snacks and whatnot. Yea I haven't really planned...except for the fact that it's from 5:30 to whenever. Oh yea, Silly string, if I can get a hold of a massive amount of Silly string I do believe we'll have some fun with it in my backyard. AND bring your favorite movie or movies to fill in as background noise or just fill time.  Oh yea, if you guys expect cake...well you'll be disappointed... SO don't look for it...unless I get mad and decide to bake.  Ok I think that's it. If I'mm missing something (and I prolly am) just put the question here.
