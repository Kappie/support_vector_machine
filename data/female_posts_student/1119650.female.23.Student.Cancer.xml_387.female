You put me in a really akward position and I'm sorry, but I can't lie to someones parents, thats just really messed up so when your mom called you and said she spoke to me, it wasn't a lie, she did call and I did tell her that no, I did not have your computer.  She knew I didnt have it even before I told her, she just called to make 100% sure.  What you do with your family is your business, and what you do with [boyfriend] is your business, but please, I dont have time to be caught up in lies and the resulting drama of the lies for something that doesn't even directly affect me.     I know it sounds bitchy, but honestly: I am really busy during the week I have class m-th until 830 every night, I come home and have homework to do, only to get up and have to get ready for work at 6am the next morning.  You guys have to stop bleeping me at like 3:45 in the morning 'cause I'm tryign to sleep and thats not fair.     I want to be friends with you and you know it, but you're making it really hard by putting me in these wierd situations.  I already had to lie to my mom about one thing, but its out now so I can stop.  I dont want to have to lie about stuff.  It doesn't end well.   If you want to be mad at me for saying this, thats your choice and I suppose I respect it, but I hope you will realize your family is your family, you cant change that and it seems from the convo I had with your mom that you're pushing them away.  I dont want to not be on speaking terms with you like we were for the last few years, I just can't get involved in stuff that doesnt involve me.  ~G  Reply: well i told them the truth like 5 days ago and i dont bleep you at 345  [boy] does...we call you because you dont call back. it seems to be that  you have so many more important things to do with yuor time than  actually call me back or hang out. and thats fine thats your decision.  i  dont know if you call me then i guess we will talk and hang out and if you  dont them im sorry but i tried and i called and i left messages and  everything and by you ignoring me and everything is not what friends do.   if i put you in bad positions, my bad. i didnt think it was such a big  deal. but i guess to you it is. so i guess i just wont involve you in  my life anymore because you are too busy with your own. im sorry for  bothering you."    How on earth did that guilt trip almost work on me?   How on earth did you even have the balls and try to turn that around on me? How on earth did you tell your parents the truth five days ago when on Friday your mom had called me to bust you in the lie? How on earth can I possibly come out of this looking like the badguy? (Yet somehow I know I will) How on earth did we grow so far apart as friends? How on earth is it possible that we were inseperable and practically shared a brain and ended up on such different ends of the spectrum? How on earth can you not see what you're doing to your life and try and help yourself?
