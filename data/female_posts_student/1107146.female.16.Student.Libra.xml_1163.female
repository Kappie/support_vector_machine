Um, I donated like $10 already to the CF thing, but if anyone else was motivated by your inspiring speech, then by all means, give your money.  Um, yeah...I burnt my finger cooking a cold dish today.  I had to boil some water to liquify this gelatin stuff, and while I was putting the water on to boil, the guy standing next to me (who was doing nothing but getting in the way since I'm the only one in our group that knows how to cook) turned around and hit my arm right as I was putting down the pot.  Anyway, it had only been on for like a minute, but it was a gas burner, and it hurt.  A LOT.  And I didn't even cuss. (Not even a smurf, Abbs!)  And now they are having me do the poster that goes along with it, because apparently, I'm not busy, and because apparently I didn't do enough of the work yet.  What have the other people done?  Cliff bought orange juice, Meredith got pictures developed, and Ogetchi took pictures.  I'm definitely thinking this is even distribution of work.  But I had to do the poster, because 1) No one volunteered, except to volunteer me, and 2) If they did take it home against their wishes, then they either won't do it, or they'll do a seriously crappy job on purpose.  And that is how I got stuck with doing all the work.    So, did Travis ask you out yet, Abby?  If he didn't i'm going to really have to talk to him.    And, let's see, I've got that AP test to study for.  And the chemistry test.  And the Algebra test.  And the Spanish quiz... heeheehee...I'm going to di-ie.  Well, I betterquit procrastinating and actually start studying.  Hasta la vista, baby!
