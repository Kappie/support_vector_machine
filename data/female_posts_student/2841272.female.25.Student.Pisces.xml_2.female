I don't want to dig in too much deeper, rather let's chalk it up to a disagreement about one word.  You say verge (meaning edge of or threshold) I say path.  As to the Eisner debate I don't think you want to begin a philosophical disection of free will.  I wouldn't go so far to say "Eisner has done  everything  in his power to keep the film from the screen" because if Eisner did in fact everything in his power, it would never be seen.  Because it will likely be released I think Eisner did his reasonable best to stop it, but stopped short of using every drop of power and favor at his disposal.  On the final note fear of retaliation does not make you for the oppressor.  Now that I've finished with the semantics lets get back to creativity.  Regarding  Harry Potter  I've neither seen the films nor read the book but based on the voracity of your enthusiasm I have no doubts about your testimony.  My own literary suggestions include Michael Cunningham and Eric Schlosser.  Writing has been around for hundreds of years but these two have been able to read both new and original.  One of the most creative acts working in music today is The White Stripes.  I'm not going to say I don't have a few issues, at some point Jack White will have to marry and divorce a bassist, but Jack's guitar work and blues influences are taking rock music into new directions.  The other breath of fresh air in music is Eminem.  Yes his attacks on his mother, his girlfriend and homosexuals are predictable and pedantic but his stream of consciousness lyrics are the wittiest use of words in music.  My final musing will no doubt surprise you but rather than epitomizing musics lack of creativity with Christian Auguliera or Britney Spears I suggest Courtney Love.  That isn't to say Spears and co. are as talented as Love, they're not, nor am I saying Love has lost her talent and creativity, she hasn't, but she has become a caricature.  Her live, electric unpredictability has been replaced with incoherent, junkie ramblings and poor behavior.
