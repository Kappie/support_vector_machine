I didn't go out and drink on Friday night and get wasted like I have been doing since I started school. That felt good. I didn't see any of my girlfriends this weekend, which was strange but alright (most were out of town, anyway). I saw my family, like my ENTIRE mom's side, which was also so much fun and a nice escape back to reality. I didn't feel the need to lament or cry once over the situation with E, which made me feel very rejuvenated. I didn't get my homework done which causes me to panic somewhat. However, I am going to be okay in the grandest sense of the word, and I'm happy about it. I realized that no tears are worth E, they just aren't. He's not a quality boy by any means, just by what I wanted to see in him. He is selfish, he is not intelligent like I like my men, and the most unappealing thing about him is that he's so confused that he makes other people look like the bad guys when really, it's him! I am happy to have hit this revelation so early. I mourned him a week and now I'm ready to get back up off the ground and start dating again. Hell, I need to revel in being single! I have been thinking about R lots and lots lately. Strangely enough, those thoughts don't hurt, they just offer me comfort and a hope in my heart. Things are looking up, and this week is not going to be anything like the last...I guarantee it! No more E getting under my skin. I don't need him! He's not the love of my life, and he doesn't even have the qualities I'm looking for in a boy. So, here we go, back on the roller coaster I go!
