The day started out with band, but we didn’t play.  We just sat there and studied for other classes and talked.  For the first 15 minutes or so, Meagan (I found out that this is the way you spell her Meagan) Philip, and I moved boxes close to 40 pounds each.  Then we sat down for 77 minutes.  I went over to Meagan’s seat and we talked and studied.  I tried to find out her AIM screen name, but she doesn’t have AIM.  So at yearbook signing I’m going to ask her for her cell phone number, yes I did fix her cell phone today.  After that we had homeroom.  We finished are really stupid book.  It was called King of Shadows.  Susan Cooper (the author) should be shot for writing such a stupid book.  After that, we played musical chairs, and it was really violent.  I got tackled and winded while playing.  At lunch I DM again nothing interesting happened.  Last period we had P.E, nothing interesting happened, what a boring day.
