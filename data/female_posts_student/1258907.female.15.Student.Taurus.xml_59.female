Is the mirror broken? Or is that just my face? Is it possible to change it? Or just leave without a trace?  Could I leave and not come back? Could I run and never look back?  Would people even notice? The ugly face that has now just gone Would people even notice? That I had left at the crack of dawn?  Goodbye to all, For now its time, For me to run And for me to find A place to go And a place to stay A place for me To stay astray.
