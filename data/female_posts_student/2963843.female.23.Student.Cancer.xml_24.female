I can't help but enjoy myself watching all these guys bitching. And Rachel sure has nice 'racks'.. Well, I thought she did Singapore proud by showing the well endowed foreigners that we are not to be trifled with! =p  The highlight of the show is still about da guys in my opinion though.. Liked the silver bracelet that one of the dudes gave her as a present.. At that moment, I wished I was her.. Come on, don't lie ladies, I'm sure you love to be worshipped. Its evident all the way back to Cleopatra..  Watching that ang mo cringe when Rachel tells him that her friend saw him with his girlfriend is pure justice brought onto tv.. I thought that guy was an arrogant SOAB. He reminded me of some of the ang mors at clubs.. Sleazy! Some of them really have no respect for asian ladies, thinking that they can score with any chick they want.. Just because they are white.. Thanks alot SPGs!  Sorry, but I would rather have my true blue Singaporean guy, no matter how boring he may be. Sincerity always wins the lady's heart at the end of the day... And presents too!  haha...   Love her bracelet.  Think I'm gonna get Don to buy me one.. Worship me you unworthy one!! hhaha... I'm praying that he doesn't read this EVER!
