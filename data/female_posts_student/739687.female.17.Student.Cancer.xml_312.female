School started last Monday obviously, and it's not so bad I suppose. With the exception of pre-cal. Someone please shoot me for that one. Oh, and work...I am working non-stop. It's insane. However, I have off tomorrow, so expect a post again. Perhaps one longer and more important than this brief update.  One thing on my mind however...I wish that things wouldn't be so impossible. I want simple things. I just feel like I'm trying and trying and it's like swimming through molasses...in the winter, on the coldest day in the past 50 years...in Alaska.  I just can't sit back and watch everything just walk away from me. I have to do something...sitting on my ass isn't getting me anywhere!  I have to try harder to make life work out. And I'm going to. I'm going to try alot harder. Because I'm  going  to get things right for once.  Well...that about covers it for now...I'm going to bed.  Keep busy, crazies.
