I just have to make sure i finish this cause i dont want to be writing an essay tomorrow during lunch. blegh! not on my birthday. Its okay though, cause for once its a pretty easy essay. woooooooooo easy essay. i slept for like 3 hours after school today which is why im still up writing this essay cause i didnt actually have that much homework...i should have done it earlier and then gone to bed early, but oh well. i got up at like 7:30  and ate dinner and started "working" at 8. haha. I'm so excited though, man. I dont want any presents though. Not from my friends. their love is the best present of all! my family can get me stuff cause they feel obligated to and i guess tehres some material stuff i sort of want.. but i dont want my friends to buy me anything. i just want those questions. actually, to tell the truth, what would i want if i could have anything for my birthday? to be closer to emily! but nobody can exactly give that to me, not even pasch. questions are sort of in that vein though. and so is doing something on friday. and so is getting that journal back. so any of those things i guess are great presents. i can deal with balloons i guess...just not a million of them. im afraid of carrying a million balloons/extra thigns around.  oooh, and i have drivers ed free tomorrow. forgot about that. woo.   thanks in advance, guys. cause im sure ill have a great day tomorrow.  and now i should work on my euro...
