Last night. Will remain last night. and thats it. no great story to tell, no great revelation. no great new developement. but heres the thing. alanah may very well be a pessimist. and even tho i HOPE to god shes laughing and smile and content right now, she may be no farther along than me with this shit.  but, alot of ppl say i'm an optimist....its only that that screws me down so hard. i get a glimmer of hope, and i cling to it for dear life. but i always end up getting disappointed in the end. so if i become a pessimist, will i not put mysef through this each time?
