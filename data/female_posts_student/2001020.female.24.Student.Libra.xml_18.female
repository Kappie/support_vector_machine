I know by holing myself up in my room, I'm not being overly productive in dealing with it, but I cannot bring myself to enjoy life in this empty state of heart right now. I miss him, I really do. It's been a week, that's it. I cannot believe it! It feels like forever...but it hasn't been. I need to keep that in perspective. I've never gone longer than a week not talking to him, but I have nothing to say. When I think of him, automatically something pops up into my head, like a circumstance where he lied. I gave him the benefit of the doubt all the time, I never doubted his integrity...I can't believe all of this still happened. But disbelief isn't going to change anything. But I still feel pain when I think of all of the things he could've said or done to remedy this and he didn't. I mean, the last time we had sex, I thought it was so loving and, well, at the very least, I thought it meant something. For him to ask me to forget it like it never happened? No, I cannot...and for him to make me out to be some kind of psychotic crazy woman to her? No, I cannot handle it! I cannot! I am still shocked that he did this to me, after how wonderfully I treated him and how much I loved him and how much I did for him and everything, everything. I can't believe it.  Went out to dinner last night with my friend T. I sorta have a crush on him, but I think I'm a little wild for him. I mean, I'm not a wild girl, he's just a little tamer than most guys I that I date or date me. He's adorable, though, purely adorable...I mean everything, his personality, his smile, his intelligence. Nice guy. I have known him in the friend capacity for a few months now, so most likely nothing will happen, especially since I'm leaving in less than two months...but it's nice to think about him. He is a wonderful, wonderful guy. I highly doubt he's capable of anything devious, but I haven't been the best judge of men lately, so I wouldn't put anything past anyone. Anyway, T and I had a great time. Good conversation, Cuban food, laughs, just fun times. I haven't seen him since December, so it was nice to spend time with him.  I should've gone out tonight with my friend S to Sunset, but I'm in this funk...I cannot seem to shake it. I feel like I am trying to emerge but have not yet emerged from my web of torment. I know I'll get out, but I don't think the new me has quite "hatched" yet. I guess I thought I could force this process along, but in all reality, I cannot. I just need to let myself mourn and hurt and I know that nature will allow me to progress like normal. *sigh* But I never thought I'd have to go through something like this with R. Surprise surprise!  Anyway, I think I'm going to read and fall asleep. Gonna run errands tomorrow to get ready for my mommy coming to town next weekend. More later.
