Once I got home I like crashed...literally. Then 4:30 rolled around, I chased my dad away from here so it wouldn't b all awkwardy...He liked my pictures hehe...And then ppl started coming...Tasha was like the first one...Playing in the rain was soooo much fun dudes...wow...I have a bruise on my knee and I got blisters bcuz of our walk to Dairy Queen *my mom was like grr for about 2 minutes lol*...those flip flops don't like me man...But I think I had too much sugar and other junk. I felt like I was gonna get sick...Zero sleep didn't help either. I was quite content w/ the CHIPPER-ness. And the watermelon story. Tasha, did you hug Jdawg for me? Maybe I should check your blog lol...w/e. Since y'allz know what all happened, all I have to say is: nailpolish highness=scorage, and it's 12 AM...I must be lonely now...
