Read a good amount of Lord of the Flies, which I am now about half way through. Annie called me around 8 and asked if I wanted to sleep over so I got ready and went over there. Her cousin, Teri, was there. She's cool. So we all just hung out and talked. Teri's really funny. She has some pretty out there stories. We were talking about Hooters and how someone's mom works there and Annie says, "Now when the boy is asked what his mom does, he gets to say, '  MY MOM WORKS AT HOOTERS!  ' Isn't that funny?" Yes, it was funny. Annie made fun of me because I need to wash my face and all that *exciting stuff* morning AND  nightbecause unlike her, I break out. And then she was making fun of me because  I was too short  to turn off her light. (from the fan...I hope you know what I'm referring to...) So blah, blah, blah.  July 24, 2004 ...Then I came home today. Didn't do much. Cleaned, watered flowers, did some crunches, and now here I am blogging. Then I'm going to do more crunches and read Lord of the Flies. Hopefully I'll work out some afterwards...OH! Guess what?  I've gone two weeks without junk food!  GO ME! If ya'll (LoL, my mom said that the other day) didn't know, I'm on a diet. Don't freak out. Not starvation diet. More of only eating three healthy meals a day and healthy snacks. I already don't drink pop so that's good too. Well, here's a poem. I've been kind of neglecting to put one in here for awhile so here ya go! Enjoy...          We  Were...     We  were  prefect together,  Why'd you have to go and ruin such a great thing?   We  were  in love,  How could you break my heart?   We  were  so close,  Where'd you get the guts to tear us apart?   We  were  so happy,  When did you decide to make me cry?   We  were  always together,  Who am I suppose to be with now?   We  were  suppose to last,  What were you thinking?   We  were  meant for each other,  So now, how do you live with yourself at night?
