These are songs that I can really relate to.  My favorite part is how it shows the familiar paradox of loving someone and hating them at the same time.  That just clicks for me.  Again, this is a 104.9 song.  Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven’t missed you yet  Every roommate kept awake By every sigh and scream we make All the feelings that I get But I still don’t miss you yet  Only when I stop to think about it  I hate everything about you Why do I love you I hate everything about you Why do I love you  Every time we lie awake After every hit we take Every feeling that I get But I haven’t missed you yet  Only when I stop to think about it  I hate everything about you Why do I love you I hate everything about you Why do I love you  Only when I stop to think About you, I know Only when you stop to think About me, do you know  I hate everything about you Why do I love you You hate everything about me Why do you love me  I hate You hate I hate You love me  I hate everything about you Why do I love you
