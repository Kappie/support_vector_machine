Dacia is in florida she sucks. So what's up? I really have nothing to say. Last weekend my cousin came down to see us and she is like a Hilary Duff and Aaron Carter fan so I promised her that I would help her get away from them. It will be a looooooong processe but I'm up for it. So every week  I will mail her a new cd in hopes that some day she will listen to Green Day or any other rock music as long as it's not Hilary Duff! So I started her off with Avril Lavigne. Next week I'm sending her Simple Plan. I really want to send her Taking Back Sunday but she isn't ready yet... lol later
