Anyways- the real reason that I made this post is because...I feel I can live up to this phrase really well. And the reason for that is that I think I know everything one day and there's nothing more I can learn...and then, BAM- a stroke of genius...or rather someone elses stroke of genius hits me and it's takes me a long time to chew and swallow.The other day someone made me ask for something that I didn't really NEED to ask for, but they made me anyway...but then maybe a half an hour later I realized that was most likely a good lesson in humilty. That I shouldn't just ASSUME i get things, but either ask or think about if I need it... Jeez. You'd think I'd know by now.
