If she's smart she'll get Chelsea to pick it up for her in the morning as chelsea should be awake to get to school. I'm hopeing she'll wake up for it becasue I like causing pain in others when I'm in pain... the pain of haveing to wake up at about 7 to go to work.   I'm going to go eat now, then go to bed.
