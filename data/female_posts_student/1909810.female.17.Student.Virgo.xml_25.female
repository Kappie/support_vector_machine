But of course I didn't have anyone to go with(seeing that my friend is a cheerleader and would be cheering obviously) and no way in hell was I going alone.  I had an exciting day of school today. I still have an A in my AP chem class...barely.  I got a B on my french test, then went home by myself for lunch again, then designed some shirts in math class, that's what i do in math, math is dumb. We had no rehearsal today, holy shit what are we doing? We aren't going to be ready if people keep not coming. What can ya do though? I've  missed 1 rehearsal and that was because I had to go to phoenix for an information thing.  And I don't know what it is with people ignoring me lately.  I was talking to my friend and she asked me a question and while I was in the middle of explaining it she turned and walked away without saying ANYTHING because she saw her boyfriend...she could of at least said something like "hold on a sec" or "oh there's drew I gotta go..." but no..she just walks away while I was in the middle of a sentence. Yay.   My cat was in a tree today.
