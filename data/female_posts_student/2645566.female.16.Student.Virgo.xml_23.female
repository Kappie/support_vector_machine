It was just a rambling that I needed to get out and I had no one to really talk to about it. Anyway...since the last real post, so much has happened. I got to go to Bonnaroo 2004 which was an experiance in itself. It was great because I got in for free, and I got to work which wasn't bad at all because it was soo much fun. The highlight of being there was I got to see my favorite band: Guster. Man, that was the best show ever. The energy was so high...and so were the people. haha.  Anyway...the only other thing that has really happened is babysitting. I HATE KIDS!! And I don't really have a choice in the matter. Yes, I am getting paid, but these kids are horrible! They never have anything good/nice to say, they don't behave, they don't do what they are told, and they are always talking back. I mean, how hateful can ya get guys?? It sucks even more that they are all related to me. Arrgh! It's okay though because it has made me realize that I never, EVER want to have children of my own. Paul backs me up 100% on that, so we don't have to worry about the whole kid thing. Woot.  On a final note...I want out of this house. Out of this city would be nice. And out of the state would be ideal. What I thought was going to be the best summer of my life is turning out to be pretty damn lame.
