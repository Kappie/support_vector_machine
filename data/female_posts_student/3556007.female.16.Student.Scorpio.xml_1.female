I really should go to bed, but that is ok because it looks like I am back to my nocturnal schedule! I went on vacation with my family... We first went to Corpus Christi, and after about 3 days we went and stayed in South Padre. I got sooo sunburnt when we went to Schlitterbahn! I feel like I am as tan as an Indian or something! And then, we went horsebackriding on the beach. It was really fun, but my horse wouldn't stop! He would go faster and faster everytime that the guide tried to catch up with him! I was pulling so hard with the reins that I couldn't feel my finger, and now I still can't feel it!! Ahh! Well, I will be back tomorrow! (Well, actually today, but oh well...)
