I finally made it out of the apartment at 1:30 am on Friday. The good news is that I'm getting my full deposit back from Brookwood Terrace. If anyone is looking for a place to live in Gainesville, I highly recommend them. The staff is wonderful and they're not trying to rip people off, which is a nice change from Treehouse Village, University Place, Legacy,  Grantwood.  This next week is going to be super-overwhelming, so I'm apologizing now for my behavior...mostly to Bruce who has already had to put up with his share of screaming, crying and dramatic mood swings...even more so than usual.  Thursday night we had Amanda's Naughty  Nice Bridal Shower "Excuse me, do you have a condom?" Yes...here's one that's a brand no one has ever heard of, it doesn't have an expiration date...oh yeah, and it's half-way ripped open. Enjoy!   More news as the week continues, and hopefully some new house pictures before too long.  ~D~
