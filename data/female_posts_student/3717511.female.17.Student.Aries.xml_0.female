Practice does indeed start at five. however, everyone else arrived at 5:15. William barnes showed up early and we attempted ping pong together. the table was a bit warped and almost spoiled our fun. very hard to keep the ball going. I also perused the bookshelves and found some weird books. one about gymnastics and included pictures of freaky contortionists. another, was called sports medicine and showed some cool diagrams of the muscular system. and then--the whopper-- HUMAN SEXUALITY. very freaky book. college level sex ed.??? Illustrated various positions which i will not go into detail about, and some loser had dog eared all the pictures with naked women in them. so of course, with the pages being dog eared the first page i open to is a picture of a woman giving birth with her legs all spread open, a screaming squnched up face, and a big baby head trying to escape from her crotch. two things: 1) i wonder how much they had to pay that woman to put her picture in there and 2) OUCH! my desire to never reproduce has been reaffirmed. babies arent that cute when they cry all the time and keep you up all night. they grow up to be bigger, whinier, more brand concious versions of themselves;and who wants to deal with a whiney, expensive teenager who  will just end up crashing the car you paid for them to drive and yelling at you?  Everyone, realize that your mother loves you very much. now go give her a hug,and promise you wont ever put her in a nursing home.
