I'm waiting for mum to go to work so I can go take a shower. Unfortunately, that's in two hours.  Ah well, my nocturnalization was bound to happen sometime, and at least now it happened quite gradually, unlike last summer's excursions. Besides to take a shower I will stay couped up in my room, for fear of bad TV infomercials. Best,  Adi with the bags under her eyes.
