To those not interested in the War Between the States, no doubt this documentary would be painfully boring. The only time there's any movement is when they are talking to historians. Yup.  I dropped by Books-a-Million! today and picked up a nice copy of Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. After I finish that, I figure I'll take the plunge and start reading the New Testamnent of the Bible.  School starts back tomorrow. Auf Wiedersehen, my friends! *Weep*
