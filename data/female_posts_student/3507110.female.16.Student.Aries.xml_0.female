Debris lay everywhere in the yard, twisted images of branches defaced by a day's fierce wind. She stood behind the glass window of her door just watching the lightning and feeling the resonant thunder that followed. It shook her, deep inside her, it stirred something that made her want to scream, laugh, and cry at the same time. Nothing really had the power to do that anymore. She had become the walking dead, a slave to the oblivion that was sleep, preferring its safe recesses to the dangerous outside world. Things were darker than they used to be. The black clouds above her proved that. - 05/31/04  It's been raining in little old Mayberry for how many weeks. The pumps in our basement never relent and I'm quite accustomed to its bitching. Its got work to do. I think the sun might be out but I won't smile or hold my breath. The weather forecast hasn't been looking too grand for some time now. Best to just sigh and count your losses then begin counting your possible earnings. I suppose it can't rain all the time but 'm beginning to wonder if I should rush to Fleet Farm and start buying shit to build an Ark. I wouldn't be surprised either. Hell, If I were God I would have flooded us a long friggin time ago. Humans are assholes. Teenagers being the biggest percentage of that title. I realize that we're coming into our own and that self-expression is key but what's the point of expressing yourself if you're just going to be an untolerating, self-absorbed, selfish bitch about it!!?? Which, by the way, stands for most of my highschool. Oxymorons...
