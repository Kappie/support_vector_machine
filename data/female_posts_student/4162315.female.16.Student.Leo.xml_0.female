I first went to FEU bcoz my mom told me to do so, though i don't like that school, being an obedient daughter (nyek) i went to get the form. I was dropped right in front of the main gate. Where people came in and out. Sbi ko sa sarili ko "nako, d ko alm gagawin ko". I was all by myself (w8..kanta un dba?) so nagpunta muna ko sa 7 eleven to get something to eat. I got a chocolate bar and H20 (magpaka scientific ba?). Then i was bound to the gates again. It was like getting inside of one of those rock concerts (as if naman i had gone to one.hehe) ang daming tao!! college peeps!! No, maybe i was just exaggerating sa kadamihan ng tao hndi lng cgro ako sanay. (just so u know guys, my status at that time -> nangsspot ng cutie!.sori guys.sad to say konti lng nakita ko.landi.hehe) "hirap naman mag isa". tas punta ko sa guard where i had to leave my id and sign in achu chu. xmpre nagtanong tanong kaya un nakarating. nakuha ko ung form.   Second spot was at La Salle taft. Same thing, i had to get an application form. (hayup.pra kong nag aapply ng trabaho ah!) I also went into the same procedure of the guard getting my id and signing chuva in the log book. It was the same thing, but Lasalle was more organized than FEU (in my opinion lng ha) Pero UST pa rin ako. gs2 ko dun mag arl! ewn ko ba. Like i said, i hate comparing, so I won't elaborate more on the comparison. k? tas un. natapos ko na! i felt so accomplished kahit napaka simple lng ng ginawa ko. eh kc hndi ako sanay lumakad ng mag isa, sa manila pa.ikw? sanay ka? hndi rin cgro. good. parehas lng tyo ;)
