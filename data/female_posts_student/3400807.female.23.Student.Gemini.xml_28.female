So... Anthony's out in Washington D.C. for his annual conference. Which, incidentally, is why I was out there Wednesday through yesterday... Except that, obviously, he needs to stay for his conference, and I don't. So... I'm here, back home, with a week off work... and my husband is about 4,000 miles away. (Whoops, ok, I just checked, it's actually  urlLink 2,840 miles . So I was only off by a little over 1,000...) Anyway, the  point  is... I miss him. A lot. An awful lot, seeing as how I just saw him yesterday. Still... this is the first time we've really been apart since we've been married.  *thinks*  Actually, I'm almost positive it's the very first time we've been separate for evena night... And... I don't like it. At all. Silly, I guess, but I started crying on the plane, even though I'd seen him less than an hour before. But it hurt, and it felt weird to leave him there, to know I was going home to an empty house and that he wouldn't be coming home to me for a week... I was a nut last night and didn't want to watch a movie because it was something that looked like it would have an unhappy ending, with the guy about to get married and the bachelor party and all this stuff... I don't know. I just didn't want to see it. And I cried last night, too, when I went to bed. It wasn't as bad as it would have been, because  urlLink Ilsa  and I had a slumber party and watched  urlLink Miss Congeniality  and enjoyed the chick flick. Mostly we just visited and relaxed. It was nice to be home... but... then the lights went out and it was time to go to sleep, and all I could think was how   wrong   it felt not to have him next to me. Or at least in the same room. I could pretend, for a while, he was just up playing video games, but I kept waking up, reaching for him, and feeling this little catch in my throat when he wasn't there and I realized why. I know all this sounds terribly, horribly cheesy. I just... love him. And after I got off the phone with him (for the 3rd and final time) today, I started crying, because I just wanted him here so very much... and, actually, as I'm typing this, I'm tearing up yet again... I think it's going to be a   very, very long   week. So if I'm a bit mopey and whiny, please excuse me. It's ok, I'm still a newlywed, right? Less than a year??? Otherwise, just please forgive me if the newlywed excuse doesn't fly anymore.
