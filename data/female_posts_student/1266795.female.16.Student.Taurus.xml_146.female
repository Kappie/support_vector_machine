If I get in sometime this week, I'll have painful teeth as I go in for my biopsy on Monday. Argh...  I'll give everyone three guesses as to what I  did  do today. :P Let's just say it involved Ash, Kohl's, Dad's credit card, three new pairs of jeans, and two new shirts. (I didn't even chance glancing at the shoes.)   WOOHOO! PARTY TIME!  Here's the lowdown on Thursday: -  Ash's house  at  noon until Friday morning  - If you need a ride, tell me, because I'll gladly pick anyone up. There may be a slim chance that my ortho appointment will be rescheduled, but even so I can still pick people up sometime that day. -  BRING MUSIC!  (Try to gather up all your CD's from middle school. We're trying to remember the good times while creating some new ones, people! I'm bringing N*SYNC, BSB, and O-Town - just their single - but bring all that you have since some of mine are cassettes and, thus, they suck.) - As far as  food  goes: Ash is making pasta/garlic bread, Jane's in charge of another side, Ali's bringing drinks, and I've got cups/plates and dessert. (Hehe...) Ali's also bringing popcorn and chick flicks. - Bring some  money  with you. We're possibly going to go to the  movies  to see that one movie with the two guys going to White Castle. (I know that I could look it up, but I'm too lazy. Sorry. You all know what I'm talking about.) We also are planning to go to the  Circle Centre mall , so even if you don't buy anything while shopping, bring some cash for if we eat dinner downtown in the food court. - Bring  board games/picture albums/cameras  for when we're back at Ash's. - If you have  anything else party-ish  (disco balls, anyone? :P), bring it.  Questions? Call me.  "The strawberries and pineapples are having a nice, big family reunion. What were you thinking?"
