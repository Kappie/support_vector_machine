I haven't updated in about a week so:   Tuesday:   We packed the U-Hauls with all of our crap to move.  Wednesday:   I came home sick.  Which was more hassle then it was worth I think.  But we had to stay at Baymount cuz we couldn't get in our new house.  Oh well.  Thursday :  Unloaded all of our stuff in our new house  Friday:  Unpacked my room...some what.  Saturday:   I woke up and went to school to take the PSAT.  Ya...I don't think I did too well on that, but oh well what can I do now?  Then afterwards, Lizzie and I went to the mall for lunch and then she wanted to look for a formal dress which just was sorta depressing for me because you can't buy a dress if you don't have a date.  HINT! HINT!  After the mall I brought Lizzie back to school so she could pick up her car and then I came home and did some more unpacking.    Okay, so my life wasn't very interesting this week.  But, seriously, how could you top the show at the beginning of the week?  You can't!  FYI:  Relient K...If you like Christian music they're okay, but if you don't they're not such a good band.  So ya'll no, they're just not!    Randomness:  Lizzie, I saw that glare you gave me AP History when Mrs. leistra started talking about political parties and she's right I don't agree with everything but a majority of it I do.    night!
