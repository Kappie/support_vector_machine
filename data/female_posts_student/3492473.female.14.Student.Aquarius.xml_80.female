When I woke up this morning and walked into the living room, I glanced at the computer and found this note: "I unplugged the pc in the back so just plug it back in 2 use.... because it kept turning on by itself.... I'm NOT kidding. ~Eddie" Creepy huh? Well, I believed it because just yesterday morning I was sitting on the couch reading when the computer started making all these noises and turned on. I asked Eddie if there was anywhere he could turn on my computer from his computer in his room. He said no. This isn't the first time anything like this has ever happened before. One time I walked out through my back door and was going in the back yard as I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I figured it was my sister because her room is in the basement and my mom and brother were both on the other side of the house. When I got back in, I asked where my sister was and my mom said she was still sleeping. So then I asked who went downstairs and my mom said no one... And it wasn't like I was just hearing things, it was loud, big, footsteps... This other time, I was home alone and it was about midnight. I was in my room, listening to music pretty loud and I had to pee, so I went across the hall to the bathroom. When I got in the bathroom, I heard noise in the basement and footsteps in the hall... Suddenly, the volume of my music went down  a lot!  And no one was home to do it! All my family members have experienced some weird situation at our house...which led us to believe that a  ghost lives here too.  So what do you guys think? Do you believe in ghosts? Have you ever had anything freaky happen to you? I'd love to hear about it, use the comment-thing to get your stories to me! Thanks~
