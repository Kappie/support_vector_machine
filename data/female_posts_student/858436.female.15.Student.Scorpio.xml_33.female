We have 8 to 10 proofs and she won't tell us the number of steps either. That's such bullshit! Does she WANT everyone to flunk? Sure seems that way. I'm already a low C in that class. This isn't good.  WANTED: A date for the Christmas dance. *HINT HINT* :-P  Shoutouts (since I'm extremely bored): Kaci Jean: Love ya tons babe! We are gonna be soooo pumped to flunk this final in geometry! Pumped to flunk and ready to walk down the hallway of death! :-P Sara: I just want some freakin' implants! Uh... I said "did you..?" OMG I almost died! Allie: A Moment Like This! We're gonna whip out the spotlights and everything. Hehe.
