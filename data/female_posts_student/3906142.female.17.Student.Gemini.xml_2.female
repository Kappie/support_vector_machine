Today is my 2nd week in poly and well, so far so good. Nothing much to comment and felt numb in many ways.    Towards relationship, I have nothing much to comment. My heart seem to be drifting further away and don't know where it is going to land.   Today lectures are quite boring, because of the lecturer monotonous teaching and the long duration in school.    I reached home and tried on the uniform which I would be wearing for 3 years, starting from next month. Well, with the uniform on, I felt weird and nervous.The thought of having to wear that uniform for my attachment make me "shivered".    Tomorrow lesson starts at 11am and ends at 6pm again.. omg... what a long duration of break again!
