I was sure today was the day where I was going to say that we shouldn't get back together, and why I was acting the way I was when we were going out. I wanted to tell him everything like I did on my blog. But I couldn't. We said we'd meet at three, at lilac grove, or as he calls it the "strawberry" park. I really have no clue why he calls it that. I left early, and was at the spot where we were first together. The pond. I felt so relaxed, like nothing could go wrong. But already a lot of things did go wrong. I talked to myself, saying what I should say to him.    I don't really care what we are anymore Safee, either if we're enemies, or friends, I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want to have a relationship with any person, either if it's friends or more, I want honesty. I want a lot of things. That's why I'm sorry. I expected too much out of you. And I'm sorry for it. I'm sorry for everything that happened. I'm sorry I couldnt hold on to you...   After I thought that, I cried. I wiped them before Safee saw me. I walked over to the park and he wasnt there, I wanted to walk back to the pond. Then I had a feeling he came, and I looked back and saw him coming towards me. I walked to him. We talked. Walked over to the pond, that place where we shared something special. We were throwing rocks, having a competition of course. And he won, obviously. I'm getting weak. We actually just talked about stupid things, as usual. At the end, he said, "I don't think we should be together." I said yea, we shouldnt if we like other people. "We" didn't refer to me. I didn't have any feelings towards anyone else. The funny thing is, I've never felt so much in love than with any person other than Safee. I guess love makes you blind, but I'm not going to let one relationship break my spirit and motivation. All I think is that God created me to have this to give me experience, to let me find someone else special. For now, I guess I can look at the stars and think of joy, than think about sadness..
