All my friends laugh at me or it. {you probly will too}.I want to save enough money to buy land and have my drEAM HOUSE BEING BUILT. THE HOUSE WILL BE A SQUARE THAT IS A BIG HALL WAY GOING IN THE SQUARE SHAPE WITH ROOMS OFF THE HALL AND THE CENTER OF THE HOUSE WILL BE OUTSIDE. I want to be married and have two kids by the time i am 25. I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE AND HAVE 5 KIDS IN ALL AND ADOPT FIVE THAT R OVER 10 BECAUSE EVERYBODY ALWAYS GETS BABIES AND I WANT TO BE A PEDIATRICIAN R FORENSIC SCIENCE MAJOR. wRITE A NOVEL PAINT AND INTERIOR DECORATE MY HOSUSE IN MY SPAre time. oh but nobody thinks i can even come half way to my dream. Believe me i dont think the college part will be hard it is the finding a husbend who i love and money to do everything i want to do. my family has made me regret even thinking i could follow my dreams......maybe i should give up. This is all making me even more determined.
