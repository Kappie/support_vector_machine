You can join daily, no need to create an account, just follow the link until it says that you are fighting on my side. Anyway, this was suppose to be my "redesign website" weekend, but it has ended up as play KoC (Kings of Chaos) weekend. I am trying to catch up to the General, need some more troops and some turns so that I can overtake other people. Anyway, join my army.
