I haven't told Mom yet, she'll probably get it mixed up and ask me three times before it actually happens.  Homework that I really should do: Spanish Math ooh, study for that physio test.  I guess I'm not quite ready to break down and cry yet, but I have been very irritable lately. I remember talking to Katy's mom on the Davis trip and she said that she'd let Katy do whatever she wanted to do unless she ate, which kept irritability at a low. I love Katy's mom (haha, K, are you reading this?) More understanding than mine, by leaps and bounds. And she's so open about things! My mom, on the other hand, manages to bring out the worst in me. Maybe it's my intolerance, or her tendency to nag or her (and Grandma's) obsession with Grandma's birthday party, but I'm really not dealing with it well lately. But if I must go insane for AP season, I'm ok with this slipping away. It isn't the worst thing. So yeah. I'm grouchy. And stressed. And tired. And have a tendency to eat too much.  Rarrrrrrr.  Thinking about it, this is a very lame blog. Other people can confine their blogs to one set subject, like politics. Others use the traditional method of bolding and hyperlinking. I just ramble on and on and on.  Isn't it bliss? (aren't we a pair? me here at last on the ground, you in the air?) Send in the clowns.
