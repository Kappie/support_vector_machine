In this week I have had to say good-bye to many of my friends here in Derry who originally lived in other EU countries.  That has been hard, and harder yet is knowing that throughout the summer I am not going to be able to just randomly visit duncreggan (the student village) and see all my friends, as none of them will be there.    I am also questioning my life's ambitions.  Do I really want to start Clementine's Cookies and live here for many years.  Do I want to take that risk?  Will I be able to make an income to pay off my student loans?  And do I really want to stay here as I once thought I did?  None of these have answers and I haven't worried about these questions until today when I had time to let my mind wander and time to just think.  Its hard.  Since returning from Montana I am really questioning my place in the world.  What do I want to do with my life?  And if I can answer that question, how am I going to get there?    Being 20-something suck I have decided.  I lack direction and need guidance yet it seems everyone I know who has encountered such difficulties feels the same and has no recommendations on how to pass these years with out going through a quarter life crisis.  I know these are some of the best years of my life, but the quarter life crisis has kicked in full gear!  Booo!!!
