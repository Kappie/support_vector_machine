I'm using this as an outlet for my anger, hoping that I'll feel better... *thinking* hmm, nope, NOT BETTER! I need something to smash, something to pound my head on... and yet at the same time, doesn't attract attention. It's times like these when I really start to see the pointlessness of life. Well, I think my "boil" has settled down to a "simmer", but I'm still angry. Maybe when I post again, I'll be feeling better.
