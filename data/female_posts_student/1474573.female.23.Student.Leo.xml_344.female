And he reminds me of how I skirted around all the cars waiting in line at the exit and how I kinda sorta cut a few people off in the process... and how one of them happened to be him.  So I basically told him the truth. "Look, Bob, I really have no patience to wait on line when I'm trying to get to work on time." And he laughed at me.  But really, who wants to wait in line when the exit is wide enough to fit me and someone else there?  So I have a little impatience while driving.  So what if I mutter (or yell) a curse out the window when someone doesn't do what I want to or doesn't allow me to do what I want (usually means speeding) on the road... I mean, really people!!  I don't rudely cut off people.  I mean, I do it quite nicely, but when you've got your turn signal on, you better be turning, is all I'm sayin.
