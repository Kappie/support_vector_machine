I ate so much crap today though, I need to run.. I walked home is that good enough? My mom yelled at me. She is "disappointed" again.      No work until Friday, when I work -what? A 4 hour shift? Swickedness. My feet hurt though.       No one is on so Im trying to convince myself to go to bed... Go to bed. Hopefully it will be sunny tomarrow so that I can sit outside and do nothing and tan  all  day. I love summer.      I wrote Kate aletter today. I was talking to her mom at work and she said it isnt too late to send one, and it reminded me that I should write one. So I did. Its pretty long too, and its basically me reminising [ach! I will never be able to spell that..] about our countless good times in ancient history. When both of us showed up that is.       Listening To : Nirvana Unplugged in NY , the newest cd to my ever-growing collection.
