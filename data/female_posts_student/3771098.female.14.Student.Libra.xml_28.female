Rushmore, and BUFFALO!!! How awsome is that? Today was better. Me and Kayla and Reba are okay now. We all appoligized. The ride was so boring though. I couldn't sleep so I just sat there for like hours. Fun. Not.   We went to see an old Lakota woman tonight. Her name was Aunt Nellie. She has 109 grandchildren and 34 of them are great grandchildren. How crazy is that? Oh yeh, when I wear Joel's yellow hat, I look like a soccer mom. No lie. It's rather funny. Me and Amez and Jenhave matching anklets from the Crazy Horse place. They're really neat. Tomorrow we go to Wounded Knee Cemetary. I like how close i'm getting with my van. I don't miss home yet, but I do miss sweet tea! Oh yeh, they dont' call it soda or coke here, they call it Pop. I hate that. And the tea is iced tea. Not sweatened, and they're like, there's sugar on the table. I'm just like no, i'ts not the same. Well I gotta go. It's also cool to have Jenn here too. I haven't seen her in like over 2 years.
