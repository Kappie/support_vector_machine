I'll try to organize it, but bear with me please.   1. The Coffee Shop Sessions  Tuesday has officially become dinner at 3 AM night with my dad. He's working on this letter, condeming the unethical practices of the shareholders at the limo company he works at Communicar Inc. Here's an Excerpt:   "....The divide is not about race, nor is it about differences in either ethnicity or nationality. It’s about right and wrong. It is about the duplicitous actions of this board, the double standard practices that have become typical of this administration......"   sound vaguely not surprising?   "Our plan is to effectively stop this machinery of corruption, deceit and bring Communicar back to respectability. Finally our plan is to make equitable distribution  THE LAW  ..........."   Yeah the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.t ooooooooo....machinery of corruption? words to make any leftist girl just swoon And you WONDER where I get my attitude from??!! ;) Add to that my sarcasm, aggressive debate style and my ability to emasculate psuedo intellectual liberal arts boys in a single bound!  Editing this letter was a trying affair to say the least, but as annoyed as I get editing his shit,I'm very proud of him. I've  always wanted to be just like him.Smart logical, inspiring ....  He's taught me about morality, about standing up for what you believe in, about staying in touch with my humanity amidst a world that consistently tries to strip it away. Anyway the letter is finished and it's dope. It's got the Board ready to run with it's tail between it's legs, hopefully the drivers will sue and get their due...   urlLink COMMUNICAR INC  and COMMUNICAR CORRUPTION COMMUNICAR HANS ROY COMMUNICAR UNFAIR ETHICAL PRACTICES COMMUNICAR COMMUNICAR COMMUNICAR MTV,COMMUNICAR AOL TIME WARNER, COMMUNICAR THEFT, THIEVERY, THIEVES,COMMUNICAR, COMMUNICAR DRIVERS, COMMUNICAR FAQ,COMMUNICAR, UNION, COMMUNCAR HANS ROY, DIANE ROY, YOLANDE ROY, LENNY, Naveed Sheikh  yeah that should be enough for the google search engines ;) don't mess with the Roy cosa nostra   moving on.....    2.

This message was brought to you by   THE LETTER "M"  ...yes folks someone typed in  the letter M and came to my site. I tried it again and it didn't work but sitemeter NEVER lies.   3.  Speaking of GOOGLE SEARCHES  I recently got THIS email:    john hunter   wrote:  hi,   did you know you are a  urlLink googlewhack?    -John     4. Poetry 4 Beer   My friend Amelie just asked me to do a show on saturday. Honestly It'll just be a chance to hang out with her again. This girl friggin rules! (And Fish she's white and single)She's a  Eugene Lang alum,fighting the goodfight and right now I miss my radical lang friends :)I'm actually looking forward to fall, even though most of my buds have graduated.If you have any angry political poems that you wanna spit in exchange for free boos hit me up  urlLink backchannel.  It's a  urlLink party to help register African American Voters,  so yes it's for a good cause and you'll get heard and get drunk.    5. The Psych Sessions   No matter how much I beg, my therapist simply REFUSES to give me drugs. Seriously! If you don't know, or have had your eyes shut every time you've  seen me, I've spent that past (don't want to specify)in a deep, deep, deep  depression. What's made me feel so hopeless lately is not the pain, but how used to it I am right now, how I've spent most of my life living in survival mode. I've been up to my ears in self analysis, trying to figure out what's wrong with me,what keeps me in this place. I know entirely TOO many people who love this state, who DEPEND on this state, to write, to relate, to love, to whatever. I'm not one of them. I WANT to get better, I'm fighting to get better. I don't care if I never write another damn fucking poem, a short story, a blog entry. I would gladly give that up for happiness, to be able to love freely, peacefully. Does that make me less dedicated to my craft? I don't think so, i'm just not willing to sacrifice my sanity for the sake of my art. Personally, I find having to be depressed to right, a shitty crutch. I mean seriously everyone does it.....writing just to get through? Well that's fine, but that can't be what ALL of your work is about or other wise I can't really respect you as a writer. What do I respect? Vision and it's really hard to see in the darkness at the bottom of the barrell.....  So anyway....She won't give me drugs. She says that so far all my problems are external  My response:   "So can I get a prescription for homocide?"   she laughed. I didn't.  There is an epidemic of depression going on. Maybe I'm too sensitive, maybe I set my sights on people entirely too high and set myself up  for dissappointment....but that's not it. I can make a list of things not going right in my life and if I were to win the jackpot tomorrow, I could probably slice half of what ills me off that list.  My generation is the first to  do significantly worse than their parents.  urlLink Right now we are facing higher unemployment then during the Great Depression.   In the past year I know three people (including myself) who've attempted suicide for one reason or another ranging from deep depression to manic attacks to (me) bad drug interactions....Between the New School University and NYU we've had about 5 suicides one on my floor in the room across the hall from me. I’ve spent most of the past semester administering suicide watches for my residents. Approximately 2/3 of them are on some sort of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic. The 16 year old girl down the hall is a recovering coke-addict, and she’s one of The  “normal” ones. Coincidence?  It’s as if there is a cancer of the soul spreading through this nation. MLK predicted this in  His 1969 vietnam speech:   urlLink   “This business … of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of people normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”     And here we are. We closet ourselves from the world with our cellphones and walkmans and ipods. Looking someone in the eye is an act of overt aggression. It’s ok to not know your neighbors, fuck the person in front of you, they are in your way And you’ve got to  Get  Get Get Get Get ……………..get *sigh…….  Anyway  urlLink  5. A Nod to Guys commentary on Kerry’s ineffectual-ness   I’ve got a new conspiracy theory. The reason why Kerry’s platform is so close to Bush’s is because they are in the urlLink  same camp.  We are just being given the ILLUSION of democracy. I doubt if Bush  actually really cares if he wins or loses because the Kerry administration will be acting in his interest ANYWAY. The war for oil control in Iraq will continue and Bush money will be safe. Don’t believe me? Check THIS out…..yeah, these jackasses are bloodbrothers.  urlLink YES! They are both Skulls!  Choose or Lose? Give me a break! WHAT FUCKING CHOICE????  Just same old U.S. business as usual double speak. I’m sure the Thought Police are going to be knocking down my door soon…..  I really feel bad for P-diddy in his Vote Or Die rally.  It’s sad really. It’s really nice that he’s getting people to register to vote, but that assumes that you have a choice, Both candidates pretty much agree on everything, just Kerry couches a lot nicer. I’ve decided that I’m going to Audition for American Idol, just so that I can wear my Kucinich or Death T-shirt.  Fuck America, you complacent Mother Fuckers!    6. To Continue on My anti-american rant.   How do we win the War on Terror? WE ARE THE TERROR! Jesus Christ! Don’t believe me?  urlLink  Go here To check out the U.S. plan for Global domination.  Iraq is only the beginning  With this kind of aggressive , imperialistic foreign policy , we are setting ourselves up for attack and this constant state of war only serves to further legitimize the current administration. WAKE UP!   7. Ok a break from all that Hate  Now that Fish has retired his blog, and Guy’s ill placed cubicle prevents him from posting as often as I’d like I’ve had to go elsewhere for my daily blog updates. I’ve  Also devised a blog wish list.   Top 5 People Who should Have Blogs and Don’t  1.	Salome Gonzalez………she’s the OTHER malcontent  Ok I can’t think of any other ones right now,but please feel free to add to this list. Sal, please get a blog. It would be sooooooooooooo fun.  wow.... I feel a little better now :)  I'm gonna go live long and prosper
