I need sleep, but I can't, have to work on crap.  It was initiation day for the new cheerleaders today. Evidently making an ass of oneself should be a part of every cheerleaders life. 'course, they  are  cheerleaders so that's sort of a given. Anyway, initiation involved forcing them to wear garbage bags and toilet paper for clothes before they could join the squad. So they all showed up wearing garbage and no make-up. Steph and I were laughing our asses off at them. Helen took it a step further at lunch, she poured salad dressing in some cheerleader's leather purse when they weren't looking. Lucia, Alice, Helen and I barely made it into the halls before we burst out laughing.  Talking to my dad a few nights ago when the subject of 4th grade camp came up. My dad used to volunteer for the school district when I was in elementary school and he used to help with the annual school camping trips. In the fourth grade my best friend was a boy named Brian who lived with his uber-bitch grandmother, Dorothy. This lady hated me and my dad for no reason. So one morning at camp Brian and I were eating breakfast together and his grandmother sat down at our table. I was doing my best to ignore her (which was hard because she was over 400Lbs) when my dad came over and sat next to me. And all hell broke loose in front of a table of 10-year-olds. Dorothy: "You can't sit HERE! Go somewhere else." Dad: "You know what the great thing about being an adult is? I can pay you to go fuck yourself, bitch. Why don't you sit somewhere else?" Dorothy (turning red): "I... never..." Dad: "Well, now you have. Now fuck off."  Everyone just sat around stunned. I love my daddy. :)  Steph scared Mr. F today. Someone was complaining about how much Tech class sucks again and Mr. F very loudly "I really love you all, but..." And Steph leaped up and kissed him on the cheek and screeched "I LOVE YOU TOO!" directly in his ear. You have to love Steph.
