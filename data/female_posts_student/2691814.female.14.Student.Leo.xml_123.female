The crying has not stopped. Today, will not be happy, nor tomarrow. I feel very sad right now. I don't want to cry around my friends but i know its gonna happen cuz i know that sam is going to be ballin. But, maybe our sex ed teacher will make us laugh today. There must be a moment to laugh. or giggle. and i really hope that eddie doesn't get in a fight on the bus today. I mean..me and franny were trying to tell eddie 'remember, you get suspended and it'll go on till next year' which is true. and its not worth the fight anyway. But oh well, i may hold him back if necessary or i'll let keith do it cuz he sits next to him. But ya, a fight wouldn't suprise me one bit.  and hopefull my phone will still be hooked up today. and hopefully the computer will too. That would suck if its not....sigh....
