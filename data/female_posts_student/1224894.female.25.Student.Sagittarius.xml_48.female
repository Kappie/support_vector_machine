Blogging, I think would be a big help for me, if only I have the determination to write. If I had been a writer, this would be what they call  “writer’s   block”,  which I can’t really comprehend, if this means mental block or the block where a writer lives. Oh well, I’d like to call this temporary block as… temporary dementia .   As I happen to scan through old things, I was caught again in the drama of my life. It’s not as if my life is “teleserye-worthy”, but it does have its perks and frustrations, just like a “teleserye bitin moment”. I believe, I’m still in the stage where I want to be pleased, not because I am primadonna-ish, but it’s because I got used to wait up and please people that now, I want to put a stop to that and want my turn, just this once.    Am I selfish? I don’t think so. Is it bad that I just want a little bit of their time? I want to feel their presence. I just want to feel them. As I stare at the blank wall in front of me, vivid imaginations come to life, which I believe would lead to a disturbing image that would lead again to the destruction of a good thing.  What am I saying? Oh well, blame it on the dementia I’m experiencing now. My turn is yet to come. I’m still young and I’m not in a hurry to settle down and be among the rational…or is it the other way around? Haaay! I am a bit jaded, and careful, but one cannot be too careful, because I tend to trust easily, which often than not, result to catastrophe. Such dire predictions would surely bring the negative vibes swarming around me. Yet, hope is just a glimpse away, not too unreachable, still hovering close by.   I just hope I won’t fall too fast and feel too hard…I just might break.
