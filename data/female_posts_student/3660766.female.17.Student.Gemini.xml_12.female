I think that was my major prob. That isnt like me either. Im usually laid back and if something happens it happens and i completely did a 180 and turned into the people i used to crack jokes on, so im gonna stop and let things fall into place, and if they dont, then i was made out to be an old shrew lol Onto my night, Well tonight krissy and i decided to see what the hell was going on with the whole andrea thing, lemme break it down for ya.. 1. andrea made rude comments about me and my friends 2. I fucked up her car with choc. syrup and shit and it ruined parts of her engine and not to mention took forever to wash off lol :) 3. she assumed it was me, without any proof 4. i denied it and was like ur crazy 5. found out derek told her the whole shindig including all the details (hes aNUTSTAIN!) 6. admitted it and made her feel like shit while doing it 7. she came back and said all my friends werent my friends 8. i told them about it and they went crazy on her and now she feels even more like shit 9. im happy :)  There i broke it down for everyone lol  well after that was all worked out, i got to punch the shit out of derek and hurt my hand in doing it, then he was trying to get something from me and he grabbed my wrist and like broke the fucker, it like popped and a sharp pain went thru my arm and i yelped in pain lol then he did it to the other one on accident. So i tried to wrestle him to the ground but i completely forgot he is a tackle on the football team and he took me out and knocked the wind out of me, and at this point im all beaten and bruised lol then we left dereks and got mountain dew, my forbidden fruit! lol and we strolled meijer with these grandma sunglasses on and then came home, not too shabby for a thurs night. Tomorrow night tho is gonna be another story and I cant even explain the fun we are gonna have sat night when rara comes home, She called today and she was telling me how she got fucked up and woke up in her own vomit, THATS MY GIRL! :) k im outtie! tootlez!!
