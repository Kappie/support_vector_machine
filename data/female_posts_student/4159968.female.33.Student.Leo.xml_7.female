I was tired of "boys" coming to me looking for a way to redeem themselves for wanting to engage in what basically amounted to an affair and caused me to feel more used than a $2 whore... something like a piece of meat. They would tell me they had no limits but when asked about their wife (as in did she know he was negotiating with a domme or even looking into it) they would eventually admit they were not telling them. They were constantly comparing the dommes they did play with and if you did not "measure up" in an area you could be sure all the subs would not approach you to play in that area. The dommes were giving the impression like the entire scene was a competition. Who could play with the most "boys" or who could make the most "boys" safe out. Most of the dommes treated the "boys" as if they were interchangeable and disposeable. Whether these two attitudes fed on each other or not ... it was not something I could deal with on a constant basis. So I left. With my husband out of the country and all the added stresses... I felt that was one I could drop. I left my personal information on 2 sites and stayed on the discussion group but I stopped attending fucntions and gatherings. I am not a one time play partner. I like being able to get to know someone. Over the last year of low activity from me, I have gotten maybe 5 contacts via these sites. None panned out when they learned I had not done cyber domme and did not want a cyber slave. So when another email came in from someone with dom in their name ... well, honestly, I figured it was another crack pot wanting to tell me that women were not made to dominate but instead to be dominated (yes I got about 3 of those a week when I was active). Imagine my surprise when within 3 emails I found an intelligent, funny man who already had made me laugh. He was appropriate in his greetings without being simpering. And he peaked my interest. We began conversing on im and I doubt I have laughed that much in my life. Even for being a smart ass he is hilarious. We can talk as friends and that is a huge bonus to me. We managed to meet ... and I was impressed. I was almost afriad I would have to go into big bad domme mode for the entire time but instead I was able to relax and be myself. Something I prefer greatly anyway since I already wear enough masks. First impressions? well for some reason the word imp pops into my head. Mischevious. But not flighty. It is hard to describe what was going through my head at the end when we decided we would like to try to get together. I was flattered that I made such an impression I suppose. Then despite myself the worries set in. I have been through a lot in life and most of it was caused by males umm well basically lying to me. I subconsciously made the decision to give it a few days and see if the attitude changed. I suppose I have been expecting it to, and it has not. He is still as interesting and fun and I have to stop making things so hard. Today on the drive home I ran over many things in my head. I think I was worried because I do not have a real playroom set up yet... have to deal with the dogs 99% of the time... am not as experienced in varied things... and had to admit to myself that I was just as nervous about the first time as he probably would be. Ok this is getting too fractured... time for a break..
