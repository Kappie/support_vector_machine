Just kidding! It was pretty good! We watched a documentary about women and their struggle for justice. I loved it, being that I am a feminazi. But, there was this one awful, awful woman. She was almost everything I hate in a person, in one person. She was from Texas, she was stupid, and I just hated her! She goes, "We really had everything, nobody should have complained. We were all happy." BULLSHIT- being a slave to a man is not life! Then they talked about Roe vs. Wade and she says, "I saw it in the paper (tears) and I just couldn't believe it! (Dramatically crying when it is obviously for attention only) I knew I just (can't get the words out cause she's crying so hard) had to do something!" It was so obnoxious. She should go back to Texas with all the other losers from Texas, i.e. BUSH! ABB- Anything But Bush! (p.s. I got the "Rock Against Bush CD" it's good, check it out!) That made me remember when I was in Washington on the march, and I heard this baby crying, and I said to Erica, "That baby is crying for injustice!" We thought it was funny. Anyways, then we had our last actual math class with a lesson. It was kind of sad. I had some good times in that class. Let's reflect. 1. "Karen and I had fun on number 69!"-Ms. Potts 2. Me yelling at Ann to do her math homework every night! 3. Ms. Potts always hating me... "What did you do now, Allison?!" Oh it was just so wonderful! I'll miss it. Spanish is taking over my life. I'm going to do so badly this quarter, really it's not good. Health was awesome! We had pizza and then listened to the drug speaker, Sgt. Powell. Somebody threw a candy at Megan Quinn, and it hit her in the boob! She yelled that it had hit her in the boob, and Ms. Faidiga said, "Maybe it'll swell and you'll have a good weekend!" Can you believe that!? She really said it! I was dying. Then Megan kept drinking Mountain Dew- oh that's not a good thing for her. But no, she was well-behaved. The drug stuff was interesting. After school, I went home with Chels to study for the SAT. But did we study? NO! We went to see Mean Girls. It was really good, I don't regret going! Then we went to the McDonald's drive-thru. When we were ordering, I kept yelling out "YOu have a hot voice!" and other things. HE was so annoyed with us, so we were finishing ordering and he goes "Is that all?  IS THAT ALL? " WE WERE SO SCARED! The food was good. We did come home and study a little. Then Chelsea told me the plan on how to take the test for somebody else and they take it for you... etc. resulting in you getting a really good grade. So I called EC up at like 10:30 and tried to get her into the plan. HAHAHA She said no. I probably wouldn't have done it either. But it was really funny. I ended up spending the night at Chelsea's, so we had to go print our admission tickets out at her mom's. We started watching Dateline about this knocked-up 17 year old. It was awesome. I told Chelsea all my stupid, funny stories, we bonded. Her brother and his friends were being loud that night, damn freshman. It was great. The test was so hard. It should die. Then we went to lunch and it was yummy. This little girl kept sticking her hand in her brother's butt, and only stopped when Chelsea saw her. Then I went to see Envy with Liz, it was so bad don't see it. We hung out until I had to go babysit back in Bexley. They were new, I'd never met them before. The boy was annoying. He was better at everything than me. Plus he would not let me help him when he was taking a bath. I said, "Well I won't come in, I'll just be out here in your room." He replied, "No you won't. You'll be out there and my door will be shut." Okay, fine. They were okay, I got like $50 for 4.5 hours. It was sweet. I babysat AGAIN this morning. AHH KIDS SHOULD DIE! Sofia, a little girl, never ever speaks, but today she wouldn't shut up! Then all of these kids just barged in and were being really bad. It was sad, they were really in-bred. I wanted to go to the Allister show tonight with Anna, but my mom is being an ass wipe and an evil dictator. So I'm not studying for chem right now, oops oh well. Just another bad grade to add to... JUNIOR YEAR FROM HELL!
