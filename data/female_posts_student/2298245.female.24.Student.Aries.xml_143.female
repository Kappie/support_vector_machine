It has not been a good couple of days, as you can tell from this recap:  ~I almost threw up during my landing at LaGuardia yesterday.  It was very bumpy and hot and I couldn't reach my air thing.  As soon as we landed it was fine.  But the thought still lingers.  ~The bookstore doesn't have one of my books, and they guy told me it would probably take two weeks to get it.  I try to give people the benefit of the doubt (well...sometimes I do), but there is really something wrong with the intelligence of the people who work at the bookstore here at St. John's.  Not to say anything against the guy who helped me - he was very nice and it isn't his fault the book wasn't there.  I need it for Monday, so I will have to go on a quest to find it now.  Or I'll just copy someone else's pages until the books are in stock.  ~The bookstore charged me for highlighters and then didn't give them to me, which means I have to go back in there and deal with the people again.  The girl checking me out even asked if they were mine as she was bagging my stuff.  Oh well...  ~Oh, yeah, and I'm back at school when it's just about the last place I want to be.  In fact, I almost didn't come back at all.  But here I sit, ready to embark on another semester.  I am halfway through, so hopefully, it will all be over soon, and relatively painless at that.  Depressed.  And back.  But still trying to see the bright side of life...
