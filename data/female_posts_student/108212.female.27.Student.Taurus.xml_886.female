Good tip, Net.  I'm thinking of turning Golden Sushi into an online mag (we're keeping the blog of course -- just moving it to goldensushi.net/blog or blog.goldensushi.net instead) will you guys write for me?  I figured Daf will do the M section (movies and music) and Net can do T (tech and travel).. What do you guys think?
