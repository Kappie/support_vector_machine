I was going to take off today, but I figured since one counselor has been absent the whole week and since tonight was suppose to be talent show, the smart thing was to go to work. This morning, I took six of my campers up to the front to work on our banner for talent show. We worked really hard on it, and so far it looks pretty good! I had no clue what the talent show people wanted it to look like, so I took my best guess, and if they don't like it, oh well, they'll live. So yea, after lunch, I was going to take the 6 kidsback to the front, but it started to downpour. We had about 100 people under the pavil' (how gangster). It was gross, but the rain was so pretty. I seriously thinkrain is one of the most beautiful things on earth. I'm serious! So of course, all the kids have to go to the bathroom right in time for it todownpour, soI ran them over to the bathroom, and right when I go into the bathroom for cover, the whole soccer camp is there and wouldn't make room for me. Thanks guys, great way to show sportsmanship! Anyway. we get back, I boughtan icee with my brother (which I later gave to Chrisbecause he really really wanted it). Haha, the best quote "You gota vanilla ice? I've never had a vanilla ice before! HAHAHAHA VANILLA ICE! Ice, ice baby!" Haha me andLarisa had a good laugh from that. So, after that, I came home. I tried to make plans with Christie, but we had no clue where we wanted to go, so we ended up not doing anything.Oh well, it was a really calm evening. I watched Wheel of Fortune and Spider-Man. I wanted to watchthe Power Rangers Movie (to relive my childhood) but I'm very sad to report that my mother indeed threwit out *tear*.   So tomorow I get to wake up early to go to the DMV. Oh what fun! If anyone wants to do anything tomorrow, let me know. Maybe Six Flags? I'm not so sure. I'm sick of people's cockiness and how they think god hates them because something conflicts with their schedule. Boo frickity hoo, grow up. I'm still waiting for you to ask me how I am. Butthat's too much to ask...I'm sorry for my existance. So yea. I better go. Bye guys! and comment!
