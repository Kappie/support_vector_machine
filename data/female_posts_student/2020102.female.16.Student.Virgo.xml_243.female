Simply insert long overdrawn pauses into your speech - this will treble the impact of whatever you are saying.    Lesson 2 - "Word-stretching". Repeat the following phrases 3 times, whilst shaking your fist in the air. Remember to grimaceâ€¦   "SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS-pock"  "UUUUUUUUUUUUU-HUra"  "KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-n"   Lesson 3 - Combine what you have learnt from both exercises.  Repeat the following phrase, converting it to Shat-Speak using the above techniques.   "Spock, please contact Lieutenant Uhura, and inform her to hail Khan's ship."   Note: If you've learnt these techniques correctly, it should take you approximately 2 minutes to complete that sentence.
