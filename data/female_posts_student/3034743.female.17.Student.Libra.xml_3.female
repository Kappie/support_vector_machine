It will be nice seeing all my friends again. Hopefully this will be a good week. I think it will. Prom is this weekend, so that will be fun - I hope. Yesterday I was talking to Josh and he asked me what my favorite love song was, and that inspired me to create a top 5 list. Here it is: #5- Total Eclipse Of The Heart by Bonnie Tyler #4- I Wanna Know What Love Is by Foreigner #3- At Last by Etta James #2- Take My Breath Away by Berlin #1- Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers It was hard deciding between the Berlin song and the R.B. one to be at the top of my list. Haha. This is probably really boring to read. Oh well, only like 4 people probably read it. Speaking of boring, Martin was being an ass to me last night. We were just talking and then he called me a "library girl" and said that I "am boring and no fun, and find fascination in the most simplest things." What the hell is his problem? oh well. (Oh yeah, and Josh...I figured out what 143 means.) Well, that is it from me for now!
