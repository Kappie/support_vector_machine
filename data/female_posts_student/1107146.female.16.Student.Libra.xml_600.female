That was in response to my thinking, "Shit, I'm about to choke really bad," but I couldn't do anything because of how under I was.  O yes, the amnesics. I actually remembered all of yesterday. The biggest rememberance was that of wanting opium. Fuck, I've really been wanting a hit all day. I told my mom, "no opiates" but nobody's listening to little old me. So now I'm addicted to smack with no obvious or forthcoming relief.   As to the amnesic: it's weird. I have little blank spots in yesterday, I try really hard but I can't remember what happened. Most of it is centered after coming out of the hospital. I remember burping a lot and stumbling off the curb once in front of a dumptruck. It was parked, so I can't give the "I almost died!" excitement.  That excitement should be reserved for the GI room where I died. It felt like dying, anyway. Or looked like it.   Oh. The opium. OH.
