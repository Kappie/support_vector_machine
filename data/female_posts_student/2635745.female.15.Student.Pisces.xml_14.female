Yah.  i went to the mall to pick up a skirt and i looked at those new foam pillows but they were forty bucks but then later i went back and my mom lied and said she spent like 600 dollars there for christmas but she only spent one hundred and they knocked 15 bucks off the price.  this has been another happy day.  oh he who shall remained unamed lets call him george emailed me today.  he wanted me to help him with something but i can't say cuz it would give him away.  ta ta for now
