Karma   We didn't go tonight after all, bc some people bailed, leaving only 3 of us interested in going-and then WE bailed, bc we're are lame-o's and are tired from working at evil FB all day.  That's why I'm writing this right now instead, but no worries-next weekend will be fun for all...WILD COUNTRY and various other entertainment!   Night Cream   IT'S WORKING, you jerks. Just FYI Dan, Joe, and Donald: (I forgot to post this in my SB re-cap) On Spring Break, we went into a casino, and I got carded, and Victoria DIDN'T-and she's a year younger than me-so HA! So I look 20. You can never be to careful when it comes to prevention and maintenance.   Confederate Flags   More SB-I forgot about this, but we only saw a couple on Spring Break-one over a Civil War cemetary (very appropriate, in my opinion), and one on the Mississippi flag-as you may know, it has the Confederate flag in the corner.  However, Victoria obviously hadn't gotten over her yankee suburban-ness and shrieked every time she saw one like it was the Grim Reaper or something.  Sheesh. It was just a flag. And I'm still mad I couldn't find postcards w/ one on it to send to everyone. Boooooooo...   I Believe In A Thing Called Love   Actually, I don't know if I do or not. But this is about the song-it was played entirely too much over SB-however, it's oddly addictive, I'm ashamed to admit.  Although I have the horrible image of the jigga-dance in my head every time I listen to it (thank you Dan, for sharing the tape w/ all of us-now it haunts me).   Songs of the Moment    Every now and then -Garth Brooks  Desperado -The Eagles  I Believe in a Thing Called Love -The Darkness  Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)- Garth Brooks  The Heart of the Matter -Don Henley  When the Sun Goes Down -Kenny Chesney  -they are all very significant at this time for one reason or another.   To sum up...   I realize this was the most random of posts-now, w/o futher ado, I'm going to bed-tomorrow I have to work AND do muchas paper-writing, bc I refuse to procrastinate anymore this semester. Yick-only 16 credit hours...only 16 more...that's what I keep telling myself.
