So my mom was like I can't believe we let you go up there like that, because it was bothering me up there a lil bit. Now, my mom like it's been over 2 weeks, it could be something serious and is getting worse. My philosophy was, hey if it bothers me in Texas then it'll bother me in Nebraska and I'd rather spend my time there. So, I get to go tomorrow and get all these tests done and yeah, I'm gonna have fun...   Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain  But I'd of had to miss the dance
