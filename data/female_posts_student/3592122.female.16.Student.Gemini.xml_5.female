I brought the child into the world with pain and labor. She should be in my custody."  >  >  >The judge turns to the husband and says: "What do you have to say in Your defence?"  >  >  >The man sat for a while contemplating.. then slowly rose: "Your Honor. If I put a dollar in a vending machine and a Pepsi comes out.. whose Pepsi is it .. the machine's or mine?"   I do not agree with this but it is quite funny!! so laugh it up!!
