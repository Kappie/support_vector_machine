She said, "I just don't think I'm ready for a boyfriend."  Which directly contradicts anything she has ever said to me.  She said too that if it was ok with me we could still be friends and all.  I said that was fine, the next morning I went over to her locker to talk to her.  I said hi, she mumbled something, slammed her locker, and ran off.  I was somewhat confused by this, after all, we were still supposed to be friends.  Later that morning, her and a group of her friends were talking (they were actually mutual friends, I didn't just walk over there) so I walked over and I kid you not five seconds later she looks over, gets this look on her face and runs in the other direction.  So, who knows.  I evidently suceeded in pissing her off last night at a track meet by hitting on another girl.  Whatever...  So that pretty much sums it up, she contradicts herself, and runs from her problems.  So that should give you a little bit of vindication or whatever.  Oh, I read Abby's email.  Damn.  I am afraid to open Z's though.  What do you think?  Michael
