I think the reasons for this travesty being:  1) Whenever I begin something, which is very rare, I enter it with a passion and go to extremes (yep that's right, even online blogs...) 2) Evidently, I have too much free time on my hands, this being the summer holiday 3) I talk a lot and have far too much random and boring crap to say...  Btw, I take thos oppurtunity to DEFEND NEIL DIAMOND, who has been defined as crappy old music and an old geyser by a charming friend of mine... OK, whatever you think of the man, (I don't like *him* for goodness' sake), the following songs are, in my humble opinion, excellent:   Play Me  (  HAS   to be a classic I   LOVE   it)  Kentucky Woman   Solitary Man   I'm A Believer   Shilo   Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon     Give it a chance, eh? At least listen with an open mind before coming out with judgemental inadvised crap...
