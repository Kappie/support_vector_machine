I didn't get to see anyone else apart from my own family...Holidays are good once in a while, but long holidays are certainly not for me. I missed the big crowd, the noisy chattering, the band practices, the sectionals times, the humour, the times we've pulled through... Just two days and there was not a single band practice held. Just two days is enough to drive me crazy... There was not a clarinet to play, or to practise. There's nothing to distract me from my thoughts...There's just homework and still more homework, awaiting for us to complete all. Worries above worries to be troubling about. You call this a  holiday !? Next week, there's the PTM [Parent Teacher Meeting] about the streaming of sec2. So Band practice is once again delayed. There's also the family day fun fair on the very same day. Of course, plus the IPW presentation, which I've no idea when and the common tests. Sigh. My bag broken, my homework undone, the things that had happened...my thoughts. Two guys, one down and I don't know about the other. Something I regretted is letting  someone  read my blog... It was positive that now she knew everything...
