Her  urlLink "feeling the hate"  post today about subway and street harassment reminds me of my number one favorite New York City subway story:  Back in 2000, I was on the 4 train to Brooklyn at rush hour.  It was crowded but not the kind where you are all mashed up against one another and you mistake someone's you-know-who for a briefcase.  The next thing we knew, however, a great cry rang out:  "Oh, no!  You fucked with the wrong bitch TODAY!"  All of a sudden this lady whipped out her very long umbrella and was whacking a guy with the handle over and over. He backed away with his palms out, like, "Ow! Ow! No!"  And he was blinking a whole lot because she was hitting him in the face-- the eye!  After that it got even better though, when she flipped the umbrella around to the sharp end and jabbed him, through the train and right out the door, all the while reminding him of which bitch he fucked with today.  After that all the ladies were smirking and most of the men were looking nervous.  And I am not making that up just for effect.
