The Democratic National Committee has also started its own blog,  urlLink Boston D Party , written by  urlLink Matt Stoller  and former Al Gore speech writer  urlLink Eric Schnure .  The Republicans have followed suit and will issue press passes to select bloggers for their own convention which takes place in late August. The party has not yet published its own official convention blog, but one is in the making.   The site that brought political blogging into the mainstream,  urlLink Howard Dean's Blog for America , is still alive and kicking, and gearing up for the big political season.  Now that bloggers have been given a real voice in this election, I hope one of those press passes doesn't go to  urlLink Washingtonienne .
