Things have been a little shaky in my life lately, but hopefully that'll be over now that term paper is turned it.  yeh. um. so i could like go into detail about that  last thing...but i won't.   I'm beginning to get "spring fever" ALREADY and it's not even MARCH! i can't wait to pull out the flip-flops and the shorts and tank tops. I look so much cooler in the spring. Unfortunately i'm not tanned...so i'll need to do that too.   So the big question of the evening, is whether i'm going to bring in $10 to school tomorrow for Miss Tullahoma. I haven't really gotten much positive feedback from the idea though, so i doubt i will. Cassi and Ashli have pretty much been the only two that haven't laughed in my face. Oh well. I guess laughter really tells you who your friends are...  -tori
