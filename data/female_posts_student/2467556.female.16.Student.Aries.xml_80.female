We watched "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" today as well as Monday, but my brothers said the really funny things when we watched it on monday.  Here we go:  girl in the movie: no i don't want to live in a world without love or beauty or truth! i want to live and love with you Miles! Miles, i want to have your children! guy: i know i know, i want our children too.... dillon: if some girl said "i want to have your children" to me, i think i'd run away garik: for real, thats just another way for her to tie that miles guy down. don't do it Miles!!! run away!  or this one where the characters were taking amphetamines to stay awake...  guy in movie: here take this, it'll keep you awake! garik: yeah lets pop the speed baby and get crazy! where da club at!  where all my bawlers at!?  That whole thing was really really funny.  I love my brothers, they're awesome! and they're only 10 and 13...they pick it all up from me i guess, lol.  I went to the International Spy Museum and the National Museum of Natural History....they were awesome!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
