(ha! ha! ha!)  on the revision front, things have been a bit of a non starter with summer school on, im so knackered when i get home i can never get round to doing any work. however i feel this is excusable, at least fairly excusable. i'm just hoping my counsellor shares my view on wednesday when i have to explain why i have done no work.   COUNTDOWN to family holiday to italy is 1 week, 4 days and counting...good points about this are cute guys, interesting things to see like pompei (really not how you spell it) and pizza. also dad has promised to take me to the veggie restaurant in rome. bad points are: i'm with my family 24/7 i don't like excessively hot weather boring things dad will enevitabley drag us round like a ruin consisting of one brick, which we shall be forced to "ooh" and "ahh" at and the fact that the 2nd week of our holiday is more or less a beach holiday, which i find incredibly boring. i lie around at home, why do i need to fork out hundreds of pounds to lie around in a foreign country for a week?  last night i was at a service in a christian fellowship church and i saw an ad in the piece of paper they gave you out about baptism in lough neagh, and that if you wanted to get baptised there you could fill out a piece of paper and leave it in with them. one of the dates was august 29th. suddenly something inside me went "zinng" and i knew i really wanted to do that. i think god wants me to, much more importantly. i had just been thinking about getting baptised when jennifer did, my friend at the baptist church i go to, but then i thought, "why wait?" i really want to do something to signify to god that i'm not going to have another year like last year or the two years previously, i'm going to work hard and grow with him and trust etc and i'm going to be able to move on in my life. i was praying about it last night, didn't get anything specifically about the baptism though i can feel there's an approval behind it i think, like it's not just some random idea i had on my own. i did get some fantastic bible verses about moving on etc, best of which was this one: jeremiah 30. v 18  "the city will be rebuilt on her ruins"  then i looked in my study bit at the bottom, and the comment on that verse was  "the hebrew for this word (ruins) is tel(l), referring to a mound of ruins resulting from the acculimiation of the debris of many years or centuries of occupation and on which successive series of towns were often built."  so this was like my life had been a mound of ruins, all piling on top of each other as i was occupied by depression for years, but it's gonna be squashed down and built on, my life which was crap but all the crap was a good foundation for the city that is to come. does that make sense?   also i got this really nice verse isaiah 40 v 11 "he tends his flock like a shepherd: he gathers the lambs into his arms and carries them close to his heart"  to which all i have to say is: "baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
