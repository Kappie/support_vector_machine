If by some spectacular chance you have never heard this song, tune into 104.9, they play it all the time.  It is so simple, yet it says it all.  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am free again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am clean again  However far away, I will always love you However long I stay, I will always love you Whatever words I say, I will always love you I will always love you
