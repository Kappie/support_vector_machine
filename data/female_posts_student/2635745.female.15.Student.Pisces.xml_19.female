Yesterday I did really well at practice and found out some juicy news.  Ferrell asked out Annie Dawson.  Hamburger said he will dump her soon though.  I don't know what she was thinking.  I think she just wanted a date for Valentine's day.  She doesn't like him anyways and she seems to be a desperate person.  But Jacob was funny about it.  Ha I love his name!  I got a lot of stuff today.  And I'm going to go see 50 First Dates.  It's going to be great.  Catch Ya Later
