It's amazing how quickly everyone changes.  Or perhaps no one is changing but me?   I wish I could say what I want to say.  I wish.   I'm ready for summer to be over.  I want to go back to school.  Not because I like it, but because I need my routine back.  I need to see a lot of people every day.  I need to get out of the house.  Mostly I need to puncture my false hopes.  I need to realise that I'll never find what I'm looking for.  Elm, VW, we need to talk about the band.   If you don't want it anymore, perhaps it should be laid to rest.  But I don't see why we couldn't write serious songs as well as an occasional "Pink Bubblewrap" type thing for stress relief.  I hate vacation.  Sure, I enjoyed some things, like going on a trail ride through the mountains and holding my cousin's five-month-old son.  But all in all I'd rather stay home.  I had planned on writing a lot about vacation, but frankly, I don't feel like it.  Have you ever had a dream that's so strong and so meaningful that it weighs down your mind and your heart, haunting you constantly?
