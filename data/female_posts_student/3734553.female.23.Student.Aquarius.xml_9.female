But you remember it in very different ways. I'm surprised that he remembers I was wearing yellow after 11 years. I think I was too arrogant when I was younger, maybe I was just too naive and I didn't know that you were supposed to hide confidence.But I think I probably hurt more people than I realize when I was younger.   We talked about when I first became obsessed with music. It was definitely listening to Weezer's Pinkerton in the back of a Bronco, way after curfew when I was 16, with two people who I knew cared about me and who knew my ups and downs.   So here's to James- "Laid" for all the memories and to keeping in touch.   Shaun was right, Damien Rice "Cannonball" is my new favorite.
