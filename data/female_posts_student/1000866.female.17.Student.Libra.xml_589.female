My brother's coming to fix it hopefully...this weekend. :) It's Maureen's last weekend too. :( That's not cool. I love her. She's amazingly cool and nice and she's an AMAZING chef. And it's not even like she's going back to California or something. She's going all the way back to Australia. Not cool. Not cool at all.  honestly, not a lot of interest has been going on recently. Winter was awesome though. It was a ton of fun. I was worried it'd be awkward but it wasn't at all. Fun fun times.   I'm really just sort of avoiding this essay I have to write right now. Eeeek....whoops.   Stupid W.E.W. That class sucks. It SUCKKKSSSSS. Haha. Sorry  OK, I'm done now actually. Oh yeah...I got my car washed today. That was fun. Good times at the car wash. Workin' at the car wash, workin' at the car wash, yeah... :)  Oh...big breakthrough this weekend though. I now have the n!!! I can watch Daria and Degrassi and..AHHHH!!!! What a great weekend honestly. One of the best I've had in a while.
