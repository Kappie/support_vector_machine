Cecilia, you're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Come on home Making love in the afternoon with Cecilia Up in my bedroom (makin' love) I got up to wash my face, When I come back to bed Someone's taken my place Cecilia, you're breaking my heart You're shaking my confidence daily Oh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees I'm begging you please to come home Come on home Jubilation She loves me again I fall on the floor and I'm laughing Jubilation She loves me again I fall on the floor and I'm laughing wo-oh-ooooh-oh, wo-oh-oh-oh-oh wo-oh-oh-oh-oh,oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...     Bookends by Simon And Garfunkel  Time it was and what a time it was it was A time of innocence a time of confidences. Long ago it must be I have a photograph preserve your memories they're all that's left you.     El Condor Pasa by Simon And Garfunkel  I’d rather be a sparrow than a snail Yes, I would If I could I surely would I’d rather be a hammer than a nail Yes, I would If i only could I surely would Away, I’d rather sail away Like a swan that’s here and gone A man gets tied up to the ground He gives the world Its saddest sound Its saddest sound I’d rather be a forest than a street Yes, I would If I could I surely would I’d rather feel the earth beneath my feet Yes, I would If I only could I surely would     For Emily,Whenever I May Find Her by Simon And Garfunkel  What a dream I had Dressed in Organdy Clothed in crinoline Of smoky burgundy Softer than the rain I wandered empty streets down Past the shop displays I heard cathedral bells Tripping down the alleyways As I walked on And when you ran to me Your cheeks flushed with the night We walked on frosted fields Of juniper and lamplight I held your hand And when I awoke And felt you warm and near I kissed your honey hair With my grateful tears Oh, I love you girl Oh, I love you     Homeward Bound by Simon And Garfunkel  I'm sitting in the railway station. Got a ticket for my destination. On a tour of one-night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand. And ev'ry stop is neatly planned for a poet and one-man band. Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Ev'ry day's an endless stream Of cigarettes and magazines. And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories And ev'ry stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be, Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping, Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Tonight I'll sing my songs again, I'll play the game and pretend. But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity Like emptiness in harmony I need someone to comfort me. Homeward bound, I wish I was, Homeward bound, Home where my thought's escaping, Home where my music's playing, Home where my love lies waiting Silently for me. Silently for me.    I Am A Rock by Simon And Garfunkel  A winter's day In a deep and dark December; I am alone, Gazing from my window to the streets below On (a) freshly fallen silent shroud of snow. I am a rock, I am an island. I've built walls, A fortress deep and mighty, That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain. I am a rock, I am an island. Don't talk of love, But I've heard the words before; It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died. If I never loved I never would have cried. I am a rock, I am an island. I have my books And my poetry to protect me; I am shielded in my armor, Hiding in my room, safe within my womb. I touch no one and no one touches me. I am a rock, I am an island. And a rock feels no pain; And an island never cries.     Mrs Robinson by Simon And Garfunkel  And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. (Wo wo wo). God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray (Hey hey hey, hey hey hey). We'd like to know A little bit about you For our files. We'd like to help you learn To help yourself. Look around you. All you see Are sympathetic eyes. Stroll around the grounds Until you feel at home. And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know. Wo wo wo. God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray Hey hey hey, hey hey hey. Hide it in a hiding place Where no one ever goes. Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes. It's a little secret, Just the Robinsons' affair. Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids. Coo coo ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson, Jesus loves you more than you will know Wo wo wo. God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson, Heaven holds a place for those who pray Hey hey hey, hey hey hey. Sitting on a sofa On a Sunday afternoon, Going to the candidates' debate, Laugh about it, Shout about it, When you've got to choose, Every way you look at it you lose. Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Woo woo woo. What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson? "Joltin' Joe has left and gone away" Hey hey hey, hey hey hey.     The Boxer by Simon And Garfunkel  I am just a poor boy. Though my story's seldom told, I have squandered my resistance For a pocket full of mumbles, Such are promises All lies and jest Still, a man hears what he wants to hear And disregards the rest When I left my home And my family, I was no more than a boy In the company of strangers In the quiet of the railway station, Running scared, Laying low, Seeking out the poorer quarters Where the ragged people go, Looking for the places Only they would know Lie-la-lie... Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job, But I get no offers. Just a come-on from the war zone On Seventh Avenue I do declare, There were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there. Lie-la-lie... Then I'm laying out my winter clothes And wishing I was gone, Going home Where the New York City winters Aren't bleeding me, Leading me, Going home In the clearing stands a boxer, And a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders Of ev'ry glove that laid him down Or cut him till he cried out In his anger and shame, "I am leaving, I am leaving." But the fighter still remains Lie-la-lie...       Scarborough Fair-Canticle by Simon And Garfunkel  Are you going to Scarborough Fair... Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme Remember me to one who lives there; She once was a true love of mine. Tell her to make me a cambric shirt (On the side of a hill in the deep forest green) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Tracing a sparrow on snow-crested ground) Without no seams nor needlework (Blankets and bedclothes the child of the mountain) Then she'll be a true love of mine (Sleeps unaware of the clarion call) Tell her to find me an acre of land (On the side of a hill, a sprinkling of leaves) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Washes the ground with silvery tears) Between the salt water and the sea strand (A soldier cleans and polishes a gun) Then she'll be a true love of mine Tell her to reap it in a sickle of leather (War bellows, blazing in scarlet battalions) Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme (Generals order their soldiers to kill) And to gather it all in a bunch of heather (And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten) Then she'll be a true love of mine Are you going to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme Remember me to one who lives there; She once was a true love of mine.     omg soo many more GREAT songs im just tired.....ill write more later...if i wanna talk about my feelings or w/e
