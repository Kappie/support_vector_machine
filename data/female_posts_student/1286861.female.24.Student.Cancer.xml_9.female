Whenever I share this with people, I get stormed with suggestions and remedies that I, of course, have never heard before (please note my sarcasm). Everything from warm milk to meletonin supplements, I have heard AND tried most of them.   I personally have come to realize that there is nothing wrong with my body, physically at least, that is keeping me from the great land of slumber. It is something else, something psychological. I have yet to pin point the reason, thought, or demon that is the cause behind my insomniaï¿½but I hope to not only find it, but come to grips with it.  I will let you know.
