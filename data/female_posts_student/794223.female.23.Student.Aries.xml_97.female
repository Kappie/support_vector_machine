She is undergoing chemotherapy at present, and we're not sure if she can continue her much-needed therapy at MD Anderson unless Bryan ISD steps up to the plate and covers her medical bills as they said they would. Note also that it wasn't until March that the district informed us that there was ever a problem, long after Brandi had sought treatment at MD Anderson (which they knew about). They assured us that everything was fine, that she would have no problem, and that the insurence would cover her expenses. Apparently, they lied.  If you are reading this and know my family (or even if you don't), please e-mail and/or call Bryan ISD's interim superintendent. Since this is a local policy, they can change it if enough pressure is placed on them to do so. It needs to be changed--not merely for Brandi's sake, but for for the sake of any teacher employed by Bryan ISD.  You may reach the interim superintendent (Mike Cargill) at: mcargill@bryanisd.org (979) 209-1002  By the way--this guy was a coach and apparently knows nothing about district (or state) policy.
