And there is nothing else I can think, except that today is going to be a very long day indeed.   And I was so hoping to catch Clinton's speech at the Democratic Convention. Oh, wait a second. That's later tonight. Maybe I still can. If I still care, that is. Heh.  Since I can't really write anything right now. And since I have no idea when I will be able to see through the stacks of paper on my desk, I thought I would share a song with you. I'm listenting to it now. It's a song from the band  urlLink Tiger Army , and it's called,  urlLink Incorporeal . If you haven't heard Tiger Army, then you're missing out.    I'm dead I died long ago but my spirit still roams (Incorporeal) Unwanted in heaven, forgotten in hell as on earth (Incorporeal) I don't want to stay here, it seams that I'll never be free Oh can you hear me? (no)  And so It has come to be that I must wander forever (Incorporeal) Many things I have seen, empires that rise and then fall (Incorporeal) A life you live long is simply a moment to me A tiny drop of water in the sea of eternity  There's no place for me everywhere that I go Only seems to bring upset and harm There's one thing that I want and one thing only Release into the great beyond Don't want to remember when I was alive When I held my true love in my arms For like you I once was, and like me you shall be  When you Feel a chill in the night perhaps it's me saying hello (Incorporeal) You're so much like my love though she lived in a long ago time (Incorporeal) I long to see her for the day when my soul's laid to rest The peace that I can not find in life, I can find in death
