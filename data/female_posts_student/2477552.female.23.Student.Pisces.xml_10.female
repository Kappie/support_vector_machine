I finally broke down and bought my favorite bagel  combination today. A whole 23 days into the semester. Ahh well...I'll burn it off in dance class tonight. Anyways, I highly recommend you try the  everything bagel with honey almond cream cheese . The  cinnamon sugar bagel  is yummy too, but really messy and then after you eat it, everything gets covered in cinnamon sugary-bits too. Third on the list would be the  chocolate chip bagel  though it too is messy..and the chocolate doesn't look good smudged in the  crevasses  of your hands. Well, I'm off to eat my still warm, freshly baked bagel...and to read a psychology article on cognition and language, ethnicity, or gender..print it out..and then write a one page article review that is due at 6. Whew look at me,  I'm a real party animal.  *Hunched over a table in the computer lab that is.
