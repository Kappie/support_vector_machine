Then dee turns around and goes stacey i am tired of your bullshit so stop fucking around and then she pointed to ryan and thomas and she's like 'same goes for you two' we just started laughin but then, Ryan was like 'what the F*** did i do?' She was like 'your just a white jew' everyone got quiet and was like 'ooomg' lol. I think Mr. Moser heard it too lol. I even thought that was disrespectful and I usually don't care about it. But she didn't have to say it infront of the whole class. I was like 'omg dee yours screwed' lol.  Anyway...ya Franny came over for a while. It was fun...better than being stuck at home doin nothing...wishing i were hangin at bills with 'some ppl' ...dammit which one! brothers suck! lol Went out at night while josh,david,kevin,jordan and keith were racin on skates and bikes and what not...playin my guitar...im getting better....im starting 'empty apartment' by yellowcard. It sounds better when my dad plays it tho...cuz all i have todo is sing plus he can pick...i can't and he can keep with the beat.....i can't lol. But u know dad's been playin since we was my age..so i can't really be so negative about my playin guitar.   Well hopefully bill will be home so we can play the smoke game or just hang out lol. I'm gonna go play me guitar somore...Franny..u should really think about playing again...my dad could restring your guiatar if you want.
