I am looking into the whole transport thing, and Bri's parents are right in that we will need to find somewhere to stay. I have briefly looked into this, but my sister says she knows somewhere, so we'll see. It may not be necessary anyway, and time will tell. Anyway, we have the tickets.   In other news, Me and Penmo sat outside waitrose earlier and ate waffles and crumpets respectively. That was just after Dave had gone up to do his training. How did it go Dave?
