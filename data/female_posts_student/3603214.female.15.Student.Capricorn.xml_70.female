I will carry you Be your strength And pull you through Reach for me And take my hand We will pray And we will stand In a world Crying out for peace Let your heart be strong For when I am weak You will carry me   "Friends"  Packing up the dreams God planted In the fertile soil of you Can’t believe the hopes he’s granted Means a chapter in your life is through But we’ll keep you close as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone ’cause our hearts in big and small ways Will keep the love that keeps us strong  Chorus: And friends are friends forever If the lord’s the lord of them And a friend will not say never ’cause the welcome will not end Though it’s hard to let you go In the father’s hands we know That a lifetime’s not too long to live as friends.  With the faith and love god’s given Springing from the hope we know We will pray the joy you’ll live in Is the strength that now you show But we’ll keep you close as always It won’t even seem you’ve gone ’cause our hearts in big and small ways Will keep the love that keeps us strong  Chorus   "I Will Be Here"  When you feel the sunlight Fade into the cold night Don’t know where to turn I don’t know where to turn And all the dreams you’re dreaming Seem to lose their meaning Let me in your world Baby, let me in your world All you need is someone you can hold Don’t be sad, you’re not alone  Chorus: I will be here for you Somewhere in the night Somewhere in the night I’ll shine a light for you Somewhere in the night I’ll be standing by I will be here for you  In this world of strangers Of cold unfriendly faces Someone you can trust Oh there’s someone you can trust I will be your shelter I’ll give you my shoulder Just reach out for my love Reach out for my love Call my name and my heart will hear I will be there, there’s nothing to fear  Chorus
