I did however enjoy the little time I spent there.  What came to mind was my roommate Rahnel.  I remember when I first met her I thought she Looked" like a snob, but she was such a nice roommate.  I made a life long friend and even though we rarely talk, when we do it isn't awkward.  I have a lot of kooky memories, like our first time clubbing.  HAHA  I remember getting ready.  Oh gosh.  So here are some college memories:  - Trisha and Kelly's room smelling funky all the time and it was Kelly's fault.  - Rahnel and her beef sticks.  _ Convincing Rahnel and Trisha to join a sorority and then not getting invited to one (but hey they did).  - The hike up the damn stairs everyday, several times a day...not only in the college where my dorm was but through the entire school.  - Mountain Lion Habitat, WTH?  - Oh the food...HORRIBLE!  - The multi-colored hairstyles.  - Beautiful views and campus.  - Our frickin' room was so damn hot!  - The bathrooms that weren't supposed to be co-ed, but ended up being that.  Oh that was so long ago.  My time there was nice, I wish I had fit in better so then maybe I would have finished college.  I do miss the campus, maybe one day we will go and visit it and I can show the kids the college I first went to.  Okay, getting tired now.  Goodnite.
