Mark Recchi will be going back to his original team, Pittsburgh, and after a lot of thought, and lots of input, Goalie Matthew Robson has decided that he will not be joining RPC Youth in the Nanoose Bay Teen Camp.   There are many superlatives that you can use to describe Mike Ricci, but the most widely held is that of competitor," general manager Michael Barnett said. "He lays it on the line, every shift, every night." He said he looks forward to joining his new club. "The Coyotes have a great nucleus of young, talented players," Ricci said.  Recchi's agent, Rick Curran, wouldn't provide details on the contract, but said the right wing is "absolutely delighted" to be in Pittsburgh, where he has kept a home for several years.  After everything seemed to be a go, Matthew Robson has pulled out of Nanoose Bay teen camp. "It's a tough decision for me" Robson said. "I really wanted to go, but there were just certain details I had to work out." Robson is expected to be working during the week he was going to be at camp and with the extra cash he has decided to insure his car.
