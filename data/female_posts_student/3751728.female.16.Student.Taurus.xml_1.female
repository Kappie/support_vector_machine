Many people grow up like a druggy with a kid, They cover up all of thier mistakes for the ones they've already hid. Life is a destructional balance that slides from side to side again, The key to life is loniless, the lock is never having a friend. Jealousy takes over, nobody cares for you, People try to screw you over, they try to play it cool. Suicidal attempts that didn't really succeed, Slitting your wrists open, hoping for it to bleed. Mom dies, and then dad abandons the only kid he had, But life screws us all, and he's really just a big fag. Life is a blemish, to never disappear, It's just like a person you'd give anything just not to hear. Too bad your life will never be perfect, the way you'd like it to be, So just go around with your middle finger in the air, for everyone to see. No, I can't lie my life is obviously hard, Not to be happy, screaming, cursing with the drugs that have made me scared. Why do people act like thier life is a fairy tale dream, Sugar coated with a cherry, a big sloppy lie made out of ice-cream. Precious diamonds means nothing but useless time, Not really as luctuous when you've grown up without a dime. Problems occur when you have nowhere to run, So you hide in your shadows and this becomes your favorite fun. Silence takes over, choking your very own heart, Until you give up and say, this is one life of which I don't want to be a part.
