I told my mum cat, but if you think about it... cats just eat crap and sleep *that's me! ;)* So that's not exactly an ideal reincarntion. But what is? I don't recon a human is the best form to be in *if we are in a form* We can lie, and are deceptive. We're also extremely selfish and destroy the environment around us *purrrr* Shh! Damn second half of my soul *mumble mumble* Aww.... Mango's with me! *so's my box of celebrations! teehheee!* No, I am not feeding my cat chocolate if you were wondering... worth a try though! (I'm gonna be seriously dangerous when I'm let loose on the world!) Hmm... don't you find that you always get the wrong end of the knife? *wrong end of the stick is just a boring saying!* Anyway... knife works better metaphorically so :P! (Now I'm having fights with myself) Oh well *sigh* WEEEEEEE!!!
