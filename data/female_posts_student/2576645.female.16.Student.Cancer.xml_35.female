'Mister'... because I believe he does NOT have the diginity to be addressed as 'President') proprosed an admendment to the constition making gay marriage illegal I was outraged.   Completely OUTRAGED.  All I could think about was my mom's friend David; who is gay. He has rights. He is a human being. He found his boyfriend's body when he died of AIDS. A person he LOVED. He has been through more troubles in his life to stay true to himself than I bet a majority of us ever will.   All Bush is doing is imposing his beliefs where they don't belong. I have stated before that I can't change people's minds...and that is true. I do not profess to know everything...however, I do seem to be more cultured, tolerant, and informed than others *cough...Bush...cough*.  Why can't this country be more accepting? If someone wants to show thier love for another person by marring them... why should anyone take that right away? Why can't we be happy that two people are in love? Love is what makes this world a tolerable place. If we take that away, what will be left?  Song of the day: 'A Change Would Do You Good'- Sheryl Crow
