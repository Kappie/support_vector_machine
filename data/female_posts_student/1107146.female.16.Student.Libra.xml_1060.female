Josh, I'm flattered that you're thinking of me in Euro. :)  I'm not sure why I'm still talking to him.  Maybe I just need someone's head to play with, or maybe my subconscience is actually considering him, I don't know.  I guesss we'll see how it goes.  There is a internet cafe on board, so I'll definitely update you as we go along.  I'll get his last e-mail to you in just a sec...
