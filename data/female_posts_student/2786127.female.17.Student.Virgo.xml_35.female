Mondays are okay because you just got off from a weekend, you're revived and such. Wednesday is okay because you know you only have 3 school days left until the weekend. But sneaky little Tuesday...kicks you in the ass. You wake up knowing you have FOUR more days of school and pissed off because you have to do the whole school thing again after monday.   RARR ON TUESDAYS.  Atleast its over.  I need a boyfriend. or...atleast one that cares about seeing me...or talking to me...or being with me....everything Nate DOESNT care about. Nate was disgust yesterday, he came over all smelly and dirty from work. I didnt want to touch him.  I want someone to love so bad right now... *sigh*.  mahh.  I need to go on a volleyball tournament right now so I can escape this ridiculous place.
