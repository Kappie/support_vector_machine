Me, act as a fren to Nabilah, wanted to laugh at her for being childish at an age of 12. for a lot of people the brains have started to mature but for her doesn't seem like that. She was i dunno mad at her mum or whoever in her family and she didn't even talk to anyone in sch. when she went to sch, it seems that she was crying wud a loser.    I'm not mean or anythin but *sigh* it's totally IRRITATING....worst of all when our teacher was talking about natural hair color is brown, she said hers was natural too. Oh please right....thats wud i wanted to said her natural hair color, brown makes me want to laugh and puke at the same time. She had dyed it like 4 times. plez...almost everyone hates her cause she's bossy and proud of herself. She said she's totally independent but she's not. she can't even stay at home by herself at home pathetic... and she said that she uses her own money to buy stuffs and NEVER ask her mum. like real hello there u have been spending ur MUM'S money all along.     About me now  well...hmm..i'm getting$10 a mth now which is totally pathetic..can u imagine jusT $10.....!!! well good enough rather than getting nothing. I'm SO DAMN GROUNDED!!!!!!!!!!! cuz i didn't go for my religious..i went but i was late and there was no one teaching anymore..".........." The exams is just next week!!!!! My math is still poor but eng, sci and mly are okay..Here's wud i think i'll get in my report book...  Eng A Math F/C(arg!!!!!) Science A/B (depends on the paper) Mly A  I cannot get an F..it'll look real bad. these results and important as they are the ones which show me which sch i'll be going to. BUT it's not the most important. THE MOST IMPORTANT IS THE PSLE (primary sch leaving examination) right sounds lame but it's totally dangerous. ARG!!!!! well i wish my frenz all the best of luck in ur exams... : ) : ( :/ :      Sign Off,    Diana[the unknown]
