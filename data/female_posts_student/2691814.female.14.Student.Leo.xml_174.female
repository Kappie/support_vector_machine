Anyway, im so happy for deidra, but in a way, im not...its pretty complicated tho, i mean she thinks one thing and totally gets something else but its better than she expected....very interesting, but im happy for her. Well i guess im gonna watch 50 first dates, that or the Hard Rock Live thing with yc, but i've already seen it so oh well.
