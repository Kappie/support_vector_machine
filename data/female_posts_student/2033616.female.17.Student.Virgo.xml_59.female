I could talk about semester tests and how much time i did or didn't spend studying... or about formal tomorrow... but i'm not going to.  I took them, i studied, i'm going... that's it.  Well this weekend should be fun, seriously... i get to see lots of people.  Well today i got a present! :-D yay, Mark burned me a copy of the Relient K Christmas CD which was soo very nice of him.  Three cheers for Relient K... which reminds me... did Jack EVER call me back? no.  Well tonight will be... i don't even know what it's gonna be... but hopefully i'll feel better... or at least have a better grip on things... afterwards.  No one gets this i know... but i'm just hoping i can get things straightened out inside my head...   My head... i wish my thoughts were more consistent.  One night i'm dead set positive on one thing... then i wake up and i'm not sure anymore... i blame it on lack of sleep i guess?  But i don't want to ignore whatever it is i have to do, but i don't want to jump to conclusions either.  Now that everyone is in a state of compleate confusion and thinking "what is she talking about"... i must go... sleep... good afternoon
