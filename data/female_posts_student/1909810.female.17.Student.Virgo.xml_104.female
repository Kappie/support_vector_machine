I know, dissapointing, but I can't access my image files right now because of technical difficulties, so this will have to do (it's actually quite nice) I was planning on changing the layout soon anyways, but that will just have to wait until I get my domain up and running again.  Anyways, D.C.? Incredible. Sure, there were moments I didn't enjoy,and a few things I would have changed, but for the most part it was wonderful. I met so many incredible people and made friends pretty quickly, especially considering the fact that I'm not the best with social interactions. My TL was awesome, I'm gonna miss her. And some of the speakers were really good, others...well...yeah. I really enjoyed the simulation, it got heated at times, and I liked it. I could go on and on about different moments being inspiring, cool people, fun sites and such, but I am really not in the mood..I just pretty much came to fix my blog. I'll write more later I promise :D
