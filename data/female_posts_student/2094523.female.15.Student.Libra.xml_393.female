Went to the mall with seema kristen and seghan and it was actually quite enjoyable! i bot a skirt for myself, and a necklace for lizzy. =) yay! im excited for her little bday 2morow. anyways 2day i realize how cool my friends are, and i wudnt give em up for the world. I see how no matter how much somedays i might get really annoyed with them, in the end they mean everything to me. So if ur my friend and reading this i think u guys are the most gorgeous people in the world, you have the best personality, and no other wud ever replace anyone of you guys because you make my life livable each day. cheesy but true.
