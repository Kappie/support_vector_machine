My mom, sis and I made a pizza... it wuz actually decent, we messed it up a little cuz we didn't let the dough rise with the yeast, we weren't patient enough. Now I'm watching "Me Myself and I" which is also a British movie, it's ok. I got some more pictures from France and Ireland to add to my screen saver thing. I told you I'm obsessed.. I get like that, which is definetly a good reason never to drink or do drugs, I have way to much of an addictive personality besides the fact that alcoholism runs in my family like crazy.   Only 1 more day till tryouts... goody goody. I'm kinda just ready for school to start, I had the couple weeks leading up to it, they r kinda weird cuz summer's not over yet but u feel like schools already starting. Speaking of school I'm thinking of going from my lazy schedule with 2 periods off to a full one. I'm taking all the easy classes so I wanted to try and pick up first year french to help me out when I go to Europe (hopefully!) next year and then also advanced photography because it's fun. It'll be tough to manage all that stuff during vball, but it'll keep me busy during the winter and it'll be things I'm interested in. Anyways, maybe I'll do it maybe not.   I should probably get out and get some exercise.. although once tryouts come I'll be gettin plenty of that and have been all summer for the most part. Maybe I go for a run or see if my dad wants to play tennis. GOD BLESS
