"thou rushing wind that art so strong/ ye clouds that sail in heaven along" then came disaster. " Thou blu de bla de ab de dress/ ye (mumble mumble) pretty bush" PRETTY BUSH? what? where in the hell did that come from? PRETTY bUSH? OH MY GOD! everyone says" oh you cant tell!"(said in questioning tones) i started to cry. i know what your thinking. its not a big deal. but to me it is. this is what i pride myself on. and now, i got nothing. remind me never, ever to audtion for a solo again. (sob)   My life is your entertainment.(i hope its good)
