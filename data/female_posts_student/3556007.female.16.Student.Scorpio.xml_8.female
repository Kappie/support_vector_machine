Why do people save up all this money until they are old and wrinkley so that the can relax and 'enjoy' it then?" There is some quote that goes something like "Choose a profession that you love, and you'll never work a day in your life." That is what I feel that I have to do. That is why I have decided that by the age of 35 I am going to have a barn of my own. First, I want to help out at some other barn, so that I can gain experience and learn how to train. Also, that way I may be able to board a horse at that barn for cheap or free if I help out by teaching lessons and training. However, I will need to have some sort of "real job" with which I can earn and save money. Grrr... The thing is that it should probably at night because my horse thing would go on during the day. Maybe I could work the night shift at a fast food restaraunt. :P Oh, please no!
