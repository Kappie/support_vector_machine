I mellowed out by walking through Oxford Hills in the twilight.  It was truly beautiful out, with the moon shining softly through the trees.  Then, I listened to some of my newer music, which made me happy. The only downside of this evening is that I have piano.  I haven't had my lesson for a while, because my teacher just moved.  He's not going to happy with me, being that I didn't even look at that new little piece that he's given me.  I may just leave it here and pretend I left it on accident.  Oh, I'm so bad.  I'm interested to hear his comments about the fact that I drew stars all over my left hand and wrist.  He'll probably just laugh at me; sometimes he laughs at any random thing I might say or do.  I don't see the comedy.  Anyway, that'll be tons of fun.  Ha. I need to go practice.  Wish me luck.
