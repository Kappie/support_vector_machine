I WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH. my parents could probabaly drive us. and i have an urge to go because for the rest of the week i am being severely tortured by taking a "family road trip" to go see colleges. i think 'm going to puke just typing about it. therefore i think we should have some sort of sane social activity before i go. note: i have checked the weather, and it will indeed be decent in santa cruz on saturday....
