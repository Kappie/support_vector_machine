Err... whatever that's supposed to mean. I did get a bit freaked out at one point, where I was swinging on the rope, with my feet resting on the knot and all of a sudden I had convinsed myslef that there was no way to get down apart from falling flat on my ass. Which, although highly amusing for *others* (IZZY) would have hurt a hell of a lot. Trust me, I know from ice-skating... not that I fell on my butt a lot... Ahh, that's the one time when I envied Laura and her big butt. (Why do my blogs always flot about in the sea of randomness?) Any way, onto less ...serious things? Yeah, guess so. In English - onto my dumb writing, I think every one's noticed how weirdly I write, some times serious and the next minute just plain loopy! Funnn! (Yes, fun has three n's!) I mean (Yes, funnn has three n's!) *hehe, fools*
