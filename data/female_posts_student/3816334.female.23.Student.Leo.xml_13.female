Home was good while Rick and i were there though i always feel like i am deserting my mother. with her being sick again and now not working for the summer i know she gets lonely around the house. im going home for her surgery in a couple of weeks and the last think i do before going to bed each night is ask god for her to have a full and well lived life... not the one i know that she is experiencing now .... pain and doubt and worry. I want so badly for the cancer that is slowing inhabiting her body to be just a dream, a nightmare if you will. i want her at my graduation and at my wedding and to see my children. If i had it my way parents would never be sick or tired or lonely ... and there would always be enough time in the day to call them just because. Of course that is not real life.  My head is killing me and even the sound of my fingers on my keypad it deafening... it doesn't help that a certain roommate of mine continually is clicking a hair thingy. It sounds like she is clipping fingernails/toe nails in her bed. of course she is not so i am pissy cause each click slams into my head like a truck to a phone pole. Today is a depressed days, a day that i have usually when i have enough time to stop and think about all the other shit that happens when you don't even realize it . today is a day to forget and try never to relive again. Today is pain... physically and emotional and its a day i  hate .
