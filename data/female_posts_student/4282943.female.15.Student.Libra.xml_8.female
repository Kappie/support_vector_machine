It's funny actually, quite an odd sensation, Feeling like an outsider in all situations. I am so confused about who i am, Someone help me, Please take my hand. Its clichéd, I know, But the pain I feel is real; To express the true me, That is my one and only dream. What will it take then, to be truly free. .
