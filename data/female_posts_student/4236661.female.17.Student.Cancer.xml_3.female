GRRRR!!! stupid damn nero! making it confusing when i didn't even need to use it in the first place! AP EORUW! i guess that only works using thoses number symbols (ex. @%!@) but i like letters.  anyway, after that, i made her go onto hedleyband.com and read about the band, jacob, kevin g. and listen to some songs...now i've got her idolizing jacob! :D ;) here's some gum off the bottom of the desk- eat it! oooo entering the janitor's closet and look what i found- dish rags! AHAHAHAHAH!!! i especially like their describing jacob's dancing as  "spastic inflammation of movement" and talking about his "lack of appreciation for clothing" umm... don't ask! HAHAHAH!      on friday, amy and stephanie came over, somewhere in the middle of me, my dad, and my sister watching the olympic opening ceremonies! it was pretty cool! if olympics ever come to toronto, i definitely want to take part!  (when olympics were in australia, my cousin told me that they didn't have to go to school...that'd be nice :) )  anyway, we popped in wednesday, thursday, and those day's E-talk daily's of CI and watched them... Steph made us replay the part where we were on tv! lol! gosh, i looked like a retard! lol! nor did we make josh's brother proud! oh yeah, i forgot to mention..at the autograph session, josh walked RIGHT past me and amy (as in, he brushed by us) and we were calling out "josh! josh!  could you give us your autograph" but he didn't even turn around :(  anyhoo, after watching all that, i shplammed some more things about hedley and jacob and music at them, making them read the poems and thoughts and things jacob wrote, and also listening to more songs!  what talent! i really admire them all!  we also planned what to do to get into CI next week as with 4 of us (jd, steph, n of course me n amy) we have to go EXTRA crazy to get tickets all together too.  we had some stupid crazy suggestions which shall result in me laughing my ass off everytime someone mentions cupid now! :P HAHAHAHAH! ask steph- i did it on the bus today!  they went home at 11:30 and i listened to the songs again.... they need to write and post up more songs to listen to!  damn computer crash- i want my winamp back! and my adobe photoshop and macromedia flash!!! WAHHH!! wanna start working on the 2nd d/h flash movie! MUST find CDs!!!      well thats it on this subject for now! ciao! more to come very soon!
