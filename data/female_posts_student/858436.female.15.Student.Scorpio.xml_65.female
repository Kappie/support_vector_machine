I realized that I am closer to my friends than I thought I was, and I'm really making more friends as well. It feels good to know that. Very good.   Hm.. not many people are on MSN.. so I don't know what to say haha. It's only 1:30 AM... No school Monday! Yes! Spring Fever Reliever Week, thank God! Haha I am just not in a school mood! I am SO ready for summer! I'm listening to Rooney right now haha.. very summery sounding. :-P  Well, guess that's it. Brett just signed on, so I'll talk to him! Hehe.
