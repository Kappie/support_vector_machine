I don't want to be at school this week or do anything that I'm SUPPOSE to do. The rain? Yeah... good excuse.  I'm trying to get things off of my mind. What's the use in letting things get to me when it doesn't matter to anyone but me anyway. I guess I'm just bringing myself down. I know, I say this now. Tomorrow I'll be pissed off or upset again. That's me, I guess.
