I have tons of work to do.. Which of it I have done??     I met a mishap.. Terrible one.. I don't think it is convenient to announce here.. Sadedness..     For all last week's tests are all CANCELLED!!! Except for the History one. Although Mdm Salimah wasn't around then.. Everyone was obviously copying straight from the textbook as the dumb dumb teacher was just sitting there doing nothing staring at us..         Mon 12:05pm    Currently in school "trying" to plan for my coursework B when I suddenly want to create a wishlist for myself.. Here it goes..     New haircut!    Buy black nail polish!    Get at least 5/6 As for my O levels! *I-can-do-it!*    Slim down!    Complete make up class.. Note: Have been skipping a few lessons!    Prepare to save for Daddy's birthday present. He wants a BIG one!    Draw posters for my room.. Inspirational ones to motivate the lazy me!    Prepare my band for up coming SYF 2005! Turn the music up guys!!!    Replace contact lenses.. [@@-]v    Eat apple pie from MacDonald's everydayfor a week!!! = possible? Give me some hope!     Ok! I shall "try" my very very best to realise my achievements..    Looking forward to National Day!!! Lots of holidays!!!    Tues 6:18am    Yes it's 6+ am now! I woke up at about 5:35am to panick about my Food and Nutrition O level coursework B.. Such a hinder! Coursework B is such a tough task.. Nobody likes it.. Everyone is competing to get the best grades in class and here I am doing nothing but to ponder about it now and then. I really hated courseworks! I rather do theory paper and get an A for it..     Gotta report to school by 7:15am again.. Such a dread!     O level examinations at 10:40am until 12:40pm     Result photos not done yet!     Research and development not checked for error of imformation and grammatic errors!     *HungRy*     Gonna change into the dull and dumb school uniform soon which inculdes dressing up in P!nk accessories[-H4ha-], tying my hair and looking innocent, then off to school to sing the national anthem and take the pledge which I've taken for so many years and still taking.     Sunburnt cheeks not recovered. *Looks Like I'm Blushing All The Way..*      Hey! What on Earth happened? ALL BAD LUCK?!?!    Sign Off In Sadness..
