To have some thing that you're constantly thinking about? Hmm, I just phrased that really badly so I gues it isn't. Otherwise my brain wonders though... hmm... Every one's always obsessed with some thing or at least I am! Mmm hmm... *COUGH* (shut up katie!) EDITED. Sorry, but I value my life. Geez, they make it seem like being best friends is like being joined at the hip! Wheras Izzy and Minton are joined by the little finger and me and Mr Fopple are joined by our ankles (it would really help if I could remember how to spell that) Oh and no thinking about that peeps, especially Laura, we know her twisted mind! Mmm.. I'm gonna go watch HIGNFY!
