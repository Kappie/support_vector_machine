What I mean by that is everyone lifes in a house and almost eveyone drives in a car. There fore when a person wakes up in the morning they are in a square which is there room rather it be the same room the grew up in or not they all look a like unless they are painted which is a totally different story. But when the terms everyone uses start with "well that's what makes the world go round" it makes me want to say everything in the world is square or different and oddly hardley anything in the world now is round. Anyways if you get what I'm sayin great but if not oh-well its all good!!! ta ta for now!      *feeling really confused*
