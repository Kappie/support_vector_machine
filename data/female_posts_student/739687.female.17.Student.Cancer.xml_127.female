Now what could ever be interesting in the frikkin class? Well, here's the story:  I was sitting in class, bored and tired as usual. Because honestly, who can listen to that woman lecture for an hour and a half and stay sane? Not me, so I slept. Strangely, I've never slept that well in her class. I was seriously out cold. Dreaming and so on and so forth. Then I tried to wake up, but it felt like I was paralyzed and couldn't move. Eventually I did...in perfect timing. We were about to have a test over the notes that...oh...I hadn't taken. Even better yet, we got to use those notes...you know...the ones I hadn't been AWAKE for...it was real cute. Yeah, so you try B/S-ing an entire paper about how China influenced Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Haha...it sucked, but it was pretty amusing. Because I really don't care.  Yep, so that was just about the highlight of my lovely day. Had an ortho appointment, missed band(thank God), and I'm debating over whether or not to embarrass myself and do region. Maybe next year.  Buh Bye you crazies.
