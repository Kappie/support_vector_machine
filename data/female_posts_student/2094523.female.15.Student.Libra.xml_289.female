When im having dilemmas and im bitching about them shut up and let me talk because im the only one that matters rite now. i dont care if you have bigger problems, i dont care if your the one crying and sulking, i dont care because IM the one thats fuckin talkin rite now and you are absolutely nothing but a spec of dust to me. Don't tell me that i have nothing to worry about, dont tell me i dont knwo what the fuck im thinking coz u dont fuckin know my life, my friends, my family, and most importantly you dont fucking know me and you never will.
