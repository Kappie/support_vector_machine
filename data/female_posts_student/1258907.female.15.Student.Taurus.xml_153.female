That the Lord, He died for me Why did He, set me free From all the pain I felt? He gave me His bone He gave me His blood He gave me a chance With Jesus, His son He showed me the truth He showed me new life He showed me the way To not live in strife Why me? Why did God clothe me when I had nothing to wear? He created me in all that is fair Why me? Why did God love me through all my rejection? He stayed with me through each progression Who am I? What am I? That the Lord, He died for me Why did He, set me free From all the pain I felt? He gave His bone He gave His blood He gave me a chance With Jesus His son He showed me the truth He showed me new life He showed me a way To not live in strife
