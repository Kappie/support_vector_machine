Well, hold on, hold on...I have to admit that I am very happy to be back at Uni because I will see my friends again, get to meet new students, learn about Finance, Marketing and Business in the Asia-Pacific Region... BUT I also have to admit that being on holidays is not bad at all, I get to know my bed better and become quite friendly with him... ;-)        No tears, no no no!! Today was my first day and I was very excited to go. The first lecture of the Finance course was interesting and I look forward for the other two courses tomorrow and Wednesday. I bought my first text book, I have to start to read it... Itsounds boring but I'm sure I will enjoy it very much!        I sound probably positive and I have met some people whosay "Uni is boring,I don't like it!". Well,believe me whenI say thatI am very lucky to be able to study where I am and at this level and I won't let this chance pass away. It can be hard but learning is a great opportunity, a gift and the benefits are much greater than the efforts to study. I enjoy studying, I hope I'll still enjoy it later and I hope more and more people will have access to it around the world!
