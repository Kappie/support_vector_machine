I attempted to wakeboard but that didnt go as planned. i fell on my face. enuff of that  all of my "friends" are extremely pissed at me right now. its kind of frustrating b/c it has been like this the entire week. in the past 2 days i have been called a slutt, flirt, and bitch by meghan. kristin implied that i was the second one. i think ppl just need to realize that i have guy friends...sometimes (such as right now) guy friends are 10 times better than girl friends.   i just wanted our last couple of days together to be nice and friendly. well we already screwed that. hope yall have a nice life.    ok im done venting now
