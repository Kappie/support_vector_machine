Everyone is having a spot of bad luck...  for the last three days I have played the same song and I'm still not sick of it. Gypsy Rose Lee by the Distillers is the best thing ever and I don't know why, but I love it.  I was up until early this morning writing a letter to tr0y, so about 10 minutes after I woke up((at 1pm)), I was eating lunch... a chili cheese dog. The classic heart-attack-on-a-bun. Of all the things I eat, this has to be the worst. First it's the weenie, the fruit cake of the meat world, then it's the chili and cheese, more fat and calories to cover up the taste of the weenie. So what am I doing now??? Slowly gnawing away at a York peppermint pattie, my favorite candy after rice crispies.  I'm terribly bored, not to mention fed up with these people. Yesterday I was ready to run away. I was going to run all the way to Michigan to live with tr0y, or to Mississippi with nick. I don't think I could ever do that though. It would only take the cops a day or two to find me and even if they didn't.. What would I do once I got there?  I would like to be 5 years old again. When I was 5, we lived in this gorgeous house with a big deck and a hot tub. And we had a maid and a security system that I would always press the button for. I don't remember my room because I always slept on the chaise lounge in my mom's room. My mom bought me 2 dwarf rabbits that lived in the back yard, and I would play with them every day and when it stormed I would put them in our shed and sit with them. For some reason I remember racing my sister around in circles on the deck, but the hot tub was in the middle so it was a pretty skinny circle. I remember feeling sooo smart when I realized all I had to do to beat Devon was sit and wait for her to come around the circle, and she would always end up behind me and bang her tricycle in to mine and be pissed that I won. We moved out of that house right before I turned 6.   the other house I really loved was one really close to cross lake. When I think back, it was a pretty crappy house, but we loved it so much. The front was covered with petrified wood "tiles" and we had a guest house and in the woods behind the house there was an old barn that was full of nasty old cotton. My favorite thing to do was rake up all the leaves and then let babby((his name was Todd, and he was the love of mom's life at the time)) light them on fire. Then this other time when there was a hole in the screen on my bedroom window and some lady bugs made a nest and got in the house. It sounds pretty gross, but they never went anywhere but my window sill, and they would just go in and out all the time. Todd and my mom broke up, and Rick rented into the guest house. He was a nice guy, and my mom thought so too. Pretty soon he moved into the house house, and then we moved out altogether.  from there we went to the apartments, where we met Mr. Jean and IT happened((see end of may 8th post)). The apartments aside from Mr. Jean were cool because there were stairs and I liked having my own floor. There was also a pool where I had all these "boyfriends".  then we finally made our way to my old house, the one I always talk about. I had my own own own room that was perfectly decorated, and then the other bad thing happened((see end of march 24 post)).   I suppose that's pretty good.
