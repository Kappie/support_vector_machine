I've now moved onto an apprehensive mood about going to journalism camp tomorrow, but mainly because I have no idea what to expect.  I've been spoiled by Brenda's. I mean, last week there were only nine campers there. We had five counselors. And then one camper left, so..yeah. We got to do practically anything we wanted. It was  so  nice. And now that I'm going to UNC for this camp...I just dunno. I don't know how many kids will be there..I have no idea what KIND of people will be there...I just..have absolutely no idea. So. It scares me a little. But I'm still riding on my energy-high from tennis camp so I think it'll carry into tomorrow and keep me happy enough to be able to deal with some new people and a new environment.  Today has been really boring, though. I went and got some stuff for "camp"..like a notebook, a pack of floppy disks, a new clock..and some food, of course. Something about eating healthy at Brenda's camp and exercising so much..it just got me really guilty yesterday, after eating fastfood and getting soda and chocolate. So, I think I'll just going to try to keep myself from eating that stuff..as much as possible. I even had a salad today for lunch ^_^ And it was my own little masterpiece..it wasn't that bad, either. Some lettuce and spinach..(rabbit-food-ish stuff..enh)..mushrooms..chicken..feta cheese...Greek salad dressing..and, voila. It was all healthy. Whoo. I had some bread with my salad, too..and some muenster cheese ^_^ I love that stuff.   Ooh. I started making a quizilla quiz today. I got very aggravated when the editor kept freezing, though, so I haven't finished it. But..when I do finish it, I'll put up a link. I've got all the questions and answers typed in, though. I just need to find some pics.   Hm. Hopefully I'll be able to update my blog at UNC, but..like I said..I have no idea what to expect from this camp thingie. I guess I'll find out everything tomorrow. Maybe I'll make some more friends. More likely, I'll make some more enemies. heheh. Oh well XD  Ok I'm gonna go try and finish my quiz now. Oh yeah..I was looking up some more summer camps because I kind of want to find one on webdesigning and eventually I found  urlLink this  site. There are programs at UNC so..hm. I'm probably going to order a camp catalog thing. It looks interesting. I would have one hell of a time deciding between the Web Design  Graphic Arts program and the Video Game Creation one >  Song for today: Without Me by Eminem (Someone sang this on Kareoke Night at camp..normally I hate Eminem's music. And this song just popped in my head yesterday when my Mom was driving me home from camp yesterday...heh. Guess who's back in Mount Airy. w007!)
