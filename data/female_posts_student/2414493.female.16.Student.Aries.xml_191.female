Sylvia walked up to me in the social science hallway today and tells me the news: she's talked to Peter, and Chika and Peter are going to prom together. I can only laugh, until Sophie mutters something about a "stalker." Not that it matters, I'm sufficiently amused already.  But somehow this prom thing scares me in the way it's wrecking people, and it makes me sad. Parshaw thinks weird things are going on with his date and it's not the same anymore. Scott thinks the same thing. And Dorothy whispers in my ear that her friend is dating Keira's date, and that he regrets asking her in the first place. Meanwhile, Keira is asking Coral how people tell when it's a relationship. I know she didn't see him at the volleyball game that night when she was supposed to. I look through last year's yearbook at Dorothy's friend, a sophomore, and Keira's date, a senior. The girl looks so young, she still has braces and a juvenile look about her. Somehow I'm mad at the guy for his perfidy. Keira is such a good girl (for want of a better word) and deserves something, but maybe she's putting way too much into it. She wants to spend her birthday with him. Her profile says "baffled," and I hope that has nothing to do with her prom date but if it did, I wouldn't be too surprised either. I have an urge to tell her because I'm one for revealing secrets (ha ha), but then that would betray Dorothy's trust and it would hurt Keira. But what would be worse, knowing that your date doesn't want to go with you anymore or actually going and not having a good time? But this is all secondhand, too. It's just a lot of messing with emotions. I can see how girls, when asked by a guy, will make flying leaps of logic and suddenly think the guy likes her. Note to self: never, ever do that.  Thinking of suitable things to write, I marvel at how our lives are built around relationships, which involves communication. Mom and I aren't exactly on good terms right now because she was slow to tell me something and then I got extremely mad at her. Talking to certain people about the right things (always unknown until it happens) can make my day. When we talk, exchange looks, we can breed joy, jealousy, pain. And the more I realize it, I become increasingly thankful for the people around me who can just bring a smile to my face by just being there. Thanks, guys.  It's Greg's birthday tomorrow. And then Keira's. She's stubborn about not eating cake or anything before the real thing, but she's going to be making up a statistics AP that day, so if she has her way she gets no journalism cake. I'm sure Amanda, whose birthday is on Saturday, will be absolutely fine. I love them all, it's funny how their birthdays are three in a row. Chocolate or yellow cupcakes with chocolate mint frosting, just because Greg likes chocolate and I liked the weird frosting.  Abdul's going to Caltech. Yay!  I smell like body spray, but it sure beats the stench of mink preservative.
