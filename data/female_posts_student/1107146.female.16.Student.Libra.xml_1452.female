Also, JOSH, since no one else is here...*fumes under her breath* I am going to Birmingham tomorrow and I'll be back Monday.  So...Now everyone knows where I'll be.  Also, check your phone voicemail.  I asked a question and I'd rather not repeat it here.  ;)  Nothing personal, just don't want to keep typing.  See you guys next week...maybe some of you will actually be back.  ~Z
