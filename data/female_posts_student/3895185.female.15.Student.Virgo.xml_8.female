Remember that lovely Green Day song Nice Guys Finish Last? Yeah. That's me. I'm the nice guy. I especially hate it when I've been pretty damn good to some people and they turn around and somehow get it into their head that I went and fucked them over. Wow.        " Nice guys finish last     Your running out of gas    Your sympathy will get you left behind    Sometimes you're at your best,    when you look the worst    Do you feel washed up,    like piss going down the drain       Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane    I'm so fucking happy I could cry    Every joke can have its truth and now the joke's on you    I never knew you were such a funny guy       Oh nice guys finish last,    when you are the outcast    Don't pat yourself on the back,    you might break your spine       Living on command    You're shaking lots of hands    Kissing up and bleeding all your trust,    taking what you need       Bite the hand that feeds     You kill your memory "
