We swam off the log, and goofed off, and had lots of fun. We all stood on the log, and took turns jumping off and staying down..At the tip of the tree, I couldn't even touch (until James moved down) then when everyone jumped off, suddenly the water was around my ankles. It was frighteneing. Adam or James or Shea took off Alanna's top and played catch for a bit. I double knotted my suit, and I think Amy did too...  Then we left! James and Adam and Amy went home, did their own little thing. Cody dropped me and Alanna off. We got dressed, brushed hair, applied make up, comented that Cody was a DREAM he was so hot...:) I enjoyed that. Cody was hot. He had a niiiice ass truck. He likes Techno. In fact, we listened to Da Rude the entire time we were in that truck. W00tage.   Cody and Aaron came back to pick us up, then we went to go get Sheila and Shea, then headed off down to A Ate some food. Good food. Yummy. Went down to peacocks, (oh, and I had shotgunned like, the entire time by now, much to Alanna's displeasure) saw that nobody we wanted was there, and left. Played the "N" snatching game..:)  In case you've never played, that game is where you see a car with an N on its back, and the car is parked, you take the N. It's soo fun, and I think Cody has like, 30 or something, of N's. That they have snatched. It was perfect. That is also why, when you get out of your car, you take off your N.  We drove down to the waterfront and walked around. I scored holding Cody's hand, even though Alanna did too. But it was most fun. My parents called. Fed them some lies so they wouldnt come panicking past me. Got back to holding Cody's hand again. Rawr..That was ....lovely:) Friends were really cool, just helped me along, and didn't say anything like, What the hell! We are not! Really nice of them.   Cody dropped me off. Dad was waiting outside for me. 1000 questions. I went to bed. Woke up way too early this morning to pick berries, and now apprently, I never picked enough...*is sad*  Man, if Thomas reads this, I have some explaining to do....Hopefully he wont...Right? RIGHT?!
