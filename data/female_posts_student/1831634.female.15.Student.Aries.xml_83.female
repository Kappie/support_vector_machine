Blogger is skewed.  It said on my old old blog that I had 91 posts.  That, I'm more inclined to believe.  18 posts!  Don't kid me, please.  I went to Macy's with my mom today.  I saw that cute cute purse thing.  My mom wants to get it for me before I go to China.  Good luck, mom.  You have a week.  But then when I went back to Costco.com to check, the purse wasn't there anymore.  Eh.  Whatever.  I should go study my art terms, as I usually memorize them for a test then forget them directly afterwards.  I should also go rememorize my French grammar.  I am a total dunce at French grammar.  I have just realized that all the most important people (aka Kailing, Su, Angela... less so Angela, but whatever) to me haven't signed my yearbook.  And yet people like Jack and Chuan and Didy and Peter Tong, for goodness' sake, have signed it.  That's just plain crazy, people.  I don't want to remember THOSE people.  I just realized that I'm going to miss my mom when I go to China.  A whole month without her!  How will I live?  Especially with my grandparents!  Slightly deaf, slighly cuckoo grandparents, to boot!  One who is beyond obsessed about my grades, and the other who doesn't give a whit about what I do.  I am slated for doom!  This should be capital punishment.  I am just glad Eileen and Kerry will also be in Nanjing with me.  My mom is feeling foiled because then I will speak English.  Haha!  I love playing Neopets oh so much.  All my study time has gone into that cursed game.  But I cannot help but feel the urge to play more of it.  Most of the time I'm not even playing, persay.  Just waiting for restocks or looking around trades or something like that.  I am glad the school year is almost over.  Three more hours.  Then I will not have to see those annoying little pricks for the entire summer.  Until August 4 rolls along and I have to submit myself back to the torture that is Jasper High School.  Plus all those gibbering little freshmen.  Who will most likely go about kissing Kailing's feet until their ranks come out.  Either that or secretly despising her.  Again, until their ranks come out.  Then they will be asking, "When do we get our ranks?  I want to know our ranks!"  Then, inevitably, the Daniel Wangs and Tracys of freshmen year will drive me bonkers.  Let me hope I get a fairly decent humanities class.
