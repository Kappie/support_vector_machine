It is an interesting thought on the difference between traditional conservatives and neo-conservatives.  The neo-conservatives adhere to the confusion that Kirk describes later in the paragraphs.  "This network of personal relationships and local decencies was brushed aside by steam, coal, the spinning jenny, the cotton gin, speedy transportation, and the other items in that catalogue of progress which school-children memorize.  The Industrial Revolution seems to have been a response of mankind to the challenge of a swelling population: 'Capitalism gave the world what it needed,' Ludwig von Mises writes sturdily in his  Human Action , 'a higher standard of living for a steadily increasing number of people.'  But it turned the world inside out.  Personal loyalties gave way to financial relationships.  The wealthy man ceased to be magistrate and patron; he ceased to be neighbor to the poor man; he became a mass-man, very often, with no purpose in life but aggrandizement.  He ceased to be conservative because he did not understand conservative norms, which cannot be instilled by mere logic -- a man must be steeped in them.  The poor man ceased to feel that he had a decent place in the community; he became a social atom, starved for most emotions except envy and ennui, severed from true family-life and reduced to mere household-life, his old landmarks buried, his old faiths dissipated.   "Industrialism was a harder knock to conservatism than the books of the French egalitarians.  To complete the rout of traditionalists, in America an impression began to arise that the new industrial and acquisitive interests are the conservative interest, that conservatism is simply a political argument in defense of large accumulations of private propery, that expansion, centralization, and accumulation are the tenets of conservatives.  From this confusion, from the popular belief that Hamilton was the founder of American conservatism, the forces of tradition in the United States never have fully escaped."  Now: discuss! I'm hoping Matt will blog about Wendell Berry soon, so hopefully we'll have some interesting cross-currents.
