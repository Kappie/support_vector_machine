I did not think anyone else even looked at this site. So in that sense, thank you for reading.  I read your comment and my first reaction was to get defensive. I am still somewhat in that vein. BOTH my car accidents were due to blackouts having to do with my Diabetes: A disease...a genetic disease...something that I do not consider "my fault". I do not want to delve into my medical history, but needless to say, I have...in writing...letters and forms from medical professionals giving me clearance and permission to operate a motor vehicle.   I appreciate your concern, I believe for your own well being. I too have concern for your well being. As "anonymous", I will not be able to pick you or your vehicle out of the crowd to ensure that no harm comes to you. If it makes you feel any better, I will be giving myself restrictions on when and under what conditions I drive. Restrictions not set by a doctor, judge, or department of motor vehicles...but by myself.  So, with this said, I will return to work and continue towards getting my license again. I hope to see you on the road soon. Safe Driving :)
