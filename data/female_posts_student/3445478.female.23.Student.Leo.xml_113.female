I thought it might be time to introduce his cup when he grabbed MY water glass and drank from it without spilling....Yes, You read me right...without spilling!!! He is awesome. Very Very early this morning I dropped Nick off at G'pa/ma Kal's house for the entire day while both Shawn and I worked. Nick had a great time, especially napping with G'pa Daryl on the floor. At 4:00ish Nick and I headed up to the Taylor/Johnsons....NOW the Johnson's for G'ma Lu's (Wu's) wedding to Billy. It rained but Nick liked it at first. He decided to talk right at the begining of the ceremony, so we had to move even farther back. I did get to see the very very end when Billy and G'ma Lu were pronounced Husband and Wife and they high fived instead of kissing. It was a great wedding! There was a lot of people there including a baby 3 wks older than Nick named, Alexandra. My mom looked absolutely beautiful in her hawaiian print shirt and shorts! She glowed! It's still raining and late last night I fixed my blog only to discover now it's broken AGAIN! Friday on the way back from the cities, Shawn got into a car accident...a bad car accident. He was being a careful driver staying 3 car lengths ahead of the other cars due to the stop and go traffic...all of a sudden the car ahead of Shawn slammed on their brakes. Because Shawn was 3 car lengths back, he was able to stop his truck before hitting the car ahead of him, BUT the car behind Shawn wasen't looking and slammed into Shawn sending him flying into the air and into a ditch. Shawn banged his head, but managed after filing a police report to drive all the way home. Dizzy. Tired. Sore. My Poor POOR husband. He is doing ok today. Right now he is actully sleeping. I can't imagine life without Shawn. There would be no life...it is inconsivible. He is the best husband  father. There is No One else like him. I am lucky.  urlLink
