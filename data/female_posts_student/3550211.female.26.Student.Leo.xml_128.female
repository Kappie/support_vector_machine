However, a little while ago I had a conversation with my best friend that made me do some serious thinking.   Here's what's on my mind: marriage. Yes. Marriage.  I'll be turning 26 in exactly one week. July 31st, to be exact. And now that you all know when my birthday is, please send all gifts (no cash please, however checks are accepted) to the following address. 263- JUST KIDDING! What? Did you think I was serious? If you did, please email me and I'll set you up with all the correct information. ;)  Seriously though, I'm getting older and as much as I hate to admit it, my biological clock is ticking. God, that sounds so Marisa Tomei from the movie My Cousin Vinny. And yet, it is so disgustingly true.   When I was younger, say 15/16-ish, I thought I would be married and on my way to having kids by now. I thought life was so Beverly Hills 90210. Perfect little outfits and perfect little boyfriends. Perfect little lives.  Talk about delusional.   Here I am, almost 26, and far,  very  far from being married with children. I'm certainly nowhere close to being Peggy and Al Bundy. Which I guess upon reflection, is a good thing.   But the truth of the matter is, I want to be married. No. That's not right. Let me rephrase. I want to  get  married. Being married right now, well that would probably not be for the best. I think it would be better if I could take care of myself, before having to take care of somebody else as well. But I do want it. Someday. And as time slowly, but surely ticks by, I find myself thinking of this more and more. It doesn't help that my younger brother is engaged either. In fact, it makes me feel like I am in a race against time. And time is winning.   I wanted to have kids when I was 28. That leaves only two more years. Sure, anything is possible, and a lot can happen in 2 years, but is it really realistic for me to be thinking this? But more importantly, is what I really want?  You see, that's a hard question to answer. And that is the real question on my mind. Why is it that I feel I should be married and having children before I am 30? Is it because  I  want to? Or is it because there is still some kind of unwritten rule in society that women should settle down by a certain age? This all really falls into gender stereotypes if you think about it. Men who don't marry will always be considered "bachelors," while women become "old maids." OLD MAIDS! Yeah. There's a definition I want to be associated with. Why don't you just kill me now, please.   And that's only half the problem.    In addition, I won't settle. Sure, I bet if I really tried, I could find some sorry sap of a man and convince him that I'm the love of his life and the best thing to ever happen to him, and be married within the year. Or worse yet, I could track down my old boyfriend, say goodbye to any sort of self-esteem I've acquired, and marry him. But I'm not that kind of girl. I can't, and I won't settle. I deserve to be with someone I really do love. Somebody I will sacrifice my own life for. And my husband, whoever that may be, deserves that as well.   Perhaps, I'm too idealistic on this subject. Perhaps, this is my problem.  Don't get me wrong, I've come to terms with the idea that I might be alone for the rest of my life. Well, at least I've come to terms with that to the best of my ability. And really, I'm okay with that. But that just doesn't change the fact that I really  do  want to get married.   Then again, maybe I just want to wear a beautiful Vera Wang wedding dress.     Of course, I'd have to win the lottery to afford such a dress. But a girl can dream. Can't she?
