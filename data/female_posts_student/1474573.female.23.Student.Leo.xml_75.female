I can only think of maybe three people who read it and I only know two people who signed the guestbook.  Last night I had the weirdest dream......I was part of the matrix team (morpheus, neo and trinity) and there was a bunch of us there(Imagine everyone at 13 dressed in tight leather toting machine guns) and we were in this apartment waiting to have a battle with the "bad guys". Anyway , we were walking in to a trap and I know it and I was scared as shit......see folks? THIS is what happens when you watch t.v. and eat before sleeping!   more later..... I'm a night blogger
