Totally gonig trick-or-treating today with Maimes and Gena. I also have two goals for tonight.  1) Break Justine out of her house (she got grounded for the simple reason that her muther went temperarily insane) so she can some and the shit scared out of her with the three of us, and 2) Make some random little kid cry.  I have decided that I'm going to scare all of the little kids who come to get candy.  (and it's mearly a bonus that that will leave us kids with ample amounts of candy).  Yea,  I also have it under good authority that Shane (Maimes' older brother) and his friend Scott(y) will be spending the night, here with us, at Maimes'.  Off I go now to pick up a movie with the girlies, and because Gena hasta talk to her boy...... Gottta run before violence ensues.  Late,
