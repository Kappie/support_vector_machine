I have to say, he kinda pisses me off. He never treats me like he treats other people, and not in a good way. He's really hard to read too. Like I've said before, he's my dad's buddy which mean's he's around quite a bit. Yesterday I was laying around in my room with the window open. My room looks right out over the backyard and my dad's shop. Anyway, my dad was out there working on one of his motorcycles and Troy walked up to talk to him. I was only half listening to their conversation until they started talking about me.  Dad: "...so I was telling my daughter about that earlier." T: "So, is she asking for her own motorcycle yet?" Dad: "Not quite, her mother is pretty opposed to her riding." T: "Oh. She'll want one though." Dad: "I know." T: "How old is she? 16, 17?" Dad: "Something like that." It always weirds me out when I hear people talking about me. The part that really sacred me was that my dad doesn't appear to know how old I am. He never does remember my birthday... That conversation didn't bother me at all, but coupled with the fact that every single time I've heard him talking to one of my parents recently he's brought me up. Me. Now, it would make since if my parental units did it, but HE does. That's a stark contrast from the Troy I know. The one that rarely talks to me unless he has to. It's not like I want anything form him, just for him to be nice to me.
