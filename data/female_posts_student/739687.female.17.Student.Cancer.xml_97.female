I used to be so hopeful but I feel like I've fallen further than I ever thought was possible. And I sit here and I cry, but I don't try to change. Because I don't want to change. I'm not ready to turn around yet. I just have this mindset that someone will rescue me from this hole I've dug myself, and I know it'll never happen. And I cry and I create pain for myself. Every single tear that no one else will ever see kills me. Because no one is there to feel their force but me. And It makes me feel so alone sometimes. Because no one wants to deal with me, and I definately don't blame them. I've turned into something horrible......
