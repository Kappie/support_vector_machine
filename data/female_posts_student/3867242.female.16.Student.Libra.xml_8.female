Then I made dinner for the family (I'm surprise that I didn't burn the house or anything!) Then I went to Kyle's soccer game. Now, I'm here..bored out of my mind!!! I can't wait till' next month! I'm going to Kennywood on the 1st with the family and some friends. Then on the 13th I'm going to see John Mayer and Maroon 5 in concert...my life isalmost complete!I can't wait to see John Mayer play the guitar and singin person!! Yeah..I can't stop smiling when I even think about it. Then of course there's the fair. The fair is o.k..I just come for food and friends..the rides are dangerous..haha...Kyle. Oh, I can't forget about at "This Evening Performance"..directed by my awesome friend Dan..and starring my friends Stephanie and Grant. So please see it..I'm sure it's going to be awesome. Well..that's all I have..see ya!
