Our day started at noon with a huge barbque, loud music and  heinekens.  Lisa, Kim, Gina and I decided to have a few beers midafternoon before going to our spa appointments. I spent 3 hours in the spa getting ionthermie (a shock-the-fat treatment), scalp massage and a manicure. It was wonderful. I had a little rob on and walked around like royalty. About 15 of us met in the disco to decorate for the party. I was in charge of decorations and let me just tell you - that disco was to die for. It was gorgeous. Balloons everywhere - we called it the Mercury Prom. Hahahah. After decorating we were all a little tipsy since we had a 12 pack of heinikens, we played bingo for cash and then headed back for the party about 11:30.  My friend Helen from Scotland went with Lisa and I and we dressed up like Charlie's Angels. It was so fun!! We took a lot of photos and got totally pissed. Next day we were in San Fran.   San Fran is beautiful. I want to live there. Our ship docked right next to Alcatraz and we actually sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge. It was incredible. I didn't get to spend too much time at the port though because I was working in the temrinal greeting our VIP guests. I did get out for an hour and fell in love with the city immediately. I can't wait to spend more time there.   We had our Welcome Aboard show on Saturday night and I completely screwed up. I have to introduce myself on stage and I just went blank in th emiddle of my speech - in front of 500 guests. I fumbled a bit before croaking out, "Many days we have. I look forward ot hanging out with ya."  It was ridiculous. I wanted to cry but I made it through it.   Last night the girls and I went out for formal night.  We drank wayyyy to much. We had 3 ooozo shots.  This is th emost insane liquor ever!!! Lisa bought a bottle of champagne and carried it from the disco to her cabin at the end of the night. (We aren't sppose to A-drink in excess, B-carry liquor around the public areas, C-take it to our cabin or D-kiss a guest in the process....Lisa did all of these things.  I woke up this morning in my formal gown with half a glass of champagne next to my bed. This party queen was out! We had sooo much fun though. Oh, it was a blast.  Meanwhile we all feel like hell today.  I have to run now though - I have to go host the fruit and vegetable carving now. Ewwww......  I am going to barf.  LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH.  CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU VERY SOON! MAY 29TH IS APPROACHING!!!!!
