With a combination of yoga, cardio, and strength training, I plan to become an improved healthier me. I still feelvery amateur using those foreign machines in front of many attractive fit people. Oh well. Soon, I hope I can be one ofthem. All of us could do better in that department, I think.  Currently, I'm working on finding some songs for a mix tape. It consists of songs mentioned in  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  by Stephen Chbosky (an excellent tale, by the way). When I find all the songs (including some that are proving to be quite obscure), you can expect a copy.  I won some vintage shoes off of Ebay a couple days ago. That was quite the experience.  That's pretty much my life as it sits. Or as it stands. I don't just sit anymore. That's for the anti-fit folk. Oh yes.   *nods happily in contentment*
