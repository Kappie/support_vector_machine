Shel Silverstien (if i ever had one) would be my idol. alot of times i get sudden inspirations for example: this afternoon i was watching spongebob squarepants, that is how this was born  Spongebob Square  is yellow with holes sucking up water  wherever he goes  Spongebob he is a sponge you see not an eraser or not a bee  Patrick the Starfish his Pink best friend wears gren and purple with a flowery trend  Mr. Krabs is Krusty Krabs very proud owner but when it comes to his money he is not a loaner  Sandy the Squirrel now what a girl? enthusiastic from the moment she entered the undersea world  all so unique  in there own soecial ways i will always love them for all of my days  so you see? I just have a thing for peotry, even if it sucks (which this one does) its still fun to write!
