BUT what's happening now...is definitely not normal. but 2 years ago i was checked for dyslekcja and dysortografia and the results were outstanding so it possibly couldn't have changed, right? or could it? as i said, this is scary. maybe i should go and get myself checked again, cos i feel like an idiot when i don't know how to spell words that have an obvious spelling. ok, i finished my coffee...hey wait, don't they call this 'cafe latte'? sounds better than 'white coffee' or 'coffee with milk' or whatever. ok, i crave another cup.   ok, here i am with my 2nd cup of CL or WC or CwM :) the proportions of dissolved coffee in hot water and warm, microwaved milk is essential - practically the key to my perfect cup of coffe. it happens that this cup of cof is a bit tasteless, the other one was far better. i'll have to find out why. only then will i be able to prepare myself the perfect cup of coffee :p i'm looking forward to an afternoon where i will be sitting in my room with this knowledge in my head, a cup of the most perfect coffee radiating with heat, warming my hands. hahahahaaaa, i've been writing about coffee for like the last 10 minutes, never have thought i would be able to do such a thing...whatever. let me go on then - since i've started to write about that i wanna finish :p it's strange that i'm writing about hot coffee in july - normally kids in europe would be sipping their ice cold cokes, diet cokes, sprites or mountain dews, ice teas, lemonades BUT I drink coffee BECAUSE it's cold. i'm wearing my old winter jeans and some old waste shirt that i wear when i'm 'doing arts'. now i'm considering the possibility of putting on my 'abs'socken because my toes are a bit cool.  finished the 2nd cup of coffee. maybe i should go and take a hot shower to warm myself a bit. funny that i'm writing about worthless, empty things right now. i mean...imagine me right now. sitting in front of the screen with an empty cup on a desk and writing about things that are bothering/make me excited/ happened in the past/ i think are cool today/ happen with me etc. so what? tomorrow i won't even remember these things. i'm writing about now, stricktly NOW. what IS right now. coffee, cold feet, feelings about not finding that damn paper, feelings about me having black-outs, feelings about my mother, my family everything! why do i do that? i could analyse, write some stupid theories of mine, reflections -dunno- what i write about now is oberflaechlich, it has no deeper meaning for me, no deeper thinking is needed to write down such stuff, actually no thinking at all. it's passive in some way.  so what's the conclusion of that 'rozterka'? become an active thinker. read good books. watch more movies like 'sylvia'. that's all.  oh, oh, oh!! cool, i forgot i have polish letters here! gonna write some stuff for d.  d., it's not 'kocham cie' it's 'kocham cię.'  not baska but baśka.  w trzebrzeszynie chrząszcz brzmi w trzcinie.   that's all. das ist alles. c'est tout. to wszystko. na dziś :)
