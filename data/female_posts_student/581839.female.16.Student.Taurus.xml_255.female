Yesterday i drove over to Annie (the delayed birthday girl [it was march 3]) 's birthday party. i was the only one there for a while seeing as all the other people to arrive (antoinette, caroline, and courtney) wouldn't arrive until 430 or later. so, annie and i watched strictly ballroom which i haven't seen in a long time. i forgot how great that movie really is... bogo pogo. anyway, so after the movie, i think what happened was annie and i hung out and listened to my flogging molly CD, following which we listened to neutral milk hotel, which i must say, i am a great fan of now.  once everyone arrived, we went up to annie's mattressed out spare (kinda) bedroom and jigged a little bit and then did eachothers make up, etc. girly things you don't really want to know about. afterwards, at about 730, we went to mondo's, an italian restaurant, and spoke the whole evening in british accents. it was quite fun actually, and sometimes our british accents would pop up later in the evening much to my delight. after dinner we went to annie's house to "freshen up," and waited for taarini, another friend from school, to arrive. once she did, we finished getting ready and left the house to go see HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN. we left at 1030 and the movie started at 1201. so, we sat in the theatre admiring cute boys and talking with annie's brother and his friends. there was a girl seated in front of us dressed up as harry potter, and she went up to this person dressed as professer lupin, which i thought was a guy, and started grinding up against "its" lap, but then i found out it was a girl, and i got a little scared, because harry kept on walking up to people and sitting on their laps and making out and stuff. so then, once the lights dimmed and all the incredible harry potter fanatics started screaming, i must say i started shaking with anticipation. after like half an hour of previews, the movie finally started. i loved the whole thing. draco malfoy was especially good looking in this one, and i find that i must see it quite a few more times to satisfy my need to see him. anyways, the movie itself was brilliant. all the actors have gotten much better, especially daniel radcliffe. it was a lot more emotional and such, and i thought that it was the best one yet. once the movie was over, we got back to annie's house at about 300, if i remember correctly, and went up to her room. courtney went to bed like straight away, that is after we played clue and i totally won (mr. green, kitchen, lead pipe, booyeah!). the rest of us left the mattressed out room and went to annies room after disrupting courtney too many times and also after taking multiple glamour shots. we played have you ever, i lost, and truth or dare, which ended up really leading to a conversation about our history of friendships. and how we all have no boyfriends.  at about 615 in the morning, i tied a knot with a ribbon using only my feet, when i was upside down lying on my back, onto one of annie's drawer handles. we were all delerious by that point. we were quoting harry potter puppet pal skits, singing the mail time song from blues clues, and irish jigging. we hadn't slept at all. at about 600, antoinette surrendered to bed the wussy. at seven exactly i bolted downstairs yelling, "it's christmas, it's christmas! happy christmas caroline!" while she yelled similar things to me. we were very tired.  the internet still wasn't working (it always stops at seven at night and then randomly starts working again the next day...) so we sat on the couch to watch a mighty wind, but i fell asleep at 740. i was awaken by a very annoying antoinette tapping my forhead at 1115. that's when mrs. black let us eat the crepes she prepared for us. mmm... so good.  AH! I FORGOT ABOUT SOMETHING! the previous night, after dinner, caroline, courtney, and i rushed back to annie's house before she did, to construct a fake cake out of cardboard, prepare new icing, and ice this cake, in time that she came home and we told her that patrick, her cat, knocked it off the table. we even put some icing on his whiskers though i think he licked it off. when she was cutting what she THOUGHT was a real cake, it caved in and we all had a good laugh, while bringing in the real one. ok, done with my flashback. everyone slowly trickled away until antoinette, annie, and i decided we wanted to eat at mi cocina, so we did. and then, i dropped antoinette off at her house, and then returned to my house to do the ironing. and here i am, wanting the neutral milk hotel CD and tom felton. sigh...
