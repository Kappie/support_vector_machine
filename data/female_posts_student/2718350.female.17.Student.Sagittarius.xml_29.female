But it wouldnt work so we try and watch it on my comp....i dont have a dvd player and i so thought i did. so abra comes takes travis to his house to get his tv and speakers. meanwhile aria and i start to put the drinks in the fridge only to discover when we try and open the box that there was one leaking. so into a trashbag it went and i go change into real clothes so we can go return it as i am walking down the stairs aria says "do we have the reciet and do we really need to return it for one can" hmm good point so on with refridgerating the Slice. travis and abra come back and we hook up the tv and start to watch...5 mins later we decide that we wanna go to the jacuzzi instead because we all saw the movie and we wernt rally in the mood. aria and i both have swimsuits abra borrows  one and travis is stuck cuz he doesnt have any and he looks like he is in an asian gang with his jeans and white tshirt. Hehe so leaving the pool i take my key and abra and we go outside the gate(which opens from te inside without a key but we tell them you need a key. so aria hops the fence and me and abra sit there laughing and tell travis to just open the door and walk through. haha what fun.so back from pool. we still have 45 mins to spare so we go to the playground. weeeee! the slide was fun the grass was mushy and the boys were trying to scare us.lol abra and i run off and hide up the hill so the boys cant see us. then they lock us out of the car... :( boo hoo so they drive off and we run the oppisite way. 10 mins later we are at my house and aria has to go home. ho hum i go inside and abra and trav are about to leave. but trav comes to my door and we decide to hit up some cha for tea yummy. we arrive get tea and start to play scrabble. hunger strikes i get me some super spicy chicken yum me and abra eat that all up mmm it was good. i woop some ass at scabble hell yea i got 211 :) then its time to go home and me and travis make the skript for a really bad porno...to be continued the next time anything interesting happens...o and abra we do all have to go to a kareoke bar sometime soon and shrek 2 on tuesday!
