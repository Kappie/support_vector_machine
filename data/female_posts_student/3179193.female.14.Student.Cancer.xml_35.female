Gotta fix it up.   *sighzZ* AL's going through a whole lot right now and it sounds so familiar... the stuff she typed, I mean. In a way, I've felt something similar. Somewhat similar. Not entirely though. Alice, if you're ever reading this I want to thank you. You're not the only one who's learned something from this. You've taught so much through what you're going through. I now cherish what I have with Nima even more (if possible) than before. I love Nima and like I've said before, I've come to this point in this relationship where I am totally comfortable with him and have all my faith and trust placed upon him. I love him, and I mean it.   I told my dad about Nima and I last night. He's in HK and can't do anything about it but he was okay with it. So now BOTH my parents know. Auntie Ivy definitely wouldn't approve dating at such a young age but whatever. I think my uncle who lives next door knows. So does my other neighbor. Haha... and the ones who live across the street! LMAO! Yeah...  Nima said he was gonna tell his mom, but I don't know... somehow, his mom scares me a little. I don't think she approves of Nima being friends with me or something... haha! What if she doesn't like us being together and does everything to prevent us from spending time together?! I'm scared... well I'm dressed up kinda girly-ish today. Haha! So yeah... a black "I LOVE BOYS" t-shirt (all over it), non-baggy jeans, a jean jacket, eyeliner, mascara, tiny bit of perfume (which may have faded by now) and yeah... haha! I'm so stupid. Just felt like it.   So anyway... I should get going to band. Love you Nima.
