It's when people tell me I can't do something, and that I'll never be able to do something, or that I'm not good enough or smart enough or strong enough or daring enough...or anything else. People make stupid judgements about me, and they're just joking around, but it really pisses me off. I mean, if I want to accomplish something, I will. But when people start telling me that there's no way...then I start doing it for the wrong reasons. But it really  PISSES ME OFF  when people do that. They thinks it's sooo damn funny that they're making fun of me based on judgements that they can't back or confirm. But my first instinct is to prove them wrong. So if anyone can figure out what I'm talking about...watch your damn backs, because I'm gonna  prove  you wrong, and shove it up your judgemental little asses!  Thank you, and have a nice day. :-)
