WS had been my best friend she was a wonderful gal,she has what it takes to be a very good friend.The type i had been searching but yet other took her away.Not to be too blunt,it's that i was the one who had not been matching with her? I'm not that sure.I still have my other friends right? Do i have to be like that? No...i'm still satisfied.It's alright with me...Look on the bright side of life...  It's just that i have one shopping campanion less.Still,it made a great difference,a shopping campanion like her ...as i am a great shopper...always looking for excitement must go out one...my other friends always have no time for me to shop with...they are sort of 'workaholics' or they are spending their time on Idol dramas. haiz.not that i am backstabbing them but it's just that i have to go out alone...thinking of getting a boyfriend?...will there be a day that comes...hope so...but i shall have to love myself alot first...yea~wateva then  My passion is music rite? yea...now trying to figure out 'piano'...anyhow play one la~ still can play bits here and there :P ...woo....  Argh...pimple poke out again! SObS! y everytime like that one...i wanna grow taller! hmm...maybe by this year grow till 163?...or at least 160 cm pls god...lala...  Ewww...a mole on the eye meaning attractive? hehe...i have that...but am i attractive? Not so ?...agrees...  Your Life You never live your life in the way others want you to. You are an independent individual who loves challenges and excitement. You are ready to face with the result of your decision. You are usually the one your friends count on. Your Love Because you love excitements, you occasionally get involved in forbidden love affairs. You may fall in love with a married person and no one can stop you from making progress. You are very charming, although you might not realize it.  hoo...think all these really somewhat reveals the true self of me...haha...quite true though..i think    luv brownie bear bear :P
