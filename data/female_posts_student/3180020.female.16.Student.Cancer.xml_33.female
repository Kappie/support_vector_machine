Just hung out. The next morning, I got up at 8 and helped her and her mom load stuff in the uhual. We got done with that at 1:30 and me and cretia went and ate burger king, then we were on our way to Gadsden. We got everything unloaded at about 6:15 and then we had to have the uhaul to the uhaul place in Gadsden by 7 and we didn't know where it was. Anyway, we got back and got the boxesunpacked and then we had to arrange everything and all that crap, well at about 1:30 we went to wally to get the basic stuff you need in an apartment...we spent 331 bucks there and then finally came home and unloaded everything and put it where it went. We left gadsden at about 4:45 and I was pulling in my driveway this morning at 6:30. I got on the couch and then I woke up at 12 EXACTLY b/c christa called! YAY!! she got to call back a few more times that afternoon....I washed her car and went to auto zone for daddy and then I went out later...thats a very summarized version of what I did today!! holla
