He goes to court on the 22nd and supposably is going to this dentention place for 5 days...God, I hate having to deal with this. I talked to him about it to, I just hope he fucking realizes that this shit is killing me. I love him so much and I deserve to have things better. I deserve to be able to see my boyfriend whenever I want. Idk, I'm just kinda sad right now. So im going to go.  ***The greatest things in life are those left unexplained***
