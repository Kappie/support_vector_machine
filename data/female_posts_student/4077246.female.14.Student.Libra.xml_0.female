But that is not what is on my mind right now...i found out that 2 of my friends called me a bitch...o well it shouldn't bother me that much but it did..i know why steph did(im sry that i was being so mean to you hun!!im really sorry!!!)but i dont know why robbie did...but im sure i deserved it but o well.  I  just told josh that i think i want to break up with him...but something in my head(and a couple of friends) told me to give it some more time...so that is what im doing...but i still feel horrible.  I have something funny to say i just don't want to say it because i am too sad right now...well i better go before i say anything i don't want to...ttyall later...
