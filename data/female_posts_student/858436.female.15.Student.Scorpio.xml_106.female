ND Shirts: Short sleeve stretchy, no buttons, pink shirt with I think yellow writing.. And another one of those in black with hot pink writing... Yellow stretchy with blue ND Mango polo with blue ND  Stuff from Memphis: Dillard's - kind of 50's looking skirt, yellow with white flowers.. and short white eyelet skirt Express - black short sleeve shirt.. hot pink shorts American Eagle - yellow off-shoulder shirt.. brown and pink tanks... All VERY comfy!  Erm, yes that is it. For now I guess. Might steal a survey off someone...
