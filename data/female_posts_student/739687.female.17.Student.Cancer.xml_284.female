At 2:30 I was awoken...to find that Becky, Amanda, and Rachel had snuck into my house and were making quite a racket to wake me up. First of all...I had no idea what was going on. Then when it finally hit me that they were in my room I was like "oh my god...what the hell...I freaking hate you guys!" Haha it was outrageous. So before I know it Becky is dragging me out of bed, and putting these outrageous clothes on me (I still am so out of it that I don't know what the hell is happening), meanwhile Rachel and Amanda are taking pictures of my horridity and I'm flipping off their cameras (I'm cranky when woken up). So then they take me outside and into Rachel's van. I'm finally starting to sorta-semi wake up. So by now I have a feeling we're going somewhere, though they claim that we're just "driving around". And our driving around takes us to IHOP. Oh God. So I'm like praying that no one else is in on this, so they don't have to see me, tired, make-up-less, and in the most horendous outfit ever created. Oh, but there are more people in on it. So I'm walking into IHOP at 3 am, getting  alot  of stares, and being cranky, but amused. Haha, my friends kick so much ass.  So then we went back to Becky's and got some more sleep. Then tonight the four of us are going to Dallas. Cool stuff.  Well, have a spectacular day, crazies! Oh, and I just officially turned 16 about 2 minutes ago. I shouldn't know that, but I have no life. Later.
