I'm 15, have long blonde hair... well, kind of blonde. Somewhere between blonde and brown, there was a color that had no name... and that color.. is my hair... lol, yeah. I'm about... oh, 5'2"-5'4" I think. Can't be sure. I prefer boots to sneakers (unless running), navy blue to sky blue, silver to gold, silver to white, black to white, and I can't go anywhere unless I have my One Ring haning on a chain around my neck. I wouldn't call myself punk, although some might, I just do what I want, listen to what I want, say(mostly) what I want, etc.  I'm not going to say all about me, I'll leave you to deduce what you will from my subsequent posts. Namarie.
