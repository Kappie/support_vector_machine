You know how you sai oh I only got 5 minutes and end up talking for like 15, well when he says 5...He really does mean 5. It's ok he's on the job. But it was nice to hear from him. He's  a sweetie.  Today I'm going to Anna's and we're going to meet this guy or guys. This guy has got a thing for her and Tiff and I are going with her and I thin khe's bringing his friend or friends....Don't really know...Doesn't really matter to me. But yea...  My mom saved these seeds and she wanted to plant them and left them on the counter and told me not to throw them away and so I didn't. And I forgot to tell my sister the same and she threw them away. lolz...totally my fault. I KNOW! but my mom made me dig through the trash....not the trash like from the kitchen but the trash like the ones you bring to the street!!! What the freakin' hellz yo! but I found them.  P.S. I love the beach...and he cooks! :D
