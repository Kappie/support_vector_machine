At camp he wrote down his Blogspot address and I've been kinda reading it since then. I always get these online diary things and kinda end up forgetting about them a month later. I usually end up writing pages and pages of almost nothingness and bore people. Cept usually they don't find our I run one of these things. So it doesn't bother me. I might end up giving Alisa the link but that's about it I think.      What's the point of these things anyway? Why do I enjoy writing in them so much? Umm... well doctors always tell me keep a diary... Maybe this should become my diary... maybe not... I have one at   urlLink  http://www.livejournal.com    but this one's kinda cool... I can put pictures up! I kinda like this.... livejournal is a little boring... So yeah that's it for now I'm off to bed I think... bubbyes
