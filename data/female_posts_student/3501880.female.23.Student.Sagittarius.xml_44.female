The Case Comment is done!   With about a half-hour to spare, I finished my Case Comment for the Law Review Competition and rushed it over to school. For a moment, I was a bit disheartened by exactly how MANY people had submitted a case comment, but then I realized that I am just happy that I did it, as up until Wednesday, I wasn't completely sure if I would actually get it done.  Tonight, I have my friend Kim's Luau, and I really don't want to go, but at the same time, I am going, because a lot of my friends are leaving for Europe on Monday, so it will be the last time I see them before school starts again. The Beastmaster will be in attendance, and she just bugs the shit out of me, so I would actually rather stay at home and drink alone with a few good movies, but alas...society calls!  I am not really sure what it is lately, but people seem to keep running in front of my car! Really, they must have some sort of death wish, because it isn't like a panicked-sort of "oops, my ball just flew into the street" kind of run. It's, well, not even running at all, but rather a leisurely stroll into the street as my car keeps hurdling at 40MPH toward them.   A few weeks ago, I accidently bought a $4.50 tin of mints. By "accidently", I mean that I certainly would not have purchased them had I known beforehand that they were that expensive, but was too embarassed to ask the cashier to void the sale (because it was my only item of purchase). So, I thought that they would be extra good mints to warrant a price of $4.50, but no! They take the title of "The Poor Man's Altoid"...except you can't be poor if you want to buy them. Perhaps it is a specially-marketed mint aimed to the Nouveau Riche to make them think that they have taste because they buy expensive mints, but they can't tell that they are cheap mints, cause they don't have any "refined tastes"...hmmm, maybe that is what the "Gatsby-Approved" label on the tin means?
