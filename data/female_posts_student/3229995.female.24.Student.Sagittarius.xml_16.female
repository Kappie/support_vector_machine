Marian and Marion felt it was time to end M2M after their second album ‘The Big Room’ flopped. Their legacy is however a well produced, self written album from two teenagers.  The best tracks on this album is the single release ‘Everything’, the bitchy ‘Miss Popular’ and the powerful ‘Leave me Alone’. This is not a great album, but a good in the middle of the road album that you do not have to be ashamed to have in your CD collection.
