In your haste to answer the phone, you have water in your eyes and you can't see clearly. Therefore, as you try as fast as you can to turn off the water, you accidentally touch the  HOT  knob and without realizing, you on it bigger and get scalded by  burning  water.  4. Getting all worked up because the phone is ringing, you grab your favourite towel wrap it around yourself - only to remember that you still had soap all over your body and now your towel is soap-laden.  3. Because the phone would most likely have stopped ringing by the time you get out.  2. You manage to answer the phone alright, but then realize that you still had shampoo and conditioner in your hair, and now they are dripping onto your assignments which you painstakingly took 8 hours to complete and had placed them next to the phone.  And the  number one  reason why you should never, ever run out of the shower to get the phone?  1. You are in such a hurry that when you wrap the towel around yourself and dash out the bathroom without really looking. Next thing you know, you tripped over the long telephone wire, the telephone crashes to the floor (and stops ringing) and your bath towel falls to the ground. Then you realize that you did not shut your windows and you are now standing fully  naked  for all glory to see.
