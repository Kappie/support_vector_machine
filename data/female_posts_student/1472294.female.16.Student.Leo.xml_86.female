Because... every teacher is desperating trying to finish the chapters and topics so that they can catch up due to SARS outbreak.. *Shout Out With Middle Finger: Thanx To You! SARS!* Iwas so exhausted due to these tiring days that I fell sick yesterday. I tell you what happened... The whole night my nose was bleeding from 7 to 9pm plus plus. It was so bloody red and it was my longest nose bleeding period. My family members did not suffer all these except me... Hah!!! My nose has been bleeding since I was small whenever the weather turned very hot and humid or if I stand under the sun for too long...But these few years were okay, judging my four FINE and enjoyable years in GB! And my whole June holidays were filled with GOING BACK school schedule.... -__- Yeah... I know, I should not nag, 'O' Levels are nearing and blah blah blah.... But I am so desolate and SAD :( Never Mind, brother's not back, that's why I can used the com... *Evil Laugh*
