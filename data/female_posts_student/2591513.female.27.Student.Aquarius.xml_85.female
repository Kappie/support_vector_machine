It will be such an honor to have them there because to be honest with you guys I feel like I am lacking in the "to be proud of" department.  I guess because I am hard on myself for letting everyone down and not being done with college.  I know why I didn't...but still...I have a friend who did it on her own her BS and her Masters...as a single mom without her parents living close to her or without a husband.  She did it and now she is so successful.  Here I am not only having a husband, living with my mom and my sister...HELLO!  So I am so glad to be on the right track and I am glad Leila and I can somewhat motivate each other.  I must admit I don't talk to Kata a lot but it isn't because I don't want to, she works and goes to school.  But she seems to be handling her business well.  I am proud of her.  I still think she could have done big things at a CSU or UC, but that's just me.  Anyway, I will relish this time I have to enjoy my hard work and strive to do better in the following semester...wish me luck everyone.
