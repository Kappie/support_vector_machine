What a really uninteresting weekend I had. I did nothing, nothing at all. I was angry at someone who I will not mention because I felt like he was blowing me off, but he wasn't, he was just doing school stuff. I watched 13 Ghosts (do not recommend) and Training Day (recommend but still confused) with my roommates, and I hiked up to the Hollywood sign (well, as close as I could get). That was the extent of my weekend. I worked Saturday morning and slept all of the afternoon away. I cleaned my room, too, but that's not newsworthy. Right now I'm sitting at my desk, eating. Lame. What a crap day.
