The best part was the old camp director Alexis brought out 50 French students who can only speak English if the speak french they get sent home. All they do is drink and drink just about every single day! Well night! But still! And they were so wasted it was so funny!!! It was an awesome night I had tones of fun!!!!   anyway so I just wanted to leave a little message... How come the last comment I got was from john and about girls swimsuits? No one comments on mine:( that makes me really really sad guys! Later Gator
