I just got back to a small party. Adult party, most of them were gone drunk  bu the time it was dark. Ug. and everyone under 21 stayed in the living room while my brother played guitar. Sitting around bragging about each ones drinking escapades and girlfriends. Ug- i wanted to lock myself in a bathroom.I hate it when my cousin exaggerates adn lies about the shit he does. And why girls swoon at him is beyond me- he's the worst womanizer- exacpt he has no clue how to get a girl on his own. they just seem to flock to him. AG! it really is sickening to watch.  anyway.... not much else. i've been so tired lately everything passes over my head...  good night
