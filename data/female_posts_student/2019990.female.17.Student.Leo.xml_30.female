Right now I am capturing some footage I took of the tunderstorm on wednesday I want to say.  I think I'm going to take it and combine it with some music and make myself cd.  I have one Evanescence song with a thunderstorm on it, and I absolutely love it.     So i went into the commons today to see if Lola had left anything for me in the office.  I was assigned the task of handing out a few undelivered graduation announcements, and I was giong to make a copy of her self in technicolor tape.  But all the seniors were sitting in the commons waiting to get on the buses to go to oak lake for their senior skip day.  I went and talked to Lola, and it was very sad.  If I had a soul I would have cried.  I decided that I hate graduations.  It was kinda of exciting last year, but I now know how Wonder Woman felt lasr year when all her friends graduated.  But enough for now, I'm going to work on my personal video.  On the bright side I get to use final cut pro for another year.  Weee.
