I hate dust. I had to take some drugs to get me to stop sneezing. It was bad. Got everything set n ready so we can start tapin tomorrow...well today lol. Yeah. It was quite the long day. Kim came over and saved me for awhile...we went to the church and "practiced the organ" haha. Actually we went to the drive-in and got icecream. LoL Which reminded me...that was the first icecream cone I had, had since last July. Sad. Yeah. So then people started showing up here for my uncles party...He turns 50 today...Heh...My Dads B-day is today to. I think hes 54...or 53 somethin like that...Old Fart! lol Yeah so then I went over and babysat Cassie. Fun like normal. Plus it was cash. Ahh..money..lol. We watched monsters inc and then some tv...I tried to get her to go to bed but she wanted mommy...which is normal so she sat in the chair with me and fell asleep in my arms. Ahh I love that. First time I held her she fell asleep in my arms. Love it. Its so comforting. Ahh can't wait to have kids. *sigh* Anyways She finally went to sleep and I got soo bored that I actually watched....Baseball tonight. Sad huh? Yeah...Well I just got home and my parents are yelling so I better head off I guess....later.
