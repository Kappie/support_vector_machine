Surprisingly enough, I spent most of my time AWAY from the computer. It was nice, but I have to admit, I missed my dear friend. And of course, now when I am aching to spend my morning perusing the newspapers and my favorite blogs, I have to instead - work. Ugh. How unfair. ;)  I can sum up my weekend for you in this short dialect I had with a customer at Target on Sunday. I hope you find it as nauseating as I do. In fact, it characterizes the entire population of people in Orange County.   I was next in line to check out, when the manager asked me to move to another check out lane.   "But I've already deployed my items," I say.  "Deploy," says the woman behind me in line. "That's a great word."  Oi.
