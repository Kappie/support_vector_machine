I asked for help three flippin' times and he said he was going to help me but he left the room several times.. WTF? And no he never helped me so I left and today I went to the director of Animation and told him that I signed up for tutoring two weeks ago and that I have been very patient but I'm running out of time. He then told me that he'd send the tutor to the room I was in, and when the tutor finally came and we set a time up for tutoring  OOOooh man I was happier than a little girl with a basket full of dicks!! So I am FINALLY going to get the help I needed, yahoo. It's about fuckin time   SHEESHhhh
