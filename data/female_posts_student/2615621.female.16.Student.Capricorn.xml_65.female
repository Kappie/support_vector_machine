All you gotta do is be liked by the teachers. haha fun stuff! Oh and 2. did i mention how much i hate catherine? now sometimes i feel bad that all i rant and rave about is one of my best friends cousins. I wonder sometimes if she is ever like "aww my poor cousin, i wish people were nice to her" but then again, shes mean to her...hmm...i dount lauren is like "aww my poor cousin.." because if she was she would stand up for her, thats just how lauren is. :D  Katie is soooo freakin ...idk...STUPID?! i mean, ugh. shes getting on my last nerve, and believe me, my first nerve wasnt pretty either. haha ive always wondered why people say last nerve, what was the fist one like?  Right now i wish i was back at school to watch lauren sing but i had to do my spanish. sucks. oh well, i know she did awesome.   Leslie East came up to me and catherine and was like "so are you going to be the only mat-maid next year?" and since no one else has shown intrest and all the others were seniors i am the only one. I WANT TO BE THE ONLY ONE. lol its fun being the only one. WELL...catherine says "I'LL BE A MAT-MAID WITH U!" and i was like, *think fast think fast make her hate it* so i said, "well its during swimming and it takes up all my saturdays and 3 afternoons out of the week." and she said "well i'll be there every saturday" and im thinkin "damn damn damn nazi bitch* (nazi sounded cool there) and then it hit me!!! we're all eating and all the sudden i say "OOH CATHERINE!! im glad you want to be a mat-maid with me!! because the 1st years have to clean up the blood and puke!! yay and im head matmaid so i dont have to!" Catherine flat out said she wasnt going to do it. I kept insisting she do it, that its really fun and you get to hang out with hot guys on a bus for hours and really get to know them ;) haha and well thank god she stuck to her "no" answer. Im so smart! :D ...but u do really have to clean up blood and puke, even though i never had to, candiace, last years head mat maid did...but hell im not...coach bodnar can :D haha   Thank you god for my wonderful deciving brain :D - amen.
