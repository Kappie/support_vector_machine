We played just enough shower games to be funny, but mostly everyone sat around and talked, ate, and cooed at adorable baby clothes. Thanks to everyone who came, and especially to Alex, who really came through in the last minute food prep that sort of freaked me out. I'm really glad that everything turned out so well. It was a lot of fun. See the silly pictures below as proof. :)
