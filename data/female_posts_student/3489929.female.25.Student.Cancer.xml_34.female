Case in point: the following memo was passed around the office on Thursday (and believe it or not, this is a serious problem at my workplace):        "ATTENTION ALL NASTY FOLKS:    Alright, now this seems a little ridiculous to have to pass out a memo telling y'all how not to be completely disgusting, but...    Apparently some of you are wiping boogers on walls and any place else you feel like it. I don't have to tell  MOST  of you how revolting this is. If you feel the need to pick your nose instead of using a tissue, and something's on your finger, get a tissue, wipe it on yourself, EAT IT for all we care, but  DO NOT  wipe it on the walls of the bathroom, breakroom, or anywhere else like a five-year-old would.    Now, this doesn't apply to everyone because I know that not everyone that works here is a  nasty, nose-pickin' maggot , so I apologize for subjecting you all to this issue, but at least now you know that there are  TACKY, NASTY, CLASSLESS, DISGUSTING PEOPLE  among us, so WATCH OUT FOR THEM!    Management."        This memo was actually my fault. Not through any booger-picking. I told Posh (who moonlights as our company's janitor) that I was getting sick of seeing the boogers all over the bathroom wall, and there was one on the break room wall that I noticed while I was eating my lunch yesterday (the boogers are up so high on the wall, it's like someone had decided to flick them and try to beat their own record or something). So she and Chili Dog came up with the memo and dispersed it to everyone, and poor Posh had to scrape all the boogers off the wall last night (which she technically should have done way before now because they had been up there for quite a while). But she forgot the one in the break room, and I saw it again today whilst eating my sesame chicken from China Ya (oh, yum).    [By the way, it may just be me, but every time I eat sesame chicken, I always geta little giggly, and a teensy bit guilty, becausethe  stupid  part of my brainwill always associate "sesame chicken" with Big Bird on Sesame Street. But then I get over it because: 1. Big Bird is a puppet, duh, and 2. even if they did fricassee him, cotton and fake feathers would not taste as good under a sesame glaze as the "chicken" (i.e. dog) they fry up instead. :)]    Moving on.    Today was a lazy day. No one wanted to work. I have not had the best week, but at least it's over now. Another chapter in my life at the company down. Another to be written next week. Maybe one NOT so dramatic. Maybe I can actually have a good week next week.    And maybe I can take off under my own power and sail the skies.    Speaking of sailing the skies: my brother Nick is in Texas for a month. He flew there by himself- his first time on a plane ever. He got an internship atsome art studio that does computer animation and he'll be there for a few weeks. I found out by calling my mother's cell phone this evening looking for her:    *ring*  Nick: "Yeah?"  Me: "Nick?"  Nick: "Yeah."  Me: "What the hell are you doing with Mom's cell phone?"  Nick (sounding pissed): "I'm in Texas! This is long distance! Call her at home!" *click*    So I called my mom, who was watching  Jeopardy!  with Daddy, and she laughed and explained what was going on, and said she gave Nick her phone in case of an emergency. Then we stayed on the phone and played along, and I got Final Jeopardy! right, and she got it half-right (which is good for Mom, since she doesn't know shit about Shakespeare), and Dad didn't have a clue (hee hee).        Category: Shakespeare  Question (or Answer- however you look at it): Two of the four Shakespeare plays in which a ghost appears.  My answer: What are  Hamlet  and  Macbeth ?  Mom's answer: What are  Romeo  Juliet  and  Julius Caesar ?    The correct answers:  Hamlet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar,    Richard III.  (for the record- I knew all but  Richard III ). :)-          And of course Mr. Smarty-Pants got it right, and he set a new one-day record of $75,000, and he gets to come back in eight weeks after all the tournaments are over. 38 straight days. What a way to make a living. He'll never have to haul manure, or whatever he does 9-5, ever again.    Lucky bastard.    I am going to spend tomorrow cleaning and sprucing up the joint, and then Sunday I am going over to my parents' house to have some quality time with Lucy the Amazing Yapping Yorkie- oh yeah, and my mom and dad too.    All is pretty good. I'm just moving right along down the track. Choo choo.
