I basically just wanted to write something, and her birthday was handily coming up, so there it is.  It's kinda mean to a girl we know, but only because I needed a scapegoat. I feel guilty about that though. There are a few inside jokes imbedded into the story, but not so that it's excluding. (btw, Krisaat, if you read this: You've got more coming.) There's a link under Creations in the sidebar ~~> Rb out.
