My sister came over and started saying that I couldn't go to 6 Flags, but they're not going this weekend anyways, so it's no big deal. I may go to a movie tomorrow, though.   I went golfing with Andrew (putt-putt golfing..I think that's how it's spelled..whatever..) today, and kicked his little behind. ^__~  ..Actually, no, he beat me. Most likely by a LARGE margin. But that's okay, we can pretend that I won. ^__^ Then Culver's, where I spilled a bunch of melted shake all over the table. I can't really feel bad for the person responsible for cleaning it up, though..*I* clean tables..it isn't as horrible as people think. "*GASP!* DID SHE JUST SAY THAT SHE DOESN'T PITY THE WORKERS AT A LOW-PAYING FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!! HOW DARE SHE!!"   -Yes, I did say that. *I* WORK AT ONE. Uh-oh? Send the cops after me. Please. I dare you.  Then Andrew dropped me off and met my Zoey and Pepper and birds, and saw the extremely dirty fish tank (yeah, gotta clean that sometime..), but I stopped him before going in my room. Disaster zone. Sorry Andrew, but seriously, *I* don't even go in there unless I have to. Honestly.  So, I have *NO* life. Right when I get through the door, I sat down at the computer, checked my messages, my email, Beautiful Dreamer for updates, and then came on here to make a post. I think I may actually keep up with this one. I have about 40 different web diaries that I never did anything with, because..well, if no one reads them, then what's the point..? Hopefully all of my buddies at Beautiful Dreamer will keep my butt motivated to update.  When I get back from South Carolina (leaving..Tuesday..I think?), I'm gonna take my next paycheck and develop film. School film, party film, everything. I'm gonna get my pictures P.O.S.T.E.D. I have to do it sometime.  Wow, am I tired..  AND I FINALLY GOT OUT OF THE HOUSE..Praise the LORD!!! ..I was going insane. My life was; get up, go to work, come home, go on the phone/internet, go to sleep, get up, and do it all over again. It sounds okay, but doing it every day of the summertime SUCKS. So I'm in a much better mood now (Gotta love Andrew's Mom).  So this concludes my post. He-ave a ne-ice de-ay.  ..Oh, Elemental, thanks for the comment. It's much appreciated. And enjoyed. Go ahead, harass her, warn her, do whatever ya wanna do to her. Have fun. I'm done with sticking up for her or trying to save her ass. Hell, if I wouldn't have blocked her already, *I'd* be harassing her. Oh man, would I be harassing her..
