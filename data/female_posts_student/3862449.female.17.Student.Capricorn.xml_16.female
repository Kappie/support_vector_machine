At the end of the day I met two of the undergrad students who are working with the resident astronomer Joel Kastner.Since Joel is away until the 18th, Rachel and Samantha helped me get started with my work. He is working on a project to find out if a bunch of stars have a smaller companion stars which are causing them to appear to emit infrared rays (at least i think this is what is going on...i still don't fully understand).To do this, he is using the Spitzer telescope which is one of four large orbiting telescopes which make up a program of NASA. It takes pictures using an infrared camera. I learned how to use Unix and then had to download images taken by the Spitzer telescope of 66 stars to create a library of images. This was kind of tedious work because it takes a long time to enter in the coordinates of each star, but it wasn't bad and I learned a lot, even though i still don't quite understand what is going on. Hopefully things will begin to make more sense soon!
