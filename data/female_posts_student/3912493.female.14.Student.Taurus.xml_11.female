As we were going back to the house, I spent the ride laughing at the funny stuff my aunts were saying. Fun.   When I got home I watched the soccer match between Brazil and Paraguay. It didn't really matter who won, because they were both qualified for the quarter finals. Paraguay won 2-1, though I wanted for Brazil to win. Dang it. So now there's gonna be 4 matches coming, and I'm gonna watch all of them except one, which is Colombia VS. Costa Rica. Here are the matches, and in parenthesis is the team that I want for them to win:   Perú VS Argentina (Perú)  Paraguay VS Uruguay (Uruguay)  México VS Brazil (this is obvious)   So... yeah. They show those matches on Saturday and Sunday. w00t, 'tis gonna be a weekend of soccer. I love soccer, even though I haven't played it for a long time. I always used to be the goalie, and I was a pretty good one. I'd play with my cousins and we would always have fights. XD Yep, those were the days. Darn you, time.   I went to sleep at 2 AM, and one of my aunts was upset because I was still up. I guess she didn't know that once I stayed up until 6 AM on the internet. Heh. She told me she was gonna wake me up early tomorrow, and heck she was right. I only got 6 hours of sleep, and as of right now I'm so tired. I feel like going to sleep but I can't. Most of the time I spent talking to Mike S... heh, he's so fuggin' funny! He's the one that I can talk to about anything and anytime, and I think he's the one that I can relate to the most. He's always saying some hilarious stuff, and most of them are random. Mike rawks.   Even though we cleaned the carpet yesterday, it still looks dirty and my mom's upset. Oh well. Plus, we cleaned my room for nothing, 'cause supposedly my aunts were gonna sleep in my room, but they ended up sleeping on the living room. Darn, I guess cleaning the carpet didn't help  at all.    Now here's the part that annoys me. Yesterday I sent an e-mail to all the people who send me forwards telling them that I didn't want any kind of forward unless it was a really, really, really but   really   cool, funny, entertaining one. I also put the headline as "Read this carefully." So, this morning, I find out that I have two e-mails for me. I was hoping they would be some interesting e-mails, or newsletters from the many sites that I go to. What do I find? Two fuggin' forwards, and they were forwards from the people that I told not to send any kind of forward unless it was a really, really but   really   cool, funny, entertaining forward. What was it about? The same darn crap, "If you send this to 'x' friends, you'll get good luck, if you don't you'll have bad luck in any kind of rela--" Bullcrap! I'm getting pretty sick of them, and if I keep receiving forwards, then I'll make a new e-mail that no one exceptfour people (maybe 5) will know about. Keep it up and you'll see my rage. Rawr.
