Why does being an adult have to be so hard?  Not that childhood is easy, I suppose.  Nothing is ever easy.  But if it was, I guess that I'd be less likely to appreciate life, right?  I miss Matt.  I think the cat senses my loneliness because she's started sleeping next to me again.  She hasn't done that since we first got her, when she used to try to sleep between me and Matt.
