I'm sick and tired of cries, I'm sick and tired of defeat.  I refuse to fall in love now, And now I refuse to cry. I refuse to think of somway, somehow I could believe in you lies.  Never again will I get my hopes high, Never again will I wait. Love used to be the only thing that mattered, Now it's the only thing I hate.
