My habit of trailing off made me start a new post [since I have nothing to do].   "Charmed again", the clever title [ugh!] I thought of has double meanings. First is because, yes... you might have figured out, Charmed is back for a new season. Again is therefore used. And..... and.... Second one: Since I was watching Mr. Magoo [the movie] on channel 5 yesterday, there were a lot of  Charmed  commercials. Two types of be exact, the first one is just plain, talking about the usual...when it's being aired and stuff. The second commercial is meant for you to  laugh . The narrator talks extra fast, summarizing what happened in Charmed for the past few seasons. The last bit, [the narrator] talks about them having a new whitelighter, Chris [Perry, if the info Jasmine gave me is right]. There were a few shots of him. And so, the second reason for "Charmed Again" is because I'm "charmed" by a guy "again". This time, it's  Drew Fuller  that plays Chris is  Charmed .  I'm not mad about him just yet, I don't think I'll be as mad about him as I am for  Sean Biggerstaff . *starts wiping sweat* Talking about him already makes you feel the "hot"s for him. Too bad he's just a small-time actor...   Sean , if you haven't realized, is the oh-so-fuckin-hot actor that plays Oliver Wood, the quidditch captain and keeper of Gryffindor in  Harry Potter .  And Jasmine, "sean" is pronounced as "shawn", not "seen"!!!
