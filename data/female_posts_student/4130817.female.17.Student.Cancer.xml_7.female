This is because women have a certain gene on each of thier chromesomes and men only have one. This is why men are more likely to be color blind. Even in the days when we were hunters and gatherers women needed to detect the diferences between poisiones berries and edable berries, two different reds. And it is a good thing men did not have to do that or we might not even exist lol. Thought this was interesting and I thought I would share it with who ever reads this. ttyl ~ashley~
