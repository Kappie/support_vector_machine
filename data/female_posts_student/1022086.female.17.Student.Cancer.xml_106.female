She had told me the paperwork was done and sent off when it wasn't, and, as if lying to me weren't bad enough, no flight was scheduled and paperwork just got back. Now the finding a flight part.  They're all expensive, and they're all unclear. We seem to have found a pretty decent deal for more than a ticket should cost anyway, and now there is the issue that it is unsure whether it's a direct flight or not. I'm scared. I really hope this turns out to be a direct flight, because if not, I may very well get myself lost somewhere in the world...  There was, of course, the option of the body pass that my Aunt Juliana decided to throw in there last week; as she works for Delta, she offered daddy and I body passes. Now, while that isn't an issue for getting up there, the getting back is a real issue because we may very well get stuck in Rome, which would NOT be a good thing. Mind you, I'm only seventeen and this is my first time going across the globe on my own (daddy's mind can't help me). Actually, it's my first time flying on my own. Now, should I get stuck in rome, I could probably manage to find me a hotel and be all right in one way or another, but then there's daddy, and that complicates things more than you could even begin to imagine.  So, now I'm a bit frustrated, because I may very well be leaving exactly one week from today (next Tuesday) and be coming back 2 days before the beginning of school (school starts the 6th, I come back the 3rd), which is frightful in the sense that I will be exhausted, and just CRAP. AGHH!    Oh, and don't forget the family drama, of course. It is a long story that I shan't recount in detail on here, but what it all boils down to is that my mother hates my dad's family, and they hate her. Not only that, but also my aunt and uncle have their share of land and share daddy's share between them (farm land that there is profit off from), which, although we were always able to go without, is still unfair and all that jazz. Oh, and they're also battling over my family's house in the south, which is extra land, so of course they'd want that too (although that's a lot harder to snitch). So, all throughout my vacation, I will have to vigilate and make sure that they don't somehow convince daddy to sign anything that allows them to completely hoard whatever is there. And, although they love me, I know they very well may do that because even if I love them back, they are greedy people.    All I wanted was a break from this and a relaxing trip home. Is that really all that much to ask for!?!!?!?!?   EDIT: FUCK!!! They're bought. Atlanta-Frankfurt, Frankfurt-Rome. TO GET THERE. And to COME BACK: Rome-Cincinnati, Cincinnati-Atlanta... *cries* I'm gonna dieeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is sooooo nooooooooot faaaaaaaair!!! I'm so scaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaared!!!   Please pray for me. I mean, like really. I have NO earthly idea how I'm going to do this. I get lost IN Newnan...
