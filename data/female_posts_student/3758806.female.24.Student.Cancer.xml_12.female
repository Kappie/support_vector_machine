I went for Moroccan food at Pat and Jane's cottage, then spent the evening with them as well as Cameron, Julie, Paul, Janice, bla bla bla.. Everyone was up there this weekend.  We had fireworks and late night swimming... it was nice!  I stayed by myself at the lakeside cottage.  Mmm!  My LA plans are coming together finally except for one flaw in the plan.... But as far as I can tell, I'm going to be there for 11 days... I'm going to be staying in Jack's apartment near Santa Monica beach while he's away.... problem is there is one night I can't stay there.  So.  We'll see.    I'm getting there...  I'm almost finished "Vodkadvice".... my next project is a collaboration with actress/writer Marg McGrail (yes, my sister).  We were making notes.. it's going to be GREAT.  It's a comedy called "23 Orgasms"...  but it's not how it sounds.  Sort of.  Night night....  Happy Independence Day (belated!)
