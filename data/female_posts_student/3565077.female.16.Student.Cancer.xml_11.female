(little did they know, heh heh heh)i really hope that was the right context for ardent by the way, i have a habit of using big words without really knowing what they mean. then i just make an eejit out of myself. *sighs* soo i suppose now i should really go get ready for school... yeah, lack of posts over past couple of days was owing to our computer getting a nasty virus. typical charismatic moi decides to try to cure it, not by calling the nice people from microsoft, but by preforming a sort of technical exorcism, complete with fervent prayer leant over the keyboard and hands placed on the monitor, and then i get all upset when it doesn't work. "come on God!" i yell, "you created the world, for flip's sake! it's just a computer!!" nothing, no heavenly lightning bolt illuminates the screen, so i figure maybe he's off doing something more important (pah! what could be more important??!!) and mooch off defeated while dad calls the microsoft helpline... mleeh. anyway, i must get dressed.
