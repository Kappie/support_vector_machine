It was a 7 hour drive to get to my grandparent's farm. We had to wake up a 4:30 in the morning. Then we drove out to a field where we were debriefed, but honestly I have no idea what was said. It sounded something like this.  "So you two gotta walk the third to the second yonder draw over past the drag fence up there, but don't cross the adjacent fence which flies down on the opposite ridge, cause McWagoner's already cut the double flip-flop and we're hoping the herd is north by west-south. Thats why Kent here is circling back when the ball drops, if that happens you'll have to tell us because I'll be gunning the rig back to and forth along the gully-line and Jackson's creek. So the whole point is to re-align the fee-fi-fo-fum, to catch the overflow and head'm off with a box-in and if need be a second banger-rang. Just don't forget the banger-rang."  I decided that all concludes to "Go stand on a hill, and if you see a deer you should either shoot it or not shoot it, depending."  So me and my Dad spotted all these deer, but we couldn't tell anyone cause the radio went of range. So we didn't shoot them, and they ended up going over our "draw" further down where Ed was. And then we shot them. We stood around and shot deer... we really didn't even have to move that much. There were no line of sight obstructions besides the hills, the deer didn't really stand a chance because I saw groups of hunters on every hill for miles around.  We had 8 tags, and ended up with 9 deer by 9am which I guess is phenominal and never happens. But I was still sorta bored. I had fun because it was all new, but if I went again that wouldn't really happen cause I guess most hunting trips are just walking around for a long time... which is almost as boring as standing around.  I told my Dad that I didn't understand the challenge behind the hunting, because putting a scope on a deer and pressing a trigger is really easy, and the only way you find them in the first place is half by luck. He talked about how men have always hunted and such, but I wasn't buying it cause men haven't always had high powered scoped semi automatic 7.62mm rifles, and 2 ton Ford Trucks to carry the dead stuff and the night-vision goggles and the anti-phermone spray to cover your scent.   If I go next year I might as well just bring some hand grenades, and maybe a launcher for them. That way you could get dozens of deer at once right over the hill. I mean, its not like anyone really even needs the meat anyway you know?   Or even better, just put a lazer on a satillite and hit them from orbit. Enough of the line-of-sight crap! Just set up a laptop out there with a little portible dish and look for heat signitures. Then you could charter a helocopter to go pick up the carcuses, and they'd already be cooked for Ma.  So anyway, to avoid the hunting regulator people since we had a deer with no tag, we drove back through the hills cross country style and it took us an hour. Thats bumpy stuff to, since of all cars 4x4 trucks for some reason have the worst suspension (IT MAKES NO SENSE).     ---------------------------------- "I heard if you play a Window's 98 CD backwards, it says satanic messages.. thats nothing, if you play it forwards it installs Windows." - some guy somewhere that once said it  notes: Eric is starting a movie review segment of the site, since he's great at that... annndd James is helping me with thumbnails for the pics. I'm updating the links and blog sections too.
