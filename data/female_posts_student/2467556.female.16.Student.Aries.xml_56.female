Nothing really happened today.....or the day before that.....or the day before that.......oh well, right now life is boring because exams are coming up or whatever  Sports Update: Stars lost on Valentine's day to Pheonix (i love Shane Doan he is sooo hot and i think he got an assist!) 3-2, Stars lost to the frickin Anaheim Ducks 3-1.  Wow this sucks.  Coppell plays Keller in Euless at 9 frickin 30 pm.....and i can't go *tear*, i really wanted to see us kick Keller's ass too.  oh well, i'll just hear about it later.    Blonde Kid with no Fashion sense: He returns!!!!!  yaaaay!!!  i loved his shirt today, made his eyes stand out, very nice choice for him.  I'm afraid the ugly jacket still lives too because he wore it today.  ok but his shoes did not match his shirt!!!  They were light beige (aaaah i hate beige!) and he's wearing BLUE.  Ok....no.   If you're wearing something brown/beige (*shiver*) then its ok to wear beige shoes, but not when you're wearing blue!  aaaaagh!!!  His shoes didn't even match his jacket!  Lauren wasn't here today, so i had to critique this kid all by myself.  Lauren, if you're sick get better!!!!  Nathan was making fun of me because me and Lauren always "stalk" this kid at lunch.  Kendra finally saw the blonde kid today and we've been looking for half a week, she said he looks like he's clueless to everything.  Nadia still has to see him though!   lalalalala i have no homework........and can i just say that Marlon Brando (the actual actor, Sarah lol) is REALLY FREAKING HOT in the movie we're watching in English, Julius Caesar.  I mean seriously, the boy is fine.  Too bad that movie was made in the early 50's and he's like.....70 years old now.....*tear* oh well, me, Boah and Niki have fun drooling over him.  There's this one part of the movie where he has no shirt on....so hot! lol, ok i'll stop now....  Best of Luck to all getting through this week....i know i'll need it.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
