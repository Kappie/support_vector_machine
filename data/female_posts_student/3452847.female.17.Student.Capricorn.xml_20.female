I stupidly thought i could go to Brighton with them, i should have realised that it wasa band thing and even if it wasn't Jason doesn't want me there, i'm sure it wasn't Loz it was me who was in the way on Monday. I don't blame him, i should have kept my mouth shut and not said anything, but as usual i did the opposite. I feel like i can't really ever be proper mates with Lianne as he will always be there, always not liking it, i feel like Tom says everything to make me happy as he just wants to impress and i feel like Jason hates me with a passion. Really is completely over and i should have accepted it a long time ago. But he should not have kissed me, never, in a million years should he have done it to me, he knew what would happen and he did it on purpose, and i fell into the trap, again and again... I need to pick myself up, yet again, take myself out yet again, and depend on myself yet a fucking gain. There is no one, or nothing for me, and there definately isn't anyone for him, he deserves no one. I know i'll move on and be even stronger, the way things are going i'm going to be so fucking stronge by the time i finally hate him. I'm not going to be able to be hurt by anyone. I should have got stronger a long time ago... Hes not worth it, hes not worth it, hes not worth it... I'm not worth it in his eyes, so hes not worth it in mine.   ~Lisa~
