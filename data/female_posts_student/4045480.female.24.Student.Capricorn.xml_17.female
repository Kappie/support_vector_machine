All my financial stuff is now in folders and filed, DVD's and CD's are put away, fish is back in the room, computer and wires are all neat and tidy (these things called cable turtles, awesome invention). Still am trying to find a home for all my pens, pencils, other odd crap. Then I can start on the piles of crap that are still in my room under my clothing, shoes, and pillows. I swear, once this is done I'll be the happiest person in the world. I just gotta remember it's little baby steps. I have to say, I've found stuff I forgot I had, pictures, mementos, etc. And I'm very embarrassed by how many DVD's and CD's I have, and those are just the ones on my desk, not to mention the CD's in my drawer, and the DVD's downstairs that are also mine. I really just want to wiggle my nose and be done with it, sorta like that old sitcom  Bewitched.      I guess there really isn't much more to say today, got a party tomorrow night, should be fun, KJ should be back in town in the next few days, and then there is all the stuff I should be doing instead of parties, etc. Alright, time to finish what I can for the evening, set alarm for step aerobics in the AM, and get ready to keep truckin'. Goodnight!
