We made our way up to Noddy Land to pick up Alex, following his SMS directions and his faith in my ability to remember where his place was after being there twice, both times in the dark and both times with someone else driving.  We got there about 3:20 and he didn't answer the door, so I rang him and he told us off for being early because he hadn't packed yet.  We were only 10 minutes early!  He finally emerged, with sustanence for the road, and we took off.  At about Maribyrnong Rd he realsied that he forgot the stereo, so we went to Suse's place and stole her housemates stereo.  We stuffed it and her eski in the boot and made our way down Geelong Road.  The trip was pretty normal, including the heavy showers around Avalon.  We arrived in Geelong and went to the bottle-o to get some beer.  We finally found it and ran into Cath in her Deakin gear while we were there.  The Deakin team were sharing a hotel with us.  We got to The Mecure and ran into Kosta, Gus, Chris and Barrie in the Foyer.  We got our keys and started lugging stuff upstairs.  Being only three girls, we were sharing one room, so me and suse had to share a bed.  We found out that our room had a door into Alex's room, so we went upstairs to Kosta's room and declared our rooms the party place.  Barrie went downstairs to sort out his sleeping arrangements because he didn't have a room assigned to him.  It turned out that they had Jeremy down instead of him, so that was all okay.  Then John and Liz arrived and we sat around waiting for Frank to get back from the Team Managers meeting so that we could go out for dinner.  It turned out that he wasn't even coming with us, so we all sat around hungry for nothing!  Dinner was a short walk around corner at Kosta's most favourite restaurant in Geelong - Top of the Town Pizza.  I just thought that there was too much ham on the pizza.  And then it was down to Eureaka for the traffic light party and my first ice cream in a very long time :)  Unfortuneately, this evening was the night that Gomez was playing in Melbourne and I was bitterly dissapointed to miss their concert, being their first visit in 18 months.  We didn't wake up as early as Alex would have liked on Tuesday.  We also had the slight problem that although John, Gus, Alex (at the physio) and I were all ready to leave on time, no one who had a car was.  And Jermey was left at the station for ages waiting for someone to come and pick him up.  We got to Deakin and there seemed to be no one on any field and we weren't exactly sure where we were playing until we saw Bart and Andrew walking along in their bright yellow accusing us of being late.  We got started in our first match against Monash just after nine, which we lost 5-8, most points going with the wind.  Lunch at the union was followed by our game with Adelaide who had just beaten Ballarat.  It was a tough game but we were much better prepared and scored a couple upwind points to win 9-5.  We lost Suse early in the match with a ankle injury, so Liz, Loz and myself had a lot of savage to look forward to.  I ranked Adelaide above Monash, even though Monash beat us, because they used their whole team, and it is pretty hard to win if you only play with four players.  That evening was the Team Melbourne Cockail Party in which we tried to eat as much finger food as possible to avoid having to pay for dinner.  We went back up to Alex and Johns room to "team bond" and the party animals went out while the old fogies went to bed.  Again we had a 9am game, this time against the fun loving BUF.  Again the wind was a big factor, but we scored enought up winders to win 11-6.  We didn't know which semi we would be playing in because it all depended on the result of the next match between Adelaide and Monash.  They played in very windy conditions while we sat in the comfort of our cars trying to predict the result.  Near the end of the match, there had been no upwind breaks so it looked like we would be playing Adelaide in the second semi.  We went back to the hotel to recover and relax before making our way back to Deakin for the second semi against Adeliade at 3pm.  It was the hardest fought match of the tournament, with both teams scoring upwind points.  At soft cap Adeliade were ahead 11-10 and the score was set at first to 12.  Amazingly we score the two points required and won the match and got into the final against Monash.  It all seems a little blurry to me now, I played a lot of ultimate yesterday.  Back to the hotel for a massaging spa bath and then out to the Frisbee Dinner.  All the other teams had way more energy than us and thought us all pikers when we were the first to leave and we went back the hotel to watch a movie and then fall into bed.  We got Starsky and Hutch on pay per view and I kept drifting while watching it.  Since Barrie had gone back to Melbourne halfway through the semi for work, Kosta offered one of the girls Barrie's bed so we wouldn't have to share, so I accepted.  We went upstairs and turned out the lights and five minutes later Barrie came back.  Kosta was feeling guilty for giving away his bed so he took all the cushions from the sofa bed and went downstairs to sleep on the floor with all the cushions down there too and Barrie took Kosta's bed.  Barrie was so excited that we won the semi and he wanted all the details, so I told him the story and by the end I was also excited and couldn't get to sleep for ages.  Today the first thing on the agenda was check out and breakfast by 10 so we got to sleep in.  I woke up at about 7:30 as usual.  The final started at 1:30pm and we made sure that we were there in plenty of time to warm up.  The final was a let down after the semi and although we were pretty even at the start, we won convincingly 15-11.  We collected our medals and drove home and now I'm off to Alex's for a celebration.
