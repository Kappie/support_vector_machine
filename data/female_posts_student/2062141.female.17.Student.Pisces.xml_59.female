"Too Much Food"  ... minor chord, very fast, kinda bitter sounding.. you don't know how much energy it took to memorize this... lol.. this has the greatest opening verse i love it...  You can say that I'm one curly fry in the box of the regular Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt People say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things  Instead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings But it's much too soon to leave this easy life Pass me the spoon. Pass the analytical knife __________________________________  "Good Day Sunlight" ... slow and blue-sy... with pleasant fuzz sound in the back... strangely sad  Good-day sunlight I'd like to say how truly bright you are You don't know me but I know you You're my favorite star Follow you I will so lets get moving Who needs shelter when the mornings coming? Absolutely there's no one Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me, no. not anyone. By your clock the cock rooster crows Then off to work where everybody goes  Slow, But eventually they get there Picking up the day shift back where all left off Confined and pecking at relationships  You know it's only a worthless piece of shit _________________  "The Remedy (I Won't Worry)" ... everyone knows this one.. so I'll just write my favorite part.. shit that boy can belt it  When I fall in love I take my time There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why ________________  "Absolutely Zero"  ....made me cry, sung with so much emotion... this is one of the ones where you really gotta hear it to get the impact of it...  You. You were a friend. You were a friend of mine I let you spend the night You see how it was my fault. Of course it was mine. I'm too hard at work. Have you ever heard of anything so absurd ever in your life. I'm sorry for wasting your time. Who am I to say this situation isn't great? It's my job to make the most of it Of course I didn't know that it would happen to me. Not that easy. Hey what's that you say? You're not blaming me for anything that's great But I don't break that easy. Does it fade away? So that's why I'm apologizing now for telling you I thought that we could make it I just don't get enough to believe that we've both changed. _________________  "Tonight, Not Again" ... starts off sad and troubled... ends hopeful and vibrant... great song... this is probably the best written one but the most understated one...obviously one of my favorites.... i love how he says flushed "flush-shed"...   The night. She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  This time like every other time I believe that I never find Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again. And don't it feel allright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely. ______________ Lalalalovely.
