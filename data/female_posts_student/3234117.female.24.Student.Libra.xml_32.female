So anyway thinking my account was still in the positive range, you can imagine my surpise to see I was in the hole by a -$290. I got charged 7 overdraft fees of 33 dollars each. Wow! And all using my checkcard which I thought wouldn't let you charge something if you did not have any money in it.  So I go to my bank. I talk to the manager and tell him I thought I had overdraft protection and I didn't understand how I could be -290 dollars. He says I don't have overdraft protection and that he can only take off 3 of the charges, which is only 100 dollars. Anything is better. He's telling me this and I can feel the tears coming. I try my hardest not to cry, but here I am crying in his office, in the bank, in the grocery store. I was just so flustered and stressed from class that I guess I was in need of a good cry. I was so upset that I didn't even think to be embarrassed. Well I guess he felt sorry for me and told me to call him back in 3 weeks and he would take off the other 3, which would leave me with one overdraft fee. He explained that he didn't normally do this, but he would for only a few people and I would be one of them.  I still had to put my paycheck in the bank, but seeing as I was still crying I decided to put my sunglasses on and exit the store. I'm so thankful for this guy and I hope he remembers me in three weeks. It is just so frustrating when they charge me overdraft fees when I have money sitting in my savings account. Luckily this is the first time in the past year this has happened or I'd still be -290. It's my once a year ritual to get an overdraft fee. Only this year, it was way more than ever.  So now I'm off to class. What a wonderful day!
