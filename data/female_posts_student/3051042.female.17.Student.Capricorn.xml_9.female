I'm royally pissed that just because Keith, Gareth, and I skipped the talent show assembly and went to Starbucks, where we saw Ms. Peet, she had to go and bitch to administration about it. If I don't intercept that call my weekend is going to be screwed. Grr... he also wants to talk with me about my grades. This is definitely the worst week of my life. I just hope he left a message and my parents are home to listen to it. Argh. Pleas just let this all work out.
