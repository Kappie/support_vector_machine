Of course, there were like 8423029843923 names graffittied on like every wall/phone booth/piece of ancient artwork/architecture/sidewalk ever.  However, i just decided to take a picture of it anyway.  A bunch of people in my group looked at me really weird, too, cause I was taking pictures of a random......... a random......... uh I don't even know what this is. But rock on.  The most common grafitti was "Ti Amo" (I love you) whoever their love was.  And then something like "I can't live without you" or "You are my life" or "You are so damn special I grafittied your name on a wall.  This is love."     urlLink    Miss Molly (yes, good golly) (that was so cheasy.  Did I spell chease right? Or is it Cheese? Tina help.  I'm tiard. Right. Anyway.)  and I in front of whatever it's called.  Palazza Regalo?  Thats just my guess.  It's the palace for whoever rules whatever city this is.  This is pathetic.  It's Naples.  And It's huge, it goes around three sides of us.  It also has a LOT of couples making out all over it.  I swear.  There are like five around there on benches.  The person taking the picture is probobly making out.  This place is like chocolate or flowers I guess. So here are Molly and I, err, not making out, just, uh, posing.     urlLink    Some weirdo who thinks she's a statue, too. Psh, crazy tourists.  I like the strong image of womankind.  You know, ancient feminists and all.  Or maybe that's bullshit and I simply enjoy every available opportunity to be an idiot.  I think I'm going with B.  I have no idea who this is.  But damn, she must have tickets to the GUN SHOW!!!!  get it...... alright moving on.     urlLink    Tracy, Deanna, Emily and I in the ''backyard" of the Palace thing.  That big distant road going up that mountain thing is a feat that a lot of people climbed.  See that grey thing on the next hill up?  Sara, Tracy, Allie, Alice and I sat there.  Much more relaxing. Also: See everyone leaned over the rail? They're looking at fish.  Tons and Tons and Millions of fish.  They like kill each other over the food we threw in there.  I got one to jump out of the water.  We were touristy, but whatever.  This was like 30 minutes of fun, right here, feeding and watching those damn fish. It was so increadibly fun.  And then we ate sandwiches with our bare hands. Yum.  But all the fish though are dead on the other end of the pond. Yum.      urlLink    Sara, Me, and Alice  with Principessa Cane, A combination of the two names Alice and Sara tried to give it. I just call it that.  They have their respective names.  I dont care.  Its a street dog. There were so many street dogs in Italy. It was our pet for a while when we waited for the kids to do their climbing thing.  And so we posed with the waterfall and the dog and then played with it for almost as long as we played with the fish.  Oh, what a circus.  Anyone know that line? no. Sigh, where's Carlton when you need him.    urlLink    This is the view from where we were sitting.  There was a street below us, as you can see, so I waved to the cars for a while when other people were writing in their journals.  Or climbing that big thing.  Hehe, you can see that statue's butt.  Yeah.  Mmmm.  So our first day in Italy comes to a close thus.     urlLink    The next day we go to Paestum.  This is that awesome Temple to Hera II (And behind it there is Temple to Hera I)  And I dunno I thought I'd be artsy and take it with the tree and all, my first view of it because it was so damn increadible looking.  This temple is HUGE, and so so so so SO old.  It looks amazing, I'm so lucky to be able to see stuff like this.  I'm a dork, I was so totally into this stuff.  Isn't it cool looking? Alright, this is really the last picture on this roll, because I lied last time, I just didnt want to post any more pictures.  Right-o, then, till next time.
