It was about a train wreck in Turkey, in which at least 36 people died. What would make the French wine article so much more important the Turkish train wreck? Is it because people don’t care about Turkey as much as France, or because people care more about wine than human lives? Turkey and France are both far away from the USA, so distance probably didn’t have anything to do with it. Maybe there just wasn’t enough material for a large article on the wreck, or they just needed some sort of filler. In any case, it is an interesting problem to think about. What’s your opinion?
