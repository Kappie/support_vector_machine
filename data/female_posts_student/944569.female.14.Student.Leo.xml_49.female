To me, there is no more beautiful a season than Winter.  It is quite a shame that ppl ruin it and step all over it.  Snow is at its sparkling, utmost and untainted beauty when undisturbed.  Like little soft clouds on the grass. Not in clumsy packages we call " snowballs".  Each snowflake is different, like our world, everyone is separate,individual, unique.  I love snow.  I love its soft, gleaming shine.  And it cool and cold feeling.  It's so lovely, to touch snow.  Fortunately, I'm not like Jenny ( she eats the stuff! Poor little snowflakes!) =)
