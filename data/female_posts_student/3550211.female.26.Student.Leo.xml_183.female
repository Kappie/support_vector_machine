How sad, when the strings have been removed from the blinds and all the outlets have been painted over. And the television screen is streaked with blood and smeared from your knuckles, as if you were trying to punch it out but you underestimated the strength. Or maybe you just weren't trying hard enough. Startled by a knock at the door, you'll rise for the first time in two days to answer. But you can only greet the visitor with one short statement  -  Hello. My first name is Distance and I really don't care if I never wake up again.
