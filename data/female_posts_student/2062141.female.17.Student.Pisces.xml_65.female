He has so much talent in every aspect and is an AMAZING singer with so much emotion to his voice, and it was equally so live. Every song is so clever and there's so much musicality to it. You feel like he's just pouring his soul out with every song. And he's so sexay. Hahaha what more could you want.                                         Now I'm gonna tell you about the concert, and i know anyone who doesn't care about Jason Mraz or even just weren't there really don't care.... but I just do this site because sometimes I feel like I will explode if I don't voice my thoughts. So read or don't read. But it's a really awesome story once I get into it... this really was the best night ever... I'm sorry it's SOOO long... But so before I say "really" another 20 times ....lol.... here goes...         Me and Charlotte were all totally prepared with lighters and cameras (we wrote "spirit of Josh" on my lighter and "spirit of Michelle" on Charlotte's, cause they couldn't be there). We made this TOTALLY FREAKING AWESOME poster.....well okay that makes me sound dumb, cause I drew it... but okay, yeah so what? It WAS awesome. I'm awesome.          I drew his face ---remember that I'm awesome--- and we wrote "YO that kid is Cuh-RAZY!" (it's from a song, Curbside Prophet) and "LalalaLovely" (which I'm sure you've guessed by now is from a Mraz song... "Tonight, Not Again") and then because we're such dorks and we were so set on giving it to him that we signed the back, and wrote all this crazy stuff and even our email addresses (keep that hope alive). So yeah in short the poster was really really cool.               We got there a little bit later than I wanted to... traffic was bad and Dad dropped us off like TWELVE BLOCKS away... *OOPS*.... but we walked fast and the line wasn't too bad. We made friends with the girls in front of us and had them sign our poster.         Oh yeah I had an extra ticket (josh's ticket... sniff..) so me and char tried in vain to sell it but the only guy who needed it was realllly creepy and wouldn't pay full price. Blargh. No one ever just wants ONE ticket. But you know what I don't even care that I have to pay back my dad cause the concert was so fucking awesome.         Amanda who had to work came finally and then they let us in.... the merchandise was way cheaper than I thought it would be so I got 2 shirts, pins, a wristband... wow. There were no assigned seats so we put our stuff down real close to the stage on the far right.         When the opening band started, people immediately rushed to the front, but since we were right there we got a great spot right up against the stage. Kicked ass.           The opening band was Steadman. I hadn't heard of them before, but it turns out that they are SO awesome and I have to get their cd. SO much better than Wilco for REM, huh Charlotte? It was Steadman's last performance with Jason so at their last song (a Paul McCartney song I might add) all the crew (and a hatted and sunglassed guy who looked suspiciously like Jason playing a tiny accordian) came out with confetti and balloons and danced around... Mr."Not"-Jason smashed his accordian on the ground :D haha         We kept making friends with all these people and having them sign our poster, so the back was getting all filled up kinda like a yearbook... very cool.         Jason finally comes out and starts out with some really great songs I haven't heard, complete with Jason scatting (*a doobity do bat a dit dat dat*... haha so cool) and alot of improv and yeah I was so hyped... haha my throat, my legs, my arms, my back, my feet... are all in so much pain right now cause I was SOOO having the greatest time ever and dancing and singing for three straight hours.          But yeah the BEST PART..          So many people had signed our poster that everyone was rooting for us to give it to him.. so we're all shouting at him and... success! he says "ah what does that say? Lights!" and they shine the lights on us oh wow we were so excited that when he was asking what it said we were just like "AAAH!" ....He takes it from us and takes it to the center of the stage and shows everybody, and puts my drawing over his face and dances around with it ("Take note of this, boys, and remember that I'm cuh-razy" he says)... We were all freaking out and we're shouting for him to look at the back at all the signatures... and he does and...... oh man I took so many pictures in those few minutes lol. I really hope he keeps that. It was a most excellent drawing of him if I do say so myself. And if he even just reads our signatures and notes and all that, i would be so happy.        Then (((((!!!))))))  he props it up in front of the drums and it's there for the WHOLE OTHER HALF OF THE CONCERT right in the MIDDLE. We were soo soo soo happy. I still am. I bet those people were happy they made friends with us! I think I was shaking I was just so happy.          heh...their were only one other group of girls that had a poster (it just said "we heart jason" in bad lettering) but he didn't take theirs cause it was LAME bwahahha. Heh I'm mean... the truth hurts. hehe jk         He's an awesome performer. I didn't stop smiling the whole time. I swear to God me and Charlotte were like the most psyched people there. It was the most awesome concert ever. I wish I could rewind and go back a thousand times. God I love music.  **** FIN*****          I had such a good time. The concert was just so personal, just these guys having a great time playing great music. The problem with these idolized mega-popstars of late (britney, nsync, you know the crowd) is how their concerts, in these huge monstrous stadiums, are so impersonal... everything is planned out and sometimes music is even pre-recorded (???), like a tv special. Why bother. Just watch it on tv. Artists like Jason are real musicians who are loved through their great music by great music lovers.         You guys know that I'm real critical about music too. He's so awesome and that was like one of the best nights of my whole life. Great music, my best friends, and everything turned out like I hoped and obviously then some. I know that didn't excite you guys as much as it does me but you really had to be there I guess... I go overboard when I talk about music... I wish my life could just be music... everything music.. that's all I'd need. Sorry I just wrote so much... I just had to say it....I think i could explode... I think I would have if I didn't just type all that just now, so really this is for my benefit. ^_^  You're really cool if you read all that just now.  HAPPY BIRTHDAY CHARLOTTE! She said that was the best birthday ever and her birthday's not even til Sunday. Hell that was MY best birthday ever. :D  PS. Do you think it's weird that I had a better time at that than at Paul McCartney? I think it's cause I was with my family and we were so far away... I think it was like a dream to me kinda.. because I mean Paul McCartney's like a god. I just couldn't process that I was in the same room as him. That I could see him. Wow.   ***********  My only fear is that because the cameras weren't flash cameras (didn't have the cash just then for good disposables) and even though we were right at the stage they might not show up.... but it will always live in memory! I have to have at least ONE picture of him holding our poster.
