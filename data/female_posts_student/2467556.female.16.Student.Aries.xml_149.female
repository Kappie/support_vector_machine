I came home, took another shower and got ready to go on the hunt for a Vincent Lecavalier stick for Britty's birthday.  So i go on the hunt and discover that the Vinny stick that i originally saw was on clearance and is now gone.  The people at Oshman's were absolutely no help because they don't know anything about hockey.  So then i went to The Hockey Shop and discover that Vinny's new stick, a replica of the one he used in the playoffs, a Vector something (i can't remember the numbers after Vector but its the best of the best stick on the market right now) was $150!!!!!!!!!  I don't have that kinda money so i decided to buy Britt a Vincent Lecavalier poster.  Later, Nadia came over and we partied it up/talked about stuff, it was awesome.    Thursday: Job, got paid $60 for this week yay.  I went back to The Hockey Shop, discovered that they couldn't order me a Vinny poster so i decided that i'd buy Britty something SO MUCH COOLER!!!  Its this thing where it lists all the division of the NHL and has a bracket for playoffs and you can track the teams throughout the season/playoffs with the little magnets with the team emblem on it!!!!  its so cool, i want one!!  So after i watched the NHL Awards 2004 (instead of the 2004 MTV movie awards), i drove over to Britty house at 9:30pm to give her my present.  She loved it along with the Tampa Bay stickers that i got her for her car/bedroom door.  We hung it up and figured out (without using the computer!) who all made it to playoffs and who beat who to be in which part of the bracket.  it only took us 10 mins!!!  So that was cool.  I heard the MTV movie awards were kinda stupid this year, so i dunno if i'm going to watch the encore.  Now its friday and i think me and Jess are going to do something as soon as she finished her chores since everyone is either working or on vacation/at a summer camp thing.  Me and Jess decided that we're not going to make the same mistake we made over Christmas Break when no one was home and we both thought the other was busy and didn't call so we were both at home, really bored and alone lol.  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
