I wish I could retrieve the moon To place it in your hands To let the light run between your fingers  Just like the grains of sand Which run to symbolize the time I have With you and in this life  And yet I'd rather have the moon  So we could remain in this night  Or perhaps I'd fetch the stars instead  And spread them all around  To let the light shine down on us  And let the glow resound  Whatever I will need for us  I'll grab it as fast as I can  Whether it be as big as the moon  Or a simple grain of sand  The size in the end will matter not  Nor will the amount of time  No matter the size, these are my symbols To show that I'm happy you're mine.   I have been inspired by David Thewlis. Go  urlLink here , and you'll see what I mean.  Thoughts anyone?  Oh and Sallis... how do you know about the addicting Halo?
