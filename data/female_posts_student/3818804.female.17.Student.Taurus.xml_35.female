Good food, nice places, Extremely HOT!!! um, I saw wild burros and their shlongs...lol. That was perty funny...Got to hang with Sonny boy, he is too cute. I love their dogs. Saw some Hot guys...Eh...thats it.  Um, No Lala = No boys. lol. oh well...I guess if you cant like me for me and my way of life then screw you. haha, no pun intended. Boys are frustrating...  If I remember more about my time in Vegas i'll let you know. lol. Doode, It was a week long...how can i remember it all. All's I know is I had a damn good time.  P.S. I found out something neat! Someone digs me...lol
