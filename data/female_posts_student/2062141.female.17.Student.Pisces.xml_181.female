I'm not sure what I did to Josh, I'm very confused about how he can be so maliciously upset about some sort of trivial (did I say trivial? can i say it 5 more times?) misunderstanding. It's the weirdest thing. It's really the cherry on top to this SUPER week I'm having. Oh well, be mad if it makes you happy, because that's the only reason I can think of that you would be so insanely absurdly mad at me and Charlotte (and not Erinn wtf). Unless I accidentally killed your grandmother, and for that I am sorry. Lol. Thanks for being a good friend. But.. Oh well.        Anyways. Yeah. This year has been full of disgustingly-highschool drama, which is new for me. I'm not the sort that enjoys drama, in fact it kind of breaks me down completely, because my friends are the most important thing to me (it should be like, school, huh? uhhhh oh well) and I never try to do anything to hurt them but I'm starting to realize that that doesn't matter.         Ryan, you need to get your license. Now. It was very depressing on Saturday night to come home to an empty house. Especially cause.. you know.. I won't see you til uh 2008. Sigh. Why does everything suck so bad? I'm a happy person I swear, just... not right now.
