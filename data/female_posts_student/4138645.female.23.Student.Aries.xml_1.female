Well, I was supposed to go see Daisher sunday night, but I got to Cassies (to pick up the dig cam) too late, and he had to get up early, so I just chilled at home with Grandma and Uncle Dave, plus my cuz Sarah got in around ten from NY...and I haven't seen her in a long time.  So i stayed here and watched Inuyasha with the fam, i mean, Nooch, Ben, Nick, Sarah and Dave all watched it with me, including Keebler and my kittens!!  Monday morning, i slept till like ten o clock, i needed the rest i guess, I called Sonja, Johnny's little sister, cause we were scheduled to do a photo shoot today, she was on her way home from visiting Bobby in Cleveland, so i cleaned the house until she got here, I love photography, I could minor in it..sigh..well it was a fun shoot, nice day, she looked too cute in my cowboy hat, i hope the pictures get her somewhere, they are fantastic, maybe I'll link you guys to them if she doesn't care!  Well, she was here from like noon until 4:30 shootin and she had to go to work, well she got lost and was late, but PETE'S SAKE I didn't do it!!  I got showered and dressed, I was supposed  to meet Sara up at Flavors, it was her first night bartending, so i got dressed, and half way up there she calls and says i lost her soc, card when i unpacked the groceries yesterday, so i go to the house cause Brandi and Barry are there and had to dig thru the damn garbage...sooooooo gross, Barry was amused to say the lease, no luck, so I drive back to Cassies' and she follows me there and drops my car off and we go to Flavors.  We got a munchie tray cause we were starving!!  I got a free beer from Jessie...she's training Sara today, and I love her!  Well, Candace came, Kim Came, Timmy and Dave came, Jessie's boy and his friends came, Mike and his friend from the bar came, and some other kid he knows, Yoster came, and we basically had the bar to ourselves!!  We drank for freaking free all night long, i did so many shots, Cosmopolitans, Windex, Alligators, Hurricanes, beer all around, and others I have no clue what they were, we left at like 2:30, after i had made numerous phone calls to people i don't remember calling, and songs i don't remember playing, and taco bell i don't remember eating...oh goodness i was crazy, I called Daisher, and Cody, and woke up RJ when we got back to the house, and Dmiles let Kim sleep in his room, and i bombarded RJ and took over the bed, I know he's pissed, he had football today, i woke up and had NO idea where the hell i was, thank goodness i was with my boys!!!  Then i had to get up today at 8am, and went back to Sara's and Timmy ended up cuddling with her last night, ha ha, and candace was on the couch, and i didn't even get to go back to bed, I just went out and went shopping.  I got Dave Kill Bill 2 for his b day, i got one for me too.  Then i got Aqua Teen Hunger Force for myself...season 2 baby!!  watched all those movies today and just chilled on the computer all day messing with Sonja's pictures.  I did get SOME studying done today...I was glad, school starts monday, ah, sigh, no more freedom, buckle down time.  I talked to SAP for like a really really long time too, my sweetie....well, i am gonna make Daisher watch Evil Dead with me tonight, since everyone is still working, I am outtie like a troutie, ha ha so gay, later J
