Lots of fun people, lots of silly raps  greeting cards, some Mario Kart Double Dash (Toadetteandbabyluigi4thewin!), some beers, some party balls, some rounds of Kings all making for a great time.  Sprinkle in some Stongbad emails and some cute boys and can you go wrong?  I sumbit that you cannot.    My vegas trip has been postponed becuase of "outside" circumstances, but its all good in the hood, I'm either going to use my airline credit to go to Washington (the state not the district) to visit some friends or to go to Vegas with some other friends.  I'm prolly going to end up going to Washington though, because that will require the least money (no airfare cost, no lodging cost, minimal food costs) where as Vegas will be much $$, not to mention I have to a) save for Eurpoe with Anna and b) start paying my debt off so I can quit my job at the end of August.  Did you say quit your job?  Right you are, Ken!  I have made a huge decision in my life.  I am in the process of applying to  urlLink The University Of Connecticut  to go back to school full time as a day student and finish my bachelor's degree in English like I've always wanted to.  My plan is to sell my car for something I can afford a lil more easily and work thru til the end of August paying off as much of my $10k debtload as possible so that I can take some measly part time Starbucks-y job and continue to live at home rent free and finally finish my degree.  If I have to take student loans to do that, so be it, but I prioritized my life finally and finishing school is important to me, jerkin' off all night long at my community college isn't cutting it.  So I ask over the next few weeks and months as I go thru the application process that you all keep your fingers and toes crossed for me that I am accepted again (I'm not applying for housing as its a commuter campus), but I will finally finish what I started in September, 1999, graduate from the University of CT.  I should have been a member of the graduating class of May, 2003, but alas my one semester stint didn't help me accomplish that.  I am older, wiser and ready to just do this already so I can and  will  get it done.  The scariest thing in doing all of this is telling my mom.  I dont want her to think I'm a disappointment.  I know she will be happy I'm gonna go all the way and really finish school, but I can't handle a full time 8-4 job and then school on top of that.  At this point in my life a degree is more important to me and I will do what it takes to get it, but while I can afford to take the "normal" route there (schooling full days and workign PT around that) I would like to.    This was all just kind of one giant brain fart, but thanks for reading.  Go, Huskies!
