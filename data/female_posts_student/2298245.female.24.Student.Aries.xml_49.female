In this spirit, I would highly recommend that everyone get out there this holiday season and see some production of this ballet.  Chances are you won't have to go very far to find one.  And, if you can, try and support a local dance group.  My mother runs one herself in Gulfport, MS, and it is a daunting thing to undertake, and very very expensive, so support your local arts community, especially your local ballet.
