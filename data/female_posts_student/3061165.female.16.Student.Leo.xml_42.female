Anyways.. i think i was most bonkers suring my sss with Aliah.. lolzx.. dun really know his name but he's actually this sec 5 guy hu is a little bit on the cc type yah know?.. fat, so to speak.. Aliah and i were bored and we forced out our imagination and tot he was pretty cute.. we obeserved his every move and laugh each time we noticed something and acted it out.. lolzx.. it was truly amusing.. it was probably the most enjoyable sss i ever had.. so cool.. we said he was hot and cute and adorable and sweet, and all the gd stuff.. lolzx..  aliah noticed his chest and butt.. lolzx.. yah.. and we were laughin at that too.. really.. it was funny.. and totally lame.. cos obviously we were being really insane and crappy and all but certain things are hard to control rite?.. lolzx.. then when sss ended.. it started to rain and all.. did part of my colour scheme.. that sri didnt come today so we cont our art from where we stopped.. and wad i realised was that everyone was pretty much serious about completing their art.. including those hu usually sleeps or do their own work when she aint arnd.. except for bs.. he's still not being very serious.. lolzx..   hmmmm.. i sincerely hope i can fight thru this battle field and still stay alive and strong.. not easy though of cos.. aiming for visual comm.. i know i said this b4.. just repeating it.. hais.. cant seem to concentrate on my work.. i mus do it!!.. mi go bathe le.. then do my art.. jia you!!!!
