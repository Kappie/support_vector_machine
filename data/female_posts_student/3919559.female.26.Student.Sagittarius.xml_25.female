If you're an atheist or agnostic or just someone who doesn't think prayer is appropriate in a government setting, you have to suffer silently through infinite numbers of invocations, prayers at football games, etc. etc. etc., but should you deign to ask for "equal time" in what seems a reasonable and appropriate gesture given the circumstances, you are some type of affront to moral decency?  If it's inappropriate for an atheist to give an invocation, then it's inappropriate for ANYONE to give one.  It's too bad this council and others can't see their own hypocrisy.
