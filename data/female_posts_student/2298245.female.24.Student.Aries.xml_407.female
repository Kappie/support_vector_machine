Well, I suspect that  urlLink Tom  may decide to head to Crete permanently and cease communications with the outside world. And  urlLink Shannon  might pile up her law books and leap off.   Yes, folks, that is me he is talking about, as it is my blog he linked to.  I received a considerable amount of traffic (well, for me anyway, which isn't saying too terribly much), so I just want to allay any fears that I will try to do myself harm if Kerry wins.  Alas, even if I wanted to, I have sold a lot of my law books back to the bookstore, so I would be unable to execute such a plan.  Perhaps I will stop selling back and start stockpiling my books again, just in case.  I do still have all the ones the bookstore wouldn't take back becuase new editions have been published...  But I digress.  Robert goes on to offer some hope even in the face of a Kerry victory:   And of course, there are many others. All kidding aside, we have to be prepared. Take a deep breath and consider it: What if Kerry does win?   Well, the world will not come to an end -- at least not immediately.   Yes, I must admit that I feel much better now.  He goes on to make the anti-Kerry case, better than, and with much more authority, than I ever could:   Kerry's ducking, diving, "nuancing" and  urlLink insisting this is not a war  might appeal to some in the U.S. electorate, but the Islamist crowd is not voting (at least, not in large numbers) in a U.S. election. The enemy remain AT WAR WITH US, regardless of whether or not we -- as many of us seem weirdly determined to -- choose to cover our eyes, in the manner of a two year old playing peek-a-boo, in an attempt to make it all just go away. It won't.    I have to admit that at times I wish to succomb to this impulse as well.  There are times I almost find myself doing it, after watching the news for a long period of time, it all starts to seem so reasonably distant.  In the sight of recent setbacks and horrors, it makes one want to retreat even further, as I have been wont to do in recent days.  But ignoring it will not make it go away.  It is braver to stand up and fight, even if mistakes are made along the way - as mistakes will invariably be made, as no one is perfect and it follows that no nation can be perfect, and in fact is further from being perfect than any one individual because a nation is simply made up of many individuals with their imperfections compounded - than to curl up and admit defeat at the first sign of trouble or to pretend that it isn't happening at all.  Going back to the pre-9/11 mentality is absolutely the worst case scenario, and it is the most unacceptable position that any government, but especially this one, could possibly take.
