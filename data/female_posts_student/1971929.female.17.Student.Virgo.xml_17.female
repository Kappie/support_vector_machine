First we drove around Lake Jackson for like an hour going to people's houses and collecting stuff, so we got to the beach at like 3:15. We swam around for a while and then these three guys came. Only one was moderately attractive, until I glanced over and watched him pull up his boxers, but pull down his pants. Then I decided he's weird. They asked us if we wanted to go sailing with them, but they didn't even have a sailboat. It was one of those blowup boats that you use in swimming pools. So I also decided they were lame. Who asks someone to go sailing if you don't have access to a sailboat? They finally kind of drifted away from us, but came back to say goodbye when it was time to leave. We went back to the cars because we felt like we should be leaving too and then it happened. We were just standing there, minding our own business, when some black guy in a silver passenger vehicle drove up, stopped and hung his head and gold-plated teeth out the window and yelled "I just want y'all to know y'all all fine. Y'all all fine." We figured it was probably a really good time to go and started to get into the cars. His two black buddies then drove up, stuck their heads out the window and asked us what we were doing later. We were saved by the sailboatless guys who revved their engine and sent the black guys away. It was very amusing though. I also fulfilled one of my life long dreams of building a tunnel, though it was crushed shortly thereafter when the sailboatless idiots threw a football at it. I was crushed. Next time, I'll just have to make it bigger and better.
