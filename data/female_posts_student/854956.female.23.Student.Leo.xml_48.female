I hate it because it caused me to be quite bored... and has taken electricity away from Zack so we have hardly talked lately.  He was lucky last night and had a battery for the laptop... AND was lucky enough that the phones weren't down.  So he could get on for a bit.  We talked for about an hour... then he was supposed to come back but didn't for whatever reason.  My guess is that phones went down and he had no way to connect.  Anyhow, I'm supposed to give him a call this weekend, but I don't even know if I can get through, because well... phones may be down.  Oh well... in other news... not much is going on.  My Mom's birthday was Wednesday, and so we all went out to Marie Callendar's for dinner.  We got the Kahlua Cream Cheese pie... it is SO GOOD!  I recommend it to anyone who likes a chocolaty-coffee taste.  Well, nothing else to say for now.  Hope everyone has a good weekend... I'll post more next week (or earlier if something interesting happens).
