Its weird every time I sing, I think that she is there with the harmony (we sang together on worship team in high school) every time I play volleyball I know that she is there coaching me on the side.  Every time I say something silly she is there laughing with me or at me more likely.  And every time I am sad I know that she is there saying that everything will be ok.  Yes after 5 years things have gotten better, but after 5 years her memory is just as vivid now as it was when we finished high school.  I still wish I was able to talk to her before God took her home, but I will have to wait until my day comes to meet her in Heaven.  Until then only pictures and memories will have to keep her alive in this world.  She was an amazing girl, one I will always admire, and one I always was jealous of.  She seemed perfect, and everyone who met her loved her.  I know now, after 5 years, that the jealousy was foolish, but the admiration was sweet, and beautiful.  I only can pray that after this time Lora still looks down, smiles, laughs and cries when I want her here.  I pray that in these 5 years while we haven't forgotten her here she hasn't forgotten us there.  Lora Beth, you are a star!  And you have touched so much of the world....still your dream is being lived by all of us who knew you!  Lora made all of us want to be better people, and for that I am grateful!  This is a little tribute her mom has created in Columbus OH, its a huge billboard on the side of the highway.  For those of you not privvy...Lora was killed by a driver who fell asleep at the wheel, when driving from the movies with her friends.      urlLink
