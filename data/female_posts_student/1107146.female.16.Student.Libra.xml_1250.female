I don't know if there is a point to life, but it doesn't bother me: whether there is or not, the important thing is  to live  instead of being concerned with the question. Basically, that other post was a lot of shit to see if anyone was really getting to the same point as I made therein. There was a lot of anger; I guess I was just getting tired of the constant "kids fighting a grown up war", tip-toeing around the real issues but spilling blood over the little ones which they heedlessly chose to fight about.  I was really more angry about my cat though...thanks for your concern, Abby, I'm ok. I really love cats, enough that there  IS NO POINT  when one dies. Alright, not really, I just really love my kittens :) And I can't hear anything, hardly, my ears are still ringing, so, to all, don't be suprised to hear me going "WHAT?" about nine times to everything you say to me.   What a year it's been...come, summer, come.
