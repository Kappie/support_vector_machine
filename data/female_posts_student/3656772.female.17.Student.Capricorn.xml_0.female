Barbera (my bryce teacher) and I talked today about the E-Zine thing I'll be co-directing next year. (I'm excited :) ) He gave me a bunch of books on Flash...omg...they are huge...and long...and fantasticly kewl. *yay*   Oh, and lots of people are still complimenting me on my art in the art show!!! It's so great getting the positive feedback!!! Makes me feel all warm and cheesey inside ;).  I WANT TO GO ROLLERBLADING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My foot is mess...I think the blister is going to eat me alive...it looks kinda infected and crap....I need to get it to heal by Saturday...yeah good luck....I want to be able to dance  at prom!!! *rolls her eyes* That was the whole point of going... But anyways, I have had the urge to go rollerblading every day this week, and now I can't....bumms me out man....  I'm also working on Rachel's picture, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it...I kinda want it to be done, but it doesnt look done. *shrugs* Ah well.  Oh, and Chris and Anil and Sam and I went out to lunch at Mirsch Mirsala today, it was great, I love that place/food. YUMMMM. Cept my stomach was kinda hurting, so I hope I'm not getting what Smauss had ;) It would serve me right though. Chris still seems a little sore about my "breaking up" with him. We weren't technically going out so, it doesnt really count or anything...but...I don't know. I still feel like shit about it..and I think it's starting to come out in my giving him crap about stuff...I rag on him pretty hard, and I keep biting my tounge every time.....I'm going to get myself to knock it off if I have to swollow my tounge to do it! Chris kinda makes me feel unwanted in the group...but thats not unlike Colin, so I guess I'm sortof getting used to it...*winces* If it weren't for Sam, I don't think we would even be on speaking terms.  I also feel like painting...and drawing....or something....I just ...don't have anything to do.....sux moose man..;)
