I have neither the time nor the patience to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said "thank you" and went on your way!!  ... oops. Wrong speech.  p.s. doesn't the word  vindicated  sound like it should mean 'pissed off'?
