SHIT!  going to the tate or something tomorrow. with jonny. thengo to the jazz festival, once again. for the millionth time.  that bloody song, tremelo blues has been stuck in my head. and im so fucked off.  i went to ken high st this morning. in such a mood. i was huffing everywhere i went. looking tired and pissed off. then i saw miss skone-roberts!!!! i kinda froze and wobbled about on the spot, not knowing what to do.... but i just ended up walking straight ahead... good work kumiko!  xxk
