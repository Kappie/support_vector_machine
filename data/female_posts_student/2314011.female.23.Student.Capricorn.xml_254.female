Saw a couple of cute gals sitting out here when Mom and I drove by a bit ago on our way home from Buddies and (gasp!) they're still here!  The one just confirmed my suspicions by her phone conversation, detailing the latest dyke drama that ruined her girls night at Charleys.  For my part, I just finished reading the latest issue of  urlLink Diversity  (I worked there for one story, you know), so she knows the score.  She vaguely reminds me of the Voice of God.    My other agenda in coming down here is to tear away at the last 200 pages of Book 4 left.  I can't get enough.  Just finished the Second Task and it almost killed me.  This just in: she drives a Jetta.   Do you think the laptop makes me look hot?  Or is it the tight London shirt and new jeans I'm conveniently wearing.  Had the locks trimmed a bit yesterday...nothing major, just rearranged so they can grow out properly.  But definitely have the cute coffee-shop dyke thing going.    She's thinking of going to see SpiderMan tomorrow.   The thunder is starting again, so I should put this thing away and see about making eyes at the girl over the top of my book.
