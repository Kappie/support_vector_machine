However, you do tend to see the world in a  cynical and critical way .  While you are a realist, there is also  disappointment and disapproval , in your opinion,  of how the world is .  In this sense you are a idealist and have firm ideas of how things should be.   You can put people off with your tendencies to be too critical and knit-picking.  Yet you are even more  hyper critical of yourself   and a perfectionist.  You see your own faults clearly and punish yourself for your weaknesses.  As a friend and lover you are  extremely caring , going to great lengths to do nice things for others.  You tend to show people you care by doing concrete things, like cooking dinner, rather than using words. You have a reserved demeanor and will  withdraw into yourself in uncomfortable situations . It usually  takes a while for people to get to know you .  Quick minded, you make connections faster than others and your wit and play on words can be hilarious.  You are always  dependable  and your  sincerity  lends a certain charm and innocence to those that appreciate you.  Helping others makes you feel good and you are likely to seek your career in a some field of service.  Life is a serious matter to you and you are concerned with doing everything the right and proper way.  You cringe when you think you’ve made a fool of yourself- being held in high regard by others is important to you.  You can be scolding, prissy, fussy and  worry too much .   You want all aspects of your life to be in order and can become  pessimistic and a kill-joy when things don’t go the way you think it should .  You tend to be a hard worker and take pride in your attention to detail and responsibleness.  The lesson of a Virgo is to  learn tolerance , see the bigger picture, and to  distinguish between  the  important and unimportant  and stop stretching yourself so thin.  In learning a balanced sense of judgement and priorities you will better be able to relax and enjoy life as it is, not as it should be.   Aquarius  You are  independent, friendly and analytical .  Others can think you odd because you seem to  follow your own beat  and don’t give a care to conventions.  You probably get a kick out of this and take it as a badge of pride.  You like to be unusual, to try and see things differently from other people and to take the road less traveled.  Although you can be quite practical and efficient  you are at heart an idealist.  You have many broad and lofty ideas about life and  live by your own code .  It can enrage you when others expect you to conform.  You are not one for traditions because they bore you and besides  your pretty sure you know a better way .  The  only real authority you respect is your own .   Authority, following it and respecting it,  can be a problem  for you.  These attitudes can lead you to be arrogant,  unreasonable  and unpredictable as you can often change your mind.  This isn’t a wishy-washy quality though.  When you do have an opinion it tends to be very firm, yet you can be very  open minded  in recognizing new ideas and incorporating them into your way of thinking.  You value  freedom ; freedom to express yourself and  live life as you choose .   One of your goals in life is to try and sway people to see things your way.  You are also a very friendly person and would rarely be described as shy.  You can talk to just about anyone about anything.  Most the people you know are acquaintances as you rarely form deep and lasting friendships.  You are a humanitarian and tend to see everyone as equally valuable.  This is a great quality but it does tend to limit lasting personal relationships when your siblings or love interest is as important as someone you just met at the supermarket.   The lesson of an Aquarius is to  form close personal bonds .  You need to recognize that although everyone is equally special and has a great role to play in society and human evolution, people need to be appreciated as the individual they are and loved for it, not just as another fellow human being.  Your high idealism and dedication to the brotherhood of man is of great value but can be cold without any personal involvement.
