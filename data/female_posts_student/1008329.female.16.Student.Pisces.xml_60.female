I clicked on it and it brought me to this:   Subject: Re: abercrombie or american eagle Date: 12/23/2002 9:32 AM Pacific Standard Time From: Dannyboone11491 Message-id:     Hey i saw this little post thing that u've got going here and Abercrombie and AE are both kewl places however Im a very cheap person and the cheapest shirt i eva bought a AF was $20 and at AE $2.50 (thats right 2 dollars and 50 cents). Has ne 1 ever heard of a store called Aeropostale? It is a great store kinda like american eagle but the clothes dont look as worn out. They are like in the middle between AE  AF.  Oh by the way this goes to all the gothz/ skaters that think "preppy clothes r gay" all i have to say is if im driving in my car and i get pulled over i am less likley to get a ticket because i dont look like  friggin batman or somthing else weird. Personally i think all goths are jealous that they cant look half as good as preps do Dan    HAHA. BATMAN ROCKS!
