Now, I am journeying into a rocky road. Folks are different but somehow they've got flaws. Instead of making this journal quite sad maybe it's time to put a little candy. Oh well here it goes --> rue, martin were transfered into a different teacher during english 11 so i was always left. Anyway, james is there. I have many new classmates w/c are pretty weird. I dunno if I was put in a wrong section or are these folks really deserve to be in college. Yeah...yeah...this is some sort of criticism... I have this classmate who is very careless in spelling. Actually, he's not just careless. He really dunno.    Mispelled Words  Wrong-------------------->Right Spelling  roat--------------------->wrote dilicios----------------->delicious ivinted------------------>invented but---------------------->bought    These were only the few words I remembered...
