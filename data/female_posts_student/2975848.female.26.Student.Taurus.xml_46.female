Sailing in this immense ocean of sorrows, never seams to be an end Dying a bit more every minute it passes Why bother… if my best friend is Loneliness? They say: “Everyone has a purpose in life” I’m a forlorn soldier, in this battle called life Everyday there’s a new fight For me the biggest is to stay alive… My destiny I do not know But my end will be no different from all A lonely death… of an un-living life
