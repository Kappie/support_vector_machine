So far it looks like there are only 50 members or so, but I reconize several of them and many of us are club presidents. Most of the people on the board right now are really passionate about what they do or else a) they wouldn't have discovered the board and b) they would not be in team leadership positions.  Just because there are only 40-some members doesn't mean its not active... every time I go back there have been updates and new posts. It's really cool to be in touch with these people. In the past you go to competitions and you recognize the same people you compete against but you never really have an the time or the opprotunity to actually get to know them.  This one guy named Norm emailed me already. He seems like a really cool person that I'd like to get to know. He's read the Singh books that I recently finished, which means he has an honest interest in the same kinds of topics as me.  I'll probably email him later or maybe get on line, but right now I really have to get to work on my homefun (work).
