I realize he's a guy and thinks like one sadly. However I NEVER thought he'd consider acting on it, which makes me lose all respect for him and certain other person. At this point I'm so freakin' pissed off I'll tell them both what I think of them. I'd go into more details but I seriously doubt you wanna know.
