So I came home to get my hearing aids; you know incase my house gets blown away, atleast I was able to save those.    But on the way home I fell on a pile of freakin rocks and hurt myself pretty badly.  My knees are black  blued, my wrists hurt from where I landed on them, my voice is completely gone again from screaming when I fell, and the inside of my stomach feels like someone twisted and cut me inside - Not so fun, ya know?  I finally went back home around 2 am when it started raining.  Of course, my mom was worried that I may of busted my scar or something worse.  I mean I'm only 2 months out of surgery, the inside of me isn't quite healed completely.  And this is the part that freakin pisses me off more then falling on the damn rocks - Mom tells my dad what happened and instead of asking.... Oh are you okay? Oh is your stomach okay? Damn that Brian - This is 2 people that have fallen over this mess outside! Blah blah blah...  He says "You should of moved the damn rocks!" and then finishes watching the news.  Now I'm sorry but Brian started this whole rock mess about 4 months ago and last weekend he got FREE babysitting if he would work/finish the job.  Of course, he worked about 20 minutes and left a bigger mess then before and somehow its my fucking fault.  Gosh, Don't you feel the love in my family? Because I'm not!   ***Update: My dad picked up the rocks the next morning, so no one else would fall on them! :-) I feel the love NOW!
