I watched Gurmit Singh's Small Talk (about small little kids) and was fascinated by his quotes. Of course, majority of it I have used it before. Like ''Love makes the world go round'' and '' Love means never have to say you are sorry'', I have used them all. Now I took it from the show too, "There is no remedy for love, but to love more", ssssoooooo sweet... (^.^)
