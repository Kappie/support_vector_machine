I hope you don't mind my sharing this. I thought that since it's based on a true story, most of you would know about it and how it ends. Kind of like if I told you that they all died at the end of  The Perfect Storm , it wouldn't really be a  spoiler  because that's a given. I have not seen  Shine  (and I know I should; Brian has and says it's very good) so I cannot make a comparison. I guess the similarity to  Good Will Hunting  is that they are both math geniuses and the college campus setting.. But that's about all that they have in common. The story that ABM tells is way different. You'll have to see it. It's really good.    We went to see  Black Hawk Down  this afternoon. It's really good. I liked the movie.    By the way, Glee, next time you post something click on the " view web page " link on the left. You have your own special section on  urlLink our blog . Check it out!
