I got this stupid little job and I mow for like 15 bucks. Soe like my aunt and grandma felt sorry for my cousion soe they let him mow their yeard for 10 and 20 bucks. I was soe mad! I mean, it was my idea! Oh well  doun't care. I'm broke. I spent almost 40 bucks on a straightner, and Virginia is mad cause now I can't goe to the movies this week w/ her. Oh something that really bugs me, is when people put cApoTils in the mIDdle of their sentences. GOsh it drives me crazy!
