Well, now I have a reason to be bitchy at people on the bus. *YES!* And I need to call Brian or Cindy...my people...my other Highland people lol. along w/ their chilluns, my stoopud freshman n my mini me. Hopefully they can give me a ride on Wednesday. If my dad shows up to take me, I'm just not leavin the house I guess. I'm trying to find the good shit n life n it's hard. All I can remember is bad stuff. That's all I can recall clearest. I must seek guidance from Mitch my "shoulder" n the exceptional one cuz I miss that dude. I shouldn't have to give up on guys but I'm forced to. No flings for now. No using certain beings although since I'm extremely vulnerable it's possible. Who knows anymore. Can my life get any worse? Yes...it surprisingly can. It's really sad. I'm not even happy bout shoes or painting my nails man. I thought that maybe if I inhaled enough nail polish fumes, I would feel better, but then I was like dude, don't try to get high cuz that's lame. So I didn't but since I had to paint my nails, not much of a choice. *shrugs* I just wish this pain would go away. I wish I wasn't so bitter. I wish I cared about things I once cared for. But it's like...too late. I have no emotions...no true emotions. If I cry, it's for no reason or for the littlest thing. Nothing big anymore. I can be good at phoniness. I must get that from my dad. The only difference is that I'm better. Since I don't remember what else I was gonna bitch about due to the fact that it's 8:45 AM and I haven't had slept since noon yesterday because my loving padre came over, I'll be back later. But for now, I must eat...I'm thinkin cheeseburgers...n macncheese...HOTTNESS!
