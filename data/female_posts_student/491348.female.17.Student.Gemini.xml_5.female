It's not that I want to look fit, or that I care so much about looks.  I don't think there's anything to be proud about. Being good-looking, I mean. You're born with it. It's not like you have a choice, or that you can do anything about it. So I really don't understand girls who are so proud of themselves for being pretty. It's not like you even did anything for it. You were born that way. We don't choose to be ugly, do we?  But being thin and keeping fit is a whole different thing. It's something you can actually work for. It means something. To keep fit and be thin you need to control your diet, resist temptation on yummy sweets/fattening food; you need to exercise, not be lazy, etc. If you can't even control your weight, how can you control your own life?
