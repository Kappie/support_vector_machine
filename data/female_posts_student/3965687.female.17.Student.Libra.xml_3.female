A*'s problem seems to have been solved, the Cuddlesluts (that's our coffee-shop group) although we're one less in number are for the most part back in contact, financially everything seems to be on schedule for me....But today blew like no other. I was almost late to work because I'm lazy, and I made myself a peanut butter and honey sandwich; since I'm hypoglycemic, going anywhere without eating is a bad idea. So, sandwich, book, and hat in hand, I get in the car and prepare for my first ten hour workday. Unfortunately, I dribble a lot of honey on myself, and all over my hands. That was mildly frustrating. I just went into the back and scrubbed off my hands. The next four hours were uneventful....maybe even pleasant if one can say that about work. Then....oh, then....one of my friends at work, who goes by Potter, has been training me on register. The day before he had blown up at me for doing something incorrectly; it made me angry, but I accepted it because he was having a horrible day, and because he's simply a meticulous person. Telling him at thatpoint that, had he wantedme to do it acertain way, he should have trained me accordingly would have just been unfair and cruel.But today I was doing him a favor, did something else incorrectly because he was once again not doing his job, and he (again) got angry. For some reason this made me furious...I had to go outside to avoid completely losing my temper. I eventually got over it, as my discipline helps me to do, but for the rest of the day, little things irritated me. The light refracted off the tile floor and into my eyes; I've always been highly sensitive to light, I suppose because they're blue. A young woman had her perfume on very heavily; likewise, I'm sensitive to scent, so that as well bothered me. And above all, I hate whiney fuss pots, which today included myself.. so even I frustrated me. But ah...praise John, he let me come home early, and there is nothing in this world that a scalding shower cannot cure. And curse him, too, because I have to go and do the same thing tomorrow...Axyl
