I'm not the type of person that would usually get choked up, but some of the scenes are really heartfelt. Perry has that energy around him.  He's like a really great gay man who loves fashion and  will still fuck you.  I always fast-forward Casey Niccoli's scene where she shoots up with the  phone cord tied around her arm.  I have to say that she is fucking hot as well.  I love the Santerian wedding, the way Jane's "Classic Girl" kicks in, and P. Farrell HOT AS FUCK.
