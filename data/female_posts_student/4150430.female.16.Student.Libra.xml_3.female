I decided that after dealing with the daily issues of the foltz family, i needed a little break...but i didn't mean literally..         While trying to sit on the back deck to read my book, the dog decides he's pissed and wants to jump all over me and bite me. So in my best attempt to tie im up, i didnt realize that my brother left bricks on top of his doggy house....one fell hit my toe and i screamed bloody murder! I ran...well, hopped, to the house and looked at my toe...bleeding like crazy, swollen and oh so painful..   ...so my mommy (she's the best) wrapped it up and told me that i can sit on the couch all day and my brother has to wait on me hand and "foot". haha. Hopefully it'll heel in a few weeks.       This day didn't turn out as bad as i thought i would.      xo: amanda
