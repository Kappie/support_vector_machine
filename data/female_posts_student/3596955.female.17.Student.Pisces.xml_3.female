But when I try to 'emerge'  come out of my shell, step-up  make new friends, doesn't mean I am better than them nor have they ever been better than me. Doesn't mean I have less time for them, love them less nor give them less a less preferential status. Doesn't mean things have to change. Face it, things have -  In fact, it is because of them I am a stronger person. It is because of them I have been given the confidence to shine, share the gift of friendship - be happy  content. I love meeting people, trying to delve into discovering the 'christ'  charisma within them (even though it doesn't seem like it). Its true. I do. And oh have I been blessed my whole lifetime. This year I must say, have I been a witness to ever-changing friendships, new  old. Yet it sucks how I have the mentality that I may always have to endure my toes being treaded on, or giving way or letting them 'win' to avoid conflict. Or I have to restrain myself from saying or doing certain things - especially in the eyes of certain individuals. Im not being true to them, or to myself.        'You have equipped me well  blessed me with your gifts at the right moments in time  place. And for that I am utterly grateful. Help me understand why things have to change. It is for the better. I will be OK.'     -- feelin opps! -
