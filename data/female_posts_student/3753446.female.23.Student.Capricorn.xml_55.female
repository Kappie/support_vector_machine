As long as I remember I've been a huge Olympics fan for some reason, even though I'm not as into any other sport besides football. My favorite part of the games of course is the opening ceremony. I just LOVE seeing all the different countries and their native costumes and flags. Wow. I stand in awe of diversity, as always.
