Collins was my favorite again. it was the same cast from Gah Funk, except for Mimi and Joanne. I liked the other Joanne and Mimi more at Gah Funk. But it was overall very good and i could see better too. Instead of the shadow I saw the actual faces. yay! i was scared to see it with my aunt. she's pretty conservative, and halfway through the first act she figured out that Angel was a guy. *smacks forehead* i wasn't surprised, she's kind of slow with stuff like that, but i still love her. i also wasn't surprised with the amount of people who walked out during Collins and Angels duet. I felt bad. You could tell we were in Conservative Territory. But i'm proud to say that my relatives could take it and understood it by the end and they also thought it was awesome.  hmmm what else has happened lately. well i have never titrated a single thing right :P it's makes me feel bad. we've been doing this for a week and still my record is something like, 0-15. lovely! also, i babysat the penny wars today. i was shocked at how much people chipped in just to get an hour off of school. but that's awesome, it's for a good cause. 9th graders started their 4th mayo jar and our class got it's second. sadly, everyone else is one their first jar. oh well it's really fun to see everyone like the fundraiser. i'm glad it wasn't a bust like a lot of other fundraisers.   well i believe i'm done for now. have a wonderful weekend.
