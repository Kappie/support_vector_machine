Or rather, the beach most like what we grew accustomed to back home.  Today reinforced two conclusions I have come to:  1. We take beaches in Australia for granted in a way I never even knew about.  2. The first thing I'm doing when I get home is hitting Somerton Beach and I'm staying there everyday til I can't get no more!  Honestly, I can't remember the last time I swam at a beach back home. It was probably in Year 10? But after my experience here, I'll be going every weekend that I can! There's really no way you can fully understand the frustration of not being able to access a real beach when you most want it, but I'm going to draw you up a couple of lists to help:      Beaches in Australia    Beaches in Seattle (and probably the US bar California  Florida)        White sand   Clear water   Mostly seaweed-free   Can swim anywhere you like at 99% of beaches     Rocks/pebbles and grey sand (if lucky)   Green or dark blue water   Slimy seaweed   Can swim at 2% of beaches in blocked off, designated areas      In spite of the obvious drawbacks, we had a great day.. we hit the  urlLink Juanita Sunday Market  beforehand and bought some fresh, organic apricots, peacharines (they call them nectarines here), carrots  beans; yummmm.  There was a playground at the park for India and unlike  urlLink Alki Beach  in West Seattle, the water was warm enough for us to swim in comfortably! Whee. If it weren't for the choppy waves, water murkiness and stringy seaweed, it would have been a perfect 10! ;)  Photos over  urlLink here .  xo
