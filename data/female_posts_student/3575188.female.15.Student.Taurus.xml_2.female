But anyway back to what I was writng about. I haven't really gotten to any interesting and scary parts yet. A father only just broke his son's arm. That is about it. This book is supposed to be a scary story. But sofar nothing. I guess it is just because I haven't really gotten into the book yet. I'm sure it will become a lot more intersting. Don't you? Stephen King is a pretty good author. If he wrote the Green Mile he must be because that was a pretty good movie. I know there are many parts to that series. How did they fit like 15 books into one movie. I's amazing. Anyway. I hope that this book gets a lot more interesting. My father told me that the movie was really good so maybe it will come around.
