His brother Mike owned all this DJ equipment, and since Hubby loves being the center of attention (he's so cute. Awwwww.) and I was a DJ myself for like 3 years, we decided to buy Mike's equipment and go into business for ourselves.  Mike has... well I should say "we have" since it's ours now... some really nice equipment, albeit a little old, and we got it for a steal. I'm talking a Peavey amp, two CD players (one plays Karaoke CD+Gs), one minidisc player, a nice Mackie 1202 dash something (I forget the model number but I was drooling over it.) mixer, JBL speakers, a disco ball, a million CDs... the  works .  So Mike had all these contacts around Sacramento for people looking to unload some gigs, so this guy named Dennis called Brian up and gave him three shows. One tonight, one for a few months from now (which he probably won't take because of the new baby), and a New Years gig.  The show tonight, Dennis said, was for a group of people who get together every year for a social dinner / dance type thing for their "club".  "Club?" Brian said, interested.  "Yeah," Dennis said, "They're swingers."   ....!!!!!  So anyway apparently these swingers actually have a   club   with meetings and dues and membership cards and everything. They get together once a year at the Best Western (oh, what luxury!) and rent out a conference room and then like 50 or so hotel rooms for their.. uh... swinging. They get together once a month or so to discuss swinger things I guess, and then swap wives. I've never heard of swingers actually having their own freaking  club , so that's pretty funny.  Well, the best part is, they can't "swing" with people outside the club. Couple A, for instance, can't officially "swing" with Couple B unless Couple B is a member if Swingers International, or whatever the fuck this club is called. I guess because, like the porn industry, they don't use condoms and want to make sure everyone is "clean" before swapping wives. Which is actually pretty responsible because all the "swingers" I've ever known are just men with wives that fuck everything and the men just call themselves "swingers" because they're pathetic and defeated and won't get a divorce because nobody else would touch their ugly ass. (It's a bar called the Hideaway, folks, the crappiest dive bar in America! lol)  So anyway, Hubby told me all this because when he first mentioned that it was a swinger party I raised my eyebrow as if to say, "The fuck? A what party? Explain."  I have nothing to worry about, even if they didn't have all these rules and guidelines, because Hubby and I are madly in love and I know that he would never touch another woman, as I would never touch another man.  He still has issues when people flirt with me when we're out (Who flirts with a 35 week pregnant woman, by the way! How pathetic for the dude that flirts with one! lol) but he knows that I'd never leave him. I love him so much and try to tell him and show him every day.  He actually didn't want to do this gig because apparently his ex wife Terri the whore always freaked out about Brian cheating on her.   She's such a pathetic woman, this Terri. There's this legal issue between them involving a vehicle that Terri took when she left him and subsequently got reposessed or something, and now they're coming after Brian because his name was never taken off the title and it wasn't addressed in the divorce for some reason, apparently because the bitch lied to him and told him it was taken care of... I don't really know what the fuck is going on, because I really try to stay as far out of it as I possibly can because it's not really my business. But anyway, he served her with some papers recently and now she's got their son (her son, actually, Brian adopted him when he was 6) turned against him, probably telling him that his dad is an asshole and he doesn't love him and doesn't want to have anything to do with him... you know, the usual 'parent-against-parent-using-the-kid-as-a-pawn-typical-jaded-bitch-bullshit' women like her are famous for. My dad did it too, talking the "Your mother is a bad woman and she did this and this and this and she doesn't love you that's why she didn't fight for custody of you, blah blah blah" game to poison my mind against her to get back at her for leaving him. Anyway, you get what I'm saying.   So this happened a few days before Father's Day, and all of a sudden on Father's Day, Hubby gets this text message from his son's phone saying "I hate you I never want to see you again", or something to that effect. So we knew that she got the papers, at least. We don't know if it was Terri the Bitch using her kid's phone or if it was his son, but it hurt Brain pretty bad. On FATHER'S DAY, of all days.  I know that this baby is not a replacement for his son, because he loves P. as if he was his biological father. He raised this boy and poured his heart and soul into him and just  loved  being a father. A daddy, really, because any asshole can be a father. It takes a special man to be a "daddy". So now, Brian's getting his heart trampled on by these two and it's killing him.  So here I am pregnant with this "new baby" and selfish me, all I can think about is "Has this cunt ruined his heart and burned him so bad he won't be able to love his son because of how she turned P. against him?" And that's just a silly thing to think because I have seen this man's capacity for love and he has one of the biggest hearts in the world, but is it a legitimate fear that he's going to be wary of his new son doing the same thing P. did? I only say this because he was cautious in the beginning of our relationship and didn't want to get into anything serious because Terri the Whore burned him so bad. He needed affirmation almost daily that I loved him and you know, I didn't mind. I tell him I love him a hundred times a day, I show him I love him with my every action and every moment of every day I have him on my mind. The outpouring of love I have for this man cannot be described in words for fear of making it less than it is by not having words strong enough or beautiful enough in the in any language in all the world. Can I get any sappier?   Anyway, so is it going to happen the same way with the baby? Or will it be different because the baby will not only be his biological son, they'll be able to bond with each other from birth and Brian will be able to watch his son grow up in total adoration of his daddy, as most boys do? I know Brian is going to live this baby, no question. What an irrational fear to have, right? But that's how I feel sometimes and it's scary.    This makes me so angry, that this horrible bitch is so vindictive she'll go to no lengths to make Brian's life miserable. I watch him call his son day after day after day and get no answer, and Brian never cries, but I see those tears well up in his eyes and I want to go over to her house and maim that fucking bitch.  Is it wrong of me to hate her so much for something she didn't even do to me? This woman and I have never said three words to each other (mostly because my mother taught me if you have nothing nice to say, better to keep your mouth shut.) and yet I have this deep resounding hatred for her because of what she's doing to my husband.   I know, I know. I need to stay out of it. I don't talk about this to Hubby.. I think that's tacky. If he brings it up and confides in me, I never offer my opinion, even if he asks. I only tell him that I'm there for him when he needs me and that everything will work itself out. He really doesn't need to hear me go off on a rant (and people that know me know that when I go off on someone it's  bad  news) about his lousy emotionally retarded ex-whore. Er, wife.  I just need to vent, because if I don't get it out I'm not sure I can keep myself from either calling P. and asking him just what the fuck his mother has been telling him, or calling her and giving her a fairly large piece of my mind. (and of course offering her an even larger piece of my fist.) I HATE HATE HATE her.  And impotent hatred is not healthy. Nor is it productive.   So God, if you're up there, please let this all work out okay, and if it's your will let Brain and P. get their relationship back, and let this evil bitch Terri burn in the fieriest pits of hell.  Thanks, God. I owe you one.   So anyway, time to go take a bath because my feet are swollen today and try to pass the time until the love of my life comes home from his Swinger party.  With his membership card. Haha.   -Me
