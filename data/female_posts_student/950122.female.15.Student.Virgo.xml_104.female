I've been filled with thoughts that run thru my mind at blinding speed. It's crazy. I think I'm going crazy.  I saw a woman this afternoon. She was walking down the street naked. As the car sped by, my heart. It twisted. It moaned and creaked. I didn't dare to look back. Someone please just stab me repeatedly! Stab me in the back and leave me to die.  I hate how so many things can make me feel bad about myself.  So many things make me feel so frustrated. Sometimes up to the point where I can't stand it at all! My mind goes into ultra frustrated mode, and I go crazy! I just have to get away, just get away, but I end up in my room where I push the frustration down, and I go back. I never ever get rid of it, I just stuff it under my bed. I can never get rid of it. It's always there.
