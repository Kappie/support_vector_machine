Yesterday was my Babe's birthday..(much as I hate to be that cliched, its the most natural thing that comes to me while addressing him..). The night before, I baked him a cake. A chocolate cake with chocolate icing, albeit out of a box and a tin but hey, it was still a cake. And it turned out good. But the same day, I got news that my car in India was sold. That car meant a lot to me. My dad's first car, it's has been there, my whole life in India at least. And now its gone to someone else.      Then yesterday, K's B'day. It was a big deal. I mean its not everyday a person turns 25. But again I felt depressed about the car and just before going out, we have a fight about my clothes. We finally do go out and what happens? The restaurant closes early that day! We have to eat and run.      Then I drink a little more than I expect and it goes to my head. On top of which I take medication for allergies which means, I fall into deep sleep.   What do you do when u cant get up in the morning? What I do is just go back to sleep. Until the phone begins to ring that is. Then u drag yourself out of bed and try to face that aforementioned new day. And what happens? Just another round of disasters.    You find, that the kitchen is overrun with cockroaches, big and small. You manage to gather the enthusiasm to try something new for dinner, which blows up in your face and stink up your kitchen till you feel sick to your stomach. And you realise you might have done something to your boyfriend's computer. All in all, a new day isn't always the best thing to happen to you... Lets see how this one ends anyway...
