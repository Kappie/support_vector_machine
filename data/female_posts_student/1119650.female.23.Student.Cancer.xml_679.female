So good, that I don't think that there is, in fact, a word to describe his ass kicking-ness (See, he's so good I have to make up words like asskickingness!)  This can only mean one thing:  my snowboard deck is completed and is so rocking that it rocked my face right off.  You should see it, I look pretty silly with out a face!  I will have pics up tonight of it (the snowboard, not my faceless head) and you can all be jealous because no one on the PLANET now has the same deck as me and the only thing that could possibly be hotter than the design he did for me is the design he's gonna do for himself when he gets his own snowboard.    Thank you, Andrew, you're the best (c:
