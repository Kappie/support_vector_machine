Bill Guerin scored the overtime AGAIN for the millionth time in a row.  It was tight! My Niko played a good game and so did Mike Modano.  Then me and Brittany started talking about groins and calling the teams other flower names besides pansies....because we wanted to, thats why.    Coppell kicked Flower Mound's butt 8-0 because we rock like that.  FM was playing alright at the start, but then they gave up and let us score 8 goals.  Way to suck FM!!!!  And you know what the best part about this whole thing is that we play them in the first game of the playoffs!?!?!  Like they have a chance!!!   Haha, this'll be great.  And we'll either play Jesuit or Marcus in the next game.  Then we'll go on to be state champions.....i hope we don't win metroplex though, because then thats a bad omen as to how we'll win state.  EX: Southlake Carroll.    School was boring, AGAIN.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
