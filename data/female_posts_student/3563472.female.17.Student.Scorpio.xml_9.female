So before the ACT's I had 2 cans of pop and a Sugar Daddy Latte. By testing time, my hands were shaking from the caffine!   Anyways, the first 2 tests (english, math) were extremely easy. I finished them really early and had time enough to go back and check every single answer. This was helpful because I had a few many on the math that were dumb errors and I corrected them.  I don't know what it was, but after the break, I couldn't do anything. The reading test was really strenuous for some reason. It was like I could see the words, but they had no meaning because I didn't give a shit about it. I got through it all right. And then they gave me science .. which is basically reading charts. So, I did that for awhile. It sucked, but i'll live  After ACT's I went to PRIDE FEST!! I actually had a blast despite the fucking heat (which makes me really sick because i have an unusually low body temp). i saw a lot of ppl i met at the Matthew Shepard counterprotest I went to a while back. YAY. And I Saw JUEVOS (aka. BOBBY) and it was rather swell. YAY FOR BOBBY!!.. anyways.. I'm going to go to relay now.. stay up all night... and then work tomorrow at 9
