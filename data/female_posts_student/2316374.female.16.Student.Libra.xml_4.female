BA-bam!  here i am.  and it took me far too long to get to this blog thing.  my computer is far too slow.  not to worry.  cause i'm in no hurry.  i am determined for my first post to be the longest one this blog has ever seen. so i'm gonna keep a'typin' til i feel that i have out-typed the other posts.  can't wait to hear something about AZ from cantora...so far, all i know is that is was, "awesome, very moving experience".."we helped soo many ppl"..."wow, i'm sorry, i didn't get enought sleep last night. ::nervous laugh::  like, anyways, i was, well, like...i didn't get enough sleep last night.  anyways...".  and that constitutes my entire knowledge of the goings on in AZ.  did you say some thing about the "anasazi" indians?  my crew will be visiting some anasazi cliff dwellings and whatnot...i was just wondering.  ok.  i win.  and its time for breakfast.  so ya'll just chill, y'hear?
