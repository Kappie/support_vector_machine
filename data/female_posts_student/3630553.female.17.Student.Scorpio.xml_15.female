As I moved a muscle, my mind kept juggling between two options: Shall I go back, avoiding the risky steps and dwelling once more to places where my past relives? Or shall I proceed to the other end, where another world awaits, totally unheard of, and take the all the risks of whatever comes my way? ... I was having a dilemma. I needed to decide fast. The bridge was creaking as seconds of time progress and was getting tougher towards the other end.  If I turn around and return to where Iâ€™ve started, I'm sure to be safe because I know very well what was in there. If I make my way towards the unknown world, I might fall from the bridge.  Clueless of what lies ahead, I was starting to feel terrified of all the unknowns that possiblyawait me.
