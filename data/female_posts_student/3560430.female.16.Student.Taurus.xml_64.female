I think I'll probably get quite a few pages done to. Or not depending an what my parents plan on doing today. I really love my private writing time it's nice and, well lovely. Lovely is the only way of putting it. If I don't write I find that the ideas start clogging my mind and then I can't think as well as I would like to and well... For all of those who read Harry potter, think of it as a pensive, it's like the silver stream of my thoughts flow out through my fingers and onto the screen, it's really a phenomenal occurrence. It's hard to describe to those who don't write though, very hard indeed. I think it'll be nice to settle and write, but first I'm going to have to continue cleaning my room.   Today is Canada day (there I go with my lack of transissions again). Unfortunatley there will be no fireworks. I love canada day with fire works, it's beautiful! But becasue of forest fires we can't have any. I would still rather have forests then fire works though, becasue I even though I love both one of them only really occures once a year, and the other takes a couple of hundred years to grow. I wish others would realise that too, 1 out of 3 forest fires are started by people. How very irresponsible.   Well if I'm to write today I'd best go and clean my room now.
