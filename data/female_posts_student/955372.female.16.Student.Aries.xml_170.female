It was just gonna be my dad, but he wanted me to come so I could meet his side of the family. I know like everyone on my mom's side but i only know like immediate family on my dad's side. So i met all these really bizarre people. Jesus the stories in this family. It's funny everytime my mom-mom sees my aunt peg she says "put that man in a home" and by "that man" she means her husband. Hillarious really. But seriously that family is like a frigging soap opera. I don't have enough room/time to say all the stuff i heard today/knew already about his family. But just extremely screwed up. Yeah but I found out today that my old landlord from when we lived in Philly was in the Mafia and he was in jail for most of the time we lived in that house. And our neighbor's dad was a numbers man for the mafia. And we lived a block away from the projects (that right there tell ya what a great neighborhood that was, lol) So it's like wow, learn something new everyday. Yeah so then i came home and now i'm burning a copy of my dad's cd, Sticky Fingers- Rolling Stones. Good Cd.OMG my dad bought The Donnas cd. and i'm like "WHAT THE HELL!!!" and he goes "some girl at work recommended it" and we listened to it on the car ride to the funeral home, and i'm like wow this sucks and he's like yeah it does and i'm like yeah so worth the money, and he's like shut up. Yeah i wish he had told me he was gonna by that cd, i would have talked him out of it. hmm anyway i think thats it. adios
