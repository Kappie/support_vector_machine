(this all had a nice ring to it before *demiseful looks*) i'll explain-  yesterday i was informed that the dance company will have a uniform look for competition. this includes same makeup, hair, rhinestone placement, and shoe type. so for the rhinestone codes we will have three rhine stones in our part on the left side of our head over the arch of our left eyebrow which is two inches long. (did you get all that?) also we will have rhinstones on the end of our eyes, and we will be buying  rhinestone earings  *dun dun duuun*   well this came as a shock to miss mariam that i didn't have my ears pierced. i explained that, since i am in so many sports i never had enough time to get my ears pierced so they wouldn't close. well she blatantly asked me to get my ears pierced. of all the nerve...  well today that's  just what i did. i intended on getting my hair trimmed today and i just added the ear piercing to it. so while i was getting my hair done my hair stylist finds a gray hair * mid-twenties crisis * along with the aging i jump back to pre-teen essence and get my ears pierced. haha *"brad will love me now!" giddy happiness*   so now that the step into adult hood had been fulfilled i decided that the proper thing to do would be to have a "Disney Movie Night." This symbolizes the circle of life in all it's glory!  Well, there goes Bill. -Poor Bill- -Betso
