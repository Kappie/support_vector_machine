And to worsen the unfortunate realization, it was my younger sister who actually lost it. I didn't! I just somehow feel responsible because I handed it to her. We were browsing at the mall when we stopped at this "Cardams" botique to try on some footwear. Since I wasn't carrying a bag, I asked her to put my phone in hers. I didn't have any pocket, either so it was uncomfortable for me to try on some sandals with my other hand holding my phone.  Then, that was it! That was the last time I saw my phone. An hour ago, I asked her to hand it to me. I thought I was probably having some messages by then. When she dug for my phone in her bag, it wasn't there! It was neither on her pocket nor on my cousin’s.  I was calm for less than a minute then I almost went hysterical. She even assured me that she tucked it inside her bag. But the thing is, it was under her premises and it was no longer inside her bag! A theft couldn’t have possibly snatched her bag. It was zipped very tightly. Besides, had a theft stole it from her, he or she would have stolen her wallet and other valuables as well.  Anyways, there was nothing we can do about it. Even if I scold my sister, who was obviously in denial for misplacing my phone, it would not bring my phone back. And in such a crowded mall, it was impossible to revive it. Good citizens, especially here in the metropolis, are as rare as diamonds.  Now, I’m back to zero. I’m gonna have to do the arduous task of searching for contacts. Thank God my mom lend me her phone for a while. I really need it.
