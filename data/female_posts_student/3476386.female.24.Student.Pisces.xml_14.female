Gary Condit was even starting to become a prime suspect in the case of her disappearance. On that note I must say, Gary Condit is the luckiest fuck alive. Ok, I take that back, O.J. Simpson is the luckiest fuck alive. But lets pretend he's not for a minute.    Timing is everything. For Gary Condit, the 9/11 tragedy COULD NOT have come at a better time. Upuntil that fateful day in New York, news coverage was beginning to focus heavily on the disappearance of Shaundra Levy. Condit had a nice steady flame right under his ass at that time.  I  even felt the heat. Then, bada-bing bada-boom, a couple airliners go slamming into the twin towers and everyone goes apeshit. I suppose that's a pretty good reason to forget thatGARY CONDIT IS A PHILANDERING MURDERER! Does one tragedy cancel out another?I didn't think so, butit seemed to happen anyway .        We haveshort attentionspans don't we?Analogy-wise, ifour attention spans were comparable to dick size, we'dall be hung like a light switch. Shaundra Levy'smissing...oh shnap!The twin towers were attacked.GetOsama Bin Laden. Ok forget him then, get Saddam Hussein instead. We got Saddam Hussein?! Yipee. Ok now what? Lets take him to court. Yeah.      Out with the old, in with the new. We just want to be entertained. We want to sound informed. Give me scandal, give me a juicy story, give me, give me. Stimulate my peanut sized brain.        How come we aren't really talking about Osama Bin Ladenin connection to 9/11as wewere before? Has the search for Bin Laden subsided?Has the focus shifted to hunting down Saddam because curious George W. had beef withhim since he tried to whack off his pop? That sounds like a personal problem. No need to drag the rest of thecountry down with you on this one.     I digress...    So Gary Condit one lucky fuck. He's stoked. Terrorism came in real clutch and saved his ass from further scandal and possible prison time. Everyone just plum forgot about that measly disappearance. I haven't forgotten, Gary Condit. I know what you did last summer. Intern killer.    Speaking of disappearances, whatever happened to the sporty and scary Spice Girls,Al Gore, Ralph Machio (Karate Kid) andthose kids from DawsonsCreek? Or all those canceled WB showsfor that matter.
