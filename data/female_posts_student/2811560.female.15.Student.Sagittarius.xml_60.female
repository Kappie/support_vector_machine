It didn't help that I stayed up late last night talking to Paul. It was worth it though. I wasn't supposed to be on, and my Mom sorta found out. Uh oh. Didn't seem like she really cared though, so whatever. Yeah so, the only reason I'm really updating now is because I have to babysit after school and I won't have any time after school. Grr, weight training tomorrow. And chorus concert tonight! Not fun at all. Wish me luck in surviving the next few days...oh yeah, Paul is giving me a picture today...interesting....
