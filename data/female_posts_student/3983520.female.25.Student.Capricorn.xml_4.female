Luckily this is only a temporary position otherwise I would go insane. I do not know how the man that I am filling in for stretched this out to a full 40 hours but I can do his job in a mere two hours. Once I am done with my two hours of work I end up just surfing the internet for the rest of the day. Some of you guys may find that this would be the perfect job for you but believe me you would not like to be in a cubical for eight hours bored out of your mind.   Luckily I start a brand new job next week that requires a lot more work, I think and it even pays more. So I will see how this goes. Hopefully I will like it because it is suppose to last for four months. The position I am in now luckily only lasted for two, I could not have done this any longer. My new job will be in San Francisco so I wiill have to commute further but I will be able to carpool and just park my car. Therefore saving money on gas and toll.    I guess I am just rambling now. So I better find something to do.
