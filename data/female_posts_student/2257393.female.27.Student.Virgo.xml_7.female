"waves" by gustave courbet, 1869.  i will freely admit that i don't understand visual composition or the balance of color or chiaroscuro or pointillism et cetera, but this painting filled me with a sadness that was so familiar to the sadness i was already feeling.  the image is simple--giant waves crashing on a sandy beach, empty except for a small deserted boat.  you can see other boats way off in the distance.  but what got me was the sky--it was blue at the top of the canvas, but as it fell to meet the sea, the clouds congested and darkened, making this mess of sea and weather and blue and grey right in the middle of the image that made me want to dive right into it.    it was like the beginning of _the voyage of the dawn treader_, the painting in lucy's room.  it struck me and i must have stood in front of it for 15 minutes.  it was so beautiful and i felt so small and so... ...afraid.    i walked around a bit more in the exhibition, but i kept coming back to the courbet.  so many thoughts were in my head and i realized that things are going to happen to me in this whole brain tumor process, i'm going to feel things and see things and do things, and it's probably a good idea to start writing those things down.  i said in an e-mail to valerie sayers last night that i want this experience to change my life.  i don't really know how one goes about changing one's life, but i would think it is something that happens one step at a time, and probably pretty undramatically for the most part.    so that's that.  emily's brilliant how-i-survived-brain-cancer weblog, inspired by a silly painting.  though, it seems that it's always the small things that move the most mountains.  we'll see how this goes.
