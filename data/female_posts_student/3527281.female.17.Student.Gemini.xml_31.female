As I was driving home tonight from Wal-Mart, driving around 45 mph, I was stunned to see a creature running across the road right in front of my car. I tried to slow down, but it was inevitable. Ricky was killed. Even though he tried to run with just three of his paws, his front paw held up in front of him like Igor, he was still unable to make it safely to the other side.  So tonight, my friend and I had a ceremony via MSN Messenger in honor of Ricky Racoon, and I have decided to post that ceremony here as a tribute to Ricky Racoon and all he has done for racoons everywhere.   Ricky Racoon XIII   Birth:  Unknown  Death:  July 1, 2004 Beloved Husband and Father  Yes, Ricky was a good racoon. He always loved going through people's garbage to get that one chicken bone at the very bottom of the can. And there was the little twinkle in his eye I when he reached for that chicken bone. *sigh* Yes, and what a lovely twinkle it was. And then one night he was running home to take that special chicken bone to his babies and his wife but he did not stop, look, and listen before crossing that trecherous road. Instead of running towards the light at the end of the tunnle the light came to him and Jacqui said (I mean) Jesus said, "Yes Ricky, It is time." At that exact moment he knew that he was leaving his family forever..and the trash cans with chicken bones, but he was not afraid, for he knew he was going on to a better place. And that was when his skull was crushed. The poor soul.  May he rest in peace.  Amen.
