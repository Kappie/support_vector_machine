He swung a watch slowly in front of the lectern, and at the end of the sermon he said, "Give!" and the collection plate was full of twenty-dollar bills.  It worked for weeks.  The congregation sat mesmerized during the sermon, staring at the watch swinging, and when he said "Give!" they gave everything they had.  Then one Sunday at the end of the sermon the watch chain broke, and the preacher said, "Crap!"
