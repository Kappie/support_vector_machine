Bill left around 7:30 after hanging out all day with my sister. Cierra is coming over tomorrow night and I'm really excited. I hope she doesnt cancel anytime tomorrow. hehehe:) anyway..Ashley, if you read this at all i REALLY REALLY miss you. I loved my hug today, thankyou...Everytime that I think about it I smile. You're sooo beautiful. hehe...anyway..I guess that I'm going to go now. Bye bye
