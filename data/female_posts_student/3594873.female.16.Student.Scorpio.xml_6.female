After all, you’re not always going to have answers just fall into your lap.    You know it’s impossible to see beyond what you see. Cuz if you see something and look beyond it, well then you see what is beyond it…so you’re still looking, if you know what I mean?  Which remind me: you know what I mean? What a stupid expression. How do I know if you know what I mean? You could very well say, you know, I know what you mean. And it would just go on…that expression is just because people are too lazy to continue on with their explanations and stuff. So to just end it, like their conclusion sentence, they just stick that in.   That also reminds me…seems I’m like a grandmother; so many memories. Anyways, when I was a kid, we had to write vocabulary paragraphs and other delightfully fun, not, paragraphs. Well, I enjoyed writing so I’d start writing. Everything would be so detailed…I’d have written so much but still be at the beginning. Nowhere near where I wanted to end, so I’d just add this, “Well, I got to go now. My hand hurts”. Can you believe it? How stupid? How shameful? I could go on and on, but the truth is I’m kinda tired of typing all this time… so gotta go. oOops, looks like I still have that habit.  Some habits just don’t die, now do they? Well, maybe because they’re called habits…duh! If it’s a habit, then it’s something you’ve been doing for a long time, and if you’ve been doing it for a long time, then you’re used to it. And if you’re used to it, then its part of your nature. And if it’s part of your nature, then it’s hard to stop it. So you just keep on doing it, and that’s why it doesn’t die.  But you know habits also change. When I was a kid, I didn’t mind staring into mirrors. Now I do. In fact, I don’t just mind. I hate it! I loathe it! I abhor it! Just trying to sketch you a picture (instead of paint you a picture). You know why I hate it? Cuz I just see my  reflection. If you’re a smart aleck, then you’re saying right now “Really, what did you expect to see? The zoo?!” No I did not expect to see the zoo. I expected to see my soul. Yes, that means I’m pretty happy with who I am. In fact, if you were to look at it, it means I think that I am a beautiful person inside and am quite surprised that it doesn’t show on the outside. Now, over here…I’m being arrogant yet modest, aren’t I? Arrogant since I’m calling my soul beautiful, but modest since I’m saying I’m ugly. But you have no way of knowing if this is true…so it doesn’t matter to you. It matters to me though…mirrors and pictures can only capture your outwardly appearance. They’re so shallow. And that is why they can not picture who you are.   You know it’s funny how people seem to think because they know celebrities, then the celebrities must know them. We memorize their birthdays, their favorite expressions… everything about them. The whole time, though, these celebrities have no idea that we exist. That we actually walk the same earth that they do. We’re just not there, to them. Who can blame them? It’s not like our birthdays or anything about us, is published or taped so that they could be aware of our existence. It’s not like our own best friends remember our birthday anyway. When we see them, or get them to sign our autographs…when we wave at them, we feel like we’re with a friend, whereas all they see is some people obsessed with them. Yup, fans!   Fans: its such a weird word. It can mean an appliance that helps keep you cool or some admirer. I see no connection what’s so ever. English really is strange.  You know, I used to get so angry whenever I heard some British word, like mum. Until, this year when I realized that it was Americans who copied the British, took their language…and then changed it. (or else they just didn’t copy it right)   But the word loo still annoys me. Just say it; loo. Hey, people who are called Leau or have that as a name are really unlucky.    Silent, like a ghost it creeps. With the stealth of a thief, and the confidence of a natural predator it sneaks behind the unsuspecting bird. Its eyes focus on its victim: the bull eye. For a second, just a second, the bird smells something. Something dangerous in the air; something ugly. It looks with its beady eyes all around, but it can’t spot anything. But the feeling of something wrong, still lingers.  It finds itself in a dilemma. Does it leave its breakfast or stay? This bird has not eaten for a long time and…it didn’t find anything risky. Maybe though, that’s why there were no other birds there. Maybe, it wasn’t lucky and that’s why it found food, but because it was unlucky. Go or stay? Stay or go? It can not choose. But the choice is made for it. And a single white feather falls to the ground.
