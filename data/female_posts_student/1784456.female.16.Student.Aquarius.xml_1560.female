Science is tooooo confusing sometimes. Eek Halloween aye, sad to say I'm not doing anything! But my brothers going to a party dressed in a business suit, that's enough to scare me for today. No one's really making a fuss over Halloween anyway, so it's alright. *sob sob* (And I could have worn my usual clothes!) :P
