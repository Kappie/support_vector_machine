I don't understand how people can vote for complete strangers to take care of the tax money, say where it goes and where it doesn't go. When I turn 18 I am choosing not to vote because I don't know how you can believe all the promises that these "political icons" make people. How do we know they are going to put more money into our education, or into health care. Since when does EVERYONE all of a sudden care about the education system, us teeagers go to school don't we? Well most of the time we go, but shouldn't kids be able to say whether or not we want more money towards our school system! I don't really give a shit, because when i'm in class I don't pay attention anyway so why am I forced to! Thank god you aren't forced to vote cuz I would prolly just close my eyes and just check one of the damn boxes, the government is still gonna take taxes off of our paychecks so what the fuck is the difference? Either Steve-whatever-his-name-is and Paul-whatcha-ma-call-him? Whoever the hell people chose, they should know....one is them is going to take your money and buy a condo in hawaii whether you like it or not. So you might as well just go ahead and guess who you want to "represent" you. I guess for this one I will keep it short and sweet, this is my first post so lemme know what you think and i will try and keep posting....by the way thanks to tyler for tellin me about this site. Im out....
