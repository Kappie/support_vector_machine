The wedding itself--before a judge--was not interrupted.  But, the picture session following the wedding was.  Some might say I should have expected it, since she is 14 years old, and larger dogs have shorter lifespans.  On the other hand, she never acted "old" until this past year.  She's taking medications, and she seems better; in fact, while at the vet's, she demonstrated her talents as an escape artist.  When we picked her up the next morning, the vet said that she learned how to open the doors, and spent the morning wandering through the rooms in the back.  Tinee's always been a very smart dog.    I had to leave the next morning, and come back to school.  I live on campus, because I have no vehicle.  Also because there is less distraction and annoyance; it's easier to concentrate on my studies.  I'm actually finished with my summer course; it was an online course--Profiling.  No lecture, no class discussion.  Read each chapter and take a test.  There were also some links to articles that further explored the subject matter for each chapter.    Though I am done with my summer course, I still have work to do this summer.  I am conducting an experiment/research project which deals with eyewitness testimony and how postevent suggestions effect witness memory.  I couldn't find a movie that seemed to suit my purposes, so I made my own.  Unfortunately, there were some problems lining up the "cast," which turned out to be very small; 3 persons, 3 dogs, and a couple of cats.  I still haven't got the test questions and photos set up yet.  I thought I had enough photos on my computer, but it turns out I don't.  That is, either I don't have the picture I want--for instance, a "look-alike" dog--or the picture I want to use is out of focus.  So, it looks like I will need to go home for a picture day.    So, to sum all this up, I have a lot to do.  And I feel guilty for not being able to spend more time with my baby--Tinee--when we might not have much time left.
