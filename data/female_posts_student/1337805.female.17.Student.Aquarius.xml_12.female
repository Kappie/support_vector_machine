So she wants to be with someone who does. I personally think she's whacked up. Her boyfriend, my best friend, shows everything. I can tell when he's mad, sad, happy, moody, glum, everything. She just hasn't gotten to know him better yet. It makes me so mad to think that he's been with all these girls that do it all the same to him. He deserves someone who wont hurt him, soemone who knows him like me. Same goes for me too, in fact....  I HATE TV NETWORKS AND KAZAA!!! I really want to watch some Family Matters and Full House, but guess what?! They aren't on the TV! And KaZaA doesn't have them ready for you to download either! :( It's so agrevatinggg!!!
