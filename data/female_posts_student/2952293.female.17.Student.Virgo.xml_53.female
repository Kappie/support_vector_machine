We see someone pulling out, but all of a sudden they hit this cart from out of nowhere! They get around it, but the cart starts coming close to us. But it was in a straight line, I thought it was fine. All of a sudden it sees us and starts heading straight for the car! There was no time to pull in front of it, so instead of just stopping the car and getting out to push it away, Elizabeth starts backing up and screaming, "GET AWAY!" It was so funny. This cart was evil! It finally moved on and went flying across the parking lot. There weren't many people parked out there, and yet it managed to run into one of the few cars. It was crazy.
