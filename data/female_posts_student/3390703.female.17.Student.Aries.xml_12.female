What good would me caring do?  None!  Because like you said in your journal ... it is over between us, for good!  And you know what, I'm not going to let it faze me because I have other friends!  A couple of months ago I would have been depressed and begging you to be my friend again!  But now I've realized that I shouldn't have to beg my friends to be my friends!  If they are true friends they will stick by me no matter what, and I guess that obviously shows that we were never true friends because I have no intention to stick by you, and I know you feel the same!  And about you believing Ashleigh over me, I don't care!  Because I would believe Ashleigh over you!  I've known her longer, meaning I trust her more!  So if your saying that to make a point, or hurt my feelings don't waste your time! My journal is meant to be read by my friends, not people like you!  So unless you intend on my being my friend, which you don't ... don't comment in here!  Don't even waste your time reading it!  Let's just pretend we ever met, it would be a lot better that way!  So yes, just pretend me, my life, my journal don't exist!  I'm doing it, so should you!
