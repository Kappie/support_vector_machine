I talked to B tonight after he got back from New York and we have totally reconciled.  Whew!  He's so wonderful!  4 more days and counting...  I'm still thinking of ordering "Experiencing God" by Henry Blackaby.  I feel kind of aimless with my quiet time lately and I think that I need something to read that will take me through the characteristics of God.  I really enjoyed the excerpts of the book I've read and it seems like it will be a good addition to my library.  It seems like I'm searching for books on spiritual living as kind of a substitute for having a spiritual leader.  I need to be taught somehow, whether it's from a book or from a real person.  I know that the Bible is sufficient, but I need something else to help me interpret the Bible. More and more when I read passages during QT (which isn't as frequent as I would like), I feel like I'm merely GUESSING at what the author is trying to say. I could be totally off and would never know without the help of someone wiser.  I keep saying that I crave spiritual leadership in my life, but yet I'm not being very proactive in actually finding someone.  Auntie Denise and Auntie ALice always say "let's get together!" when I run into them, but that rarely seems to happen.  As for Auntie Denise, I don't really feel that much of a connection with her.  She's kind of "soft" for lack of a better adjective. I need someone who's going to be harder on me and discipline me.  I trust Auntie Alice--afterall, I've known her since 3rd grade, but I feel like there's tiny bit of a cultural and language barrier.  Goodness, why am I so picky?!?!?  I really like Val Wong and her testimony really touched me when she spoke last month at the girl's accountibility meeting.  What's keeping me from meeting with her?  It's been so long since I've had a spiritual leader that I don't quite know what to do anymore.    More and more I feel isolated, not just from a spiritual leader, but also from my peers at church--just the sisters of course. I still care about each one of them, but I really don't now what's going on in their lives.  I feel like there is so much untapped potential in the sisters of our group.  I want so much to sit down with each of them and have a heart-to-heart talk, or just hang out.  Sometimes I envy Ruth because she is able to have the kind of life since she's not working.  She can meet girls for lunch, plan Bible studies, lead small groups, write people e-mails, etc.  Besides loving the sisters, her other job is to make a home for herself and Wayne.  Planning meals, cleaning, decorating, trying new recipes, baking, entertaining friends and in-laws, what a wonderful life!!!  It would be so EASY for me to give up veterinary medicine for that kind of domestic life.  I know that that kind of life isn't easy either, but I think it would be much more fulfilling than sitting in front of my notes and computer all day (including weekends) instead of building meaningful relationships with people.  Maybe this is a selfish desire because I really enjoy cooking, cleaning, and entertaining and I'm actually GOOD at it (if I can say so myself).  I can't really say the same about vet med all the time.  It's not that I don't enjoy vet school, because I do--ALOT.  Sometimes when I'm studying for Small Animal Medicine, I'm literally  overflowing  with happiness. I know that sounds totally cliche, but I'm telling you, it's absolutely true.  I just feel like hugging people when I'm studying for SA Medicine because I'm so happy.  I've mentioned my desire to be a housewife to B before and he definately thinks I should be a vet.  I agree, because it's not like God made a mistake in putting me in vet school.  I'm on this track for a reason.  God seems to think that I could serve him best as a veterinarian instead of a housewife.  I trust His plan, but I'm ready at a moment's notice to drop my degree and make a home.  Sometimes I actually HOPE that this will happen.  It's hard because I don't go to CAT anymore so I rarely have the opportunity to hang out with the girls anymore.  I really really wish that Tracy would hurry up and move back so we could hang out more.  THe only way that's going to happen is if she comes back with a diamond ring on her finger from Todd.  I'm all for that though!  They're an excellent couple with an awesome testimony about their relationship.  I only wish that B and I could have an equally powerful testimony someday--not that I'm comparing our relationship to Todd and Tracy's of course.  It's just that they're life exemplifies that two is truely better than one and that we have a God of redemption.    Anyhoot, my eyes are thoroughly tired now and I'm completely burned out on radiology for today.  Up at 6am tomorrow?  I still haven't gone through the exotic animal stuff, nuclear medicine, and the CT/MRI stuff yet.  *sigh*  It's funny that in this class, rabbits, rats, and snakes are considered "exotic".  I would think that animals like tigers would be considered "exotic", but I guess they are anatomically like big cats. Well, actually, I guess that's exactly what they are.  Anyway, how often would I get to radiograph a tiger during my career?  That would be cool, but scary.
