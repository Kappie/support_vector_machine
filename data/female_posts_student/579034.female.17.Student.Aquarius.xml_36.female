When eva I do something happens and I just get so upset. He just makes me feel like shit and I can't stand talkin to him. And I don't know some of the stuff we had talked about was really bothering me and I didn't feel like dealing with anyone today. I just wanted to have a day to myself. Everything is just piling up and I can't take it any more. Like, if I was allowed to make my perfect world I would include Erica, Debra, Melanie, the trackies, everyone from Florida, Mick, and a few adults I think are cool and that would be it. And we would live somewhere it's warm and we would just have a great time. No worries, just kids bein kids and havin a good time. I just been thinking about like everything lately and I've come to the conclusion that my life, while its not shit, has a lot of speed bumps. And last night was just a really big one... I'm glad I stayed home today and had time to think. I'm gonna get ova last night. I'm gonna get my self together, and I'm gonna handle this.
