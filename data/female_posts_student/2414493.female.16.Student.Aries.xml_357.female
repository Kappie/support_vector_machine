That's disturbing, I'm typing in his IM font right now. It just really makes me wonder what all that crazy stuff was that came out typed last night...how sincere was that? I have a terrible tendency of saying things that border on exactly the opposite of what I really mean.    And putting aside what I said, how am I supposed to interpret something like an email reply that's only one word in body? If you know anything about me, you know my tendency to overanalyze. One word is enough to set me off for ages.    What the hell is it that I want? The last thing I want for this journal is for it to turn into the annals of my obsessive existence, volume 2. I'm done with that! And it's an issue of personal strength...after that one blech episode it was time to move on and to assert my independence and realize that yes, there are other meaningful people out there. It's just something that I've never been able to handle. It's almost like I could say that he's the one person I'd trust the most outside of family...or at least I did a while ago when I told him just about everything about my life. I wonder if he's been equally honest with me--wouldn't that be disappointing if he didn't? It's just taken a long time for me to be able to let go of so much, but at the same time, sometimes, I just feel so silly discharging such minor details, etc. Honestly, what does he get when I call him up when I'm just really angry or something and spend an hour crying to him on the phone, especially when he doesn't know what in the world is going on?    It's really sad to say now, since I thought I was completely over it, but it's just this little funny tug, almost like self-pity but not. Why would I be pitying myself?    Perhaps he's just an emotionless slab of stone or I've just been expecting too much. In  Swann's Way , I can't help but compare Swann and Odette to whatever I feel sometimes, but it's just so awfully pathetic! I'm not going to admit to a class full of 30 people, probably all more experienced than I, and tell them that I, too, have been obsessed, or jealous, at one time. I just like to wallow in self-pity sometimes. Maybe it  is a matter of self-pity. It's just--why do I feel like I've always wanted this, and I have to read his hieroglyphics to figure out what he wants? It's becoming clearer, yes...the card, and the fact that he actually shredded the journal, but looking back, I realize it was the most beautiful book. But sometimes he'll send you an email that'll just leave you crying because it's  exactly what you wanted to hear  andyou'll neversee it manifest in real life. We can talk through email, online, on the phone...but in person, it's nothing.    Or maybe it's that he doesn't want the things that I want. Independence, for one--could you ever really date a guy who didn't drive? I thought, maybe in the big city you could with the public transportation, but in the suburbs?    I just want to be surprised...to turn around at every corner and find some happy secret waiting for me. Writing letters all last summer was some form of release for me, but was it reasonable to expect something back? or be disappointed when he didn't send anything? Or when it was just awkward pauses? Is it just too outrageous to ask for an unexpected phone call, or a message, or just something little...a clear sign? Or to hear, "Let's go out sometime"?    How is it that among the few guys who I honestly like in a romantic fashion, nobody knows how to date? Maybe that's the crux of it, and I'm too afraid to admit it out loud.    I got his card in the mail today. When life gives you lemons, say "*#@!!@# those lemons!" I want to ask him where this card was found. In the "encouragement" section? For what, then?    What can I expect?
