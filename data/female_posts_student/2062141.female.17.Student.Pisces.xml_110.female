What an honor. What a dream. That kid has no idea. Notice he wasn’t trying to get out. The only emergency they mentioned was that he had to use the bathroom. I wonder if they let him keep any toys from inside. I’m not sure he ever put his money in the darned thing anyway. Seven year olds. What I’d give to be seven again… at least my eight-year-old girlfriend would be legit. I’m just kidding. She’s eighty.  You know me and claw machines. We get along just fine. Though I have to admit, half the time I could care less what the heck is inside the box, I’m just down for a good old confrontation, man against machine. The same goes for those arm wrestling games, as puny as I may look I can usually get thru two or three rounds before someone notices I’m using both hands.   I’d rock one of those mechanical bulls too. They look a hell of a lot easier than real bulls and you get to land on a nice soft mat and you’re usually surrounded by a bunch of fools eating dinner on their birthdays, celebrating with the sing-a-long wait staff a happy birthday song parodied over a classic cowboy anthem.  I’m not poking fun and this ain't Sheboygan. I'm a real cowboy. You should see my signature hat to prove it. Plus, I ate the testes of a cow. Up here they call them “Rocky Mountain Oysters.” I’d rather just call ‘em what they are. Bull Balls. Yee-Haw.  Today’s post is making no sense. I wish I was one of those people who has an address book of all their friends and they send out an annual newsletter stating all the interesting things that makes life grand… our excellent drummer, Adam King does a hilarious one and I receive a few here and there from my iron woman friend in Greece who’s swimming and jumping and pedaling her way to the Olympics, but usually I delete all my mail and I’d worry that someone would delete mine, so I guess it’s best it just sticks up here on the site and annoys folks or whatever when I use run-on sentences and go completely nowhere with my words, heck, I could just blah blah blah blah blah blah blah and there you go, a’keepin’ on reading-a-long… sheesh. What was I thinking? I’m no cowboy. I’m a fast talking city boy.   Pardon me. I’m not from around here. Does anybody know where I can get a good ass whoopin’?
