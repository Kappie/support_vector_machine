Is anyone's?  So, life may have its imperfections, but that doesn't mean it can't be great.   Band is going really well.  The other section leaders are awesome.  Cathy is just crazy funny with her "ring tone." And Sarah pumps everyone else up.  And Katie and the guys are awesome too. Wow.... i sound as cheerful as a Frangos.  Hmmm.... kinda creepy. But Liz is in band now too.  And my other buds in band too (except Kelly) so that makes it even better.    It is kinda sad though.... my life has become entirely band.  I realized that the only time i spend at my house is to sleep, shower, and eat.  The rest of it is spent on a parking lot, at school no less.  But what do i care?  I am having a blast, and if i am ridiculed.... bleep them!!! (yeah, I am a wuss and don't cuss.... so shush.)    Yeah.... well I go now....
