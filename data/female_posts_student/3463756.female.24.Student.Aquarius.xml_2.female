Saturday I finally went to the Indian area around this place. Funny how us Indians a colonized race have managed to make our own colony here. Kind of ironic even. The street is a wierd mix. Its a bit like one of the lower middle class areas to shop back in India and yet the crowd is a strange one comprised of those that would be at the places where I shopped. The clear cut class difference vanishes in a country like this I guess. You tend to lust after stuff that back in India you probably might not even have thought twice about. Who would have thought I could become mad about Indian groceries and Hindi movies after leaving India when I wouldn't even glance at them back in India?! That's the strangest part. But then I can say that back in India K and I didn't so much as glance at each other in 'that' way either.  I guess you begin to look at things differently when you don't have them anymore, when u have to stop taking things for granted. Perhaps then, those are the times when you would stop being blind and actually begin to see things that were right in front of your face, the whole time.
