Nothing especially interesting happened, but I did run into both Robbie and James, both of whom I haven't seen in a while. James told me I needed to get a job, which struck me as rather ironic, considering his lackadasical approach to life. Also considering that  he  was the one with the doobie in his hand, while  I  had just gotten back from responsibly stocking money in my new bank account. He's right, though. Standing there on the street, with him blowing smoke and everything... it just seemed a little off. Then there was the cashier at the store where I bought my new (gorgeous) shirt - I liked her right off the bat. She was 20-ish, pretty, and a little plump, and even though I could tell she was weary, she tried to be cheerful. When she went to go ring my shirt in, a little boy came over by her, and she was trying to discreetly tell him to go back where he'd been. He was probably her son, but it made me wonder, if she had to take him to work with her because she couldn't afford babysitting or something. I'm not sure she was even allowed to have him there if she was working. And then I noticed her tugging the front of her shirt down so I wouldn't notice her stretch marks. Like, here's this sweet, gorgeous, articulate mother trying to make ends meet, and she's nervous about me seeing that she's been pregnant recently. My heart melted. I wanted to hug her. And now there's going to be devastation in Cuba, and... poor Florida. People's sentimental treasures, the lives they've carved for themselves... some of them are going to have to leave that behind forever.
