Should my bro feel guilty in what he had commited? he did it because circumstances forced him to.  well.. he didnt feel guilty because he felt he had to do it.   In my case, i dont know whether or not i should feel guilty. I dont know if the circumstance i am in is suffice for me to commit what i have committed.
