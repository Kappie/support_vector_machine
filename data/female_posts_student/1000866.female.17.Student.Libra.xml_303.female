Ahh, so cute! And we went out to lunch and just talked and stuff, and then we went back to her house, and had smoothies. Ohhhh, they were SO yummy. mmmm, now I want one! But anyway, then we went on her trampoline for a bit with her sister and her friend, and we played some volleyball and stuff like that. It was just a fun time.   Then, last night I went out with Bryan and Chris which was also quite fun. We went to McDonald's annddd then to Ranchview, and finally I gave in and watched Super Troopers with them, which I didn't want to watch just because I didn't want to watch a movie. It was a really good movie, but...I would have enjoyed it more had I wanted to watch a movie. It was still really funny.   So, basically that was my day yesterday. Just a really fun day in all. I think.....hmmm....I think....I think I'm not going to write what I'm thinking. Heh. I always do that. I start writing something, then realize I realllly shouldn't write that, but yeah. Then todayyy.....I went to Kelly's house, and we worked on our group preasent for Joanne!! :( Wow. I miss her and she's only away at camp!!! I can't imagine when she goes to England. She called me too!!! And I missed it. Grrrrr!!!! Ah well, she said she'd try back, so....hopefully I'll be home when she calls. I have to remember to send her my letter tomorrow.   Note to self....SEND JOANNE HER LETTER!!!  Then, tomorrow, I'm not sure what I'll do. The next couple of weeks will be weird. Chris will be gone because of Birch Creek, Kelly will be in Ireland, Kathryn just seems....permanently down about Joanne and whatnot, and I don't hang out with Mary Clare a lot. I'm hoping to hang out with Kelly C., or Bryan some, since I don't get to hang out with them that much. Haha, and I just told Bryan about the incriminating pictures. I really shouldn't have haha. Ah well.   I think I'm off to sleep. I love sleeping. :)
