When we started painting on walls with berries we were making a mark that represented some part of our reality.  All writing could be said to be a journal of sorts, a journal of the human experience.    When the diary started it began as a ledger.  The Latin that diary comes from, or  diarium , means daily allowance.  This makes sense.  Some of the leading theories about why writing began say that it all started as a simpler form of labeling trade goods and keeping cleaner books.  There you go.  This sort of thing has been going on since the very start of the whole writing event.  Journal comes from a similar Latin root,  diurnus , which means "of the day" or journey ( urlLink Diary ).    Western journaling in a familiar form started about 200 years ago with the work of Pepys.  This was the introduction of diary being more, in the western mind, then just an account of your business practice.  In other cultures, most notably the Japanese culture, the pillow book of court courtesan is much older.  In the 1960s Tristine Rainer wrote  The New Diary  which introduced diaries as a form of self exploration.  Since this time, and this book, diaries have taken off in the form of journals; pathways to self knowledge, or the inner journey.    Blogs are newer still.  The weblog was only created six years ago and has been gaining popularity ever since.  Long time internet users tend to claim that online journals are not as new as they appear, having previously come in the incarnation of home pages and message boards.  However, there is a key difference in what is happening now with online journals and what previously happened: the ease.  You have to have a basic sense of what goes into a web page to build one, and you either have to be able to host a server or pay for space on one.  Online journals are free and easy.  In order to get one you have to have internet access somewhere, and need to be able to navigate a basic page.  This has allowed for a vast amount of people who have never had any html coding experiace to create something very much like a home page and to get their words out online.  Crazy.  Crazy because of how popular it got so quickly.  There are millions of web journals out floating around in space, and while some of them are boring, or defunct, others have audiences of millions.  The audience seems to be the key part of this shift.  Pepys, Anne Frank, and other journalers previous to this age of internet, often had to die or get famous, or both, before they could have their daily ramblings going to a larger audience.  Now people are logging on and talking to people, publishing their lives for all the online world to see...
