Me and Mike talked for a pretty good bit tonight. He said some sweet things. But i'm not sure if i should believe it, he was drinking. haha. But it was flattering.  Tomorrow Shan and I are goin to hang out. We havnt talked much lately. She's been at Caroline's all week. We dont really talk when she's there. i mean it doesn't bother me bother me, but it does to a certain extent. Yess Caroline is a great person, and fun to be around, maybe im jus jealous of her. I don't know i need to quit being so selfish.  Anyways, i need to go to bed, my other half is calling me in the morning. She's such a cur`racker. haha. i love her bunches`!!!!
