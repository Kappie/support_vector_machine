It's interesting the differences between the things I take for granted and enjoy here and those in Oakland. The house there is so small that if I watch tv in the living room, I can hear it in the entire house. Here, I can't hear anything from the living room to my room. That means that here I can watch tv and be sort of loud in the morning while Jerm is sleeping. That boy sleeps so much... I feel like an early bird with him, and I don't even get up until 11:00 on weekends. He can sleep til 1:00 pm easily, and this is when he goes to bed at the same time as me. Sometime when he goes to bed late, I get up hours and hours before him... we try to have the same sleep schedule when we're together, but it can get awkward and tiring. But he's so sweet and cuddly in bed, I can't get aggravated.  The Oscars were kind of emotional at times, and I am convinced that Renee Zellweger has sold her soul to the devil, aka the Weinsteins of Miramax. I've never seen someone so smug about an award before. And she looked totally bitter when Lord of the Rings won best picture, it was awesome. I'm totally stoked that Return of the King did so well, they very much deserved it after all that work. It really is the masterpiece of our time. It's better than Star Wars. Amazing stuff.   Overall, a good weekend spent entirely in Davis. I think I have to do it more often. I especially had a great time seeing Melissa, Liz H., and Dave. It felt like old times. Good times.
