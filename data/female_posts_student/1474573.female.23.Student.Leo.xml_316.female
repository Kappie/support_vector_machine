Well, after a wicked fight, some time to breathe and a make-up conversation, we started talking again.  However, every time we talked, I had to cut it short because it was busy here or other shit like that, and since I'm not used to calling her when I'm at home, I just kept forgetting to get back to her.  So this morning she sends me an email pointing out that the ball was in my court and why haven't I called her back the past 3 times I cut the conversation short... so I started writing an apology and then I thought it would be  funny  if I wrote that I didn't want to be friends anymore.  So I wrote out this whole Dear John letter to her, sent it, and then sent her an email RIGHT AFTER saying, "GOTCHA!  Sorry, I just got caught up over here.  Bad DyDy!"   So then maybe 10 minutes later I get a response to the first email saying, "okay."  As in, "Okay, I guess if you don't want to be friends then...okay..."  And then I didn't get a response to my second email at all!  So I started to get paranoid, like, "Holy shit, she thinks I'm serious!"  So I called her and I'm like, "Did you not get my second email?" and she says (rather curtly), "No."  So I'm like, "DUH!  I was  KIDDING ."  And she says, "Oh, then I apologize for calling you all these names in my head just a few minutes ago."  Then I wondered, why the heck didn't she want to argue with me about it?!  Like, what the fuck does "Okay" mean!?!  Does that mean our friendship means nothing?!  That she would give it up so easily like that?!  Flim-flam-freneh-freneh-grumble-grumble!    I talked to her and she pointed out that she just thought I was being a total bitch but she really couldn't stop me.  Couldn't  force  me to talk to her... I was like, "But this is  ME , you know?!  We understand each other! Sheesh!!"  She basically just stuck to her guns and pointed out that, yeah she thought I was being dumb, but what could she do?  Somewhat similar situation... This weekend I advised a friend to give something (someone) up for the sake of their own sanity, but then I realized that that person is a fighter.  Isn't willing to give up so easily for something they have such strong feelings for...  So basically, this all just got me thinking...what is actually worth fighting for?  And how would one go about it?  One can't really change another's feelings in general.  We are who we are, right?  But then again, what makes a person feel that something isn't worth it anymore?  When is it time to give up and when should we fight?  When should we just accept something and when should we point out what the other person is missing?  I dunno... these were just random questions going on in my head...  Oh, and by the way, after we laughed about the practical joke gone wrong, I had to cut her off again because I was being beckoned by the powers that be... heh. heh. heh.
