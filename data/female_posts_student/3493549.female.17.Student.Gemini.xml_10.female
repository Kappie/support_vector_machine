I thought I might take it easy and slow down cuz there's like 2 weeks of college break. Looks like that won't be the case now.  As usual, i spent my morning glued to the TV watching Beastmaster and Punk'd. I am beginning to get a little hooked on Beastmaster, which I only started watching yesterday. It chronicles the life of this male Xena, Dar, who goes around saving everything from humans, animals to the supernaturals (Read: Centaurs). Basically, that man is a typical  hero  with a loyal sidekick, Tao and all these animals he can communicate with - ferets, tiger and an eagle. Now, I kind of like the character Tao, as he is an Asian amongst the Americans and he gave up love (with this girl  Caro ) to remain with Dar, which I think is really heroic in a strange way.  I kickstarted my afternoon with journal writing for my Research Study, which wasn't too bad. Next came a tough part where I had to analyse the feedback from the questionnaires i handed out the last 2 months. Being a total klutz with the computer but eager to learn, I soon discovered that drawing pie charts and columns ain't that easy after all. Or maybe it's just me. But whatever, i'll leave it to Jay to come to my rescue as usual. By then, I was already on to a new task - transcribing the tape interview with dr. Robin Mitra. Piece of cake, that's what I thought. Once again, I was wrong. First, my stereo isn't right next to my computer. So I had to play-stop-run to the computer-type-run back to the stereo- and because I have no idea why everytime I stop the tape and play it again, it automatically fast forwards a few seconds, I have to keep rewinding it. After an hour, I was  drained . Imagine my sheer frustration when I looked at the screen to see how far I have gone, it barely filled one page. ERGH! And apparently, I had only transcribed some 15% of the interview. This is going to take a long time. *sigh*  The bottom line is, life can get pretty interesting when you have 'nothing to do,'
