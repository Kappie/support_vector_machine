This here is what happened, this is why I think he likes me.  I came in one day and he told me my hair was cool.  (Before the pixie cut.  Oh for everyone I haven't seen, Nikol.  I cut my hair.)  Then I smiled and said thank you and he said you have a really nice smile too.  Then he reacted as if I distracted him from his work.  It was small talk from that point, that day.  Then I was there on Friday and he said, something like, I was asking myself who is this beautiful woman then I realized I had met you before.  And I said oh, you called me one day and it didn't sound like you remembered me.  He was like no, that wasn't the case.  Well, he was dealing with a customer and I noticed he kept looking at me and when he walked by me he'd smile at me.  Then when he was done with that guy I walked over and he said I purposely rushed through that so I could help you.  And of course I just cheesed.  Then, we made small talk and at one point he said you know, you're a really cool person.  Then it was small talk again.  This is why I think he likes me.  He's cute.  I think he's cute.  But I don't know if he likes me or if he's just a really nice guy.  Hmmm.
