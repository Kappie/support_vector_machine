Now, that's lazy!  Then, I realized I had a luncheon w/ my grandma.  It only took me about 30 minutes to get ready...from trying to get woken up!  So, it wasn't that bad!  But, then I had a doctor's appt. at 3:30!  It takes forever to get there too!  I don't think we got out of there either until about 5:00!  IT was crazy!  Now, I'm just waiting to hear from my best friend, Kim.  She might be coming over for a while to hang out! Should be fun!
