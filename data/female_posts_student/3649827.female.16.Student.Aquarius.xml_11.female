Music in my head:  we ain't going to the town....we're going to the city...       this may be very quick. i haven't decided yet. but it's only been about a day since my last post. and not all that much happened. not all that much i feel like talking about.   uh. hmm.. yes. good things happen. example: WE JUST GOT OUR NEW CAR. and it is very pretty. and i like it very much. mogwai was the very first song to be played in the car...yeeshh. they should feel special.   so i got off super early for that occasion. we had to be there when the ppl came to drop off the car. they were awfully nice. i guess they had to be.    then i had all that time to do whatever i wanted. and i did none of my summerwork. i'm disappointed in myself.   then nadia came over for a while and that was good fun.   and then blinkie and zach came over.    and then nadia came back to pick me up so i could go spend the night at her house and that was swell. we stayed up until 2:30am talking. and i liked it much though it didn't give me that much sleep. heh.   nadia is most wonderful.   curiosa is in 2 days.   heh. wow. stupendous.
