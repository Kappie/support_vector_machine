I'll give you a hint:  it's black it's sassy it's a fender it's a stratocaster it's mine!  ::does the -very happy- happy dance::  And it's SO wonderful and it's got bitchin killin amps with super distortion to go with it and I'm just beside myself.  Tomorrow daddy and Kelsey((half sister)) will come into Shreveport to do the Christmas thing. Mom got him a calendar that I'm supposed to give to him, but I feel bad about it. It's a dumb calendar about books and I didn't even pick it out and it's really impersonal and silly so between now and 10am I need to find/buy/make him a good gift. I didn't get Kelsey anything either!!! I'm so well prepared aren't I?  Today was kind boring aside from the mountain of shrimp and broccoli from imperial wok I ate, it was tasty. Maybe this day wasn't really that boring and I'm just incredibly tired and can't appreciate it?  I'll just do a load of laundry then be off to bed then...  coughfendercoughstratcough
