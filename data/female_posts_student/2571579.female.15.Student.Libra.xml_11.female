I put some clothes away in my room cause my bed was covered. Then i went online for a lil bit and was planning on going outside and maybe finish my book. But it turned out that I just layed out and tanned for like 2 hours. It was cool tho cause I got compliments on how dark i was tonight. Soo since today was my brother John's 10th birthday, the family..and the Chromy family went to eat at Osaca. Then i got dropped off at Jitty Joes so i could finish off my night with Carissa, Eileen, and Matt. I was glad to see Matt cause he was away all week on vaca! It's been quiet at work without him. But we just drove around for a while. Carissa was in a very bitchy mood but that's ok. We stopped by Mandie's house to visit cause Matt loves her. He said they have been like best friends since 8th grade or something. I didn't know they were that tight but whatever. It was very cool. We might all go to some picnic tomorrow so that's guarenteed to be loads of fun. After we dropped her off we went and chilled at the park and had some good talks. Then we dropped Eileen off and me and matt continued our talk so it was a good night. He understands me and i dont think a lot of people do so i'm glad to have him back. We're both kind of going through the same thing. Well that's it for now .. post tomorrow probally xoxo Case       Greatful Dead- Friend of the Devil  "Set out runnin' but I take my time.
