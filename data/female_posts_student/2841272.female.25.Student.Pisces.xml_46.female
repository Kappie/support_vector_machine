And rightfully so, on paper this movie has it all: a proven action superstar in Hugh Jackman, a director who has given you three established hits, and the undeniably successful franchise(Universal's classic horror remakes). Not to mention the confidence the studio seems to have in it(creating a video game and soon a TV show spin off).   Granted, the prime target for this film is teenage boys, but I was a fan of the three previous Steven Sommers movies(  The Mummy, The Mummy Returns ,  and   The Scorpion King  ) simply because they were entertaining all the way through. They are the truest form of a popcorn movie, a guilty pleasure that almost anyone can enjoy.     Van Helsing   begins with a black and white reprise of the 1931 movie   Frankenstein   re-creating many of the shots frame-for-frame. In which we discover that Count Dracula provides the funding for Dr. Frankenstein's experiments. But Dracula wishes to use his creation, the Frankenstein monster, as a means to achieve his own evil goals.  Now after the homage to   Frankenstein  , we jet over to 1889 Paris, where we meet the new incarnation of   Bram Stoker's Dracula  's 60-year-old Dutch monster-hunter, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing(changed the name to Gabriel in this movie), as he's in the midst of battling a hulkish version of Mr. Hyde, played by Robbie Coltrane, in the Notre Dame belltower.  After disposing of Mr. Hyde, and a 600 year old stain glass window, he is ordered back to Rome where we find out he is a 19th century James Bond working for the Roman Catholic Church. From there he is equipped with many high-tech(for the times) gadgets, a chatty, cowardly, quick witted sidekick and dispatched to Transylvania. Where it seems Count Dracula, played by Richard Roxburgh, is just about to finish off the last of the family that has been his chief opposition for control of the place for the past 400 years -- a Gypsy princess who dresses like an L.A. dominatrix(Kate Beckinsale) and her brother(Will Kemp). He arrives just as the vampires are making their monthly assault on the population, and from then on the movie is a silly fabrication for one long action sequence: Van, his allies and the Frankenstein monster vs. Dracula, his three brides and the Wolfman.   The movie's also stuffed with enough over-the-top computer effects -- a few of them simply lame -- to choke George Lucas. Jackman does well as the famed hunter, but his strong performance gets overshadowed by hammy overacting by Dracula and his annoying brides, and the directors love for CGI. Beckinsale's lack-luster performance didn't help either. All in all Sommer's fell victim to the same problems that plaque a lot of big budget directors, He got so wrapped up in spending the money on the effects, he lost sight of what this movie should of been, a funny, action packed popcorn movie.   Grade: C-
