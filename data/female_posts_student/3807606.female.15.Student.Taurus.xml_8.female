They were only 16 years old...16. I can't believe God took such young lives. He prolly just wanted them up in Heaven for some reason. The sad thing is, they had their whole lives ahead of them. JP was in my spanish class 1st semester. He was pretty good at drawing. I didn't know Justin but my brother did and said he was nice. It really made me think of how precious a life is. How we should live our lives to the fullest with no regrets. What if tomorrow never comes? So live life each day like there is no tomorrow. Spend more time with your family and friends because what if you never see them again? Everyone should be more thankful for what they have rather than always wanting. Well I want to close this post with a prayer that everyone please be safe today on this busy day of celebrating the United States of America's independence. Spend time with loved ones and charish each moment. That's life...
