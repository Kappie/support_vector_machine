Okay.. Let me give you some background. She can probably do it better than I can (she's an english person, i'm not) but basically we're a couple who wanted to create a blog.. and here it is! I love her very much and we love each other. (we're two girls by the way) interesting I know, but we love it! Okay, well I'll have her write some more later! Bye bye!
