Go CrazyTown! lol Well i got a called from krissy this morning or aka 1:45pm, see to me thats the morning lol bc i sleep till 2 , wel ne ways i guess her and i are gonna hang out tonight, prob just lounge, i wanna see matts new car tho, so we'll prob do that. Matt no longer has a blanket on wheels :( ill miss that car and the satan symbols that rara andi drew all over it :) Well lets see, i got a nice lil text message from andrea this morning stating the words i hear more often in my life than anything else... I HATE YOU.. which is completely reasonable bc i dont like her much either. lol plus last night, OMG it was so funny, im surprised the cops havent been called on me yet lol o well, i was wearing dereks clothes so they wont be able to identify me, theyll just be like it was a fat woman in drag lol or maybe andrea was looking in the mirror , LMAO ... Ok something else that has been going thru my head, greg told me that cody had a nigger hitter, and i thought that was the funniest thing, so i told my mom about it and she was like, u dont need one of those, u just wave a job in their face and they go runnin! LMAO it was soooo funny!! Then we made up a Cracker Wacker! its to keep the white folks away... ok im done with that, i just thought it was sooo funny!
