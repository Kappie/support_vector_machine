That means that I have taken over 1,230 birth control pill over the years. How long does it take for a woman to get pregnant after being on birth control so long? I guess when it happens it happens. I have looked in to this issue quite a bit but still wonder how long does the pill actually stay in your system? I have heard many people get pregnant on the pill or miss one and it happens, so I guess time will tell.
