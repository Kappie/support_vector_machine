That sucks. yeah well. I went to Mike Fanizza's house last night. It was fun, he's cool. You see, I didn't actually play Halo because there were already 8 people that wanted to play...so yeah. It didn't bother me that much anyway. Oh yeah...so this really weird guy called my cell phone twice last night and I had no idea who it was! He sounded old and Italian. The caller ID said private. It was funny because I had Jasmine answer it the 2nd time because I was a little freaked out. She told them we were having a mass orgy, it was hilarious. And of course John Kasper felt it was his duty to yell out things like "Bend over!". That's our John. I seriously think he is the single funniest person I've ever met. He makes me laugh so much! Grr, off to babysitting.
