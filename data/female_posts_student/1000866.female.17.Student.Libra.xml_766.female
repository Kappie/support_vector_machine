Some days I just feel like I need to run away for a few days and everything will be better. Then, some days, I realize that I can't do any of those things and I bear it and grin and keep this song in my head.  Somewhere over the  r  a  i  n  b  o  w  Way up high There's a land that I heard of Once in a lullaby  Somewhere over the  r a i n b o w        Skies are  blue  There, the dreams that you dare to dream Really do come true  Some day I'll wish upon a  *star*  and wake up where the clowds are far behind me Where troubles melt like  lemon drops  Way above the chimney tops That's where you'll find me  Somewhere over the  r a i n b o w         Bluebirds  fly Birds fly over the  r a i n b o w        Why then, oh why can't I?  If happy little  bluebirds  fly Beyond the  r a i n b o w         Why, oh why, can't I?     It's been a rollercoaster of a night. Ah, the typical teenage psyche rears it's ugly head.
