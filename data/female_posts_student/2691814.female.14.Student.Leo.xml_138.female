I went on dueling dragons ...i didn't go on both i just went on ice. We all went on a bunch of water rides and got really soaked and some other neat things. All last night i kept thinking about going up and down and loopdy loops and stuff lol. I couldn't get to sleep with out be scared to roll off my bed lol.   Today we're actually starting Sex ED class lol. I mean...yes you shouldn't like be imature about it but the thing is.....alot of us have already have had sex or came reeaally close lol. I mean...they're telling us stuff we already know and for the ppl who have had sex....that teacher is gonna prolly make them feel like sh**. I really don't understand the whole point in this...but oh well...just another class.   Thursday is our chorus concert. I'm dancing....with a cane and a hat...dammit lol. But i think i like the dance part. I mean...unlike last year we didn't have to sing....but here...ya i have to sing and dance which isn't that big of a deal.   Well..i guess i'll post later.
