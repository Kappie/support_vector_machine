So today, 6th period, in Trig with Trivento, I was proposed to. By John the Polish kid. We're going to Vegas to elope. Or not, because then what about my Nicholas? I hate my English teacher. She's a stupid bitch. I'm so obnoxious in that class now just because I hate her. She acts all fakely nice, but she's really all stupid and conniving. People in my class are talking about how some girl shat in a tanning bed. Strange. I think my game is going to be canceled tomorrow, which kind of sucks because the hour I have to kill before my game is the only time I have to spend with Nick this weekend (insert sad face here).  Ok, Jared just walked in and put on the Yeah Yeah Yeah's. I'm going to shoot myself. Or him. Someone. I fucking can't stand the Yeah Yeah Yeah's. I hate them so much. Seriously I'm cringing right now listening to this shit. I want to take something sharp and shove it into my eyeballs or something.  Happy April Fool's Day, Assholes :-D
