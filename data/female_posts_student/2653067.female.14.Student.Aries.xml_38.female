I remember when I used to be gone all the time. I don't really go anywhereanymore (well, compared to the past). I don't know why I'm feeling this way, perhaps everyone goes through a blank phase like this? I definitely should find something to do with myself before I become some crazy isolated kid. Lol. Someone has to throw a party.. Perhaps Robin? Okay, now for a better subject.    I'm going to be attending a Franz Ferdinand concert this September with Kelsey and Sam and Rachael. It's going to be so much fun! I'm not100%sure that everyone can come yet. It seems so far off. Eh. Just thinking about September freaks me out. I don't want to go back to school, I've had enough. On the other hand, Ilook forward to seeing everyone andhavingsome fun times at school. Maybe it won't be so bad after all.    Well, I guess I'll be going now.. This is getting boring. Gah. I     must    find something to do with myself for the rest of the summer or else I'm doomed to a life of boredom. Lol. Tomorrow'll be better then today. I think I'll call someone. That's enough boredom for now.   More to come.
