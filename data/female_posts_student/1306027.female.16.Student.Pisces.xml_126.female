Drama is all around us. There is technically no way of escaping it.  Some people expierence more drama than others. I tend to think that I attract drama. My friends are dramatic, and have their own dramatic situations. Work is dramatic. My family is dramatic. I am dramatic. Drama, Drama, Drama. Will I ever just have a moment where nothing at all is going on in the world that I have to potentionally worry about? There are so many different situations going on at once in my life, that sometimes I think I could just stop right in the middle of cleaning the sandwich station and explode. I would of course write a letter before-hand blaming it all on the egg salad.  So, it's times like this that I like to let my mind wander to other places. Being online is a really good way to get out some of things floating about in my head... for example, my conversation with carmen a bit ago Carmen: i have a life? pfft-- think again Me: Lol... you have more of a life than I do right now Me: Mine consists of Working and Sleeping Me: and studying for SATS Carmen: sleeping is good... SATs: not so good Me: Yea... let me tell you... what fun. Carmen: i'm takin an sat prep class come the school year if that makes you feel any better Me: **shudders** Me: Yea- But are you taking the SAT II Biology or the SAT II Math?? Me: Cause that's what Im studying for. Me: Stupid college entrance boards **kicks the fat guys with clipboards and acceptance stamps** Carmen: *falls over from overload of knowledge* Carmen: whoa. Carmen: that... sucks. Me: Hm, yes, on about 6 levels of suck. Me: we have.... doesn't really suck, slightly sucks, full on sucks, sucks muffins, sucks in the third degree and sucks to the point of a black hole Carmen: but at least you aren't on the level of pink bunnies and junniper lillies suck Me: Well, I wouldn't really know if I was on that level, because people usually are on medication and getting to know the ceiling at that level. Carmen: so be thankful your not on that level... i was on that level once. Carmen: ...good times, good times... Me: lol. Me: I got close to that level once..... I considered faking catatomic-ism Carmen: sweet Me: Yea. Carmen: why didn't you? Me: I thought about how difficult it would have been to pee... Me: and I didn't like the idea of wetting myself (I.E... days of the diaper rash...) Carmen: oo... thats right-- maybe they weren't such good times.  Now, if I were to have a conversation like this out in public, people would give me funny looks and start to think that I was really, and completely  crazy.  There's a concept. How is it that some of the most deep-thinking people in the world are crazy?! Just because they take a different view on things doesn't mean they should be considered a threat. Granted, there are some real nut jobs out there, but still.  Why can't I have conversations like that with people here? BAH! If I could just find one person within ten miles that thinks even remotely as close I as think than I would die a happy, crazed person.  But no, all the crazy people I know and love have to live out of state. That's definately a level five suck. No doubts about it.   "I'll never tell"
