Which I think were good.  So to celebrate my efforts, I plan on going out drinking tonight with my old buddy Ryan who is back in town after graduating from Law School.  We both concur I need a drink or maybe two or three.  Also exciting on the agenda for this week is shopping.  Amy and I have made plans to go to the Galleria.  Shopping always makes me feel better.  Well, anyway Amy and I are really terrible influences on each other when it comes to shopping so it will be interesting to see how the dynamics have changed now that she is married and her husband won't allow her to buy anything.
