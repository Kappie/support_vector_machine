The best anyone could ever get...yeah and that's why I've been insanely happy. Yesterday was our one week aniversary and he came over to my house and we hung out while tring to ditch my brother then I went to his soccer game. It was really great cause he got down on one knee and asked me out again cuse the first time was kind of an imcomplete rush. So yeah it was great. I find it a real relef not to be single any more. Don't have to impress anybody and don't have to worry about all those other scarey guys...yay! He's my first boyfriend and I'm loving it...
