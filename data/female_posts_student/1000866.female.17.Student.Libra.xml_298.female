It was so great, and also when Lauren and I were walking back from the Bella Vista, one guy honked at us, and this old lady was like....staring at us. It was so CREEEEPY!  I also learned some errr....interesting pick-up lines. You take your packets and pull the insides out, and you go up and say, "Hey, have you ever kissed a rabbit between it's ears before?" Haha, so dirty....and yet, so funny. Then the other one, which I'll probably actually use is, "how much does a polar bear weigh?" "Enough to break the ice!"
