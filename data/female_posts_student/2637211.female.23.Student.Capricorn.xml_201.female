So now I need to go to DVC in Pleasant Hill to get this damn thing straightened out. I've tried to call the offices and it's all information that I've read on the website, no real person. When I pushed the button to talk to a real person, it put me back to the beginning menu. I sent an email, and so far no response. I sent them a letter months ago requesting, in writing, with my signature and everything, that they send the certificate to the dean's office as soon as possible. And apparently nothing happened. I gave them all of my contact information and nothing. I guess I need to be more proactive about this, but it's hard. That isn't the way I work, nor is the way I was raised. I know I'm way too go with the flow for my own good. But all I want is for people to do their job without causing me so much undue stress! I cut class today, just so I could deal with this bull-oney. Crap. I'm probably going to drive to DVC, park without a permit and pray I don't get a ticket, wait in line at the admissions office to have them tell me it won't work and I'm screwed! Ack! Ok, maybe I'm catastrophizing, but I'm terrified about all of this not working out for the best. And it's probably my own fault for procrastinating and not wanting to deal with lame ass counselors. Ack!!!
