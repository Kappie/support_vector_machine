But it is not the only evidence available.  Perhaps the most damning account is from UPI, making a  urlLink persuasive case that this is the work of al-Qaeda .    One telling thing from the UPI article comes at the end, when a German intelligence officer is quoted:  "[N]ow the war has reached Europe."  Uh, I'm pretty sure the war reached Europe already.  This war has touched many countries and many lives, and it will continue to do so until it ends.  I said in an earlier post that, if this was the work of al-Qaeda, then hopefully this will help open the world's eyes that this is not just an American problem.  Now, I would alter that statement slightly:  I hope that it will help  remind  the rest of the world that this isn't just an American problem.  I started out the day believing that this was the work of Basque insurgents.  I now stand, perhaps not convinced, but with one foot in the other camp.  Only time will tell, but either way this event should alert us that there is a threat out there, no matter where it comes from, and it is growing.  I fear the worst - that it is happening all over again.  And it is, no matter who is responsible.
