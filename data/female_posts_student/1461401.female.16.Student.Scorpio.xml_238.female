Art cause I finished my painting/drawing and mrs. sockman said she really liked it. English because Mrs. Dunn asked me if I was ok, and looked like she really meant it. I almost broke down at least three times today. I just want it to be over. And I don't just mean the week. I really want this to end. Why do people make it their business to make me cry?   DAMNIT! this has to stop this has to stop this has to stop this has to stop. on my way out of school, I walked through the halls with my hat over my eyes and my headphones securely in place. It was kind of nice to not have to see or hear anyone, to just walk on in my own little world. Even if it is looking a little bleak.   later: a little bleak? hmm, no. I hate this. I wish I just had a little room where I could go to cry and scream and break as much as I want to. Dog fecking darnit. (that doesn't help, none of the normal satisfation of cussing) IT HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT MAKE IT SSSSSTTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I've fucked up so much, more than I can stand!  I just want to sit and cry and make IT ALL FUCKING STOP! but no. that's not my choice. that's not my job. it's out of my hands. AND I HATE IT
