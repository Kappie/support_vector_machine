       
      Good day today.  Had an eye checkup that went really well.  My glaucoma is under control now (but it begs the question I saw on some other blogger's page... If I've got glaucoma at age 26 what's next?  Menopause at 31?) and I'm seeing a lot better than I have been in six months.  I could actually see the doctor's face for the very first time.  I was convinced he was simply a blurry face with a little bit of hair on top until the last visit in September.   Next appointment in July.  Another with a glaucoma specialist in March.  But, all's well so far and I'm going back to school full-time in January.  More time to be academic and try to figure out what the hell I want to do with my life.   More to come...
