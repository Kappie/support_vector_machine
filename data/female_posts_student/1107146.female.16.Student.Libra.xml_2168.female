Hell, you could come to the tryout or something, I don't think they're really going to do anything about it. And then we'll get on with it.  Tomorrow is going to be awesome, and if we make it (and we probably will, all that has to happen is Leper shows off a bit) Spring Day is going to be cool. Did you know that Kyle Jones is an amazing pianist? Lord, that kid. He laid out the song  Mountain King  like I've never heard it played before. We were like, "Calm down Kyle! God!" I think he's replacing Shaun for Spring Day (aww shucks for him), and then, everyone might actually enjoy listening to these 27891326498716237169324 minute musicals they're planning on.   So woo, I need to calm down. I really laid it out today and I was feeling mighty by the time I left. Nick said my face went past purple and into black when I was screaming "FREEEEEDDOMMMM" today, and that's always a good thing. I'm accomplishing more and more as a vocalist each day.  Wait, what am I doing? I should be ranting on my BLog. Lord, between this and EMO posts, I'm probably going to fill this BLog for all that we haven't over the past school year.  Peace.
