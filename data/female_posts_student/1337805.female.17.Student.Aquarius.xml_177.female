If you've ever been around me for a substaintial amount of time, (substantial being an hour) you'd realize that I am very loud, and very near unforgettable. But lately, that seems to be the opposite.  My socials teacher forgot me and Laura today. Loudest, most irratiting kids in the class. How do you forget us? He never, ever picks us to read, always skips over us. He forgot to give us the case study today, and I freaked out at him.  There are people on my MSN list I never talk to. I'll strike up a convo, and they'll be like, "Who's this loser"? And I'll be crushed.  Two people that mean a lot to me never talk to me anymore, not more than the Hi, how are you thing. I miss the days where I could have detailed convos with people.  I never have good long convos with people anymore, unless it's Adam. We'll talk about anything, really. But with anyone, the convo just dies. I used to have such animated happy ones, that made me want to sign on and stay on for hours. I stay on for hours now, but for the anticipation of people coming to talk.   It makes me sad inside. If I lived at school, I could be talking to people all day long and never go home, and never ever stop talking to people. Luckily I babysit saturday, 8-6, so that's a few good hours of converstation with Ayla.    My calgary friends have forgotten all about me, to venture to China to find chapstick and hairbrushes.
