Sunday I went out with a friend of Jesse and me and his ex, also a friend of ours and his hopeful of a boyfriend (trust me as I am here typing this it does make perfectly good sense). I spent most of the day listening to the other one talk about the other one and so forth. After a while I just sort of toned it out. Around 3:30 in the afternoon or for all of you army time people… 15:30… did I get that right?  Any way, my big Brother and my friend/his girlfriend Candace came to pick me up and we were off to go see a semi-free concert… long story. It was Styx with headliner Peter Frampton and opening act Nelson (ewwe :-P). Peter Frampton was good (and I have to say he is an awesome guitar player) and the show Styx put on was very entertaining. I don’t really listen to this kind of music but I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to see any concert from 24 rows from stage for $4.00 a ticket, could you? Any way the concert was very good. Styx did a song, but I can’t remember the name of it, but they did a dedication to all of the service members. It made me cry to say the least. But deep down inside I know I really needed too.   I just can’t get over the fact that I cried because of Styx.   Well today is my last final for the spring 2004 Semester. I get to demonstrate how to make a “Magnifying Waterscope” It’s pretty cool. So today is it for this semester then it off for 3 months for summer break and then back to school for my first full-term semester in a very long time. I can’t wait. I have always preferred school over work.   Today I feel very sick to my stomach though. I ate at a restaurant yesterday called Annabell’s and for the First time ever I think I have food poisoning. I feel so nauseated. Usually Annabell’s has good food.
