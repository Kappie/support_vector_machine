The 43-year-old priest and 26-year-old nun were caught "in the act" in a tinted saloon car parked at Lilongwe International Airport.     The pair were brought before magistrates where they received a suspended six-month jail sentence with hard labour.   "It was a bizarre spectacle, the public alerted airport police after noticing the car shaking in a funny way," police spokesman Kelvin Maigwa told the  urlLink BBC .  In a packed and giggling court-room, both the priest and the nun pleaded guilty to the charge of indecent behaviour in a public place and disorderly conduct.  The nun told the magistrate she regretted her brief lapse in judgement, while the priest said that as a man of God he accepted Satan had tempted him.  Magistrate Arthur Mtalimanja accepted their pleas in mitigation, but admonished them saying that as servants of God they were the last to be expected to  misbehave in public.   "I therefore sentence you to six months imprisonment with hard labour, but I will suspend it... because you have shown remorse," he said. If the couple repeat the offence in the next 18 months they will go to jail, the magistrate said.   (30 July 2004)   My favourite was the line by  urlLink Jay Leno  who said that this was the best news the Catholic Church had received in years.  "Right on, Father!" said the Vatican.  :-)   More to come...
