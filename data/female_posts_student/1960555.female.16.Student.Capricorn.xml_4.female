I'm so going to see them at Legends, unless my parents decide to be cute and drag me up to Cowichan for the Thanksgiving weekend, making me miss the show.   Would it be childish to give them the silent treatment if they make me miss it?   Are they going to use the Warped Tour against me?   I miss Janine. Come home sis.
