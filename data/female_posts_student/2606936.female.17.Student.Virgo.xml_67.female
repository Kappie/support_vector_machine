That year's show had a "night" theme, and the tunes were Tossin' and Turnin,' A Night in Tunisia, Stardust, Saturday Night Fever, and Late in the Evening, among others. It was a wonderful show - it had so many different genres and feelings in it, and it was exciting and it was the only show i had ever marched before, and it was so special.  I had the misfortune that happens to every other rookie band class of having my very first uniformed performance at an away game. I remember little bits of it - how I was the bus captain, which was weird because no one remembered having freshman captains before, but that later became a normality with the director. I remember having my first conversation with B that day, and him telling me some story about a  Jackass  episode where someone hit someone else in the nuts with a hammer. I remember when we came for report time, how all of us freshmen had our hats on with the brims way up high, and all the seniors pulling them down over our eyes. I remember warming up in the parking lot with my section and feeling like I was going to throw up, and seeing that reflected in the eyes of my best friends. I remember how much fun we had in the stands, singing and cheering and chatting with the upperclassmen. I remember how, marching in, after a lecture about not allowing anyone to break the line, some rude woman stepped out into my path and then looked at me and asked if she could get through, and how I didn't meet her eyes because I was at attention and just tried not to step on her, and how my revered section leader was in front of me and how the director was walking beside the line at the time, and how no one ever got mad at me for it, and now I step on people who try to break the line. I remember hitting that very first pivot in the line coming in, and how I did it perfectly, and how the director was right there.  I remember when suddenly it was halftime and it was time to put on our hats and gloves and march down the stairs, and I was scared out of my mind, and how the guest band always goes first, and how we stood in front of the stands and the freshman boys were trying to get someof us to move but we didn't, somehow, and how we got out onto the field and I was so afraid and how the senior in front of me counted the  duts  and how somehow, during the big swing phase of Night in Tunisia, I realized I was marching it in uniform, and I started to play, and how it felt when we brought the horns down at the end of what we did that night and I was panting and my arms hurt and I realized I had done it.  I remember the competitions when we'd spend the entire day with band - practicing in the morning, then all the girls would cram into the bathroom to paper-towel our faces and put on eyeliner and lip gloss and french-braid each other's hair into pigtails, and then we'd eat lunch in the bandroom and then we'd do the hi-dee-ho, which was just a big cheer, and then we'd get on the buses and when we got to the schools, we'd watch the other bands compete, and see how some other bands were allowed to march and realize how good ours was, or see what cool things you could do with a marching band.  Then we would go to the buses and get out stuff, and we would change, sometimes in a bathroom or locker room, once in a gym with chaperones covering the windows so the boys couldn't see us, and we'd have to have someone else zip up the jackets and we'd stuff our hair into the hats and go out and warm up, and then when we marched people watched and listened because they were there for the bands, not the football teams, and they knew what was good and what sucked, and they would clap, and I remember how I felt at the end of the closer, because we ended with a "Hooah!" on the horns-down and it was just amazing, the rush you got out of that.  I remember practices in the fall and the winter, how the weather would change, how we'd be sharing bugspray or huddling together, how B would run around trying to get us to play football when it was freezing because he had just moved here from Philly and thought the weather was nice instead of hot like it had been. I remember how good it felt to go home after practice and take a shower and go to bed feeling like you'd accomplished something.  I remember Waffle House and Chili's after games, and sleepovers after competitions.  I remember eighth grade, feeling awkward and insignificant, and then suddenly I was in high school and I was in the band, I was important, I had people who cared about me and looked after me as I found my way through high school. I was loud and hyper and weird again, instead of introverted like I has become as adolescence set in.  I see now, in the freshmen class, the ones like me - they keep a low profile, but every now and then you get a glimpse of the outgoing, crazy band person hiding inside of them. They're learning, and they're going to be a strong senior class.  Few of us will go on in music after high school. I love it now, but it's something fun, not a career choice.  We stay in it because we love it - this group that simply takes people in and makes them feel welcome, needed, wanted. We grew from scared freshmen, and now my class is the cool, calm, collected senior class, and we've watched two other classes growing as well.  I wouldn't be myself if it weren't for marching band. I would still be afraid to speak up and out, to say what I actually think to anyone, whether it sounds ridiculously intelligent or ditzy. I wouldn't be proud of myself the way I am today.  My last band camp is over, and I'm about to jump into my last marching season. I am neither the first nor the last person to go through this nostalgia.  I've seen, a few times, exactly what marching band is all about. I've watched the others as we march into competition, and seen all these different people - different ages, races, religions, economic classes, intelligence levels,  athletic abilities, musical abilities - walking the same way for the same purpose. Over one hundred teenagers, at attention, quiet and ready and relaxed and aggressive all at once.  When we march as a band, it isn't the loss of individuality people make it out to be. Uniformity isn't about conformity - it's about purpose and pride.  Somehow, when we get onto the field, we can all work toward the same goal.  There is nothing in the world like marching band. I will never be in another organization like this, and it will hurt, but I'm lucky to have been a part of it. Yeah-whoa-hey-yeah-whoa.
