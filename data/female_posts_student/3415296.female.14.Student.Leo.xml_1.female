Even if it rains, I will not care because this is more important than getting wet by some rain. I will be strong. I will do what I say, even though I never do, I will. And for once I won't feel ashamed about what I am saying because what I will be saying is the truth, and I can't deny it. I just wish I had the confidence I needed.   Today I put everything that he gave me in this box. Even the stars I made, I still didn't finish making it all. I just thought that it can help me for a while. I was planning to hand it over to Nima, just for safekeeping, but then, I really wanted finish making those stars, really I did. I think I only have 100 left to go. But that's still 100. I remember yesturday I wrote [ 95 - 1053 ] on my name. 95 days, meant something. It was the number of days me and Safee was together. The numberof days where we were more than friends. 1053, the number of days I've known him since the beginning to the last day of grade 8. Some people say I should still give it to him, the stars I mean. I guess that's for what I feel about in the end.   I was talking to Nima on the phone and he said he was worried because he thought Joey sound upset over the phone. I didn't know what was happening, so I couldn't say I knew what he was going through. I just told him that whatever she's upset or thinking about, their love is going to conquer it all. I know that line seems tacky, but it's the truth. Their love is so true, and even someone like me can figure that out. They can work it out together, I know they can. Because they're both strong. I was then talking to Joey on MSN and she said that there were some doubts between them. I said that everyone had their doubts during a relationship, but it doesn't stop you from loving the person. I knew that they would fix this one thing immediately, it's just common sense. Love is common sense. Something that you just know. It doesn't take much thinking to know.   That's what I wanted to know from someone, but I never asked. I was too afraid, but now I'm not. I'm not that little girl who would be afraid of every little thing. I'm stronger now, from the person I was yesturday. Thanks to everyone and the experiences I went with them.
