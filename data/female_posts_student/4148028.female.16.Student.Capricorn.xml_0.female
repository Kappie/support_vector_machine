I am now with one of my best friends...Joe. apparently he's liked me for like forever and I never knew it...I can't believe I was so blind. He is so sweet! The whole time I was with mickey he was so unbelievably supportive of me...even though he liked me. He keeps telling me I'm beautiful. We kinda have a song...it is "Nothing on but the radio" by Gary Alan. It is great. If you know me...you know that, for the first time in a long time, i'm truly happy...and that makes me happy. he is so...so...yummy!...i can't believe i never thought about Joe this way. He is so cute and so funny and so loving and so honest and truthful and caring and did i say cute and loving! i'm so mad at myself for waiting this long to see this... and i am so happy now that i have his love!...I can actually sleep again....wow...i'm gonna go play that sleep game!...cause i can...i sleep really well!...i'm happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
