Luke, Joel, Tim McCloud, Tim Buckley, Monty, Bec, Nat, Jodie, Ash Bennet, Megan, Gemma, Hannah W and me and I 4get the otha person that makes it 14!! Ooops... So neway we saw Shrek 2. It was soooo good, realli funni!! I suggest every1 see it. Basically everyone was late, T1 told everyone the meeting time was 12.00 and Monty told everyone it was 12.30, which was really good! So half of us were there at 12.00 and waiting around 4 half an hour, and the others were at 12.30. 'Cept Luke and Joel, who were very late, 'cept it was because Joel (silly, silly) left his wallet back at the house and they had 2 go back and get it which took them an extra half-hour. We got food at the food court b4 the movie, and we saw Caitlin Casey and Bubs there, and Caitlin had turned goth and had bought these $430, physco ugly black and fire like combat boot thngs. It was soo crazy!! But yeh, that was basically it. It was bad 2 see that the guys and girls didn't merge and sit next 2 each other, it was basically girls one side, guys otha (and hannah w and gemma were lonered and had 2 sit on two loner seats heaps far away behind us, and so they missed out on heaps of the food, and they were chucking 5 cent coins at us so we could give them food, but it didn't work, and all it acheived was that gemma lost one of her "prized" 5 cents - haha) so I was the only 1 who sat next 2 a guy. Shame, shame. And back 2 Luke's discussion on the whole hugging issue. No-one hugged goodbye! Well 'cept the girls, but no guys. Shame, shame again. Apart from all those shames it was pretty good. I'm glad the 2nd movie didnt ruin the first, like Legally Blonde 2, ugh that was totally dissapointing.    I'm also just wondering 'bout whether I should post a poem that I wrote while I was away. It's called "Le Deux" (its french, not the poem, just the title) and it's basically bout unrequited love. I dunno if I should put it up, I'm not a sharing my poetry person, cuz it's private, and also people will prob. read into it, tho I spose there is sumthing 2 read into, but kinda not. I'm so confused....bout everything 2 post or not 2 post.
