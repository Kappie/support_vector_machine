But once Tapenga's aunt came to pick her up, their views changed. Why? Because they were hit with the cold, hard truth. There was this amazing true love in front of them and that's not something you can deny-ever. No matter what the age is, anyone can be in love.   Anyways, only 4 MORE DAYS!!!! =D yay! So so so excited! And Exactly ONE MONTH till Scotland!!!!=-o WHAT??!? YESS! I can tell I'm getting close because I got my money holder thing, and applied for a credit card, and am learning how to convert the money and OY! it's SOO CLOSE! --remember to give me your address if you want mail from me while I'm gone!--   peace.n.love!    btw))I was over-worried last night, all is well, I was forgiven!=)
