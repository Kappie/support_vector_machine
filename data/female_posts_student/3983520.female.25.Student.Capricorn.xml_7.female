I only called him this morning to let him know that I did not bring one of our sons over to his house this morning because I was running late to work. It goes from that to me being a hoe, yes hoe because I don't want to be with his pathetic ass anymore.  I overslept for one because he kept calling until at least 12 p.m. maybe even later but I put my phone on silent, mind you I have to get up atfive o'clock in the morning. So I woke up late it is not like I am trying to keep your son away I just did not want to be late for work. I would have had to pass my job and sit in another 45 min worth of traffic just to get to his house then drive back to work. I would have been more thanan hour late and he already is not supporting the kids so that would have been less money for me. He got so irate because I told him that I can notinvest any more time in the relationship and I believe there is someone out there that is going to treat me ten times better than him. I think that right now we should just work at being friends and if any comes out of that than fine but until then I want to date. I said that nice right? I didn't completely close the window of opportunity and his response was calling me a HOE. What nerve of him.So my response was no I am nothing like your mother or sister. Was that wrong of me? Oh well I can't stand his mother or sister any way they are just as pathetic as him. Can you believe after all that he tries to keep me on the phone for anotherhour or two begging me to be with him and asking me for forgiveness. Does he not know who I am? I don't play that BS and I don't have the time anymorefor his games or drama. You can go cry a MOTHER F*^!#$ river for all I care I don't want you back. I swear he is either bipolar or something. Like Michael Jackson said, "Just leave me alone"!
