The definition from dictionary.com is:   "1. A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  2. A person whom one knows; an acquaintance.  3. A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  4. One who supports, sympathizes with, or patronizes a group, cause, or movement: friends of the clean air movement."   Hmm, whom one knows, likes, and trusts? So are we friends? I've noticed in grade nine, I've made more friendships than I ever did in elementary. My, those were the days. But now, I've been busy planning so much things! I'm like the summer activity planner! Hah.
