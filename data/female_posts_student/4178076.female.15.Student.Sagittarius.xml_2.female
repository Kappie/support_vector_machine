He was supposed to meet us at my house (apartment... thing...) so after waiting for like 20 minutes, Rachel and I decided to go without him. Luckily for him, just as we were about to walk out the door, he showed up. Then we went to the Kava House (or local coffee shop) we hung out and talked for a while and harassed each other. Then Rachel's friend Jeremiah showed up. I had never met him before so that was cool. He and Rachel flirted, then me and Christian bitched and then we walked home. Then Joe (Rachel's BF) was supposed to meet us at Rachel's but he didn't come and she got pissed because we girls (oops, sorry Christian!) had to put up the bunk beds on our own. So then we dragged Rachel's regular bed downstairs and brought the bunk bed up stairs. We also managed to put it together successfully and Rachel probably won't break the bed and die tonight. Then Christian had to leave and me and Rachel watched some bad TV. Then she went online and talked and I called Andrew with my phone card (well at least it's not one sided codependance! He calls me too!) and we talked. I felt bad because he is really tired. So Andrew, if you are reading this, I don't care what time it is, even if it is 2 pm, GO TO BED, get some rest. Then I was online IMing for a while and just as Ben came on (because, as we all know, I have been trying to remember what I wanted to talk to him about) I had to leave and barely got to say two words to him! I did find out that he can't do Wizard of Oz. This is very sad. Stupid religion, what does he need to be confirmed for anyways! And confirm what? (can you tell I've never been catholic) Then Rachel and I went with her dad and his family to a fish place. I don't eat fish but, as usual at fish places, I had fries and chicken tenders. The fries were really good. I like her family, they are really amusing. They are also nicer than my family (my mom's side at least, my dad's side is lovely). Then we went and got ice cream. I had raspberry frozen yogurt twisted with vanilla frozen yogurt. It was sooooo good. I love frozen yogurt. It is way better than soft serve. Then I came home and dad and I watched Photographing Fairies. Despite it's happy name, this movie is no laughing matter. In fact it is quite bizarre. I do not recommend it and nearly everyone dies. It's like a Shakespearian tragedy . In fact it is probably more tragic that the Scottish Play (which I recently saw) because no one you like very much dies except Banquo, MacDuff's family, and Duncan. Also, in the end the good guys get to be king. At some point I should blog about Stratford. Also, the Scottish king is not a tragic hero because, unlike Hamlet, he is not a hero! (he's not even a nice guy) Now enough about that. Then I took a shower! YAAAAYYYY SHOWER. I like to be clean because when you are not clean... You're dirty. I would like to end with that little gem of wisdom and say good night and I love you!
