Law enforcement officials need to learn to differentiate  between criminal hackers who cause damage to computer systems and  benign hackers just trying to learn how things work, says industry  pioneer Steve Wozniak. Addressing a conference of presumably the latter  type of hackers in New York, Wozniak described how he learned to hack  the long distance telephone network from another early hacker, John  "Captain Crunch" Draper, named for using a whistle packed in Cap'n  Crunch cereal in the early 1970s to control the phone network. As a  teenage prank, Wozniak, now 53, says he used the "phone phreaking"  techniques Draper taught him to call the pope.  WHO'S CALLING? II: After committing at least 262 burglaries in the U.K.  over just a year's time to support his heroin addiction, the criminal  career of John Cash, 32, should be over. Judge Barrington Black of  London's Harrow Crown Court handed down an unusual sentence: jail for  seven years, and then for five years after that he may not enter any  house -- anywhere in the country -- without permission. The order even  covers the phone: Cash is not allowed to "call at any residential  premises by way of doorbell, knocking or telephone call," the order  states.  PAGING COLONEL HOGAN: A prison in Port Augusta, S.A., Australia, opted to  turn off a faulty sensor on a fence rather than pay A$75,000 to replace  it, but officials were still surprised to learn inmates were taking  advantage of the security hole. Guards caught a prisoner after he  briefly escaped and went to a party in town to buy drugs, and then  returned. The man admitted that brief escapes were "quite common" among  the prisoners in the affected pod, which included a murderer. "I make  no excuses for it," said Correctional Services chief Peter Severin.  "But in an open security environment you manage in an environment of  trust."  FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED: Mexico's Attorney General Rafael Macedo says  that several staffers in his office, including himself, have been  implanted with a computer chip that allow them access to high-security  computer files in an effort to fight crime. Further, he says, the chip,  which is implanted in his arm, allows him to be tracked, which will  protect him from kidnapers. "I can be located at any moment wherever I  am," Macedo says, adding that the chip "is unremovable."
