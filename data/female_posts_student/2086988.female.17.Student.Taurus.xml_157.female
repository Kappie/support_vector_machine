Me: "Well, I'm going to slash my wrists." ::Dirty look from Kiera:: I love pissing her off like that! She gets so mad when I say that =p  Second highlight of my day:  ::calling BJ:: BJ: "Hello?" Me: "Yeah, um BJ did you happen to tell Kiera to read my blog?" BJ: "Ummm what are you talking about?" Me: "Don't fucking bullshit me, you told her to read it!" BJ: "Ahh, now I remember." Me: "That is private and you had no right to tell her. I was going to handle that today, and you fucked it all up. NEVER FUCKING TALK TO ME AGAIN!" ::click::  Ritika: "Damn that was mean, you shouldn't of called him when you were so pissed off."  Me: "Ahhh...well I feel better now!"  I know, I can be a bitch...ehhh only when people piss me off or are just stupid.
