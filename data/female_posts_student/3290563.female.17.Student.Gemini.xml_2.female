His arm was hanging around this girls neck and she had her arm wrapped around his waist. It made me want to cry and scream, all at the same time. I think I'm just jealous. I dunno. Maybe. It's all just really confusing. All I know is that I didn't want her putting her hands on him...weird eh?  So Avril's new CD has finally come out today in North America! I thought I would have time to get it before work, but I'll have to wait til after. That's all I could mainly think about the whole day lmao. How sad is that? But I really want it and I hate waiting! Grrr! Even though I've heard all the songs, and seen the pics that are going to be in the booklet, I haven't read the lyrics, or read the thank-yous. That'll be the best part! *sigh* Whoa. I just realized something...I don't think they ever released her single over here! Omg...somebody...please tell me I'm wrong lmfao. I've been wanting to get it for so long now. I'll have to check FYE this weekend I guess.  It's super hot in my room and blah...I have my hair all up in a messy style lmfao. It's hideous. Anyways...I'm going to go now. I have to pee and wait for my uniform to finish washing so I can put it in the dryer. Fucking work. I damn it to hell. Don't forget, Avril's on TRL today! I'm going to have my sister tape it for me...she's really my only hope. Sad ain't it? Lmfao. Oh well, at least I know I'll be able to see it when I get home. No wait, scratch that. I don't think I'm going to watch it when I get home. It'll be almost 11pm. I'll be way too tired and I've got a shitload of homework to do. I guess I'll have to skip the eating on my break and just work. Oh darn.../sarcasm. Come to think of it, I never did eat dinner last night either. And omg you know what? I despise eating lunch. I really do, but Christa makes me!   Bri's home! I gotta show her how to record. God help me teach her this.  Much love
