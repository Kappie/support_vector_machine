But anywayz yeah we went...and we were on the river for 5 hours! Yeah 5 freaking hours. Who goes on a river for 5 hours unless they are skinny dipping...I mean... anywayz. Yeah usually when white/albino people go on a river for 5 hours you think they would be smart enough to wear sun screen. Yeah not us! Yeah ok...Lindsay has a broken hand from a stupid reason and Kasey has a broken toe for a stupid reason but I'm fine so that means I should have been smart enough to figure that out before hand. Yeah ok so Lindsay is broke and Kasey is broke and I'm just...well...BLOND! Yeah you know it...I said I'm blond! But yeah I would say more but i'm tired cuz Kasey woke me up at 6 o'clokc this morning!
