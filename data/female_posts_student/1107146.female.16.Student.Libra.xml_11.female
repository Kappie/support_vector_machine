Tin Haven was deleted by Leigh Anne in a fit of anger, goodbye Tin Haven. It doesn't matter.  For now, I want to post all that happened in Kenzie's BLog. I'll put it here eventually. It just seems like I'm talking to Kenzie when I do it, and it's a lot easier than feeling like I'm talking to no one here.  Welcome to Antiphilanthropy, down with this wastrel existence.
