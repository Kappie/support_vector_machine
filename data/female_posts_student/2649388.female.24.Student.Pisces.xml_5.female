I am going to blog about this"; then I ended up procrastinate, and the blogging time window kinda just "expired".    Anyway, this week was disastrous, especially Monday was the worst.   This is what happened:     Monday   10-11:30  Class -- Theory of Parallel Hardware; talked about semisystolic network and systolic network, transformation from one to another, retiming of the circuits ... etc., went over related Lemma, Theorem, and Corollary ... and I walked out of the lecture being more confused than ever.   11:30-12:40 Grabbed quick lunch, ate, checked email, went back to the lecture notes from this morning and tried to re-digest the material, and learned that, I learned absolutely nothing this morning.  12:40-2:30 Headed over to another class -- Computer System Architecture.  We went over 5-stage pipeline for MIPS architecture and different types of hazards (structural, data, control).  It was a good review for me -- thanks to Dean Tullsen, I think I actually learned architecture well in my undergrad class.  2:30-3:00 Headed back to lab, grabbed coffee and gulped it down.  Checked some more email.  3:00-5:30 LONG meeting for my research.  5:30-8:00 Study group for my Theory of Parallel Hardware class.  We have problem set due every Wednesday. Trying to figure out how to divide a N-bit number by 3 in O(logN) time using O(N) hardware is not exactly a fun thing to do.  8:00-9:30 Had a nice dinner in Bertucci's with labmates  9:30- Trying to do the problem set Got really dizzy and nauseous Threw up twice Decided that doing problem set while being nauseous is not exact a smart thing to do, bed. Slept while having stomachache.    Tuesday  I woke up, still not feeling well, so I decided to go to the MIT Medical center. Honestly it wasn't very helpful. The female doctor said that I have stomach flu (duh), and told me that I should:  1. Go home, lie in bed, and sleep more. 2. Eat something light, such as miso soup.  Ok ... let me get this straight. I have problem set due the next day, for which I haven't figured out the answers.  I have a paper reading meeting on Thursday, for which I haven't read the paper yet.  I have a quiz on Friday, for which I haven't had time to finish the practice problem sets.  Sleep more?  I don't think so.  Furthermore, miso soup??  What the ... Do I look Japanese to you?!  (I don't even know where I can get miso soup paste.)  So the trip to the Medical center didn't help too much, except that I learned:  1. I have stomach flu. 2. There is no medication for it. 3. To cure myself, I should do mission impossible #1 and #2. =/  After the medical center, I again headed back to the lab, for my study group for the Theory of Parallel Hardware class.  This time we were stuck on the problem of "how to compute the minimum spanning tree of a graph G with N nodes in O(logN) time using NxN mesh network".  Throughout the entire discussion, I was just sitting there, feeling nauseous and dizzy, praying for this whole thing to end as quickly as possible.  Obviously at that point, my brain wasn't functioning anymore.  (Thank God I have smart classmates.  Of course, I feel stupid in front of them from time to time, but that's beside the point).    Wednesday   More Theory of Parallel Hardware, learned that there are more things that I just don't understand. More Architecture, which is not too bad. Trying to finish my practice problems for the architecture quiz. Still bad headache due to the stupid stomach flu. Have been vegetarian and cut out diary from my diet since I threw up.    Thursday   Uneventful.  Had two meetings since 10 in the morning, stayed in the lab for the rest of the day, studying for my architecture quiz the next day. Bill Gate came to MIT campus to give a talk.  I got the ticket for it, but of course, I ended up missing it.  Because I eventually decided that, my quiz is far more important than going to listen to the richest man in the world talk.     Friday  Quiz. Architecture is the one class that I thought I could handle well.  Ok, maybe I was wrong.
