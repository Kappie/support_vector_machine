But then she bolted after chick told me how to take care of it. My mom is weird and can't watch stuff like that. And to be honest. It didn't hurt as bad as I thought it was going to. The only thing I felt was a pinch. So yes now I am excited.          E just know that I believe that you will work everything out and just know that I am here for you no matter what it is that you need.
