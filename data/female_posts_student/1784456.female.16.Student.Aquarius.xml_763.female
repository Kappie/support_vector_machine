Hmm, my brother's online, maybe thing's get more interesting! I just love being relaxed cause I'm so highly strung the rest of the time. My dad can't do forward or backward roles and neither can I! Ok, so I just threw that in then... That's why I spend so long in the bath, it's so relaxing! So is going to sleep, it gives you time to think. The only problem with me trying to get to sleep is that I usually do in about five minutes so I don't get a long time to think! We all need time to think, well I do cause otherwise I get all messed up! No seriously, I get all eggy and grr like! Hehe, angry Katie not good! I better 'go do shite all' downstairs (in the words of the smelly rikster). Hehe, Flatrick! (Patrick with Fl infront of it!) Ok, ok I'm going! Slightly maaaaaaaaaaaaaad! Go my minions take over the world! ...Gone bubi!
