I miss my best friend.  You.  Only you!  I thought we had something planned-- But we don't, and I lost a smile. So, I think we need another time together, Quite soon, in fact--  I wanted to call you today but it's too late.  You have always been my best friend. And you always will be. I miss my best friend. Do you want some girl time again soon? Maybe your withdrawl symptoms mimic mine. I hope they do.  I wanted to call you today but it's too late. 10:43 P.M on a not-so-typical Monday evening. I miss my best friend.  I'll ring you tomorrow.  Love, Katie Rose
