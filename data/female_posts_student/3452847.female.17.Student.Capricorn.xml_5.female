Anyway, Dave, hehe, we seem to be getting on well, sometimes a bit ackward at first but then its all fine, and i quite like him and hopefully i'll be staying over his on my own on Sat night... Hopefully anyway, hes nice and we'll see, its the first time i've felt like this since Jason so i don't want to ruin it...  ~Lisa~
