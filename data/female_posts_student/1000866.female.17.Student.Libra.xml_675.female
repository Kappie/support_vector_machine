Lock your children away! The blogs come to attack at midnight...  I'm fine. I swear. Well, fine in my definition. Really. Let me just sing a little song. A love song...heh....  I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them fall away Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing. Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.  I know the pieces fit cuz I watched them tumble down No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over. To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication  The poetry that comes from the squaring off between, And the circling is worth it. Finding beauty in the dissonance.  There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away. Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.  Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any Sense of compassion Between supposed lovers/brothers  I have more. Yes, I know. "She has more after she's put the song lyrics in? What's wrong with her? That's not the way things are done." Perhaps deviating from my usual abyss of normalcy will add excitement to life. Hah. Sad though, changing my blog pattern brings me happiness... Did I really reach the high point of my life at eight when my brother chopped off Mermaid Barbie's head with the little guullotine he made for history class? Ah, that does bring back happy memories though. Anyway, that really wasn't my point for continuing my entry although, it does lead nicely into my next point. I was thinking...it'd really depress me if life really were like a box of chocolates. Chocolates are a perfunctory gift that people give to people when they don't know what else to give them. Guys give them to girls. Acquaintances give them to aqcuaintances. Businesses give them to their employees for a great five years with the company...if you can get to that without being laid off. I think if someone can manage to stay with a company for five years without a. killing themselves, b. getting laid off or, c. comitting a felony, they should at least get some waterford out of it. And, back to my original point, which was what you ask? I really don't know. I'm sure I'll figure it out though so, stick with me. Even if you love chocolates, when you finish, what are you left with? A sticky empty box with the lingering smell of a delicious indulgance? The chocolates were probably mindlessly wolfed down anyway. Sure, once in a while you get one filled with cherry (if you like cherry) or one filled with peanut butter but the taste is fleeting and the memory is soon forgotten. So, really, I'm not sure what my point is and even if I did, it's not as fun as listening to people tell me what my point is.   And all of this because a friend's blog said people only write about the silly stuff. The little pieces of nuts in the chocolates of life. Well, I'm sure I shall continue writing about the nuts but, it's nice to confuse people once in a while. Peace, love, and good luck Forrest Gump with your chocolate filled life.
