Since they have switched to this new box the "[i]n one time slot, black viewership showed a 32 percent decline". Such a huge decline could not go unnoticed, and in fact it has not. Critics of the Nielsen rating systems are crying that this is further hiding the viewing habits of minority groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics.    This conflict over the accuracy of the new Nielsen boxes highlights how important viewership is to the television media. So many decisions are based upon viewership that if these statistics are inaccurate the television media may be hurt and lose money. Often people feel controlled by the media, but this reveals how controlled the media is by them. The audience/consumer is the final judge on the merit of a show, and with it how much advertising revenue the station is going to receive. Although people are often at the mercy of the mass media, they do have some control over the course of action the media takes.
