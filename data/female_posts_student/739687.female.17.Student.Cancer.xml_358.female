So...I received a compliment the other day, and I thought that it was interestingly genuine, and quite possibly one of the best, most meaningful compliments I've ever received.  Of course when I tell you all, you won't think it's that big of a deal.  But I do.  I was told I'm weird. And when I asked why, I was told this: People who don't really know me would probably tend to think I'm a bit stuck up because of the way I carry myself. I tend to carry myself at a higher regard and such. But when you get to know me, I'm "really cool and down to earth".  I liked that.  Why you ask?  Because a) they said I was cool and down to earth, which is always complimentary, and b) because it's comforting to know that I carry myself a bit 'stuck up'.  I would much much rather carry myself like I'm up on a pedestal than like I'm just your average girl.  Because I could never ever ever ever ever ever settle for average. I could never live with keeping my head down, or even level for that matter.   If you're ever going to make a difference, you have to be a little more than down to earth.   Thank you, complimentor.  My birthday is TOMORROW crazies!
