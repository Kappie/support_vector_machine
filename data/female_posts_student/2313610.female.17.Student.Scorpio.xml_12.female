Ok, life went down hill even further since my last confession. I failed at the one thing I'm considered good at. I went to a poetry reading, and, despite what my friends were saying, I didn't win a damn thing. I apparently suck at the only thing I'm good at. FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can't that damn god people put so much FUCKING faith in kill me now dammit!!!
