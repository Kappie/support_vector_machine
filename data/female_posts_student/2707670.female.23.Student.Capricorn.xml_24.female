There were a few pirates but my favorite guy all night was Captain Crunch who's shirt said "show me your crunch berries" and had a pho penis complete with pubes sticking out of his pants. I also enjoyed the life size penis that was walking around and the life size sperm that should have been with them cus that would have been funny but they weren't together. There were also lots of girls dressed up but nothing real cool except my friend Zach said there was one that when she bent over her breasts fell out. We ended up going home early because of lack of standing space and I didn't feel well. It was just too crowed to have a good time.   Now I am avoiding studying for my finance test at 7:30 tomorrow morning. I really should study for this one but you know me.. I am the worst studier ever!
