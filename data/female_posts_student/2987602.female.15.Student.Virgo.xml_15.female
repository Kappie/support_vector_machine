Then Nicole and Kat tanned while I was more in the shade but I still go an Irish tan...NOT SUNBURN, there's a difference. So well ne wayz we went back to Nicole's and waited for her to get ready and then we walked to Hoyer's and listen to old perverts honk @ us... old fucks. Then Nicole and Kat were hungry and I wanted to rent a movie and I remebered that we had some money left on our account @ captain video but by the time we were there we didnt have enough time to get a movie and get back and watch it so then we just went to the pizza place there and Kat had garlic knots while Nicole had pizza and i wasnt hungry @ all... weird. So then we were gonna leave but Kat wanted something in CVS so like i was hidin by the cotton balls while she went to get it bc i was tryin not to be seen LOL...(no ones gonna understand tht except me Kat and Nicole hehehe) then we left and went back to Nicole's and we watched Life As a House and my mom was suprisingly 45 minutes late and then I went home and went online and Dani called me so i filled her in on everything going on and then I went online again talked for awhile and went to bed... yes ino not the most exciting of days but I still had fun, it was really nice outside. Today I went to the mall and got two new shirts and like 6 Buddas... I LOVE BUDDAS!!! I hung out w/ Xtina there for awhile and now im back home. So i hope everyone else had a good day...later -Colleen
