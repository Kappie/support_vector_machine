That's all I have to say on this particular subject. aaaanywho, so tonight, my mom drove me around rochdale and i applied at like, 5 places for jobs. dollar store (by iga), quiznos, the extreme pita, tim hortons and mr. sub. yeees. i think, if anyone will hire me, its dollar store, cuz it's like brand new, and the chick even said that they're looking for people. and i have cash experience. or so they think. lol. i wrote that on my resume. shh. but yeah, i know how to  count  money. and even if i didn't, the machine does it for me! :) ah, the wonders of technology. but yeah, that's really all i wanted to say. until next time! which is probably tomorrow.  -joebie
