I amthe ugly, fat, stupid, pathetic, mute, girl that is extremely untalented and clumsy. What type of fantasy world was I living in? I was insane before, absolutely insane. I'll be totally lucky if one day I ever get a boyfriend. Oh, what guy in their right mind would want to get close to me? What was I thinking? How could I believe that he would choose me over all of the sexy, well dressed, popular, totally talented, coordinated, outspoken, skinny, funny, and smart girls that go to my school? Yes, why in the world would anyone want to hang out with me? Why would this guy, who I've liked for just about FOREVER, like me back when I am the way I am?    What sucks the most about this situation is that there is like NO WAY that I can CHANGE the way that I AM. I mean, okay, I'm pretty smart. I even get better grades then he does, but I'm not perfect straight A's. Alright, though I am totally fat, I guess I don't look that bad for my weight. I am ugly though, how do you change that? My mom won't pay for a makeover! The other things like being pathetic, clumsy, and untalented are completely impossible to change too... Is there a way to cure yourself from being pathetic? I think not. Now, for the untalented thing... Don't tell me that I could practice things a lot and that I'd get better from doing so, 'cause I've tried that and for a wretch like me, it DOESN'T WORK! I could always work on my balance by trying to balance on stuff but it is more likely that I'll fail too... Ah, WHY AM I SUCH A LOSER?????????????    He'd never give me the time of day... If he did though, it would probably be to laugh at me.    Gone.
