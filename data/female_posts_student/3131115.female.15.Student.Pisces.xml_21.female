I have feelings and emotions toppling over eachother corrupting my every thought. Why am I so selfish anyway? I love helping people, or atleast people that I care about. I care so much about Bill..and I wish he understood that I really do care and that I want him to be happy. Although, that's probably hard for him to know, seeing as in how I keep saying that I'm not leaving Ashley no matter what. I've grown to really really really really like Ashley. She is a major part in my life, and I dont want anything to change that. I dont want to lose Bill, nor do I want to lose Ashley. I got snot all over Sams shirt, so I feel kind of bad about that. I'll have to wash it really good before I give it back. Her and I haven't been talking a lot lately, I dont really know why. Sam is cool to talk to. I hope that Ashley and I can hang out REALLY soon. I didnt get to last weekend which sucked, badly. I think that Bill is going to come over tomorrow after school..That is if I can get ahold of him and have his mom write him a note..if she will. She's mad at me now, so she probably wont..just because she doesnt have to..or because she just wants to make mine and bills life miserable..as always. heh..not joking either. Sometimes I think about asking him to talk to somebody about how his family treats him. I know he doesnt like people knowing about this...but, pretty much anyone that reads this doesnt know me anyway so therefore they dont know him. If he were to tell someone, they could look into it, and he could be taken from them and put in a better home. That would suck..badly, and...I guess that he can probably make it another couple years. He'll be sixteen soon, so I hope that he can make it that long. WIth my by his side, I think he'll make it. Although, sometimes I really really worry about him. It smells like Williams penis in my room right now, and I dont know why. It's not a bad smell...it not really a "smell" at all..I dont know how to explain it..nevermind. Anyhow...I finished my English Essay tonight, I was so proud of myself that I got it done, and my math. Now all that I need to do is my Science homework and Global Studies homework. Oo yay...School. hah..I wish I could drop out, but..that's stupid and I dont think that I would even if I had the choice. I dont really like talking randomly in my other Journal, then I know that people read it..and I dont want to bore people with my problems...this is pretty much for me and me only. Although, I stopped writing in this one..but, now.....as you can probably tell I have so much to say that I can't stop writing. I dont think that I've stopped writing since I started. Okay.....now I have. heh...figures. I'm writing ANOTHER story..hehe, I dont even think I'll continue with it. It's turning out a piece of shit. Im excited about reading Ashley and Ambers story tomorrow though..wicked excited. I hope that Ashley will help me write this story..she probably wont. She'll realize that she's better than me and then she wont want to write, afraid of making me feel bad. heh...thats okay though, I know I suck..but hey, its something to do. la la la....Amanda Hodge likes bill..and her and I haven't always really gotten along. I guess that she admires me, according to Bill. He wants to be with her, Ashley, and me...I think that's a bit much but I told him that I'd put it into consideration. Although I think that when he see's her and I standing next to eachother he'll change his mind. The thing I hate, is all these girls like him and say that he's perfect and stuff but they dont know anything about him. I could stay on all night explaining how much there is about him that they dont know, or will ever know. bla bla..Im rambling too much. I think that I should probably save some for my other journal. So sorry Bloggie...but I think you're full already.
