See I got a cold, and I let it go into my asthma, which caused acute bronchitis. After performing on Friday night, I went home to bed and I woke up unable to breathe and my meds didn't work. So I got to go to the emergency room at 3 am! Oh fun, but I had to miss 4 hrs of my volunteer work, plus I missed the winter ball :(. Oh well I guess I'll save my dress for prom...Anyways I heard it was uber crowded and you could hardly breathe and alot of people left early, so I didn't miss much. But now everyone is caught up to speed. Oh and one last thing, I GET MY SWEETIE FOR CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!! :) :) :)   It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do To turn around and walk away Pretending I don't love you
