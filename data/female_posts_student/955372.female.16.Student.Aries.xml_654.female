"I'm shocked, shocked to find gambling going on in here." "Sir, you're winning" "Thank You." "We're so excited. We'll be there at six." "yes, I'll be there at ten." "Here's looking at you, kid." "This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship." "What's your nationality?" "I'm a drunkard" "If you don't get on that plane you'll regret it. Maybe not today, but tomorrow and for the rest of your life." "Round up the usual suspects."
