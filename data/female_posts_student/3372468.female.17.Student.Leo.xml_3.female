I walked out to my baybee's house and woke him up washed the jeans he needed washed for the lunch we were preparing for with Elighie (his professor). Then I took a shower while he was still sleeping. I don't know what it is about a hot shower but it's soothing like a bath especially long hot showers makes me think a lot about everything and it's there I try to comprehend the things that I haven't yet. I'm not slow or anything just takes me a little while to understand so call it what you want. Then I walk around because I don't want to disturb him. I lay at the foot of the bed he shifts so I have to I move to the side with the most room his back is facing me so I scratch it and we talk of a couple things it's funny how we both have trouble sleeping all the time. Anyway he locks his leg around mine I love the physical contact with him anything holding hands everything kissing caressing my face I love all of it it makes me tummy do cartwheels. It's the best feeling ever!!!! Does he know that? I hope so I hope that he feels the same way. Anywho we went out to lunch with his professor not before getting into a lovers spat (that wouldn't be the only one of the day)before we got there generally giving me an attitude. I try really hard but it just seems like Evan knows the right combination of buttons to push sometimes, I enjoyed lunch he held my hand for a couple of seconds... Which was comforting. We ran some errands then went back to his house where I attempted to clean his room. I accomplished a little we can see the floor. Oh yeah I was cleaning because I was making him write his letter to Monmouth otherwise he would just put it off and continue to do so. Somewhere when he came back there I wanted to spend some q-time with him whether it be laying together or running around the house playing like little kids. It didn't matter to me I just wanted some attention that's all.Some generally I got mad when I didn't get it. He took me home, I chilled for a bit then I went up stairs in hope to clean me own room I was sadly mistaken, Evan called and told me to be there early. He signed me up for League fun stuff.... I got there and our attitudes were different from earlier which was nice. We bowled three games won the first 2 lost the last one. And in the last one we got into another spat. He always makes me feel like I'm wrong and an idiot I know that's not his intention ya know? But it just happens like that... The entire car ride home was silence until we got into my drive way where we semi talked and I kissed him apologized hugged him and he told me that he loved me which is always nice to hear my friend taliah who dropped me off was suppose to come back and never did she didnt start calling until 930 by then I was like F*@$ it. It didn't matter. But it's all good I guess I'm use to that. Then she calls at like 1245 to see what happened to me. Whatever that was a lost cause don't you think but whatever. I watched you got served the corniest movie but the dancing was HOT. Newho lets see what I thought about today... Many things I'm an extremely Jealous person but not all the time, just sometimes grrrrrr I'm working on that, was thinking about my family how much I love em but I just got to get away quick fast and in a hurry.Friends always know how to disappoint you no matter what it sucks but what can ya do ya know... Until next time.....
