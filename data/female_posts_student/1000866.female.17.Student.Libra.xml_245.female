It's probably my favorite movie of all time. My grandma gave it to me when I was like, 8 years old and I just can never seem to get sick of it. It always makes me so sad though, which stinks because I don't want to be sad when I go to Kelly's house tonight. I think I'm going there arend 4'ish, and then we're going out for pizza and stuff, and then we're going back to Kelly's for a sleepover. I think it will be a lot of fun. I haven't been to Kelly's for a sleepover in a while. I feel like I should bring something, I just don't know what. AHHH, why did I watch The Sound of Music?? :( That movie always makes me want to cry. I don't know why I love it so much, but...I do.  It's weird, and I can't explain it. I guess people think I'm really weird for loving that movie that much. Not many people even like that movie that I know. Oh well, who cares. It makes me happy, actually, it kind of depresses me, but I love it, so, that's what's important right? Right.   Climb every mountain, search high and low Follow every by way, every path you know Climb every mountain, ford every stream Follow every rainbow, till you find your dream A dream that will need, all the love you can give Everyday of your life, for as long as you live Climb every mountain, ford every stream Follow every rainbow, till you find your dream A dream that will need, all the love you can give Everyday of your life, for as long as you live Climb every mountain, ford every stream Follow every rainbow, till you find your... dream...   Haha, wow I'm a loser. Oh well.
