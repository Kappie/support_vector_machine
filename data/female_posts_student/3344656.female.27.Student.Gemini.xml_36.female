So, today was my belated birthday pedicure.  it was the  urlLink BEST pedicure  I've ever had, complete with hot stone massage and pretty polish (yes, a lovely, sherbet-y shade of frosty orange), I needed a nap afterward.  So I took one.  Then I paid my rent, and now I'm online in Lakewood, CO.  But can we please review and find out how it's already June?  I suppose that's good because that means I'm starting school in 3 months, but, this year is flying by way too fast.
