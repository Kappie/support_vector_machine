I would love you all to utilize them! :)  Anywho....  I have now determined what is most important in my life right now.   MONEY.  MULAH.  DOUGH.  GREENBACKS.  Many girls would say that their boyfriend was their top priority currently, and I have contemplated this and determined I am through with members of the opposite sex. Money is much more rewarding. With money...you can buy happiness.   Don't argue with me on this one.. you know its true...don't lie to yourself! I have accepted that fact.   From what I have come up with, all love is can be summed up in this phrase:  MARKETING TOOL.  A highly stratigized, highly effective marketing tool invented by the card companies, television and movie producers, and record companies.   My mother argues sometimes I am too synical and literal. Perphaps mommy dearest is right, but some may call me bitter also. I, however, believe I am none of the above. I just believe I found the truth.  I am sure a rare few agree (....Satpreet...Marissa...) but at least the my ideas are out there....   SONG OF THE DAY: 'Quitter'- Gas Giants
