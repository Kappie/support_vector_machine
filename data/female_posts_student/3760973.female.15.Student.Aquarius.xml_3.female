But LJ decides not to freaking work.   So, later, after my angsting was done, I was reading my friend Erin's blog. 'cause, you know, I love her.   Anyway.  I was like, WTF? That's so cool, it's not all, like... standardized like Livejournal.   But maybe it is and I've just been around Livejournal and Deadjournal too damn long.   So anyway, here I am. With a blog. Whoo.   Enough with the shameless plugging of Blogspot.   On to the strangeness of what I'm listening to.   Okay, so I'm on the Hal Leonard website, listening to stuff so I can arrange it for our corps. And I click on one thing that has something from Drumline, intrigued.  As I listen, I am fucking floored. In a bad way.  How stupid can Hal Leonard (and whoever wrote/arranged this damn peice) to put singing in for band members?  Not just regular singing, either. Singing in parts. On pitches.  It's what makes the whole song.   ... Hal Leonard's stupid, damnit.   Band people can't sing.   But can singing people band?  Yeah. Also- the name of this blog emerges from a conversation I had with my now-friend Charles and friend Megan yesterday.   We were in Graphic Design, aka Set design, and we were supposed to have specific measurements for the stage dimensions on our drawing, all on quarter-inch scale.   My lines wouldn't come out straight.  So Megan pipes up randomly, watching me fumble with the lack of straightness of my lines. "Are you gay?"   And I was like... "I don't think so."   Charles (No relation to you, sorry Charlie. But I still love you, damnit!) spoke up next.   "...I'm sorry. You must be in the wrong place. We're theater people- gay is in the job description."  Quite a funny conversation, considering Charles is straight as anything.   And then we started talking about "Harry Potter- the Opera" and what we would make up for operas if we could.
