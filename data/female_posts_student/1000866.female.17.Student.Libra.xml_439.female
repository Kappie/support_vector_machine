Hmmm, we have a competition next Saturday. I hope it goes well. It's our last one. Wow....marching went by REALLY fast this year.   Heh, when I started out junior year I thought it was going to be my crappiest year yet but the beginning has been realllly good so far. Maybe I'm just saying this because I had a good day yesterday but...eh. I'm still feeling really good about everything right now. AND, I can legally see R rated movies in...three days.
