I nearly started to cry and had to read it twice.  Please in future when you are telling me that someone has died make it slightly clearer!!! Phew. I have had fun!! I cant believe it Emily and Samantha are obssesd with police men!?!?!?  Flipping scarey and weird if you ask me.  jenny and i had a lush pizza last night and i'm still sat her feeling hungry even though i have eaten loads of food.  Ummmmm listening to J trousersnake and its that bit that Tom always sings!!!  I like this bit.  Its Rock your body by the way!!!  oooo Now its travis.  Umm period pains!
