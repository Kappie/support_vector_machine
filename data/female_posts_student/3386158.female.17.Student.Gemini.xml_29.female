You would too if the sexy devil caught your eye, he'll suck you dry...Soon you'll cry to be back in his bosom to do it again. He'll make you weep and moan and cry to be back in his bosom to do it again...   Pray? Shall I go blind? Pray? Cos nobody ever survives!  Praying to stay in your arms just until I can die a little longer  Saviors and saints, devils and demons alike. He'll eat you alive!   Jesus is risen it's no surprise even he would martyr his momma to ride to hell between those thighs... The pressure is building at the base of my spine. If I gotta sin to see him again then I'm gonna lie and lie and lie. He'll make you cry! I'll sell my soul to be back in your bosom and gladly help. Please suck me dry and still you'll cry to be back inhis bosom! Do it again!   My pulse has been rising, my temples are burning, the pressure is so overwhelming and building. So steady and heavy I'm ready to blow. He waits, what is He waiting for?
