(Letting the days go by, water flowing underground)  God some mornings I wake up and I feel like I have been asleep for the last two years.  I wake up now and still I expect to see a man long gone sleeping next to me.  I wake and I expect to find myself at the last place I considered home, a place that was no more mine than this public lab I am sitting in.  I get so disoriented, like my life has splintered off into unrelated fragments, like this is some kind of ruse and all of the sudden he will rush in laughing at my horrified expression and give me a handful of dandelions and we will ride off in the maroon station wagon with the Gar Angler Association sticker on the back and the fast food trash on the floor.  And then all this will make sense somehow.  Needless to say, I am in a strange mood today.  I must have dreamed old dreams last night to wake up so frenzied and wondering what the hell happened.  I would not trade this life I am living.  I would not forfeit myself and rearrange the past.  If it took all that trouble to bring me to this moment, to bring me up to the present with my new lover and my good friends and my fancy free life--I would do it all over again.  I remember my first job back here after my brief stint in Iowa City working for the Man.  It was summertime, that infamous summer of highs in the 110's.  I walked to an Amoco a few blocks away from my apartment.  The pay was low, a dime over minumum wage.  It smelled like sun scorched concrete and motor oil.  There was trash eddying around the pumps, and the boss had a buzzcut and he looked at my boobs the whole time I filled out the application.  As I walked back home, I knew that something was going to come of me taking that job.  I prayed to thin air that something big would happen, Big Love.  I wanted with all my heart for something to break me, just so I could feel something.  The Prince came rolling up in an AMC Eagle, one of many such Princes.  One had a boa constrictor.  One was tall.  One brought me roses when I had my wisdom teeth removed.  One smoked GPC full flavors and read USA Today.  One turned out to be married.  One wore a kerchief on his head and painted my picture.  But it was the roaring of the AMC Eagle I looked forward to, the sound of its muffler dragging on the ground, sparks flying everywhere.  Sometimes I think I was so tired of my life that it could have been anyone, but in truth, it probably had to be him.  I don't love him anymore.  I don't even hate him.  Most of the time, he's just a footnote to stories I tell from those years.  But sometimes that life I signed up for, the life I fully expected to follow through with--It comes washing over me at night while I sleep, and I wake up like I did this morning, saying his name.  Enough about that.  I went to the lake yesterday with my roommate and her (ex) boyfriend.  It was a sunkissed day.  There were trucks painted in camo with rotweillers tied to the bumpers.  There was loud AC/DC, there were hoards of sunburned blonde headed children, there were burgers smoking on the grill.  It was a classic weekend hangout, the kind of place where I feel at home, although my parents tried their hardest to raise me with all the affectations of the "intellectual elite."  Fuck that.  I am such a Kansas girl.  I love this place so much.  The green tall corn, the shimmering lake, the potbellied fisherman on the dock.  I am not so sad about staying here a little while longer.  It suits me fine.  I will miss my friend when she leaves.  I suppose half of what makes me feel like staying is that I am not alone.  And I will be, eventually.  My man might try to get a job here after he graduates, but I'd almost rather see him go far, because I know he can.  (But I'd be selfishly thrilled if he stayed nearby.)  He has a quality about him that marks him as a leader.  So maybe it'll just be me and the jilted boyfriend floating around on rafts in his swimming pool, talking about people who have forgotten us.  Oh, who am I kidding...I am going to have a goddamn great time in graduate school...If I ever remove myself from this computer and go do my homework!!
