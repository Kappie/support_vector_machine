Two years ago, all we talked about was: ANIMALS, food, paper-delivery rounds, teachers, RABBITS, boys, horses, friends, money (lack of), careers, philosophy (in a 4th form kind of sense) and what GOOD GRADES we got at school.  Now all we talk about is cars, SEX, guys, money (lack of), food, DRUGS, jobs, school, sex, ALCOHOL and how we are failing badly at school.    Its kinda funny how life changes.
