I was just so damn suprised that Swati mam with Somia mam, rekha mam chose me instead of raina! Its totally unbelievable! I am still in shock!!!!Raina is much better than me in studies, dancing and taking responsibilities! I mean what the heck were the house teachers thinking at that time! May be they are all mentally retarded just like my pathetic and annoying classmate Shivali, who according to me looks like a well........dog!Anyway i will write more later my idiotic dad is scolding me and giving me lectures! Bye!
