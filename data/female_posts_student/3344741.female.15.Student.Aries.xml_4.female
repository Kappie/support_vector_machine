So I cleaned my apt. and than I just hung out here till people got home. My boyfriend called me as soon as he got home, hah. That's cool.. Yeah, I like him a lot. I just hope he doesn't screw me over. I went out like around 7:00 last night and came home around 10:00... I was with Ryan that whole time, but he didn't leave till about 12:00 last night... It was fun, we talked about me and my simple life and his drugs. He's a little out there in the drug world.. Rolling=E, Trippin=Shrooms and Smacked=Weed or Candyflipping=E Eh!! But, he's slowing down on everything.. So that makes me happy. I still feel weird dating him tho.. I just feel like I should be dating Mike.. But we know that won't happen. He's back in Maryland.. And I am not, hah.  Mhm, let me see........ Maybe I should start doing something with my life. Other than sleeping, eatting and sitting on the computer. I mean I go outside but I don't do anything out there either. I just sit around with Ryan and his friends while they talk drugs. Hah...  I miss my friends back in Maryland.. I really miss Jenny and Kasey. Dude but I feel so alone without my D-unit. Ahaha, my Deter. That's my whore there, haha. Wow we had the best times in gym. You would of had to be there to see why. Geez, Mrs. Shoenadle hated me. Me and Deter made it impossible for her, lol. Memories like that I love to look back on and talk about. D-unit and C-unit, The Dyanamic Dou lives on. Jenny I've known sense I was 8 so I'm deffinitely missing her in my life... We've been thru alot, Turtle Food to make a point.. Hah!!! Than there would be Cookie Monster... Kasey I mean... I love her!!!! Matt and Tj were my good friends too. They made my days better when I was sad, hah. Thanks! Now I'm here..... Alone and without all of them.... Geez, I hope I can make it without them..
