God put you in control of your childs life, to protect it no matter what triquetta16: not something i want to spend the rest of my life thinking about triquetta16: (forcefully sending someone to hell) triquetta16: what do you think about that triquetta16: would you choose a saved loved one or an unsaved attacker? Jcarlos287: i would protect the thing God had entrusted me to triquetta16: and send someone to hell to save the physical body of someone who would be going to Jesus' side Jcarlos287: number one: who is to say my child is saved? Number two: who is to say this attacker will be saved? triquetta16: this is all ethical debate. triquetta16: i don't believe in ethics.  i believe in morals. triquetta16: Thou shalt not kill triquetta16: one of my moral rules...given to me by God triquetta16: i do not feel the need to argue situational ethics since i am a moral absolutist.  i had thought you were too Jcarlos287: eth·ic    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (thk) n. A set of principles of right conduct.  A theory or a system of moral values Jcarlos287: the two are practically synonymous triquetta16: Situational ethics refers to a particular view of ethics, in which absolute standards are considered less important than the requirements of a particular situation. triquetta16: The standards used may, therefore, vary from one situation to another, and may even contradict one another. This view of ethics is similar to moral relativism, and is contradictory to moral universalism, and moral absolutism.  triquetta16: Moral absolutism—the belief or theory that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged—suggests that morals are not determined by societal or situational influences.  triquetta16: not one of the ten commandments has an instance when breaking it is acceptable Jcarlos287: do you believe in capital punishment? triquetta16: the two are polar opposites triquetta16: if God smites a person for murder then yes.  however, the executioner is just as guilty of murder as the condemned Jcarlos287: eye for an eye Jcarlos287: i believe that is in the Bible Jcarlos287: no? Jcarlos287: God smites the person with an executioner triquetta16: Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:   But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.   triquetta16: direct quote from jesus triquetta16: Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.   But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;  That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  triquetta16: resist not evil.  do not kill someone trying to kill you.  do not cower.  but do not kill Jcarlos287: what if in the act of "not cowering" you killed the attacker? triquetta16: i mean by "do not cower" stand firm, tall and fearless.  show them you have nothing to fear in death but that you are unwilling to kill Jcarlos287: you can do that in less then 10 seconds? what are you going to do? make a speech? triquetta16: no.  posture resistance and the look in a person's eyes can say alot about fear Jcarlos287: there is a man attacking your wife. he is 6'5 and jacked. you are in an ally. you think youre gonna stop him? triquetta16: sending someone to hell is irreversible, by not killing them i am simply giving God the chance to lead them to him triquetta16: no. i hope she would stand firm with me and we would die together Jcarlos287: did you know God gives up on people? he gives them over to their wickedness and no longer tries to reach them triquetta16: FYI, Ted Bundy, serial-rapist/murderer is now saved and in heaven Jcarlos287: good for teddy triquetta16: he raped tortured and killed almost a hundred women.  he was caught.  Jesus did not give up on him.  One of the victim's families kept witnessig to him and he was savef triquetta16: saved* Jcarlos287: give up was a wrong term Jcarlos287: but still triquetta16: still after all that man did he got saved triquetta16: God loves all his creation Jcarlos287: good Jcarlos287: "it repenteth me that i have made them" triquetta16: which is a greater witness killing someone or letting them kill you Jcarlos287: you cant say that without saying the other triquetta16: do we go to the same church? Jcarlos287: yes triquetta16: i believe all the verses you are using for crime and punishment are old covenant.  we are learning in church that the new covenant is SO much better.  all the verses i have used are new covenant Jcarlos287: i used two verses Jcarlos287: one was old covenent true triquetta16: old covenant verses Jcarlos287: does the other still stand true? triquetta16: both were Jcarlos287: I KNOW triquetta16: neither do Jcarlos287: but latter still applies triquetta16: that murderer is just as wicked as i, except one thing i have jesus Jcarlos287: i agree Jcarlos287: bottom line: i would lay down my life to save my friends. that is Biblical. I would die to save them, but I would not have them die, that is not their choice Jcarlos287: i told you i agree with that Jcarlos287: and i would protect that which God have given me stewardship over triquetta16: it is my choice not to kill.  it is their choice to murder.  if my friend wants to murder to protect themselves so be it triquetta16: i refuse Jcarlos287: i am saying there is a line between murder and defence triquetta16: nope triquetta16: thou shalt not kill.  PERIOD triquetta16: statement ends there Jcarlos287: i will have to get back to you on that triquetta16:i think generally most people are so egocentric that they would kill the one the aggressor triquetta16: i still feel very strongly about my beliefs Jcarlos287: as i do triquetta16: also think what a testimony cassie bernal was at columbine triquetta16: she didnt lunge at the kid with the gun.  she took the bullets.  she stood tall and unwavering. Jcarlos287: i would like you to realize that that is completely irrelevant triquetta16: i also feel the new testament completely backs up my view triquetta16: one NT verse about it being alright to kill the agressor is all i need triquetta16: it is not irrelevant Jcarlos287: YES it is triquetta16: why do you think so? Jcarlos287: because Jcarlos287: he wsnt attacking her friends Jcarlos287: hah Jcarlos287: as i recal he pointed the gun AT HER Jcarlos287: we discussed this already triquetta16: you really cant think of anything good can you. Jcarlos287: i would die in that case too Jcarlos287: DO YOU REMEMBER THE STORY triquetta16: killing to save a friend is no more noble then killing to save yourself Jcarlos287: he didnt give her a chance to answer before he shot her triquetta16: yes he did triquetta16: she said "Yes. I believe." Jcarlos287: do you get my point? triquetta16:  i have to leave though so we can debate later...btw find a NT verse that says defending yourself is ok and murdering to protect a loved one is acceptable triquetta16: no you have no point Jcarlos287: bye
