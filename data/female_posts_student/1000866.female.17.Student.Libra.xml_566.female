There were so few people there because a lot of them were at the marching thing. I think I'm glad I didn't go and I got my tests all done and whatnot. Wind Ensemble was fun. I just sat in a practice room and played cards with Katharine and with Amanda for a little until she had to do her homework and then with Alex. Good times. Brandon scared the heck out of Katharine and Amanda. Hah. That was pretty funny.  Then math...finished my test. That was probably the hardest math test other than a final that I've ever taken. Actually, I take that back. It wasn't that difficult, just, time consuming. But, yay! Byebye math test!   Then bowling was fun. I got a 106. Go me. Wheee.   YaY French. I totally rocked my quiz yesterday and today I think I did well on the second part.   Lunch was fun. Haha. Amanda, Elizabeth and I all sat around talking about guys...again. We do that SO much. It's amazing. We're such losers. Then, I sat with Carson for a bit. Fun stuff.  During Study Hall/Drivers Ed. I sat with Brandon and Alex and Elizabeth and played Yahtzee. I'd never played it before. Fun times. Fun times indeed.  I debated on whether or not to go to History since I was excused the whole day but, I ended up going. I just felt too guilty. Ugh. I'm a wimp. A WIMP I TELL YOU.   And Satire and Comedy, my test went well and I was definitely right on the sheet we had to do. It was amazing. I understood it!!!!   I am definitely on a sugar high or something right now. I had a brownie earlier. I'm thinkin' it was a special brownie... :)  OK....I'm going to go not sleep now. I'll probably just go talk to people for another hour like ALWAYS. Late arrival tomorrow though!!!!!! :)  ~~~~~It's all waiting if you keep believing~~~~
