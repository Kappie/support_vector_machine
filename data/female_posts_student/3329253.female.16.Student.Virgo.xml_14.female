Almost at any rate. Though you do start to question people's judgments when they become all... Like this. Weird and insane... Not that I'm not already weird and insane and people aren't all weird and insane with me because some people who are weird and insane are cool weird and insane.    anyway enough about being weird and insane. It's just occurred to me that I am a super fast reader. Though there are other people who are probably faster than me, I read a whole novel in 5 hours yesterday. 355 pages. Cover to cover. All done in 5 hours.. And I had started it that morning and picked it up here and there during the day. And then while I was volunteering I finished homework and then did it all. Yes! I rock my socks! Mwahahahah! and i think that i've gone quite insane because of it.     The fan is going and the day is coming to an end andI know why the sky is blue!Anyway... Bye bye!
