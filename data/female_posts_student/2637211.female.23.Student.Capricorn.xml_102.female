I really need to figure out what the heck I'm writing for Von Henneberg's classes. I have a pretty good plan for 146B, just need to do a bunch of research, but I'm a little bit mystified by the 102E class. Not sure which prompt to work on, but I'm leaning towards the last, analyzing how films and books deal with responsiblity. Not sure I can milk 8-10 pages out of that topic, but we'll see. Oh well.   The weather was weird today. Aparently we're in for more: Jerm called and said that in Oakland, they had a massive thunder and lightening storm, and while we talked it started hailing sideways, hitting the windows. Sounds exciting, and should hit here in the middle of the night, just in case we wanted to be asleep. It'll be interesting. I hope the power doesn't go out and kill my alarm. I better set my cell phone just in case. That reminds me: Liz, I read that your cell doesn't work, but I don't have your home number... but I usually talk to you by IM, so it probably won't matter. Whatever.  Melissa and I went to the Clinique counter so she could buy some foundation. I almost got some, but it was $24. I thought my Neutrogena tinted moisturizer was expensive at $12, but I guess you get a free gift with Clinique. I'm not sure if it's worth it, but I'm contemplating going there after class tomorrow and getting some for myself. I need think about, because I'm not sure I really need it. What I've really been thinking about getting is a straightening iron and also maybe a diffuser. I'm sick of my hair doing this wierd almost maybe wavy but kinda sorta straight. Or maybe I just need to get better at styling my hair. I'm having hair issues. Maybe I need a hair cut, though I'm not sure at all who to go to. Never again will I go to Suzie. I'm done with lazy, old-lady hair cuts that start off bad and take weeks to settle down, and which I actually never like. Yesterday I actually tried to style my hair and tried to make it lay smooth, but it got all big and voluminous, like anchor woman hair. It's upsetting. I am really considering chopping my hair off again, or letting it get back to pony-tail length, so I can just leave it back all the time. I have really good pony-tail hair. It looks so good and smooth and the tail flips out nicely and everything. I'm so close, but the hair around my ears is still a bit too short, which is annoying.   Nice how much more passionate I am about my hair than about my homework.
