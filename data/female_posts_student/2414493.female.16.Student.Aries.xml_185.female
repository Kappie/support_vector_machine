Drove to the post office. Saw a double-decker red bus on the way home.  Orchestra mall thing in the afternoon. I WILL PLAY SOFTLY, hah.  I don't know what to do with the rest of the afternoon. I told myself I'd wake up and practice SATIIC math, but I felt shitty so I decided not to.  Oh, and I had a bizarre dream. I went to Harvard summer school, but for some reason I had to come back for a week or two, and a whole bunch of weird stuff went on i.e. some sort of Disney-like hotel called the Empress, prep school guys in rooms, 10pm curfew, closing the gates on you, wandering on the streets in daylight. I guess the ultimate conflict was whether or not I should go back because by then I'd already missed a few weeks, but I wanted to stay home for my driving test. I tried to go online to talk to people to get advice...  I think about going online too much. I'm online too much. Yesterday going through pages I swore I saw orange rectangles flashing at the bottom of the screen even though it was on an iMac with no possibility of getting AIM. And then after dinner I closed my eyes and the first thing I saw was that yellow man.  But journalism's going well this issue, I think...at least for me. I'm done with my pages as much as I can do, though the valedictorian story opening is what Sylvia told me not to do so I better check with her this afternoon...or tomorrow sounds better, hah. I need baccalaureate details, and then I'm all finished. So I've started to tinker with other pages, which is the best thing in the world. I need to rearrange the juniors to look out for page. I wish I had some magazines to flip through for ideas.  I should practice orchestra pieces, hah. Well, it's star-spangled, valkyries, chicago, pirates...wait, that's not much at all. Oh, lord of the rings. That's still not much.
