And when she asked me if they let me wear that stuff to school, I told her "Only if I sleep with the administrators first."  I don't think she thought it was funny.  And I really just don't care. It was good to be back at school.  I missed having a set schedule, and a male presence in general.  My dad does not count.  My hair is even redder now, and people actually noticed this time around.  I think it was starting to fade.  And I had given it a break from the straightener for a while, but that was changed today.  I think it deserved spring break more than I did. It was rainy today, and I had to take to the bus home.  But it was alright--Alex and Mary Alice helped me not to miss it.  I don't even have much homework.  It's a little eerie.  I just have to read Jane Eyre.  I'm supposed to have it done by Friday, and that may actually happen.  We'll see.  If I don't fall asleep too much.  I fell asleep watching "I love the 80s" this afternoon.  They were talking about "Top Gun" when I woke up.  I've never actually seen that.  I probably should if I want to be up on the movie classics, which I do.  I bet I could tolerate Tom Cruise for a little while.  Now I have the song stuck in my head.  What other good songs by Berlin are there?  That's the only one I know.  There's gotta be something. I'm going to go play the piano.  Give the dogs a treat.  Rufus usually comes and lies down under the piano to listen to the music.  It's really cute.
