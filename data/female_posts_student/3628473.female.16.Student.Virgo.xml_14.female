But this man makes me stand in awe... There are only two people in my life, that are males, that i see them truly wanting God... Richard.. And Kyle. The difference between them is, Kyle... Just Kyle. Rick has a passion for God. And i see that with my eyes. But Kyle. I talk to him every now and then. And this man also has a passion. thats what i want. I have been having a hard time with thinking that i am ever going to get what i want. Which is a Godly man. And i really want that. Right now... But maybe why i dont have that. Is cause i'm not a Godly woman.  And Kyle, me dear. You are the reasoning for my thinking. I'm not saying that i want to date these two young men. but i am saying this is what i want. but i can't be that for them. I'm not ready... Thats why. Now i'm thinking Satan is pushing others in the way. That can be Godly. but doesn't have the passion... And i hate saying Godly. Seeking God... Thats it. These two men are trying to find God... And to tell you the truth. That is a beautiful thing. Am i being beautiful? am i seeking the one who has been seeking me? Are others looking at me saying "that is a young lady seeking God"? If not, why not? Cause i'm not living like it. That is sooo it! I'm not Seeking God... What i have wanted for so long, is a Godly man... but the truth is i need to be a Godly woman. Kyle thank you. To marry a man that is truely seeking God with his heart and his life. Is something i want. And something i'm going to wait for. And perpare for...
