Well I've bought lots of munchimoos, the days been pretty poopy, that girls dance is making me laugh again.  Bye xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Hey I'm back. The days still been pretty boring, coming towards the end of it now though, arg! Lol, nothing to say. I've ate so much it's untrue, I've seen some of my my sisters mates, but I don't think they recognise me, I'm getting dropped off at Nippsipuff's later, so I'll write more when I go home Bye (again!) xxxxxxxxx
