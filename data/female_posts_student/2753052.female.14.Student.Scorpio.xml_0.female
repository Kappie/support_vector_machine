Not that I think it's a great career choice or anything, it'd just be cool, someone says,  "I'm an industrial engineer"   And then you say "Oh, that's great, I work at the Quikie Mart for $6.50 an hour, I used to only make minimum wage, but I've been workin' for quite a while now. The boss says I could even get up to $7.00 if I work on my catfood displaying skills.."   The look un their face...priceless no?
