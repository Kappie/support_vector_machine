I think every mother with a child who loves to scream was following me into every store I went into today. The thing about that that really gets to me is that everyone around the baby is like "Aw, hes so cute!" and "Aw, he's a big boy!" and "He's a wild little one!" as the kid is screaming his head off, and there I am in the dressing room almost crying beause the headache from lack of sleep and the headache from the screaming kids were meshing and forming one big throbbing pain in my head. In the end, I got my outfit in the first store I went to (this is after I went to 5 other stores just to make sure I didn't find anything there). Then, I came home, took a small nap, and when I got up from my nap I got ready to go to Melissa's sweet 16. It was really fun!! I hadda good time. I felt kinda bad for Greg though because his foot was hurting him and like he really didn't have anyone to talk to if I went to dance. But he talked to Morgan and Kim and I think he had a fun time. Melissa looked REALLY puuurrrty (lol). And, as of 12:00 A.M. it is Greg and my five month anniversery! Well, thats about it. I have to go pack for the Hamptons now cause my dad is comming to pick me up early in the morning. Peace xoxox
