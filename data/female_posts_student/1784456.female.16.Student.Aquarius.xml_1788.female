I'm losing it, i am losing my insanity! aaah, that sounds about normal *does a quick trial run of freakiness on Megan , Megan just stares at me blankly* YAY! My brother came 5th out of some odd in 800m! (out of those doing GCSE P.E.) which i thort was quite good. not as good as my first (obviously not at school, cant beat bethan!) but good all the same, adn my sis came 6 out of 8 in 1500 for year 7, and 13th out of 20 year 7's and 8's overall, which was good. I am losing my hold, but i am health wise feeling pretty crap at da mo! I gotta go to the doctors at some stage cos my mum thinks i mite have skin cancer. She's probably just worrying too much! LAST EXAM TOMORROW! YAY! Cant believe its history, but hey who cares, no more exams. You lot can all come round to mine afterwards i wud expect, that is if u read this in time. but we'd have to go up in my room, and u'd have to sit on the floor, cos noone can sit on the bottom bunk cos its my sisters bed and only one can sit on the top bunk and thats me! lol xxxx
