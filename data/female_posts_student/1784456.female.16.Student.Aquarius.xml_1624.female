THEY  ARE BOTH GORGEOUS NOW LEAVE IT AT THAT!!!!!! good news. i am meeting up with tim at some stage, whenever we can both get to the mall, cos we worked out on christmas eve (despite the fact that he'd had about 10 cans and had been playing drinking games, and i had had a couple of drinks) that the mall is the mid point more-or-less between us. YAY! i got chased by the ducks at backwell lake on christmas day. i had bread and of course no one had been there so none of them had been fed, so the chased me (or followed, either way) 1/2 way round the lake, and it was geese and swans aswell which i am totally scared of cos they try to eat me! wot else has happened, my eye is alot better. my auntie got engaged christmas day, i am very happy for no apparant reason, and i have lots of money that i can spend or save and gain interest on! okay i think that is it so i will stop blabbering on and on and on.......................... bye xoxoxoxoxox
