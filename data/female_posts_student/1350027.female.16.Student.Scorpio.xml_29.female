Unfortunately, we ran out of stringes and trying to contain him, without the trcyclic, is quite impossible because he is big and strong and I am just too lazy too bother. Plus, my mom just threw out the rotan the other day.  Did anyone understand the frog story he wrote about though!?  He might appear once in awhile. We'll forgive him for his rants. *Nods solemnly* We shall, we shall.  xxx Right, back on track with my ever involving exciting updates:  My computer is kaputt AGAIN for the 486233842634273542634572345th time. Brilliant. Technology and me. We have such a nice history together. I get all 'nostalgic' thinking about it. Can you feed electronics poison? Something which will slowly kill it whilst make it suffer in great agony? Pour water over it, you say? That's just being too nice. I'll think of something soon.  Besides that,  Fishes are dirty creatures. Robbie Williams is my sex fantasy. Matthew Perry and Dylan McDermott have beautiful eyes. I have my period. I want to get out of the country. SOMEONE PLEASE FUCKING BUY ME SOME FREOSMOOTHIES. I'm reading a John Irving book (I wonder how did that happen). Mom wants me to look for scholarships. I need a new phone color; something red would be nice.  Leanne is impossible to live with. I've started collecting 1cent coins. I need new CDs. My mother owes me a book. I have a bamboo plant next to me. I've finished all the coconut and durian dodol and I need more of it. I've decided that the oven is my new best friend and rose syrup is the #1 cordial in the world.   I've not been to Starbucks in ages (explains why I actually have some notes in my wallet - could be maybe it's just the starting of the month or something..). My aunt sent back 2 new collared shirts from Australia; I'm forever grateful for that as I'm desperately in need of new clothings - any form of new clothings. I have period cramps. I've discovered my teeth have moved and now I have more than 4 gaps.   I crave banana leaf. And I like milk.  I will be vegan one day. You bad people should stop eating the cows! I need someone to wax my legs. I might have to stop myself from eating too much cheese. I must have put on atleast 3 pounds.  I MUST SLEEP MORE!  Okay. I go read now. Byebye, my lovelies.
