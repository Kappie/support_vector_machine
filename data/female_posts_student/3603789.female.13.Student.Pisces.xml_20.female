Michael Moore managed to combine fact, satire, and emotion into an explosive bundle of socio-political commentary. Now I am horrified, saddened, and having random fits of hysterical giggles. But predominantly? I'm pissed off.  Without giving away the movie, let me tell you the gist: Moore will focus on the emotions of soldiers and civilians in Iraq, then the horror of actual battles, and then Bush and his minions coldly and calmly saying that all this is justified. And what Moore movie would be complete without one of Mike's stunts? In this case, he borrows an ice cream truck and rides around Capital Hill, reading the Patriot Act over a megaphone (seeing as nobody bothered to read it before they passed it).  I laughed. I cried. I 'grrr'-ed. And you will too, when you see it.  PS: Sorry we couldn't give you guys rides, but they were doing ID checks, so we might not have gotten in anyway. FIND A WAY TO SEE IT.  PPS: Michael Moore is my hero.
