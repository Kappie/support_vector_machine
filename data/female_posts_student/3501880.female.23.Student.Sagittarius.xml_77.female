Listening to:  Jay-Z's "Dirt Off Ya Shoulders"   Watching:  The rain fall outside my window   Mood:  Unproductive ______________________________________  My sister called me last night. She told me that she was getting married, but the way she told me was more in passing, like "Oh, D and I want to go to Spain...and while we are there, we want to get married." Like an afterthought, or rather like that is just something that you do while in Spain. Go see the Alhambra, the Guggenheim, and get married.  I am happy for her. I truly am. I guess I am just in shock about it. She and her boyfriend have lived together for the last three years or so, and just bought a house and a puppy this last Spring. For all intents and purposes, they already are married, so why is the piece of paper to make it official necessary?  My attitude toward marriage has always been very much against it. For historical reasons, I don't particularly want to engage in something that originated as an "exchange of property."  Sure, I would like to have a long-term relationship at some point, but marriage just seems like a hassle.   For some strange reason, I am a bit sad, cause she will be losing her last name. She won't be "one of us" any more, or at least it won't be apparent by her surname. But, as the old cliche goes, I am not losing a sister, but gaining a brother.  Congratulations to my sister and her boyfriend!  *************  On a completely un-related note, the beastmaster said to me the other day, "Maybe I should take down my bed while I am gone, so you can't have sex on it."  Next week after finals, she is leaving to go home for the rest of the summer. About this time, the guy I have started seeing will be coming to visit, and a shag-a-thon will ensue. Naturally, it had crossed my mind that I would indeed proceed to fuck at least once on her bed, and I guess the devious look on my face gave it all away without me saying anything.   "Noooooo, of course I won't have sex on your bed!" I said with fingers crossed behind my back.   I feel bad...Really, I do, because I certainly would be pissed if my roommate fucked someone on my bed. I love my bed. I don't like her. And I certainly don't want her naked-ass on my bed. As a relatively nice person who tries to treat people the way I wish to be treated, I decided that it would be wrong of me to engage in sexual activities on her bed. But in the same moment, that is EXACTLY why the idea is so hot and appealing...Maybe being nice in this situation means washing the sheets after I'm done.
