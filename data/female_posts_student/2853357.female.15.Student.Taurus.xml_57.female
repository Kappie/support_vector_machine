Especially because me and my brother finished one of those boxes of mint and chip ice cream from Safeway in two days...I mean,I could certainly eat the whole thing in one day ifI really wanted to... ButI wasn't desperate to get fat..... It just sorta... happened (the eating of the ice cream)...         I love it when it's just dad at home. Mom's so strict and stuff and dad's all laxed and stuff... likeI can't STAND the way my mom asks me to do anything (like the LAUNDRY!), but when dad asks i do it... Ooh, what's the word. I'm electra complex... It's the unconcious tendency of a daughter to be attatched to her father and hostile toward her mother... LOL. Found that whenI was looking up the  exact  definition for impassive. ( Because there's 4 other words like it, apathetic, stoic, stolid, and phlegmatic... how did i find electra complex again?) It's like when we went to the Philippines... Mom didn't come, it was a week of heaven... I swear.    What else shall I rant about? I think nothing that should go up here anyways... *smirks*     Okay, I'll go back to being my boring self again.        ta     Patty        QUESTA NOTTE  PASSERA!
