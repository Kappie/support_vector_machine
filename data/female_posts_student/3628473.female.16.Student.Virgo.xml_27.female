(Which is an act of worship, but not worship) Now i think about my God. And i try my hardest to look at him. but my mind goes of to, what if this person was here with me singing/playing with me? Kind of sad huh? So last night a thought that came to my mind; i think about praising in front of people, then why dont i? Then a thought came to mind... NO! lol... I was scared. So i think i'm just going to stick to my one person watching me... But a song i was taking part in tonight was talking about our fathers hands on the cross and stuff. And wow... I so over look that... yea yea i was died for, yea yea... but wow. A thought that will never sink in, and thats sad. Now about the cross.... Dont get me worong, i am not a hater or anything of it, but i just have a different thought about it i guess... But i dont see whats so wonderful about it... "Thats where our sins were taken away" POOP! Who cares where... i care about WHO was there. The cross had nothing to do with it (from my way of thinking) the blood was the thing that saved us. A thought came to my mind while i was praying about this (seeing if this is the way i should be thinking or not) and it was my own thinking i know that for sure, but if a gun killed our God (Jesus)then we would all be having a gun around our necks and on our alters... So yea, i guess i dont see whats so wonderful, also, why not have a tome (grave) around our necks? I mean he rose from the died!!! Thats awesome, i would be saying yay for life and not for death. But its just the way my silly mind works...But o well... I tried to go to small groups tonight but amber wasn't feeling well, so hopefully later she does...
