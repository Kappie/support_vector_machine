It is official now, that Bhavya has a fan following in class 11th gals. Today, he was offered a friendship band by a group of girls who also wanted him to put their names in his blog. (I will not do so, and let Bhavya introduce them to you) This is only one of the incidents which have finally led to people believing that some gals REALLY like him.This craze has increased after he organised iquiz and iquisition.  The 12th class thinks that the 11 th batch is freaky ( think about somebody finding Bhavya cute, urrrrgh..). Quoting Damini - "It is scary and very very shameful for the 11 th batch".  So all of us would like to warn these 11thees who are falling head over heels for Bhavya, about the danger that they are posing to their very existence.  But I do think it is a lovely sight to see Bhavya embarrased about it. To get a jist about how major this craze is, visit his blog and check out comments where he has posted his and PC's pic.  Maddening, but true.
