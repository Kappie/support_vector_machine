I enjoy this challenge.  It's like class.  It's hard, it's kicking my butt, but I'm taking the challenge and succeeding.  It's a great feeling to know that I'm putting in all this effort into so many aspects of my life.    I really don't have a choice though.  In two years I'll be competing with all the doctoral level students across the board going into internship.  This is scary!  I'm not about competition, but I guess I have to be.  Especially competing with those from Ivey league Universities.  My Dad has got the referrals for the DFW area.  My half brother,  urlLink Kevin , is a psychologist practicing at Yale so maybe that'll help.  And then I have a cousin on my dad's side, Dr. Sheldon Brown, who is a child psychologist in Chicago.  Luckily I have some connections.  I just need to get my name out there and hopefully this will happen when I get involved in research in the Fall.  Now, if only I could put this effort into dressing a little bit better!  I've decided I'm going to change my hair color again.  I don't like my hair color now and haven't really since the day I got it done.  I was hoping it would fade, but no.  I think I'm going to go back to my natural hair color and be dark again.  I really like that look anyway.  I think it's classy.  And I need to be classy.  And a little less trashy!
