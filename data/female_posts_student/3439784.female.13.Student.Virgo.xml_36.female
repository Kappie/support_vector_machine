[[Last nite i was at my aunts and suddenly i had the urge to speak to someone about how i rele feel! U kno how sometimes u try to block all ur emotions in the back of ur heart and then it gets to a point where ur like,....if i don't let all this out then...i'm gonna BLOW! Well that exactly how i felt....so i did the most logical thing...and called Chels! I knew that she would understand. And i'm so glad i did! We talked for like an hour and then my uncle ordered pizza and then i called her back cuz i said i woudl and we talked for like another hour!   It was great...we talked about how soemtimes people put u down and they don'T realize that the things that they say rele affect u and hurt u. I mean i'm sure that their intention weren't for that to happen but the reality is that the truth hurts! Adults can be so cruel sometimes! Its crazy! They don't know that the things that they say affect us the most because we have been brought up in a world where we are supposed to believe that adults know best! They don't understand that the littlest things they say...we take to heart! I've had my share of disappointments and now my best friend if going through it!?! It just sometimes doesn'T seen fair...like...i mean..why do they always have to be so negative...! I know personally that my family seems to think that when the say negative things...it encourages the kid to get better! WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG! I can'T tell u how wrong that it! i mean..the only thing that will do is just male them feel like ....SHIT and they will give up trying because it seems like anything they do is not good enough! Whatever!  THen we talked about our friends! We both agree that sometimes we hate our friends because of the things they do and the things they say...and how they act so differnt around different people! But we also agree that we rele do love our friends...i mean...i kno that deep down they rele do care for us..even tho they have a rele bad way of showing it!   We talked about goin to highschool..and how we rele hope that we stay in touch with some of our friends but not so much others! I'm not mentioning names or n ething....but one thing i will say..u have to put the freakin effort to be a good friendÂ° If ur not even trying to be my friend then u mite as well say buh bye to our frinedship!]]    sometimes it honestly is the best thing to do. just let it all out. it seems when you keep things inside, you're emotions all jumble up into one ball sitting in your stomach.  about the whole putting down thing. you know, ive been a person who honestly usually doesnt let people get me down. ever. but sometimes, its like words truely weigh you down. and if theyre coming at you all at once...they're going to put big weights on your shoulders and you're going to break down.   off that topic..wanna hear my dream? okay here it is.  we all were coming back from some kind of trip, maybe it was Ottawa or something, all the grade eights were. when we got off the bus, everyone's entire family was there all dressed in suits and ties and dresses etc. and everyone kept hugging everyone liek REALLY tight and lifting them up high and stuff! and i remember people kept wanting to get pictures with eachother and all these formal family pictures (this is all taking place at the school). then i looked at my mom and she was pregnant...and it was then i realized..she was like carrying my baby while i was in Ottawa, but it has to transfer back into my body now that i was home. and then i realized how young i was...nad that i was going to have a baby in  about a month. and i started BAWLING and screaming "NOO! i dont want a BABY!!!" and then miss lowry was there, and she started saying how i shouldnt have made the decision that i did. and i was sooo upset....after a while, i went to hug some guy good bye (i couldnt see the face in my dream..) and then he hugged me SOO hard and lifted me soo high we almost fell over until my dad yelled at him to stop. then my mom and i walked home, and we saw cracks in our house..when we got inside there were sleepingbags set up on the floor, and my brother was getting ready to sleep. then i woke up! yup, it was retarded.  anywho..today, i dunno what im doing, hopefully zo might be coming over...then tonight im most likely going to austins house with a bunch of people! so have a nice day! ciao!  .chels.
