And then there are the times when I feel like I'm caught somewhere in between death and life. Like I'm still breathing, but with each breath I die a little more. People get so mad at me because they don't understand me. And when they get angry like that, how can I explain myself to them? It's like no one understands, because they're too nieve to even listen. I want people to listen. Because if they only knew the things I could tell them, than maybe--just maybe--the way I am would be a bit easier to understand.
