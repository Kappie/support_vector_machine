I wish progression didn't go hand in hand with expecting so much out of life and loved ones. With all the changes that I see unfolding along with those already experienced, I can't help but remember times when my brain was pacified by thoughts of living in a hut by the beach, smoking, and fishing all day long. I used to have such admiration for the simplest of things life had to offer, for instance, if I just got into med school, if I just could lose some poundage, if I could just bask in the sun and never go hungry, if my heart could only be clean and pure, and if my only expectation of people around me was to be happy and be happy with me. Even my choices in men were more grounded based on the mere fact that they possessed ideals that I respected, they really didn't even have to respect me...this may account for the jaded product that types before you....  Now...well, now peace comes in different flavors for me...I don't want material things, although they would be nice, but the pacifist that once existed in me is faced with my other side, the one that roots the underdog on, the one that empathizes with problematic psych patients who are unruly or undisciplined. My ideals I realize now, are genuinely open for discussion, not open for the sake of being called, "open minded" or relaxed. I can see why a child would curse at his mother insistently, after being compared to a sibling or being abused himself. I could see why a group of angry children would want to ridicule an outsider, because he instigates 90% of the trouble these little big boys get into. The budding rastafarian (funny pun if I do say so myself) has been smothered in me...I want to be a survivor, a fighter who doesn't take being taken advanatage of lightly, whose pet peeve is a man who shows no respect for me.  I still want a hut on the beach but only after I've worked very hard and deserve a life with no worries...although I can't guarantee that complaining won't tag along for the ride. If my heart can be free of guilt for hurting another intentionally then this is much more appealing than steering clear of all evil...meaning in life sometimes the right thing just shouldn't be done unless you're willing to sacrifice your own well being. I've lost my genuine interest in people, for the sake of clarity, I mean I can't even see myself attached to very much, tears seem useless, attachment seems useless, and caring to the point where I used to seems useless...  My parents always said with age, practicality would overrun the passion, the drive that used to bring me to tears to hear someone else in trouble...I'm not sure if I like the trade-off yet..
