It's one of those days that begins as all others do; nothing is amiss, there's no reason to think it will be any more or less demanding than yesterday or tomorrow.  And maybe even the first couple hours aren't that special, either, but at some point, the day's activities become a mere pretense.  You're going through the motions because there's nothing else to do.  It hit me in Civil Procedure, after an hour of listening to the professor give us a book report on A Civil Action and taking bids for 2 hours' worth of legal advice.  No notes, no necessary information, no expectations.  The entire school day pretty much matched that level of involvement.  Not that I'm complaining, mind you; it's just that a day like this hasn't come along for a long while.  And to top it off, it's an unbelievably beautiful spring (that's right! SPRING!) day.  Clouds gone, sunglasses required, window optional.    So I guess it's only fitting that the day's turned out to be a bit of a collage of various thoughts/memories/feelings that haven't visited for a while.  The old high school nostalgia is going well with Melissa's latest CD, which is turning out to be quite excellent.  It matches the bright, fresh, young feeling of today.  The last, and first, Melissa album I devoured immediately upon receiving it was (yes, it's a terrible cliche) Yes, I Am.  My friend Sami lent it to me as we traveled on a field trip to Boise.  It didn't leave my vicinity for two years.  Every damn line of that album related  completely  to my place in the world, matched my life completely, as only a 17 year old in love can construe them.  Ever since, Melissa's had a special place on my CD shelf, more so than the obligatory lesbian-collection-favorites.  So it's nice to have a new album that's easy to get into and enjoy (as opposed to Breakdown or Skin; it's over Melissa!  DUMP HER!) without apology.    An anniversary has been tickling the back of my mind for a couple of weeks; and it struck me as I was perusing this month's Premiere magazine that another important anniversary has come to pass without recognition.  They work well in balance.    I'm not looking forward to Mardi Gras.  Last year, Carrie and planned a Saturday morning breakfast; I was going to return and write a wonderful story about a boy and a girl to make the Creative Nonfiction class cry.  Walked out to the parking lot to find Harley's side-view mirrors in pieces, her windshield in shards.    "It's finally happened."   Not that I'll ever know for sure, of course, whether my stickers precipitated the incident; but I'll always wonder.  It's not that huge a deal, really, and I'm not exactly sure why the anniversary has been rolling around in my mind as much as it has.  Find myself holding my breath in the morning as I make my way out, hoping.  Then feel over-dramatic and paranoid when everything's fine.    The third anniversary of a favorite weekend works well to bring the smile back.    The plans were laid more than a month in advance, during the first epic Christmas break, over the pool table.  I would have Fridays off the spring semester of 2001, and we really needed to see this movie together.  There was no other way.  A trip to Bozeman was in order.  And so it was, that said boy and girl, the weekend of the 9th saw Hannibal not once, not twice, but three times.  The first two viewings within a few hours of each other.  And we haven't been the same since.  Admittedly, the movie has lost a bit of its luster since, but the Bible we found waiting under my car hasn't.  Those few days have come to symbolize an era, of sorts.  The last moment before everything changes completely.  The deep breath before the plunge.  The pause at the end of an exhalation.  Of course, we had no idea at the time; we just knew we were young and unstoppable, together again, and summer was around the corner.    But anyway...  Today's just one of those days.
