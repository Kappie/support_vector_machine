This is a crazy adventure, so buckle up, grab some kleenex, and get ready for hot rockstars, baby! Last Tuesday I began this adventure by going to Anna's. We went to Walmart to stock up on supplies (i.e. whipped cream, sex toys, and booze for our rockstar lovers). Anna's dad told us to try and get a key box you put under your car with an extra key in it. We went to the Auto section, but nobody was helping anybody and we couldn't find it ourselves. We asked this guy in the Camping section for some help, and I think he called somebody. It was really funny at the time. We bought some food for the trip. I got these HUMONGOUS, checmical-grown apples and some bologna for sandwiches. We went back to her house, made sandwiches, packed up the cooler, then tried to make brownies. But, her brother had used all the cooking oil in the deep fryer, so we had to pour the mix in a bag. We watched the Drive-Thru records DVD, which is so funny. This guy, R2K, from Finch- so hot and funny. The Early November stuff was really good as well! There is this part where the boys go into this room to meet with these new producers. They get there, and the new producers (blonde ho's) start taking off their clothes and giving them lap dances! Then they are talking about it afterwards and Ace says something like (I couldn't remember, so I asked Anna): yay f0r mae x: he's like, 'i told them to take their clothes off, and they were like, 'what?! why?!" and i said, 'cause that's what publicists DO'. Yeah, I wish I had that DVD, it's off the hook. We also watched their DVD that comes with the CD, it is always a good time. "The CD has 11 songs and is 50 minutes long, that's pretty long for 11 songs" yeah I don't know why that makes me laugh, but it does! We watched some videos on Anna's computer and talked to some folks, then finally went to bed around 2.   Wednesday, June 23, 2004:  6 A.M.: We got up and started to get ready. We packed up all our stuff, put the cooler in the car, and rolled out around 6:30. We stopped and got some Tim Horton's for breakfast, then hit the road flying with excitement! 8 A.M.: The excitement had worn off. Now we were just tired and shit-faced (not really, but I like to say that). We realized that we were IDIOTS for going to bed so late, knowing full well we'd have to arise with the sun and bid farewell to Ohio the next morning. We drove through Cincinnati and into Kentucky without any problems. We saw a watertower that said, "Florence Y'all". Damn hicks.  11 A.M.: We rolled into Tennessee and decided to pull over and stretch a bit. I forget where we were, but we went to this Sam's Sad Clown warehouse type thing. I forget what it was, but it was weird. I walked in and saw a shelf full of Confederate Flag memoralbia. EWW I HATE THE SOUTH!  We continued on the road and saw a speed limit sign saying, "70". At the exact moment we both screamed, "OH MY GOD, THE SPEED LIMIT IS 70!" We listened to some tunes and had some laughs. My phone changed time zones, which was exciting. Anna's doesn't, and I think it upsets her. I get really excited when I see a house on a truck... in one day I saw FIVE! And I saw one on the way home. 4 P.M.: Okay... the car was no longer fun. This was starting to look like a huge mistake! 12 hours of driving in a day- THAT'S CRAZY TALK! We got through Nashville and Memphis, but we were seriously needing Jackson, Mississippi to be the next city. Mississippi was not as bad as I would have thought. It was lush and green and trees grew in the median.  8-9 P.M.: After 12 hours or so in a car, we finally got into Jackson in the evening. Our first Red Roof Inn was okay. We were not very fast at unpacking the car, but we improved our speed over the next few days. I wrote in my journal and listened to music. I think I read a chapter of  Harry Potter  as well. We crashed pretty fast and then woke early for our next day.   Thursday , June 24, 2004:  9 A.M.: We packed up the car again, checked out, and left town for an 8 hour drive to Houston. It was sprinkling. Thus beginning the rain. The rain began to pick up as we neared Louisiana. In fact, as we drove up a bridge, it poured so hard we could not see the road. We couldn't pull over either, because if we went too far, we'd have fallen off a cliff. We pulled over for shelter and gas (and by pulled over, I mean we went onto a different highway, but we figured it out). Anna called the Mae guy to confirm our being on The List, but he didn't answer. He did call back, however, when Anna was peeing. We got gas and sat in the car waiting out the rain. A man came out of his car, wearing a top hat, looked at our license plates and then in at us through the window, and motioned the act of driving with his hands. No no, it was TERRIFYING! We decided that the rain was safer than those crazy-ass people at that sketchy gas station. 5 P.M.: Arrived in Houston, only to learn that their highways are completely FUCKED up. When you pull off, you are on a one-way road and if you want to go the other direction, you have to turn around, and it's so confusing! We passed an Olive Garden and discussed our mutual like for their restaurant. We got to our hotel, after a bit of confusion, and unpacked at quite a fast rate.  6 P.M.: We got a map of the surrounding area and decided to check out North Mall. However, they only had shoe stores and a CD store full of rap. We decided to drive around and get some grub. But five minutes of driving put us like 20 miles away from our hotel. We got back on the freeway and saw the Olive Garden again.. so we went and ate there! It was our date meal.  10 P.M.: I checked in with Elizabeth and caught up. Anna and I were anxiously approcaching the concert the next morning and all the glory it would be. I talked to Erica that night at like midnight. I could hardly sleep that night with anticipation.  Friday, June 25, 2004:  6 A.M.: I woke up with nerves and butterflies in my stomach. I was so worried about something going wrong, and so excited to have so much fun. I couldn't sleep. I listened to the Early November's CD twice and tried to remember the lyrics. 8:45 A.M.: I decided to give up and just take a shower. I got cleaned up and shaved, gotta be ready for my man. I think I woke Anna up, but we needed a lot of time to get ready anyways. It was sprinkling and we were really not wanting it to rain. Warped Tour is rain or shine, but after 20 hours and a state full of rain, we wanted some shine. 10:30 A.M.: We looked hot and rockin', so we left our hotel towards Reliant Stadium for the show. We found this really awesome radio station and were jammin' and getting PUMPED! But then, the DJ starts talking about "Warped Tour NOT being cancelled, it being postponed." I'm sorry... REPEAT. Postponed? You can't cancel/postpone Warped Tour. That's not how it is. We drove towards the stadium anyways, there was no way in hell the show was off. 11 A.M.: The show was off. Postponed 'till Monday. My heart broke. I cried a little. I never cry.  12 P.M.: We left the Red Roof early, packed the car in a record three minutes, and started the drive to Dallas. We were still really upset about Houston. Then we got stuck in traffic. Dead stopped in traffic. The day was sunny. The show would have been fine. It sprinkled on and off again, but nothing we couldn't have handled.  5 P.M.: Arrived in Dallas, after sitting in traffic, and tried to find the ampitheather to get our bearings. Mapquest, however, had led us to train tracks.  6 P.M.: We began to drive around in search of a hotel. Needless to say, there were none. Dallas was holding a convention and everything was booked.  7:30 P.M.: We finally found Smirnoff amphitheater, but there were no hotels around it. 8 P.M.: We went outside of Dallas, found a dumpy Super 6 and settled on a smoking room for $50. The entrance was chained off and it was quite difficult to get inside the parking lot. But it was the best we could get. However, the boy working was hot and Indian. His name was TK and he was a fox! When Anna was paying, I noticed a van with a trailer. Rockstars perhaps? Then I saw some skinny boys! AHH could we be staying with some warped kids?! I asked TK if he saw any skinny boys with piercings. He asked me if they were "white dudes". Then I asked what room, all he told me was, "They're close." TK, YOU TEASE! Close they were, two rooms down in fact.  9 P.M.: We went to Burger King and ran into some guys who worked the Volcom stage. One asked if we were going to Warped, and we told him we were from Ohio, and the other one goes, "Why would you come here all the way from Ohio?" What's it to you, bitch? We didn't come for your ugly ass, hell no.  10 P.M.: We really wanted to hang out with those rockstars. I stuck my head out the door to try and see what they were doing, and at the exact same time the little one walked by, and I screamed. He apologized, then went to do his laundry. We couldn't stand the smell, so we went to play Harry Potter Uno outside. The guys came over and asked if we wanted some alcohol and then started talking. They're from A Thorn For Every Heart or something like that. Anyways, we saw another van with a trailer, and they went over to see who was in it. We tagged along and met the guy from... LYLAH! He was cute and goth! The first group of guys kept talking about how they have a set time everyday and all that, but the Lylah guy was like "Dude, I've done this for three years, there are always problems!" So those other boys left out of embarrassment. We talked to the Lylah guy and his bandmates for like an hour. He kept making jokes about their tour guy's mom-it was funny. They were super nice and were like, "If you want to hang out later, come up to our room!" But we went to bed with anticipation and hopes of no rain for the next day.  Saturday, June 26, 2004:  7 A.M.: The stupid Thorn band was blasting their music while packing up their van, which woke us up. 10 A.M.: Left for the show, got lost a couple of times, then paid $12 to park! WHAT THE FUCK?! 11 A.M.: We were directed to the Trojan booth to wait for The List. Anna saw Dave from Mae, with his girlfriend, and we chatted a bit. I spied Serg walking around (with hot new blonde hair).  12 P.M.: The List comes out... we're not on it. Thus begins the freaking out. We called the Mae guy a thousand times, but he didn't answer. We asked this guy who was running around like crazy, but wearing an All Access pass, to help us out.. he said he would. 12:15 P.M.: Adam, the Mae guy, hooks us up. Since Anna had an interview she got a press and photo badge. They told us we had to go backstage to get in, but we had to wait for a group of other people. I started to get freaked out. I got light-headed and was breathing really heavily. The trip had been so stressful already, I just wanted in the gates. Yes, I had a mini panic attack at Warped tour. I just couldn't take the stress anymore!  12:30 P.M.: The lady walking us back starts talking to this other woman, so we had to wait. Suddenly, I heard Anna say, "ACE!" I turned around... and there he was. The love of my life, with a buzz cut. But, it was the HOTTEST thing ever. He was tan and his jawline was better than ever! He was walking around with Jeff, who also looked mighty fine with spiked hair and a blonde spot on the top of his head. They said hello and stopped to talk to us! Ace grabbed my shoulder and asked me how I was doing. Then he looked at my shirt, an Early November "Hammonton For Life" t-shirt, and then smiled at me. It's hard to explain, but it was like a "thanks for your support, I really appreciate it" kind of smile. (P.S. If he looked at my shirt, he was lookin at my boobs.. gross I know, sorry I stuck that in there). Anna was talking to Ace about something, so I explained our treacherous adventure to Jeff, who dropped his jaw out of astonishment! I was like, "This is all for you, baby!" They said they had to go inside but would talk to us later. We finally got in, but couldn't find the main stages or the band's booths! However, I did find The Matches tent, and I didn't know they were playing! 4:45... I was there, I love them! We talked to the bass player about how much I like them, so that was good. Then it started to pour rain... POUR! Some guy yelled that there was another section. We found Senses Fail performing... and on their last song. DAMNIT. We tried to find the Mae booth, but we couldn't. 1:00 P.M.: Anna went to take pictures during Early November, and I found myself a spot in the crowd. I asked people to move for me, since I'm short. Some guy was like "If you kiss my ass I will" and I said, "I traveled here all the way from Ohio, fuck yeah I'll kiss your ugly ass for a better spot!" Some OBNOXIUOS TEXAN hits my shoulder and points to my John Kerry button and was like, "Not cool" then he makes some gesture I don't get and his Asian ho laughs. So I said, "Well, I AM in Texas, what can I EXPECT from you?! Oh, and by the way, Bush sucks!" FUCKERS. The Early November played so well! They have so much energy and I love their lyrics. It was pouring and I could hardly see through all the crowd surfing. My cartilage piercing was pulled and my head got lodged between a crowd surfer and the barrier for like five seconds. Oh, and somebody fell on my face, not my head, my face. It was painful. My buttons kept coming undone then going straight into my skin. It hurt like a mother. Afterwards we finally found Mae's tent to set up the interview. Then we walked around, I bought the TEN Acoustic CD and a sticker, then we proceeded to see Mae. On the way this kid jumps in front of me and asks me if I was from Jersey (my shirt had a picture of Jersey on it), I told him I was from Ohio, and he goes, "Oh, well I'm from Jersey" and touches my shirt to show me where he lives. By the way, the state so happens to be drawn on my boob. EWW do NOT touch me! Anna stayed in the front to take pictures of Mae the whole time! She even caught Jacob's drumstick-at least something good happened! We talked to John from The Matches as well. He's so funny! Shawn is not very friendly, though. I said, "We saw you guys with FOB" and John was like, "Oh, yeah yeah.". Then I said, "No no, it was with Matchbook Romance!" and he goes, "Oh, yeah yeah.". He was kind of dumb. Anna asked him why they didn't come out after the show, and he goes, "Well we were snorting cocaine in our bus. And by bus, I mean van. And by snorting, I mean drinking water." It was so funny! 3:45 P.M.: We hurried back to see the end of Yellowcard, and by "seeing" I mean just listening to a very bad quality, because you couldn't hear anything. We went back to TEN's tent (by the way, it was bright, neon green and, as Serg put it, looked like, "a huge zit on the top of your nose on the first day of school") to see if they were signing stuff. There was a massive crowd of people, but I saw Anna waving. I jumped up to try and see, and there they were, those eyes. Ace's BEAUTIFUL teal eyes. I was jumping, smiling, and waving, and he smiled back. We got up there and told them good job and all that. Then Ace, Jeff, and Joe signed my Acoustic CD. We talked a little bit and then Ace began to show his muscle. My god, it was HUGE. Some guy took a picture with it. Anna felt it, but I tried to and he wouldn't let me. I was like, "Please, please..." and he kept saying no and shaking his head. Then he pat my head. I feel bad, I was really gross and wet. Anna goes, "She's gonna cry!" and I said, "Hey, we traveled all this way to see you, let me feel your muscle!" and he goes, "Oh, okay!" So I poked it and it was HUGE. We wanted some pictures, so we asked if we could come around and he said yes. We took a couple and talked in between takes. Other fans were getting stuff signed, so we stood behind the boys, and they talked to us in between signing other fan's stuff. We were in there for at least 20 minutes. Let me try and remember some of the good stuff:  Ace: "Hey, who's drumstick is that?!" Anna: "Jacob from Mae's." Allison  to Jeff : "Can I have one of yours?" Jeff: "Sure, hold on...oh but they're all packed in the bus!"  But he was going to give me one.  I was talking to Peaches (the merch guy- not so nice this time either) and trying to buy some stuff. Ace kept putting his hand over my eyes so I couldn't see Peaches, but I kept moving my head to see around his hand and talk to Peaches, but he kept moving his hand with my eyes... num nums.   He was wearing his Epcot hoodie, like always, and I told him I love Epcot and he said he went there in December. I asked his favorite country, and he said Italy. He also said he liked Ohio. And to Joe he goes, "These girls came all the way from Ohio and they're coming back tomorrow!" We weren't, but he's not too bright, so he didn't know. It's okay.  I was digging through my bag looking for something, while I was standing by the boxes of shirts and merch, and Ace turns around and goes, "Are you stealing stuff?!" But it was cute.   I bought a tote of theirs and they all signed it. I asked what he wrote and it said, "Thanks, Ace" and I told him I wanted a note. So he wrote me a note on the back of the bag.  Then later, he looks at me and goes, "Oh, are YOU still here?!" It was funny, though.  He was really sarcastic this time, unlike his usual shyness, but it's not the kind of sarcasm I hate when it's just awkward and you don't know what to say (i.e. Joe from FOB), but he's really just playful and silly.   Jeff was super nice as well. God he's hot. I can't remember all those minutes in the tent, but they were pretty damn good.   We took pictures of Ace's ass.  When we left I ran into this guy who wouldn't let me ditch in front during TEN.  Me: "Oh there's the guy who wouldn't let me stand in front of him during The Early November!" Him: "You wouldn't have let me!"  I go over and stand in front of him  Me: "Do you see how much taller you are than me, you can see over me!"  He starts to shrink down as if he's short and can't see  Then he showed me his autographed Acoustic CD, autographed Senses Fail guitar pic, and all his TBS stuff. We talked a little more. Him:  about TBS  "Yeah, well I had sex with them!" Me: "Yeah, well I had sex with them before you!"  He was funny.  4:30 P.M.: I felt really bad, but I told Anna I had to see The Matches, and she said she could do her Mae interview by herself. So I left and found them. God they were good. I even had a converstion with Shawn from the crowd. He said something about the CD, and I screamed, "I have it!" and he asked who said that, but these girls screamed and I raised my hand and was like, "No... it was me!" then he smiled. They run around a lot when they play, and Shawn ran into John, who looked at him with eyes I've only seen Connie Bowen have when she didn't win every award at US night. Dude... he was pissed. Fortunately, they're playing the whole Warped- so I'll be seeing them again.  5:15 P.M.: I headed back over to the main stage to catch the end of Story of the Year. I looked at some booths by myself then caught Taking Back Sunday at 6. The crowd got pushy and there was an obnoxious girl by me.  6:45 P.M.: I finally found out that Anna was at the SmartPunk stage and caught back up with her. She hadn't done her interview yet, no she had been watching bands with JACOB. I didn't feel bad anymore, since she got to go on a date with her husband, thanks to my needing to see The Matches. We watched Hidden In Plain View, then went back to the Mae tent to do the interview. Then we waited and waited and waited. Finally, Zach goes "Let's just go back to the bus, hopefully Jacob is there!" But I didn't have a pass, so I didn't know if I'd get through. Right as we did get through, however, we saw SERG! I didn't want to go back to the bus anymore, damn Serg is hot as shit. I had been looking for him all day! We got quick pictures, and I asked him to sign my new TEN tote, and he goes, "Oh sure sure, I'll sign it!" But Zack looked like we had to go and he was waiting and I felt bad, so I said I had to go, and Serg was like, "Are you sure, I'll sign it!" It was so weird, he's usually drunk and stoned after shows and is a real jerk, but he was so nice this time! We got on Mae's bus, and Anna tried to do the interview, but her recorder was broken. So we left. Then I saw Jordan Pundik, he's actually a little cuter in person. We waved, but he didn't come over, because as Anna puts it, "It's now their time". It wasn't about us anymore.  9 P.M.: We left for our hotel and crashed, well after driving through traffic to get there.  Sunday, June 27, 2004:  9 A.M.: We got up and left. Now we could pack the car in no time at all. We didn't really talk in the car, the last few days had been crazy and we were mad tired. We did notice that the south names all their places after other foreign countries. Paris Texas, Palestine Texas, Florence Kentucky.. There were some others as well.  5 P.M.: We began to get very slap happy as we neared Nashville. We started talking like gangstas and going crazy. We checked into a really nice hotel, then went to Taco Bell for food. We came home and partied it up in the room by watching  Minority Report . We watched some of  The Secretary  with Maggie Gyllenhal- so fucking weird. Why are those kids always in weird movies? She kept having these freaky images of weird sex things with her boss. So odd.. then she was BUCK NAKED. I wondered if her brother saw it? Eww, I hope not. Anna mentioned that her ribs were sticking out and it looked like another pair of boobs, and I said, "Yeah, it looks like a butterfly!" I think you had to be there. We watched Elimidate til like 2:30 in the morning. Love those sleepovers.  Monday, June 28, 2004:  9:30 A.M.: We were woken by the maid. We decide to head out early and get home.  1 P.M.: We get a few sprinkles (it wouldn't be a day on this trip without rain) and then hit DEAD stopped traffic in Kentucky. We sat there... for an hour. But it was fun. We frolicked in the median and blasted punk music. I went to get a soda out of the cooler, rested it on the car, slammed the trunk, and saw the damage it did to the can. I forgot I had put the can there! I couldn't open it properly. I kicked the mud-flap of this truck, and when I was sitting in the car I heard him growl, "Hey did you kick my mud-flap?" and I said yes, and he growls, "Why'd you do that?" and I replied, "Because I wanted to touch it..." and his ponytail was flying in the wind, it was scary. 7 P.M.: FINALLY we got back to Canal! We dropped our film off at Walmart and then went back to clean her car. We got doubles of the Mae pictures instead of the TEN ones, oops! But they're pretty good and I'm excited to have them! 9 P.M.: My mom and I left for home.  P.S. During the trip we only heard music from these people: Usher, Faith Hill, Hoobastank's "The Reason", Switchfoot's "Meant to Live", and Trapt's "Headstrong". There were some others- damn those tunes got redundant. We also made a list of cities we passed through that celebrities were from. Here it is: Cincinnati-98 degrees Memphis- Elvis and Justin Timberlake Houston- Destiny's Child Dallas- The Simpson sisters Little Rock- Bill Clinton  Overall, the trip was a good time. It was physically and emotionally draining, but the good made it worth it. I will NEVER travel to Texas willingly again. Especially not for a boy, okay maybe for Ace, though most don't think he's that hot, his voice and lyrics and that chiseled jaw make him absolutely BEAUTFUL!   P.P.S. If you thought this was long and hard to read, try sitting here for like three hours writing it. Shut up, you know you enjoyed this. Comment.
