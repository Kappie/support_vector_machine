And not just by the new layout of the "create post" part [well, i haven been blogging lately, so just count it as new, aight?] and also.... also, i can't rmb....    i guess i'll jus crap along until i actually[lik when is that gonna happen?]do.    I've been sick for the past few days and went home halfway thru' school yesterday and took an MC today.    Damn, I just remembered i have library today! damn!!! It might be weird to hear of ppl loving their cca[esp. when its library] so much. Guess its due to the fact that i feel its a slackin' cca. It is, without doubt, a slackin' cca.    guess I'll make it up by going tommorow.    oh, and today is "slack" day too. For ppl not in my class, I'll have to explain a lil': its slack day in LY cuz the only main subject we have for today is science, other periods include, calligraphy, IT, Reading Discussion, PE...   why can't i have chose a better time to get sick? Argh!!!   anyways, i added a few new links to my blog [you can check them out at the "killed." section, but im gonna list it in this post anyway]   its:  urlLink http://punkrockvids.com    and  urlLink http://punkbands.com    and  urlLink http://danradcliffe.com  only  if u have nothin better to do   and  urlLink http://seanbiggerstaff.com   speaking of sean, i just rmb-ed what was the other thing i was stoked about, its was simply becuz he likes blink too. [this is such a lame xcuse for getting stoked....but w/e]   that  urlLink tom felton site  [im telling you the reason why i didn't link it now] scares the shit outta me. The older he grows, he fugly-er [fugly means fucking ugly, so fugly-er means fucking uglier] he becomes.   It's as if that dick ass prophecy about draco malfoy becoming the dark lord [and becoming so fugly, no one recognizes him] is coming true.. excuse while i go hide under my blankie[ -_-" ]. Except the fact that mr. felton is  only  acting as malfoy.   im sorry if i pissed off draco's [or rather, felton's] fans. But it is frickin' true! The reason why I'm not addressing mr. felton as "tom", is becuz i don't wanna spoil tom [delonge]'s name.   I'm really outta line... for you dickies [j/k] reading this, help pray for me to get well soon. and for my uncle too.   pic of this post:    its becuz im sick, that's why it was a tisuue
