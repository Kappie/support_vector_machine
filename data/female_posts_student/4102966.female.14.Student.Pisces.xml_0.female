So yeah, I guess I should tell you about my day. Well today..today.. not much has really happened. I ate alotta crap. Hahaha, that reminds me, Georgia got this icy pole and that was just what it looked like. Hahaha, and icy POLE. hahaha, I really should get a life. Anyway I really DISLIKE *dislike being a toned down version of what i could have said* two particular girls at school. Actually I dislike more, but they're not the one's i'm annoyed at, at the moment. Well these two people, Fujiko, I know I shouldn't say so, but I mean really. I have nothing against them, but it seems they think I'm weird and annoying. And it's not like when you go, haha, you're so weird. It's more of, OMG you're so weird and annoying. *sigh* I really try not to get angry, seeing as that will just satisfy them, but I don't know if I can hold myself back if they say anymore about me. So anyway, I'll talk to you later. I don't know who "you" are but anywho, talk to "you" later. Kimo
