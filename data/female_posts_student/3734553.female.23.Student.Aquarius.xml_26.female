It is a lot nicer than anywhere I've ever lived on my own. I have to buzz people up to my room. At most of my friend's places that were gated, the gates were always open. Here they never are, partially because I live on the edge of the third ward and everytime you leave the building there is someone asking for a handout. The homeless are a lot more forceful here than they are in Austin. There are tons of medical students and doctors living here. It is kinda weird because there are so many porshes parked around the square.  Everyone is so dressed up at all times. I look super sloppy, but I really don't care. It is super hot here compared to how it was in Cleburne. I had forgotten how hot it used to be in College Station during the summer.  There are huge trees and bushes surrounding the complex, and at the bases they are all labeled. Everytime I see those I think of Evan and his obsession with stuff like that. He even sent a leaf in a letter and labeled it on the back of the letter. I talked to his mom, and it seems like he is doing really well.  I'm going to Austin tonight with Krys to see a band. It will be interesting to see if N. has anything to say to me...
