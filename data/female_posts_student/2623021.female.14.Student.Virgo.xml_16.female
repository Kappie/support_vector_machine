I wish they would figure out that it isn't attractive to us! On that note, girls should be less bitchy (I'm not excluding myself from anything I'm saying) we really are nasty towards each other. I don't quite understand it, but it's really retarded.   Gossiping, backstabing, shit talking.   I just wish all of this stuff would just stop!
