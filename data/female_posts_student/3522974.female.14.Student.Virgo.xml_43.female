I spose it is right up there with Legally Blonde and Mean Girls tho. My gosh! You should've seen the cinema! It was like double the size of my vicor-on-sunday room. (i dont know wot that means, that is what they call it). It was miniscule...it didnt help us being late, we had to sit in the first row. Neway, the movie was OK, a bit too mushy. Luke Mably (the prince dude) isnt really that qte...so that takes half of the movie goodness out. Ne way after the movie we had a bite to eat, then went SHOPPING! Dan was lookin' for a jumper, I a wallet, and Rach, well, nothing imparticular. Unfortunatelly Dan didn't find her jumper, but i got my wallet. I have needed one for soooo long! Yay! Wait a sec. Cloat is is screaming out 'MAI SAIIIIIIII!' over msn. Bak, she's one crazy girl. Yeh so now im at home, getting ready to watch James Masters on Rove 2nite! I am so excited, he rules. EVERYONE, WATCH IT! David especially. Neway, i better go watch the OC for Melly. TaTa4now... LOluv, kc.
