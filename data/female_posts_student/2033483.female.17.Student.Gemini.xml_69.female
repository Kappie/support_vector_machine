My chemistry test went alot better than I thought it would and in physics I thought the test was not easy but not too hard either.  The pizza was good in Newspaper...came home at noon thirty.  When I got home I didn't feel like doing anything. However I did end up going through and cleaning some things out.  I ripped up over a years worth of painful memories that were just collecting bad karma.  It was extremely liberating.  In addition to the memories, I ripped up a bunch of notes and through away worksheets that had piled up in my notebooks.  I can't wait until they all go to the dump where they belong! That paragraph sounds extremely bitchy...forgive me.   I'm still not feeling well.  I have a headache.  Damn you headache!  Peace out my homies   P.S. Renae he is soooo hopable!: http://www.lifestylerock.com/mason.jpg http://www.lifestylerock.com/masonsings.jpg
