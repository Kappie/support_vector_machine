There was a lot of small talk this time. I intentionally continued to talk in hopes that something would come up and it did. I told him that since he's never been to the cafe that I'd have to take him one day (yeah I said that!!) and he said that would be fun. And then we just talked about other stuff and I said hey, I'm gonna take initiative and say here is my number call me.... So, we'll see what happens next. He's cute and funny. And he doesn't seem to be a partier. But he said something that made me think he wasn't as conservative as I thought he was. He seems like a good guy. And he think I'm beauTiful. That's not the only reason I like him Robin!! I thought he was cute before that, but then I was like, okay where am I??, there's no way. Who knows, maybe he'll call, maybe he won't. Suck if he didn't, just a little though. I'm happy I did it though.  Well, my brother and I looked at an apartment today. We liked it. The landlord thought we were cool and appreciated us telling him that we had shitty credit. We'll see how that goes. My brother and I both applied to work at Gilligan's. It's attached to Rain. New patio bar with a beach and waterfall. We'll see how that goes too.  I'm really hoping everything works out okay. Not just us getting the job and apartment, but I hope that we are able to maintain everything. I think we will be able to. I'm not being a child right now. I know people are probably thinking that I'm rushing in to this moving thing like I always do. But I'm not. I've been thinking about it for almost a year. I need to do what's right for me. I don't really want to wait until it's safe. I don't want to miss out on this. I don't plan on staying in wisconsin forever. I don't even plan to finish college here. The sooner I'm able to adjust to living on a budget and all that other stuff that comes with being independent the better. I'm going to do this. If I fail miserably I hope everyone who thought that I would feels guilty as shit because this is so not a matter of knowing me and how I am. I just wish I didn't have to ask people to be happy for me.  Back to good.
