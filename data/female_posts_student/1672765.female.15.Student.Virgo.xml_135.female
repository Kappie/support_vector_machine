No. That's so horrible. I've been looking foward to it.  But the cbs website still shows him as a guest on the show tonight and the rest of the week...like planned...so... I don't know. I sure hope he's still on for it!  I'm programming it anyway. If you'd like to see it, it's on CBS at 12:30AM! I'm not staying up for it by any means, ha, but I'm taping it.   Let's see...today was alright. Yeah, it was okay. Monday-ish. One more Monday left! Because we have memorial day off, so only 1! 13 more school days! I think 17 (including weekends) till summer break.  I've never been so not-excited for summer break before. I'm just complacent where I am now. I've just been getting comfortable in this school (yeah, after two years - I adjust slowly to anything, but I eventually do) and I'm happy with the routine of getting up, going to school, coming home, watch the simpsons, eat dinner, take a shower, do my homework, then go to bed. I love order and routine and I've got it. I wake up every morning at 6 something on weekends and on weekdays without my alarm. And I'm not tired. I feel good now.  When summer gets here I'm going to have nothing to do ever. And I'm half way through high school now. That's so scary. Those two years went by fast...I'm scared to graduate even though I'm also so excited. I hear senior year goes by super fast, so really...it's really close... But I still have 3 weeks...I'll try and enjoy them the best I can. I used to hate school so much, but now it's not so bad. I think it's not so bad. And everybody hates school, but why? I mean, I used to but I can't tell you exactly why I hated it, other than the work and stupid stuff but...that's life...school is school...I don't know exactly how to put my feeling into words but...I guess I just accept it...I think I've always accepted things more and quicker than other people.     Music: AFI - Three Reasons   Yeah, still on that AFI kick. Ha.
