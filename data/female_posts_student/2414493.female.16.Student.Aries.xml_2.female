Maybe I don't want to explain word for word, but let's just say that I have wasted my whole entire piano life. I just can't get it together, even for the smallest stupidest thing. I hate myself, i hate myself, i hate myself.  My whole entire week has been crap. I tutored for half an hour and didn't get paid jack, i had to spend so much time in journalism i had to cancel my driving lesson and spend an extra $20, and I don't know where that's going to come from. My week has been totally stolen from me. I couldn't spend Jess's birthday with her. I screwed up on the physio test. I screwed up on piano. I screwed up my whole entire life. I hate it. Why can't I ever do anything right?  I have had barely any time to myself this week. It's not fair--why can't I be normal? Why can't I get my $45 like I'm supposed to? Why can't I start feeling happy about Christmas, which is less than two weeks away? Maybe I'm just being selfish, but this year we have a smaller tree, and it's still unlighted. I have $40 right now for presents and all...some short time ago I had $90. I am going to spend two weeks moping, alone.  I've met one of Enid's friends online, Steve.
