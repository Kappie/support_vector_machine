She turns to me and screeches as if she's in pain. Her eye balls fall to the floor and roll to my feet. They look at me with their large black pupils still blinking. I hear two male voices that seem to come from the eyes. They whisper my name and tell me I should come with them. I can't talk I can't move I'm stuck in this place with this sight in front of me. Soon they say I will be theirs'.
