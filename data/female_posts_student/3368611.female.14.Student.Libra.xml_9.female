If you've been tuning in lately(and I sincerely hope you have been), you know about Jason. :) Well, I was on the telephone yesterday with SqueekerZ aka NeurotiK aka BranderZ and I'm like "I should call Jason" and she goes "You can't do three-way calling" (if I do 3-way, no outside phone calls can come through) and I'm like, "Yeah, but if I could, I'd call him", so she goes "Well, if you called Tanya, she'd do it" and it was then that I realized... I'm scared to call him (see yesterday's post, "Pimpaliciously Yours, SmOokie").  In the end, with much advice from Jaynina and Fontaine, I've decided that I'm going to call Jason on Thursday or tomorrow and ask if he wants to go to the movies. Davia might not go, so this is working out BEAUTIFUL. I mean, Davia is real cool and all and she's one of my best friends, but it'd be awkward if it was all three of us and we're all from different settings. Anyway, I'm thinking of going to see "The Garfield Movie" or "Shrek 2" or maybe "The Day After Tomorrow". Fontaine said to go see "The Day After Tomorrow" cuz it's good, but it's all up to what Jason and I decide to go see. I'm hoping that he'll want to see one of the funny movies cuz it'd be more fun for me, but it's okay if we go see "The Day After Tomorrow" because then I can hug onto him on the scary parts. Heehee. One problem, though : MY DAD. He said that if I go to the movies with Jason, that Jason has to come to the house and pick me up AT OUR DOOR. Ugh. Only my dad.
