I just don't have that Christmas feeling yet.  Hopefully, tomorrow it will come.  If not, then I guess it never will.  Part of it is surely the weather.  It is very warm here.  Today it was colder, but it was also rainy, which is enough to bring out the "Bah, humbug" in anyone when you are out in it going from store to store.  I think I was actually pretty creative with the gifts this year, which is good.  Normally I am at a loss for things to buy.  Perhaps seeing the happy looks on the faces of those who I have bought for will do it for me.  This is always my favorite part of Christmas; it is the one way in which I am un-selfish.  Speaking of self destructive behavior...the eating continued today.  I felt so sick after my Coke Float that I had to lie down.  I am straining to fit in my jeans.  This is truly what Christmas means to be right now...No wonder I'm a little down...Now I'm off to eat some more...
