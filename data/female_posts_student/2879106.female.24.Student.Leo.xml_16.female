Well now today they all said that they got e-mails saying that someone submitted a testimonial, but when they signed on there wasn't anything there. I am starting to hate that site. I was up all night and now I have nothing to show for it. Damn it!!  Nothing much has happened other than the fact that Me and Alek are doing great. I was a little concerned but I am pretty sure that things are good now. He got a tattoo today for his birthday. Happy Happy Joy Joy!!! I now have an inked out boyfriend. I am so excited to see it. I should be going over there in just a bit, but I want to finish writing this first.  Well lastly I want to keep you updated on my trip plans. We are going to have to change the date of our New Orleans trip to spring break. Granted that is far away but we will be there during Marti Gras and that will be so much fun!!! Also me and Nicole talked last night and I think our Europe trip plans are coming together. We should be going not this next summer but the summer after that. I think it will be my graduation present to myself. Lastly, Me and Nicole also talked about moving in together. We are going to look at some apartments down on second. OH BABY!!! Those apartments are so unique and great. I hope everything works out. We should be getting our plans together for that real soon. I will keep you updated as more info becomes available.
