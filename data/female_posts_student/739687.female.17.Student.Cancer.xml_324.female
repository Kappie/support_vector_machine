Can't wait till summer. Can't wait till summer.  Really. I can't.  I love the summer, because it is FREAKING AWESOME.  So happy YAY!  Haha I feel gay and retarded.  TAKS was today...which totally blows but my essay totally ROCKED DUDES. No really, it was quite good. It gave ME butterflies...and I wrote the damn thing. I think the beginning and the ending tie was really freaking powerful.  Okay, I'll talk later....I have homework to do.  Awwwwwchayeah crazies.
