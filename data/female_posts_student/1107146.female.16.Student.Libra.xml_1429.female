Too make thing seven better, we just found out that if she had missed her doctor's appointment and gone on the cruise, she would have died, not could haven, but most probably would have died because it would have broken loose and gone straight to her heart.  And if it breaks loose now, which it shouldn't, knock on wood, she could die.  So I'm in a lovely situation here.  I played my piano for hours tonight, and I don't think I've quit crying yet.  I was a week away from not having a mommy anymore...
