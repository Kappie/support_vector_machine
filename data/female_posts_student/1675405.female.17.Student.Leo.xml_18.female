I hate that class, I know I should drop it, but I won't because Dr. Patterson would be disapointed in me. I am honestly not too worried about the big test, but rather passing the class. That's my priority.   Edgewood Band Night is tonight in Ashtabula. Joy. I honestly hope it is somewhat fun. I am really tired of band not being fun. It's aggravating, everything has been really aggravating recently, but I guess that is a big part of being a teenage girl, I guess, now isn't it? I guess everything is so hard to swallow, especially when it is all going on at once.
