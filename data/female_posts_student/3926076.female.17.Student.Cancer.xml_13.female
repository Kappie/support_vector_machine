I’m a bum. Anyway..        Sunday, July 4, 2004      This was probably one of the worst fourth of Julys for me, ever. Things went okay in the morning, but by evening, meh.       I got to sleep in until 8:00ish. Then we headed off to Grandma’s for breakfast. My grandpa makes the best pancakes. Yum. In fact, he makes yummy everything. So we finished up there around 10:30 and headed off to church. We went to church in Beardstown (about an hour away) because they have a high Hispanic population there and offer a mass completely in Spanish! And with me being catholic and having a massive obsession with Spanish, that was insanely exciting.     We got there 25 minutes early because we had allowed time for getting lost and any other delays since we weren’t positive where we were going. The church was completely empty except for the woman making her way up to the altar on her knees like people often do in Mexico City at the Cathedral. My parents must have thought she was nuts but I briefly explained that it’s not insanely abnormal. So, we’ve been sitting there for twenty minutes, it’s now five minutes till mass starts, and there are only about 6 other people there. It was insanely empty. I couldn’t figure out why they’d even offer a mass in Spanish if there was such a low turn out. So, now it’s noon, and time for church to start. And a few more families have shown up, but it’s still almost completely empty. And within the next five minutes, the church was filled and there were at least twenty some people standing in the back, as well. It was insane. So mass starts, and the priest is speaking in English. Turns out, he was standing in for the usual priest. Just my luck. We drive an hour and he speaks English. If I wanted that I could have driving the 4 minutes to Riverton. In short, mass turned out to be very interesting. The priest led everything in English and then they’d all be saying stuff in Spanish. It was a mess.     On top of that, my family and I felt a bit out of place. We were the only non-Hispanic family there. We knew that we would be, but it was still weird. Some of them looked at us like they didn’t want us there, but others were very welcoming. So, I intend to go back on Sunday. I think once they kinda get to know me, they’ll think it’s neat. I’m just so insanely interested in their culture, and on top of that, working on my speaking and listening skills. I had read just fine. I can write pretty well. But when it comes to listening, it’s different. I have no problem listening to Senora, but my gosh, the people at church spoke so quickly! I’d really like to get used to listening at a fast pace.     So, following church, we went by dad’s friend, Leslie’s house to meet her. She was about to leave for an ice cream social and invited us to come along. So we went. It was at this new park they had just finished. It was really nice. The grass was all pretty and they had just put up a boardwalk by the river, and there was a barbershop quartet of women singing. It was pretty neat. Just super duper hot. Well, the quartet came over to sing near our table and Leslie had to embarrass me and tell them that I sing. So then they were trying to talk me into joining this group in Springfield. Not likely. So then, one started to tell me about a barbershop festival in October. Turns out it was the one we went to with Mrs. Finley last year. And it also turned out, she was the one that led my section. Odd.     Well, we had planned on watching a raft race on the boardwalk, but mom and I ended up being big babies and whining that it was too hot out. So we started to head home, but on the way made a stop at a Hispanic grocery store! I didn’t get much. Just a magazine, newspaper, and some Jarritos (this amazing Mexican drink that Wal*Mart stopped carrying).     So, that was about the extent of my excitement for the day. I did practically nothing to celebrate the Fourth. I went to Sam’s with M  D, but that was about it. I sat on the roof, alone, to watch fireworks, but by the time they started, I was being eaten alive by mosquitoes and have 7 or 8 bites already. So I called it quits and moped around feeling lonely. Whenever everyone left Doug’s he called me and cheered me right up, though!        Monday, July 5, 2004      Monday, we didn’t do anything too exciting, as far as I can remember. We went over to Jim and Charla’s for a Fourth party. We ended up playing cards with Charla’s Grandma, Mom, and Stepdad (I think) for like, an hour. It was fun though. A game called Fruit Salad.     I drove separately so that I could go get myself some summer clothes after the party. I DESPISE shopping, but somehow, was in a shopping mood. (Plus, I need a new one piece). It was quite odd. So, I went over to Old Navy, Gordman’s, and Sportsmart. The last two had one pieces, but none under like... the size of 8... and I need a 2 or so? So that worked out well. I got a beach mat and a new purse at old navy though! Then, I headed out to the mall where I spent another two or so hours. Bought lots of stuff, and everything was on sale! If I had gotten everything at its original price, it would have been $140. I got everything for $73.74! Six shirts, a purse, and a beach mat! I’d say I did pretty well!     I think that’s all I did on Monday. *shrug.* I really need to write daily. Oh! I had an appointment in the morning! I knew I did something else! Nothing exciting happened.        Tuesday, July 6, 2004      Back to babysitting. But Tuesday was fun! They got a new kitty and she is absolutely adorable! Her name is Star. The kids were both asleep when I got there… the kitty kept me company. We ended up taking a nap on the couch together for like, a half an hour. She’s too cute.      urlLink        I almost got roped into picking up Miranda and her friends from the mall. She and three other girls wanted to go out and shop. I drive a Taurus. It comfortably seats 4, but it’s possible to seat six. And that’s what we would have been doing. Driving four twelve year olds, Kyle, and me. Not good. Luckily, it fell through.     So, we just kind of hung out all day and played with the kitty. Kyle and I had planned to go to ice deli, but then a friend came over and asked if Kyle would come out and play. And then Kyle forgot about his plans with me. Amanda picked up Miranda at three and then the boys came back home and I watched them swim with the kitten in my lap. It was exciting. No… not at all. Also, I turned my application in at Sam’s Too, a nearby pizza place that the entire population at Williamsville and Sherman works at and I’ve been eating/visiting there several times a week! So after I visit Doug, chances are, I’ll be starting there.     Hm... other than that, nothing too exciting happened Tuesday either. Doug kept me up on the phone really late though! That silly Douggie.        Wednesday, July 7, 2004      Both the kids were asleep when I got there again. Theresa asked if I’d be able to dog/cat sit while over the weekend or so while they were gone to New Orleans(which Kyle keeps calling Los Angeles and Miranda thought was in Pennsylvania). So now I’m doing that. Otherwise, nothing exciting happened. We ate at pizza hut for lunch. Their breadsticks are amazing. The waiter remembered us from last time. He’s a really nice guy. Miranda and I laid out and she put lemon juice in her hair. Every four minutes, she asked if her hair was blonder and if she was tanner. And Kyle was out there with us coloring. But he stormed off cuz he got his picture wet. Like it was our fault. Eh. That sums things up.     Oh! But I did download Firefox! It’s a wonderful little browser than RC introduced me to. And I recommend it. Lots.     I treated my mommy to dinner. Originally, we were going to cracker barrel, but ended up deciding right before the exit to go to cheddars. ‘Twas yummy. Someday I’ll be able to eat everything on my plate.     Um… what else? Oh. Grandma broke both of her legs. Yay. And is probably going to a nursing home. Even bigger yay.        Thursday, July 8, 2004      Today Doug called me a little after 8 on my cell phone. And asked why I wasn’t babysitting. He knew for almost two weeks why I wouldn’t be there. What a silly head. I went back to sleep though. And it was nice to hear a good morning from him. It’s less than a month til I head off to the good ol’ PA. Yeahhhh, Wawa and Genuardis!     I’m way excited about my trip. Not only do I get to see my Doug, but we’re staying in NYC for two days (hopefully with Jaclyn [who finished her zine! Yaaayyy!] or I may die!), possibly beach-ing with Jaclyn, as well. Plus, I’m really excited about hanging out with Brittany and Courtney. It’ll be nice to have some female friends to make me less of a nervous wreck while I’m there! Not quite sure why I’m so intimidated by his parents. Oh, and what’s even better… I’m roast marshmallows with none other than the Ryan Clemens! Woo! He doesn’t know it yet, but we might camp out in their back yard as well! AND Doug is planning a pool party while I’m there. It’s bound to be a good time. Hopefully not as busy as his week here!     So, I’ve not done much today. I went to ice deli and that’s about it. I just wasn’t feeling very productive today… but tomorrow’s another day. Hopefully I’ll get back into the habit of posting daily!        3 Lydia
