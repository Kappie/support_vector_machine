I heard about the cool breeze, in the cool nights, and the cool guys that you spent them with. Well I guess I should have heard of them from you. I guess I should have heard of them from you.  Don't you see, don't you see, that the charade is over? And all the "Best Deceptions" and "Clever Cover Story" awards go to you. So kiss me hard 'cause this will be the last time that I let you. You will be back someday and this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service to keeping you away.  I heard about your regrets. I heard that you were feeling sorry. I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us. Well I guess I should have heard of them from you. I guess I should have heard of them from you.  I'm waiting for blood to flow to my fingers, I'll be all right when my hands get warm. Ignoring the phone, I'd rather say nothing. I'd rather you'd never heard my voice. too late to be gracious and you do not warrant long good-byes. You're calling too late.
