Seriously, I was fairly skeptical going in I wasn’t sure if it would be outrageously bias or not, but I really don’t think it was.  Michael Moore stated the facts, and showed authentic footage.  Sure he slanted it artistically, but you have to with your own art work.  I think it is a film everyone should see, it sure made me have even more doubt in our government. So much BS goes on its not even funny.  They’re not even that good at covering it up!  Man, first ‘JFK’ and now this.  There were times watching that film when I wanted to scream my head off with rage, and times when it was so awful tears flowed.  It is incredible what some people will do for money.  Gah.  Theres so much, just see the film.  I’m down with the sibs watching ‘Aliens’ its good.  Blah.  Super fun Friday night.  I was going to be riding roller coasters with Zach in Des Moines today, but the boy’s drivers ed got rescheduled and he had to skip the party.  Bummer.  Well thats what I get for having a guy friend who is just shy of 16.  Dang it.
