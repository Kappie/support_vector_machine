GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR the 20th is one month... and i am workin and i work the next day and i have mandatory band practice the next and i leave the next...... i am MAD!!!!! i am gonna cry.... i miss him... i hope he gets home soon... but i am also sleepy..... YAWN!!!!! we went and shot pool today with courtney and amamnda.... and yesterday... he spent 3 hours at band practice with me.... but it worked out cuz we went out after practice and got pizza and went back to Amanda's.... the only thing i really can complain about is the fact that courtney and lenny broke up again.... grrr.... i am sick of those stories.... i think mom and i are going shopping tomorrow..... which is good because i need some new clothes.... it is finally spring too i think, so it is pretty good timing! i am gonna wait for brian now... good night!!!
