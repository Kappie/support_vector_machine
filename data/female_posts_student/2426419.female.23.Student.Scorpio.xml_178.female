What is this stigma with growing old? I like low-rise jeans, even though the government in Louisiana has it out for us, I like being in my 20s and knowing about world news (except I wish I were hearing more about Mother Theresa's bringing peace and what good people are doing to change the world into a more educated, passionate, harmonious place than about the negative outcomes of the war in Iraq and gay marriages - please tell me if you are getting any other news stories that do not center around these two topics). I like NPR, PRI, and reading used books. Thrift stores (because pants can hold many stories) and bible studies and the gym.   I'm bored. I might take a shower or see wheat it feels like outside or wake Delisa up or read a little William Golding. That man is a genius with thought and word. I might read the Bible.
