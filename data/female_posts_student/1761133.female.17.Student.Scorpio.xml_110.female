Today will see a surge in energy that will greatly increase your creativity and physical strength. Seize the opportunity to get out into the fresh air for a sports activity, or even just a long walk. Engaging in exercise can direct your physical energy, plus give your mind a chance to clear. Don't be surprised if you discover clarity and focus afterward. Make the most of this.  I got fresh air today...I walked home. That was pretty long and my feet HURT. OWWY!!
