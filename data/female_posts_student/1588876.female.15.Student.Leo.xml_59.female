THAT'S 7 FUCKIN' HOURS!!! no way. besides, i have some personal business to attend to. i gotta get the stink outta my sweatshirt. good thing i didnt lean on anything last night. i would have left looking like Yetti or something.  anyhoo...about the hair coloring. i want it to really set in- not like how my mom only let me set for 10 minutes. there was barely any change there. so yeah. i want my whole head just really fuckin' saturated in it. its this light auburn-blonde-ish color. its fuckin awesome. cant wait to try it.  i just realized how much i like to use the f-word. i also just realized how lame it sounds to say "f-word" instead of just saying the f-word plain and simple.  i write more later, no? you pretty like-a your ma  ma!
