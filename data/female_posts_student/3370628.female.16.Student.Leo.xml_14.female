Taylor-- sent picture of self with new arm bracers and no shirt. Kira-- got first turned on (as always) by his hotness, then depressed by her lack of hotness.  I think that says it all, actually. -_-;  More to the effect of the entry title there... FlamesOfLoss (11:31:34 PM): Just..general negativity...I know he wants to be friends forever, but will he/why would he consider me a girlfriend when/if the circumstances with distance do change... FlamesOfLoss (11:31:56 PM): And why does that matter so much.. Why can't I just be happy to have him as a friend.. WhiteDragon1330 (11:32:36 PM): *smiles* Because he loves you... Anything he'd do for you would be because he loves you. It's as simple as that.  FlamesOfLoss (11:36:45 PM): *smiles a little* WhiteDragon1330 (11:37:27 PM): *gnaws lightly on you and smiles* That's why most guys do things that confuse the girls that care about them. There is no rhyme or reason to love. It just is.  Hneh. Y'know. A few months ago, our positions were almost exactly reversed. DL was the one having doubts, and I was the one giving guy advice. *sweatdrop*
