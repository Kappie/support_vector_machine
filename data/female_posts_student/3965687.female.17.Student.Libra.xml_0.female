I've heard it from everyone..."Aren' t you getting a little close, Axe?" and "That's a little unprofessional, don't you think, Axe?"  They won't come out and say,"Axyl, you're a friggin' idiot" the way I would have by now, were I in their position(s). And it's amusing as well...divine irony, as it were. I have thought him attractive since I first encountered him; I was amused and intrigued by his intellectual capacity, and enjoy speaking with him. But the night before last, I realized that I like him on a more personal level. I was looking at a picture of him and smiling...this is insane. I don't understand. I don't intend to let him know...of course, in that case it's a little silly of me to post this, but whatever. I don't believe he reads these anyway.   *sigh*                                                                                      Axyl
