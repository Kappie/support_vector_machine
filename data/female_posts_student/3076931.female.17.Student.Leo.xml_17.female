I want to go so bad because I haven't been back since I was 8 and I want to see my family, but also I feel as though I'm missing out on a huge chunk of my summer.  But then again, what would I miss out on? Who all I would hang out with...since I really don't have a true definite group anymore...just sparatic friends. Who I will miss greatly. I hope they don't forget me while I'm gone. So maybe this trip is for the better. Or maybe not. I can't make up my mind. Oh well I'm going and that's that. Nothing is going to change about that.   Enough on India! BAH! So school is over..pretty much..I only have to take one final. SO that is pretty exciting. Seniors next year. Wow. I still feel like I'm 14. I really feel like I'm stuck at 14. But that was almost 4 years ago. wooooo time flies. It's kinda sad seein how all the seniors are parting and I just keep thinking that that's gonna be me next year. SCARY! I still remember the first day of 9th grade like it was yesterday. I wore my short denim skirt and my three quarter length navy and yellow striped polo shirt. How weird that I remember that...  High school has been an amazing experience. I mean sure it had it's shitty points and it had its awesome points..but overall it's been awesome. I really have learned so much..about myself..about people...and about life. It's gonna be a little sad next year leaving all of those memories behind.   wow..i'm not even a senior yet....haha
