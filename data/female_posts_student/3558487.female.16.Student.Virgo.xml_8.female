After camp i went shopping with my sister which was also fun just cuz shopping is always fun, and my sister is fun as well. I got some clothes and i'm excited to wear them! haha... then i went to get gas.   It seems like gas stations make me really dumb because i always do something wrong when i'm there. Usually, i just drive away w/ my tank still open and people give me strange looks. Today, on the other hand, I must have forgotten which side my gas tank was on or something because i pulled in (very nicely) and got out and put my card in, and then realized that my gas tank is on the other side. So, i have to cancel everything and drive around in circles until i could get my car in the right position again beside a different pump. People did look at me kind of funny, but oh well. I don't really like getting gas.  Oh yes.. i also watched "Made" where that 'popular' cheerleader girl tries to become a skateboarder. It was interesting, but she was talking about how she didn't want to be popular anymore and would much rather be "a band nerd or something like that" and only have a few close friends. And i'm thinking... hrmm.. i'm in band, does that only mean i'm allowed a few close friends cuz i sure hope not. I think i have a few more than 3 good friends. Oh well...   Goodbye everyone, and thanks leah for your nice comments!   -Lisa  Song: "Mr. Blue Sky" - Electric Light Orchestra
