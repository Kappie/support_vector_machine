I ran the Seattle FireCracker 5000 at 11:55 p.m. on the 3rd.  It was wicked awesome running so late.  My time sucked but I loved passing the oogles of hot guys that were there.   Last night I went to a party which consisted of the boys blowing up things and the girls stuffing themselves and going through the yearbook pointing out who we hate.  Girls are evil to each other.  Not much else... 6 days till WP  I am soooo excited! Peace, Katie
