We swam for a while, having a pretty good time, but there was something that was making me a little edgy.  There was this guy, I’m not sure how old he was, but I felt like he was watching me.  He had black hair, very tan skin, a little ethnic looking, quite attractive actually, and he was with another guy (with blonde hair) and a girl.  Of course, without my glasses I wasn’t for sure so I tried to brush it off.  Then Emily and I rested by a wall for a couple of minutes and I heard what they were talking about.  “Why don’t you just ask her?” said the boy with the blonde hair, “Just do it man!”  They talked about me for like 15 minutes then the blonde boy swam over.  “How old are you?”  he asked, “Um, 17.” I said.  “K, cool.” And back he went to the group of three.  About 5 minutes later the girl came over.   “Okay, you see that guy over there?” “Yeah.” “Well, do you like him?  Because he likes you and wants to know.” “Um, well I don’t really know him…whats he want to know?  If I think hes hot or something?  Because to be honest, I wear glasses and I haven’t really been able to get a good look at him. Oh….(She looked surprised that I didn’t answer with a simple ‘yes or no’)  “So what should I tell him.” “I don’t know…tell him that sure hes cute, thank him for liking me, and whatever…” “Alright…”  My gosh!  It was so hard to keep a straight face!  I mean I am going to be an adult in less then a year, but I was being asked if “I liked this guy I had never met before because he likes me.”  *LAUGHS*  So they watch me some more, I hear.  “Just go ask her man!  Do it!  Look at her hair!  No man, that’s got to be a perm.  If you like her just do it!  Aw look guy, shes right THERE, go!”  So they went on and on….  Emily and I got out and toweled off.  I put on my glasses and there he was, smiling at me, grinning actually, and then shyly waved.  I waved back and he freaked.  Em and I went into the lockeroom to get some more sunscreen, and he yelled “Are you LEAVING????”  I shook my head and went through the door.  When we came back out he loked so happy, waved again and started showing off on the diving boards.  He was really good, back flips, awesome dives, the whole deal.  Then the pool closed, and he said ‘bye’ and ran to the lockers.    SO YEAH.  I never really talked to the guy, but I will the next time I see him, just to let him know whats going on, so he can relax a litle. It was too funny, sigh, a little flattering to be honest.  So yeah, that was the pool today.
