"That's when I knew, That I could never have you,   I knew that before you did,   Still I'm the one who's stupid,   And there's this burning, Like there's always been,   I've never been so alone, And I've never been so alive. "                                                               THIRD EYE BLIND-MOTORCYCLE DRIVE BY  Are you ever afraid.. afraid that each day of ur life is going to be the same.. and that is consists of all the shit that u do now that u never wana do again..  Arent you ever scared that your life may get worst with time.. and eventually turn into some kind of living hell..  Arent you ever scared that your life will be the life your parents live rite now.. Aren't you ever afraid of life ?   F.E.A.R. ... everytime we hear the word fear we get scared and we despise it because ive always said that fear is the one and only thing that holds us back from everything we do. Without it alot more would be suceeded.. But aren't alot of us afriad to die, afriad to kill.. if you think about it Fear keeps us going.. it keeps us lving and without it.. this world wud be a different place.. and we wud already be in hell.   Chick Idols : Brody Dalle from the Distillers and Amy Lee from Evanescence. simply coz theyre such godo song writers and have a good band.. altho i dont really liek evanescence's music..   "I've been looking in the mirror for so long. That I've come to believe my soul's on the other side. All the little pieces falling, shatter. Shards of me, To sharp to put back together. To small to matter, But big enough to cut me into so many little pieces. If I try to touch her, And I bleed, I bleed, And I breathe, I breathe no more." -Evanescence - Breath No More  "My one heart felt too much from the start Ive seen people come and go Living large and living low You can build up your walls sitting on death row Let the curtain fall on your murdered soul You can wash it all down swallow your story Get smacked off your head go down in drumroll glory You wont solve it committing self inflicted crime Go on pull the trigger this will be the last time The Distillers- Young Crazed Peeling  Thats enough lyrics for now.. bet U can't write better.    Wudnt it be cool to be famous... i always thot it would.. they always say its not about the money.. but i think it IS about the money..   Rite now.. i must say Life is Good Life is Good..
