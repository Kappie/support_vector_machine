Okay, so I have had a pretty hard time of it lately.  School is keeping me very, very busy!  I just started a new math class that’s just killing me right now.  I don’t think I know enough to be in this class and it’s already a pretty meager class as it is. I just feel so damn dumb sometimes.  So school is eating me alive, which really hurts!  Otherwise reading is keeping me pretty busy.  I am working on the eleventh book in the series I’m reading and its getting so interesting.    I guess I have this weird thing.  When I finish a book I feel both pleased the I finished it and a little sad that its over.  I try to tell myself that its stupid to feel that way but I just cannot seem to help it!  So now I am half done with the last book in an eleven book series and I’m not sure how I feel about finishing it. I mean that’s not really an option for me, I will finish it of course.  Still the next book doesn’t come out until October and I am not sure I can wait!    Its sad and depressing, I know…I’m pathetic.  Guess I’ll start reading Wheel of Time again!  Okay, so better run.  I’ll come up with a really interesting topic soon, hopefully.    ~ Kristyn
