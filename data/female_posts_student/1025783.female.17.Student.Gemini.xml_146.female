Valedictorian, graduated Stanford in three years and now anal as hell. So my foil and my foe is related to me- ironic. Luckily she's 9 years older (big age difference because I was adopted) and is the homeowner of some overly expensive apartment in San Fran with her husband who is brain blessed as well. As my parents and sister left for "quality bonding time" I decided to fake a headache and procrastinate packing. I leave for Kansas tomorrow, you know that state that's flat and Dorothy rocks out with that little dog, Frodo or Kiki or something. I'm going to visit relatives, which will actually be fun because I'm sandwiched in age between my two closest cousins- cool cats all around. All I can say is, farm boys + single Cali girl = ....good times
