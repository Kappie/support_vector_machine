I met people who I thought were my friends...unfortunately I went for over a year being the only non-bitch *I hope*. I remember being sneered at if I talked to certain ppl so I thought um k. I talked to them anywayz. I swear, they're communists. But then 8th grade rolled around. I was separated from all of my "good friends" w/ some 8A exceptions. I think that was fate...I was supposed to be separated from them. And that led to more things. Soon I was being emotionally abused more than anyone can ever possibly know...not even you. But I was able to be open w/you. We ended up talking everyday about our usual nonsense and other shit. Sharing our depressedness. Then IT all happened and I switched groups. Bitchy popularity to comfy popularity. It was a blessing in disguise. I became closer to you n the rest of our ppl...I think the connection was made when you told the few of us @ Angie's Halloween party what you were really going through the previous years, I felt that I was meant to be there. Did I turn tables? Because I feel like I did, as conceited as that sounds, in at least a small way. It was because of God's will that I was supposed to meet some really awesome ppl. And I'm glad that I could talk to you at a certain level. I couldn't even tell my 'sister' Heather, who I've known since I was 5, any of that stuff. Then when we were pretty much at the core of our awesomeness, you moved to Highland and now the only way we communicate is through the internet. But I think we've gotten closer. We tell each other everything, well, I tell you everything. So you're there in spirit cause you hear about it eventually lol. I don't even talk to my dad this much. Hell, I don't talk to anyone this much. Maybe it's a good thing that we're obsessed w/ our computers and don't really have lives anymore. Maybe I was born on August 15 and I'm your twin and we were separated at birth and they changed my birthday so we wouldn't figure it out or something lol...Even though we've only known each other for um...erm...3 years, I feel that we've known each other for a lifetime. Promise me that we'll always be friends and each other's half!!!!!!! Forever and ever and ever! *get's girly* like omagosh. You're in my wedding...fo sho...I HEART U DUDE! And since I don't want you to get a big head and all gushy, I'm finished.  ps. seriously, we should alter all the sspp yearbooks and put me in em lol...
