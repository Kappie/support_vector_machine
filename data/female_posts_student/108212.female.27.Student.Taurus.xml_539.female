I saw an interview - some of their best bits came out of budget necessities, including the coconuts (which begat the air-speed-of-a-fully-laden-swallow bit, which saved the bridgekeeper bit...).  Anyhow, I could have just edited my last post, but the Grail deserves its own space.  Funniest damned thing I've ever seen.  Daf
