I guess you guys weren't there.  After that we drove over to Billy's thinking that you guys would be there but no dice.  Then we drove down a random street and ended up over kinda by the Capitol Expressway Auto Mall.  Then we went back to Jason's house, and that's where the screwing began.  We were eating grapes and popcorn and were under Jason's screen names and we started messing with Val and now lets just say that we are profusely apoligizing to Val.  Note to others: If you ever want to mess with someone on line, stray away from Val. (Sorry again Val)  So we did that for like 2 hours.  I almost fell asleep on his floor.::Sigh::  Then we went home.  Fun filled but atleast we almost didn't get arrested ::cough, Ryan, cough::  Oh, but early that night Jason did roll through a stop sign with a police car right behind him.  Sadly, he wasn't pulled over.  That would have made it a night to remember.  Two run-ins witht he po-lice for some of you guys.  Fuck the po-lice and all that ass-gouda.  Damn millenium project.  It should die, die and go to hell.  On a slightly senile note: remember that Dolphin's Cry song from hella days ago?  I'm so hella listening to it now.  F that S and ass-cheese on both sides of the bagle good night!
