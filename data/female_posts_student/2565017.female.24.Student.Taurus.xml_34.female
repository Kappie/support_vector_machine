The Clothes of Mourn by Timo Rautiainen and Trio Niskalaukaus (=trio shot in the neck) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  I do not wish to carry grief But I don't know how I could, in the middle all the misery see somehow differently  When the great men of our nations In their great action keep stumbling in the dark the chaos right behind them  The positive clowns cherish their ideas as good while living like devils This is why I dress in black  When our world that belongs to everyone is nothing but imagination I dress in the clothes of mourn and the clothes of mourn are black  If I were to see  more justice in this world I would happily wear snow white clothes  But if the world keeps continuing to travel the dark journey I dress in the clothes of mourn and the clothes of mourn are black  It hardly makes me laugh or lifts my spirits up when everything starts from crying and everything ends to crying  When whole nations follow The Beast in their actions This is why I dress in black The clothes of mourn are black
