If it was the day before school started, could have been a bad thing to wait on you) "And maybe Liz, when she gets home from wherever she is... Need to do it within the next weekish though."  Anyway, that's not the point...   Rosie : of course, I'm always right.  But I hope I'm not right in this case.  Hopefully everything will work out.  Hope it doesn't turn out like Ben or Xi.    Josh  : ha!  I made your name bold and italisized to make up for rosie's wrongdoing   Will AND Josh AND Liz :  Next Monday or Wednesday or Thursday are great days for me.  I know on Tuesday and Friday, both me and Liz, and maybe Will have mentoring.  What's best for yall?     Scott :  didn't want you to be left out, so hey, how's life?  Haven't talked to you in  forever  (right..)  Went shopping, bought hangers, thought you'd be impressed.  I also bought a lot of new clothes, so I may need more hangers now, though...  Am I leaving anyone out?  Don't think so...  At least, that's here...   *sob* I MISS ABBY!!! *sob*
