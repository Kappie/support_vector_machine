TORN ............................................................................................................. .......................................................................... Unsure ............................................................................................................  oh dang...boys are so much trouble....    "A heart is not a play thing, a heart is not a toy, but if you want it broken, just give it to a boy"    true...very true...its happening rite now....    "A bonfire needs only a spark..."    TRANSLATION: love needs only a little spark to get started  I've been deep in thought since Friday evening...for a good reason too...but I can't tell anyone! *Cries* its not that I don't want to...I Just...can't...especially certain people, because I know how they'll react...  o dang...that reminds me....I got mad at Zack today....I shouldn't have...but I did...now I feel really guilty....:(  Is this all real? All this that is happenin? I wish I could go back in time and fix it...Really bad....Fix it really really bad...   I better get my priorities straight before I do something wrong...or liek the wrong person or something...it's all a fumble in my head rite now...   "You can't control who your heart likes."    In a way you can...but right now...I can't...  I wish I could tell people, especially you Zack...I really wish I could...but this is something I just can't....Later on I might be able to, but I can't right now...and Zack...I'm really sorry earlier..I just care...The same reason I get mad at everyone for that...and it's also linked to my brother too....just..things he did, and things my friends do...I don't want things like that to happen again, I don't want anyone to get hurt. I care...for everyone.... for     ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS   ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS    ALL MY FRIENDS   My friends are all the matter.
