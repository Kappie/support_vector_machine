He made me some opal earrings when I was a little kid, they are so gorgeous. He has land down in Mazatlan and I wanted to go there for spring break but we went to Ashland instead. Ha-ha.      Anyway, that's about the extent of what I have to write about. I hung around the house while Mom took Christopher to Mitchell to look at the private school there. If he's accepted he'll only be home on the weekends :D oh that would be great. Our relationship would be about 10x better, that's for sure. Almost like I've gone off to college. Soooo...I hate my family though. They're a bunch of pissy bitches. Fucking hell.      I have dentist tomorrow. I'm scared. I hate the dentist.
