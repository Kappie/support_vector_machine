I went to Nikki's birthday party, that was fun except for the imbreeder stories (I suppose it did make it interesting though), and Cowboy camps they are basically all going to. I forgot that Hailey Norton actually can be nice if she wants. I was kind of depressed though because I had a smi-sad conversation with Sarah about friendship and life. I mean, it wasn't bad but it was depressing, somewhat. Then I'm nervous, like a mofo over absolutly  nothing ! My mind is always racing, except when I count before I go to bed. It's kind of a ritual I've developed when I can't focus on falling asleep. I just lay there and count...it gets my mind to relax. (that was a little bit random)I'll be nervous the rest of my lifethough, I swear. I just want things to be like they were in 1oth grade. Things have changed with me alot this year...maybe even this past spring/summer.I honestly don't know how though.Other people (just one actually) have noticed things though about me. They (he)said I'm different, but  don't know why either, I really wish he could explain what it is, it would just be nice to know. But once again I need to lighten up. I'm going to bed.
