On the other hand, being quick to forgive will help you defeat those angry feelings.       Adapted From: The Bible Promise Book For Teens       Anger will not only cause hurt in you but on the other hand, the person that you vent your anger or have an anger with is in turn not as well as you think he or she is. Though people will make us angry in a way or another, the only right thing for us to do is to forgive them and to ask God for the strength to change your anger to joy. By changing your anger to joy, you can actually change a person thinking as they know that you are a forgiving person and it will also allow you to glorify God. Therefore, be slow to anger. -Abigail      For every minute you are angry, you lose sixty seconds of happiness. -Ralph Waldo Emerson
