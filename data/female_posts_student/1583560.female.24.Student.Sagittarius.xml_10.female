However, for those that don't know me, I am the male side of the 45 minutes. I will talk about sports and the two K's will talk about lipstick or something. I am sure that is how it will go... Ok, hopefully I will come up with something other than sports to talk about, but I get a bit post-shy sometimes. Who wants to hear about my thoughts on Ecuadorian post-modern architecture (EPMA!) on the influence of Brazilian stained glass blowers (BSGB!)? Ok, I know nothing about architecture or stained glass that I didn’t learn in Jr. High. But, I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Kate’s and Kami’s blogs and I imagine I will enjoy sharing my thoughts. So, that is going to be my mission statement: Enjoy Sharing My Thoughts! Like the cheesy, worthless, supposedly motivational little slips of paper I have been getting with my paychecks the last couple of months… Some guy is getting paid to design these things… “FINISH IT…   RIGHT!  ” It screams to me from my paycheck… Oh gee, thanks… I was so going to finish it wrong, but then I remembered… I am here to finish it right, underline, exclamation mark…   Anyway, it is good to be here. Thank you Kate and Kami for providing this fun, interesting, and potentially informative little space on the web for us.
