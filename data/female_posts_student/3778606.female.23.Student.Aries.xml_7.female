Hah-muthafuckin-hah, bitch.  i just made that up and it is too funny. i think i want to copy and paste this to my site so that others can enjoy it. wait, you are the only one who reads it, and you already saw it. never mind. tell others about my brilliance. word of mouth , yo.   later  dont foget to family please me.  mooooooly**  that last comment is in reference to ryan and i going to monical's this weekend so i can tell him adios before he peaces out the americas for some japa-sleaze. now that i have pirated my own posts, i think i will go to lunch.   peace-za
