So here I go...  Ashley Khan, Michelle (Mica), Laura Howat, Harpal Bhambra, Raveena Kang, Jon Digno, Steph Melara, Chris Lewis, and Tyler Reaugh...Thank you all for helping me through this. Means a lot. Love you lots.  So today, the day wasn't too bad. School was actually fun. I have a provincial for english tomorrow. Woot, woot!!...Right. Lol. I came home, and I signed onto MSN messenger, and I started to talk to a couple of friends, and well, stuff happened. But the turnout was good (Thanks to Ashley). Now I'm assured that my boyfriend and I will stay together after the 2 month period of not seeing or talking to eachother...But I was supposed to know that...I suck!! Lol. I need to have more faith. I was just afraid. But hey, Life is full of tests. You have to prove your strength, or lose. The choice is yours. Heh. Encouraging, don't you think? So, My decision is as follows : Spend more time with friends, and wait until the end of this, and then...I CAN SEE HIM =D!! There's nothing else I can do to meliorate the situation. If I keep being stupid like I am, I may just make it more dire. So, If all else fails, wait it out. BLAH!! I know it sucks, but it all works out for the best. Everything happens for a reason.  Woo hoo!! Well, that was my load of crap today! Feels good to get that off of my chest. Whew! Well, I shall be back tomorrow to rant on again.   This is Aman, signing off.
