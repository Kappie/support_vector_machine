Oh, I know, I slept in an extra half an hour and had some awesomely vivid dreams, one part included Jerm which I won't describe in detail. Suffice it to say I miss the guy, and I'm looking forward to the weekend. It's amazing how dreams can set your mood for the day. When I have stressful dreams (like about how lazy and unmotivated I am), I tend to have stressful, upset days. The other night I feel like I had a dream that is helping me deal with my sister. I was in the shower with Jerm, and then Alex tried to push into the bathroom. I was upset because she had just walked into our house, and wouldn't even wait until we were done to demand my attention. I had to tell her to go away, and that I would deal with her later, then I shut the door. I think that's exactly how I'm dealing with Alex in my head: she upset me for a while demanding my attention, but I've put my stress over her pregnancy aside for the time being, and I'll make it wait until I'm ready. And I think that is the best way for me to deal with all of this now. I can't cry anymore, or I'll get even sicker. And I really don't think telling her how disappointed I am and how horrible I think James is will help at this point. She won't listen anyways, and she'll probably think I'm being vengeful or something. She never listened to my advice or opinions before, so I can't believe she will now. I'd like to have a real heart to heart with her sometime, but we rarely see each other alone anymore, and I don't like talking that deeply over the phone. We need to meet sometime on neutral gound, because I'm uniquely uncomfortable at her house, and I'm not sure that either of my residences are any better for her. There will be a family event this weekend for easter, so maybe we can talk then. Although if James is around, I doubt she will be alone at all.
