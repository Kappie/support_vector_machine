Cranky due to a ordinary foul mood and being peeved at Tim Hortons because my coffee tastes old and burnt--bottom of the pot   **Not the greatest experience at the T-Ho's on 8 Mile by Eastland!  Beware!**   The crampy element is probably due to sitting lady-like for nearly 10 hours (GOOD DATE!)  M. is really sweet and his choice of movies is A+  Last night/this morning we watched The Big Lebowski and Mystery Men.  Fun stuff!  Plus  urlLink John  seems to like him.  A good time had by all.
