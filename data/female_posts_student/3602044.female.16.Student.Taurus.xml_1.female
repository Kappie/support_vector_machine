And the answer is this....I don't know....When they first came out I thought that they were really stupid looking and that the books were "gay" but upon closer realization(like my friend dragging me to the theatre to see the 2nd one) I have come to the conclusion that they really are just testimonial of the trails and triumph of the human spirit set to a fantasy theme.  The books are excellently written and make you think that you are in a world where muscles, Quidditch, and Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardrey really exists.  Last night I went into the theatre to see the 3rd installment of the series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and let me say this, I don't believe that it could have been made any better.  Now I do realize that they had to cut a bunch of things out to be able to meet time constraints, but the way they tied everything together, they really did hit all the important parts of the book.  Well there were some exceptions, but we won't get into that.  All in all I believe that for all you people out there who doubt the Harry Potter series, take a closer look, look past the magic and make believe, so you can see what the series true meaning is.  Maybe if you do look into this world you will come out with a new outlook on the REAL world.
