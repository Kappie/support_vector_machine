We still do not know if we're having a baby boy or girl. We might choose to be surprised (MERRY CHRISTMAS!) but if we do find the sex out it probably won't be for a month or so. Still due New Years' Eve. I am starting to feel slight flutters...especially when I go to sleep. I've been having slight backaches and leg cramps at night, but other than that I am pretty good. Already in maternity clothes. Started showing much faster with this one! Well, check back. We'll keep you updated on all the news!
