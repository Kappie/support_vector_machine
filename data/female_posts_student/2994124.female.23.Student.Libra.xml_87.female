It makes me feel so good: I'm doing exercise, I'm releasing endorphins, I'm using up my pent up energy. I feel so free when I'm in the water.   Worked 8:30-6 and have almost finished all the notes now - uh-oh.  Had good fun with the girls in the office today.  Why are all the environments I'm in all-female?!  Heading for bed.  Goodnight all. Sorry this blog isn't particuarly thrilling at the moment. Summarising medical notes doesn't provide many thrilling reports! Oh except the lady today who was reported as having postnatal depression in 1840!  Flipping heck think I would have postnatal depression if I was still alive after all this time too!!  xxx
