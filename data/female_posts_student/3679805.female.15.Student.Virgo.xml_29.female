To My Dear Friend,  A friend is someone who's  always there A friend is someone you know who cares They're someone who will share your dreams Someone who will hear your screams They're someone who will lend a hand Someone who will take your stand They're more than a laugh and  a wonderful time More than someone who will  loan you a dime They're someone who accepts the  good and the bad Someone who will cheer  up the sad They're people who can play around The people who won't let you down They're someone who will stay by your side Someone who you know won't lie They're someone who knows  who you are Someone to help you reach  for the stars They help you to over come your fears They're someone who will  wipe away your tears They're somone to teach you  the beauty in art Someone who always stays close to your heart They're someone to keep you on the right track Someone who won't just  turn their back They're someone to help you  keep your head clear Someone to help you drink  a beer They're someeone who is with  you throughout the day Someone who's trust just  doesn't fade away They're someone who will always be Able to accept me just for being me!  Thanks Friend!
