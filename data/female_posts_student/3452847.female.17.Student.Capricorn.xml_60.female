Saw Carlos too, and hes looking well so glad hes ok. I really think i'm giving up on Dave, he doesn't seem keen on me at all, maybe i'm being silly, but he doesn't seem in the slighlt bit interested and i'm not going to waste my time and energy thinking maybe he likes me when he doesn't. Well i brought two bras and thong sets, a perfume, a shirt, and a c.d today, did pretty well, in the sales and used my student card. Apparantly my mobile has a software malfunction with picture messaging? That sucks if it has...  Jason still away, spoke a bit to Jo about him, but not too much, don't want to push my luck with her really. Sure he's having a wicked time, him and Laura only been together nearly a month, sounds like a small amount of time but that month has killed me, plus compared to us its nothing... So guess its back to me being single with no one interested... Fun, so much shit has happened this month, mainly with Jason, and i almost dropped myself in it with Jo today when she nearly read the messages, just need to try and put it behind me, he has so i should too.  ~Lisa~
