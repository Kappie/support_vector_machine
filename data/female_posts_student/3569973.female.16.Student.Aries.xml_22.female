Well wednesday me and Jake got in this huge fight, over nothing, I was just really moody and really mean and I told him that I didnt wanna deal with him anymore. Then we both left and didnt talk to each other until about 9:30 that night, when I called him an ass and told him to come get his stuff. Well he came over and we sat in the driveway crying in the rain for an hour. Realized we were both stupid and that things had to change. I guess you could say the curse is the cure. Like that one song, ya know when they say that...and You dont know what you'd do if you lost it. Its true, that boy drives me insane, but at the same time is one of the only people that knows me and can make me actually happy, we drive each other insane. So he went home and we talked and talked and cried and talked...I ended up going to bed at about 1:00am with a terrible headache, an upset stomach, and weighing 3 pounds less. lol...which was the good part. I woke up with my eyes swollen from crying soo much and went to Jakes at about 11 to fix stuff. We got there and laid around, watched movies, ate, cried and talked some more. Then finally decided that we needed to get out of the house and we went to go ride bikes for about an hour. Thats how long it takes to get around the short block. It was soo much fun and I felt tons better when we got back. We saw soo many nifty things...like we got to see donkeys do it, an armadillo run (after we chased it), we called cows (and it actually worked), almost fell off a bridge (but it was just a stupid do you trust me game), and got chased by dogs. It was an exciting adventure. We came back ate dinner and went back outside so that Jake could teach me how to play golf. It was actually pretty fun. We danced when we got to my house and we talked until it was super late, which we hadnt done in a long time. Then today, I got up picked some stuff up around the house and made it look desent. Took a shower, did my hair and left. I went to get gas, and then went to burleson trying to look for a job...but that didnt really work out, but I did get my shirts so that I could start working on mine, and got some christmas presents. (i like to shop early) Then came home, realized I forgot to go to wal-mart and now I gotta try and get Jake to take me back there later tonight. So whenever Jake gets back from the lake with his dad and Luke, we're going to the driving range so that I can practice and then we're going to play putt-putt. I cant wait because I havent played in forever. But well Im gonna start working on some things that I wish I could tell you but cant. lol. Till then, Later Days
