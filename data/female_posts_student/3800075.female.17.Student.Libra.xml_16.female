There was a bunch of people driving by (that had to happen, everyone i know just happens to drive by at that moment)- fucking henry winkler drove by on a harley and was like- "Ehhh"  and gave the thums up.  Fucking crazy.  But man.... did it ever itch. I never thought my knee could itch so bad. Jacklies back!  Hooraa!  she brought me the coolest present.  A pipe.  i was so excited, my very first pipe, and from tijuanna at that!  I think ill call him Paco.  Perhaps ill try it out at the party tomorrow night.  well tonight i spose!  Yay.  Man today was sweet.  got to see jacklie and nathan came and played with us cuz all of his family is gone finally.   I think today was the most productive day of the summer for me.  Went got my schedule, out to lunch, goosetown, volleyball, work, and then came here and played.   I hope vball is fun this year- last year man!  thats crazy too.  Eat shit merhensy!  Oh no, poor joe, he has no...VAGINA! :)  aww good things.  Mosseltoff.  i wonder how you spell that.   but anyway i watched a good episode of bill maher last night.  bill maher- he kills me.   Welp i best get some rest i think ill need it for tomorrow!  i hope everyone can come!  that would be really cool! Good night Internet gods. "Im thankful for tucker transportation, and the fucks they hire to drive" Until Time Next
