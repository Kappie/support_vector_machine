I only managed to stand up one time...yeah, that's embarrassing...I'm really bad at it. ;) LOL, and the one time I managed to stand up, when I fell off, I filled my lungs with salt water and wacked my foot on one of the fins.LOL, my foot is pretty shades of purple now. ^_^ I still had a great time, I hope I get to go again! (and maybe stayt upright on the board...hehehe)  Matt did phone, but grrr, we were so late getting to the beach that we would have had to leave right away. I didn't feel right bugging them aobut it, I mean, I was the one wanting to go surfing, and Limão and Victor were with us too, so it wouldn't have been fair for them. So yeah. While I'm writing this, Tom is on an airplane to back home. God that must be a scary feeling. He was lucky, he was here for a year. But at the same time, does that make it even harder to say goodbye? If so...wow, it could almost make me think twice about doing a long term exchange. LOL, Almost, but not quite. I'm definately going to apply for a long term...maybe even put Brasil as my first choice. I'd never get Florianópolis as my city assignment though...and I love it here. I don't know how I could live anywhere else.  Hehehe..yeah well...right now I'm writing an e-mail to Matt....must remember to phone up Bruna as well about going to school with them tomorrow. Otherwise, I won't be allowed through the gates. It's strange having guards at a school.  Neh, going to go...I'm so tired now. I guess that's what happens when only getting about 4 .5 hours of sleep in the past 3 days. ^_^ I had a good day today. Really good. I only wish I could have said good-bye to Tom. LOL...I mean, last time I saw him, he was drunk...@_@  Hehehe...hope my parents aren't reading this. ;)  Beijos!  Hannah
