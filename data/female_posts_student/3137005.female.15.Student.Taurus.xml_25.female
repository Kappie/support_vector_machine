"Tell us a story I know you're not boring"  I was afraid that you would not insist. "You sound so sleepy just take this, now leave me"  I said please don't slow me down If I'm going too fast You're in a strange part of our town...  Yeah, the night's not over You're not trying hard enough, Our lives are changing lanes You ran me off the road, The wait is over I'm now taking over, You're no longer laughing I'm not drowning fast enough.  Now every time that I look at myself "I thought I told you this world is not for you"  The room is on fire as she's fixing her hair "you sound so angry just calm down, you found me"  I said please don't slow me down If I'm going too fast You're in a strange part of our town...  Yeah, the night's not over You're not trying hard enough, Our lives are changing lanes You ran me off the road, The wait is over I'm now taking over, You're no longer laughing I'm not drowning fast enough.')  After we had bought my new coat today...which had the security tag left on so we're taking it back in the morning, we went to big W to buy a drink of ribena and some tights. While at Big W we were served by a lady called Elli, not Elly or even Ellie but Elli. Elli was new. Elli had blond hair and liked to smile. Elli was fake, from her fake smile to her silly fake hair. Elli liked to do everything the long-winded way. Elli was the reason that I was stuck at the checkout for fifteen minutes in front of Mr and Mrs we never outgrew the sixties, and behind Mr and Mrs we've tried to cover up the fact we're going gray by dying our hair a strange shade of yellow. Elli liked to make price calls...Elli needs a life. I think that Elli may have realised that I did not like her. Elli asked me if 'everthing was okay miss', I told Elli that it was and went back to glaring at her menacingly. I think Elli was freaked out....I don't like Elli. Elli then apologised for the wait. I told Elli that it was okay. I didn't say thankyou to Elli when I walked away. Elli did a price check for a lip gloss. I went home. Bored now. Dani  He he, that post was fun to write!
