I'm 26, go to school for Dental Lab Technology, have a 4 year old daughter, fancy myself a movie snob, but am a fangirl at heart..... give me really any guy from the Lord of the Rings and I go weak in the knees... although, if forced to choose, Elijah Wood is my favorite because he seems really smart and kinda dorky, ya know?!?!  Orlando Bloom is just too PRETTY and too... I dunno, I just don't trust a guy who's a techno-phobe!!!  Anyways, I also love Speed Racer cartoons (the old-school ones), Pinky and The Brain, all movies~ especially Monty Pythons.... classic!!~ music.... some favorites are Stone Roses, Beastie BOys, The Beatles, Led Zepplin, Elvis, Blondie, The Clash (my daughter was named after a Clash song), Bob Marley.  Right now, I've started reading the book Cheet.... I've just finished About a Boy (much better than the movie, but isn't that how it always is?!?!).  So, I'm off into the world today... Will post later!!
