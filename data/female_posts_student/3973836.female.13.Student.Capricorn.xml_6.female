I figured it wasn't exactly easy to lose a website :P Anyways, I'll probably be posting in this one a lot.      Just yesterday, my family and I decided to storm chase (yeah, I know, we're crazy). But we always enjoy it. This one was a bit more..."intense". We started driving along behind the squall line to stay outta the real thick stuff. Well, we pulled over to watch the storm going on, and all of a sudden, we start seeing tornado tails dropping from the clouds!!! We started driving again (yeah, like I said, we're crazy, but we wanted to see more of the storm). So we continued driving along, and all of a sudden, the rain started real thick, and we couldn't see anything so we pulled over. That's when things got REEEALLY bad. We saw the wind change direction and then we felt the wind slam against the car. WE GOT CAUGHT INPART OF A TORNADO!!! It was amazing! Everything seemed to go in slow motion. My heart was beating fast, but felt slow.Everything was white because the hail (ranging fromgolfball size, to baseball size, to 3 baseballs stuck together size), and andrain was so thick. My sister reached over and grabbed my arm and said, "Risa...are we still on the ground?" I leaned up and nodded saying, "I can still see the road." Then Dad sped down the road away from the tornado and we started driving down a different road. Then I looked out my window and pointed, saying, "Mom...mom..MOM!"cause she wasn't listening. She said, "what?!" I was like, "LOOK!" and we saw another tornado coming down. Mom shouted, "DRIVE!" We drove and drove through the pounding rain and hail until we reached Thompson, where my grandmother lives. We took shelter there until we were sure it was safe to return to home. It was sooo surreal that moment we were caught at the edge of the tornado. It was like something from a movie that you'd never think could happen in real life. It was AWESOME! ^_^
