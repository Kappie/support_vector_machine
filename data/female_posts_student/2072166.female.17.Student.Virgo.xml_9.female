Me, Van, Julius ( Ika?) currently working on the video and all the shizzo there is to it. We'll be having a meeting w a couple of cast and crew members tmr but i guess the rest of you guys need not attend.   The proposed date to film is this friday. It'll be in school, but more about that aft tmr's meeting, I guess.   Treasure Hunt  We didnt exactly discuss this just now, but do you think it'll be cool for the Treasure Hunt I/Cs to plan and organize the actual treaure hunt itself? I would prefer if the video production  planning of treasure hunt would be gg on simultaneously since we don't exactly have all the time in the world.  Please kindly take note that we will have a final meeting with the advisors with everything (including puzzles, etc.) on  Friday, 18th June . I think that the trial run for the treasure hunt should be done before we meet the teachers, no?  We will mobilize the troops (heh.) on  22nd June .  Of course, on 23rd June, yours truly will finally turn legal!  And 24th will be  THE  day!  Lianne, you're IC of Ice Breakers? Havent heard anything from you yet. I think we need some games that we can actually brief the OGLS with, so tt they'll have a brief idea, no?  And mcm guys, i seem to be having trouble getting info to you, and if i msg all including the fms society peeps, my bill will just hit the roof, big time. so i thought we'd do a forwaring chain. here's how it'll go.  i'll msg halawah- simren - wilson - lianne - francis.  ill msg jingwen  sashi as well. any discrepancies whatsoever, holler at the tagboard, but if it's all good, then ill see you guys real soon.
