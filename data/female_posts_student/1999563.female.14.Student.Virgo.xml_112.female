So I put in my contacts and ran out the door...I just put on some jeans with my pajama top. Lol! So the day started off pretty stinky!  School  went prety much the same... We had an awesome sub in Spanish!!!!!! She was a  retired army conel.  She was spiftacular!  She read us this awesome poem in German!! It was about this kid dying..it was still cool though! :P  Then I went home ran inside and changed for rowing. Rowing was alright. I had to row with the newbies again. Bleh!  That Alexa person is SOOOO annoying. She thinks she is SO cool. She bugs me.    OOH!! At rowing....we pulled up just as a police car was pulling out and we were like "Um....ok.." So we drove up the the place where we meet and there was 3 POLICE CARS there!! They were handcuffing these two guys!!! We were all like "What is going on?!" As it turns out...these two dumb guys pretended to fish in the bay until Will (the main guy) rowed out. Once he left they went and took the CRAPPY ROW BOAT, beginning of their extreme stupidity. They tried to row away but they didn't have any paddles, Will obviously saw them.  He callled the police and caught up with the cirminals!  The police showed up...and end of story :) It was FUNNY!!! :)  When my mom was on the way to pick me up she got in a car wreck! :(  At first she thought the car was totalled but once she got out and looked at the car there was only minor damage...a 17 year old kid did it. :(  SO...we raced home and I ran inside and practiced my piano. Then we ate dinner- a small meal of beans and fish (yummy salmon!) and went to youth group. It was fun! I met a really cool girl who was wearing a Puma sweatshirt, which obviously means she is ON THE LIST :P  She had really pretty hair...it was down to her hip bone. :)  Thats how long my hair will be..eventually. :)  Now I am home...and doing NOTHING! :) That is all. So long!  Love, Laura
