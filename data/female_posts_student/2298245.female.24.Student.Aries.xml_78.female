As I started reading it, I thought, "wow, I don't know this song as well as I thought I did, because I had no idea this is what he was saying."  Then, I did some investigation, and discovered that this site,  urlLink Crazy Lyrics , claims to contain lyrics translated from English into some other language and back into English again, though I leave it to you to decide whether or not it is a joke, as I tend to think it is.  Some people seem to be very offended by this (check out  urlLink the Guestbook  on this guy's site), but I think it is just harmless fun.  Some of the "alternate" lyrics are very entertaining, especially from songs that do not make much sense to begin with.
