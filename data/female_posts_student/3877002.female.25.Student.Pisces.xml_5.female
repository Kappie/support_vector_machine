Every day from about Noon to 2:00pm, five local UPS men form an impressive posse outside the building where I work.  Normally they stick to the group of benches along Fifth Avenue, but lately I've noticed them moving about freely - a vision of brown in matching shoes, shorts, shirts, and hats.  Yesterday I saw them at the newstand fraternizing with one of the Airborne Express deliverymen.   Mr. Airborne looked slightly intimidated by all the "brown." He mostly kept to the periphery of the group, looking over the shoulder of his faded gray shirt as they headed up the hill. Along the way, another man in a ketchup stained Wendy's shirt joined them. Might the "Uniforms" be planning to mount a take-over?  Or do I just have too much free time on my hands during my lunch hour?
