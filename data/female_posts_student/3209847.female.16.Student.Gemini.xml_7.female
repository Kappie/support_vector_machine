Well the grandparents are in town, so i'm having to socialize with the family more than I usually do...(This is taylor speaking) Sarah's doing homework because she actually works.. I just take easier classes and get my work done at school... So basically i'm bored. How is everyone doing? I know everyone is stressed out because AP tests are NEXT week!! Good Luck Sarah! hehe. i'm not taking any because I didn't think I would pass AP Comp. Sci. nor AP Euro. That's alright. There's always next year. I hope everyone is doing well. School is almost over, Sarah's almost graduating! (It's so sad!! I'm going to cry at graduation!) What else is coming up?   May 1 - Sarah and I are going to see Chess at OU May 8 - Prom and Survivor Island(go jenny and bonnie! hehe), who all is going!? comment if you are May 12 - Senior Dinner (oh senior video, so corny and great) May 15 - Graduation! *tear* May 25-27 - Are these final days? I'm not sure  So that's basically all that is coming up that I can remember AT this moment. I wish I was a senior... Sarah and I are doing well, we're both happy and stressed and frazzled at the same time. We're multitaskful (is that a word?) anyways... my (taylor's) english test was hard today.. I hope I did well. We'll post more later! bye bye
