U all already know this so I won't bore you w/ details *again*. I know you're getting tired of it. Yeah OK so,    Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow. That I shall say goodnight, 'til it be morrow...  I'm taking a cue from Skye Sweetnam when I say, "4get Billy S.!!!" Ok well, Heather, the show's yours for the rest of the weekend. I'll be back either late Sunday or on Monday. Tell u what I'll make it Monday so u can have a full weekend! ::blows kisses:: Luv ya, miss ya,   SEE YA!!!    ~Cara~
