She ditched the car in town, did some other travelling, and got a plane to New Mexico, where she's living with a teacher. She had to have had a plan a while ago, and the teacher probably supplied funds. The police tracked her down, but she's 18, so no one can make her come home. I don't know... her family life was going to hell, but her parents do care about her deep down. She'll be happier doing what she wants, I guess... it's just, I think she's lied to me about certain things, and no one likes that feeling. She's extremely bright, she graduated with scholarships galore, so I really hope she doesn't sacrifice stuff for her education. Idk... I think she needed to get away from her family, but I kind of wish she was staying by herself, and going to university where she would have.
