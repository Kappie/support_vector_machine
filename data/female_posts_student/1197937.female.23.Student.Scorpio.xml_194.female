DAMN THAT OMAROSA!!!  i can honestly say that i have never harbored such strong feelings of animosity towards any living person (bin laden's existence being in question) as i do towards that LYING, CONNIVING, TWO-FACED, LAZY-ASS [bleep]!!!   on top of tonight's incendiary episode, the woman had the nerve to show her face on oprah and accuse the media of intentionally portraying african americans in a negative light. i'm not infuriated by that allegation, but by the source of it! omarosa, if you're reading this, PLEASE SHUT THE F*** UP!!! actions speak louder than words, so don't even try to make yourself out to be an aegis of racial equality!! i may not have authority to comment on other shows, but i do know that your atrocious behavior on the apprentice, not your race, is what makes you truly disgusting. if i weren't sooooo repulsed by the idea of being within arm's reach of you, i'd wring your neck with my own hands.* and may the record show that i am gentle and peace-loving by nature.  that being said, i'm really looking forward to watching next week's grand finale. one of the final two contenders is in charge of jessica simpson's vegas concert, so she'll be making an appearance on the apprentice. it'll be the fusion of my two favorite shows that i've been praying for. there is a gaaaaw.    *note: this statement does not make me liable for committing a tort in the form of an assault. it is a conditional threat where my own words negate the intent to cause a harmful contact by indicating that i do not plan to carry out the threat.   (just practicing...)  p.s. after multiple threats and demands via email, i'm starting to feel that some of you no likee japanese midi. so i've removed the background music, for now. a comments section has also been added for your venting pleasure. please be advised, however, that comments made in languages other than espanol will be respectfully ignored in honor of william hung, whose work has done so much to bridge the gap between the chinese and spanish-speaking communities. gracias and wo aye nee.   currently playing:  urlLink bailamos - william hung  (released on April 6th, check your local stores for availability)
