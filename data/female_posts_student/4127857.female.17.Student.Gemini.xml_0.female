ABRACADABRA!!!!  but yea, ya'll should deff. wear your LiveStrong bracelets if you have one...b/c they don't just represent lance...they represent all of those who have survived cancer or are going through it right now.  and it shows that dreams do come true...i mean, hello! look at lance!! And dancing in the middle of the streets last night was so cool! everyone was watching us b/c they wish they were us! yea they did! and Brandon and Amar were fighting over me b/c they love me soo much haha..but what could i do? i already have a boyfriend...but i know i always have options.  :) haha ANYWAY, after the Lance thing, we all ate at Whataburger (well, everyone but me) and then we went bowling at like 1 in the morning and i got a strike!! my first ever!!  it was awesome..and then i didn't get home until like 2:30 am...but thats ok, b/c the concert was AWESOME!!!!! omg...this week has been awesome!!  So today,  i went by the school to see if i could talk to my choir teacher b/c she messed up my schedule..but she wasn't there...so i went home and my parents and i went to Highland Mall for Best New Talent auditions, but i didn't actually audition b/c i went last year to California and so we were just wondering if we could skip this year since i was invited back, and come next year.  (we don't know how my mom will be feeling by the time the real auditions in Cali. happen.) so yea, they said yes but they will work with us so i can come this year and they asked me to come to the second audition at the Sheraton Hotel tomorrow and talk to everyone and tell them about my experiences in LA! yea, totally telling them i met AJ Trauth of Even Stevens!!! yea, and then we went shopping at J.Crew and i bought a pair of really cute jeans!! they fit perfectly!! i really love them..and then we went to Barton Creek Mall to shop for some un-mentionables and then home, and now i'm visiting the hotel and writing in my blog! yay! haha but yea, now it is time for me to leave...i have to get ready for tomorrow b/c its my last day of summer! ahh!!!  i'm sooo not ready for school!  If i don't write in my blog tomorrow,  GOOD LUCK ON EVERYONE'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!! or whenever you start!!!  Monica.
