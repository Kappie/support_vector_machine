Yesterday, I went to the movies with my grandma and we saw Shrek 2. It was sooooo cute, I loved it. Im willing to see it again, which is probably what we are gonna do. Then tonight was church. I got to see Lauren and Chelsea and Justin and Hannah and Sam, etc... We chilled and had fun. Then tomorrow, the youth group is supposedly goin to the Braves game. Then we are gonna take Justin home and Lauren is comin to spend the night with me. Then Friday we are goin shopping for Justin's birthday present and going out to lunch, then taking her home. Then Saturday, im getting dropped off at Lauren's house and Justin and his mom are going to pick me and Lauren up to go bowling (for Justin's birthday) and then out to eat. We are meeting some guy named Jeremyup there. Then I am going home with Lauren and spending the night with her. Then we are going to church Sunday and then going home, and then back to church Sunday night. NO DRAMA!!! YAY!!! It's about time. *lol* We gave out our flyers tonight for the cleaning business. So hopefully we get some good, positive feedback from it. I think I'm gonna get off and play the Sims.
