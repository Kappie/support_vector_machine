HOLY MOTHERFUCKING SHIT!   curiosa is less than a week away!!! how awesome is that?!?!?!   it's gonna be great.   i can't wait.    so is that damned presentation. but i will wing it. and everything will be ok.    yeesh.   i'm not in the best mood. i don't really know why. nothing's wrong right now. i don't think. i feel like i haven't seen my friends in a while. but it's only been like 2-3 days...   maybe thats not it.   what else? my dad and the car thing bums me out.   it's like he builds me up and gets me all excited about getting a car and then lets me down. like yesterday he had already signed all the papers and wrote a check and all this crap, and then he talked to the guy and he didn't have something that my dad thought he was getting and he had to cancel it. i know it bummed him out too. and then the other car he thought he should have gotten.   and then that time when we went to atlanta and looked at the cars there, and we should have just got one right there and then, but my parents wanted to look around and shit. i don't know.   i keep saying that i don't care what kind of car they get.   but in the back of my mind i know i do. cause i have my heart set on one of two.   and i would be thoroughly disappointed if it wasn't one of them.   unless it made my parents happier to get something else...i don't know. i don't know what i mean by that. i sound so contradictory. i want this car, and i have my heart set on it, but i'll be ok if they get something else. well the brat side of me wouldn't. but my logical side would.    and i go with my logical side most of the time. even though my brat side fights it. a lot.   well i don't think there is nething else to relate in my dull life. *sigh*   i need excitment.   i can't wait for curiosa.    i have to dress up for the presentation. hmm. and then come home and change and GO TO ATLANTA. tee hee tee hee. woo hoo!    it's about lunch time again. and my stomach bids me to go...
