Roberta leaves like...de*th threats all over. well okay not de*th, but things like "will someone PLEASE explain to me why sharon is paying you to do jobs that you suck at doing, so i get stuck doing them over again for you, Stop being lazy!"  dixie would NEVER. she'd be like, "just to let you guys know, we're going to have to be a little more careful when we're washing dishes. Sharons pretty picky about that."   oi im a space case. i think i'm going to start going to this one "church" with my friend dirk. it sounds really cool. it's the Universal Unitarian or something. and anyway, it's non-denominational. it's just about like, morals, and being a good person and respecting the earth and stuff. I mean, there's a "Pastor" like person who leads discussions, but it's just about being nice and being good to the world, and about bringing beautiful things into existance and being yourself and stuff. i guess like a third of the congregation is g*y but i dont care. Duh. dirk says it's really cool though. i'm excited.  i'm also going to check out brenden's youth group thing. not cuz i want to be christian, but just because i find religion so fascinating. especially christianity and catholicism. just because, there's so much i find in those religions that leaves unanswerable questions. like the bible....i just don't see it as true at all. but i find it fascinating to watch people who do. just because it makes you think.  maybe dirks is the Unitarian Universalists....i forget.  i'd like someday to be able to buy a building and make it just a house of silence. No particular religion. Just a place where people go and it's silent and they can have a time to pray, meditate, worship, whatever they do. Anyone of any religion would be welcome. And maybe if i started bringing in more money, i would dedicate a room to each religion...and that room would be decorated just for the people of that particular religion.
