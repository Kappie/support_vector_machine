PC 4. Dial-up or high speed internet access?  HIGH SPEED... I could NEVER go back to dial-up 5. Small *family-only* wedding or large 200+ guest wedding?  Most likely large because I know so many people 6. Would you rather be the bridesmaid or the bride? (if you are a guy, substitute best man or groom)  I'd rather be the bride... because when it's the special day, I'd have less responsibility than a Bridesmaid (Maid/Matron of Honor) would. 7. AC/DC or ABBA?  AC/DC!!! 8. Roses or daisies?  Pink Roses 9. Trashy romance novels or classic literature?  Hehe...  Beauty's Punishment ... j/k!  I like both  ; ) 10. NEW! Thought-provoking question of the week...If you had to choose one...would you rather be blind or deaf? Why? I'd rather be blind... I don't think I could NOT listen to music.
