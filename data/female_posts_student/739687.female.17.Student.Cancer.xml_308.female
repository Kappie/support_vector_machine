I had a great time in Pennsylvania, though the whole driving thing was painfully long and boring. We made a few day-stops however, in D.C. and Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I came to several very positive revelations during my trip too. I guess getting away can be a good thing. But I was anxious to get back home.  I think when I first got home last night, I was cranky, tired, burnt out, and slightly disappointed, but that changed. I came back to find that things are quite close to how I wanted them. My life didn't tumble into a mess of disorder, as I had thought. Oh, silly Shauna, and your silly pessimism.  I still feel slightly rushed and a bit overwhelmed, but I can manage to get everything done that I need. And most of my stress (well, all of it actually) is just me freaking out over nothing.  That's why I love Slowreader. So mellowing.  Oh, and I'm proclaiming July "Anticipation Month". Because I have a ton of stuff to look forward to.  To start:  9 days until Warped Tour!   18 days until I get my license!   There's much more, too. Juuuuust wait. :)  It's good to be back, crazies!!
