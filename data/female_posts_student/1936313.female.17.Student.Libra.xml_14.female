I still feel like I'm going insane or something... and tomorrow I should find out what the hecks going on with my portfolio to GMC...    - -'Cause I used to have angels that used to watch over me.. when love was not a stranger... but love ain't what it used to be.. and I don't want these devils.. they're knocking at my door.. so I.. can't love you no more.. no more.. no more..- -    Mondays suck.
