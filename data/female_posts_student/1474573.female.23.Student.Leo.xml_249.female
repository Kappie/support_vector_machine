I have now made an appointment with my old place in Brooklyn since we're going there tomorrow anyway.  SIGH.  I hate when I have a bug up my ass like this, because I'll do  anything  to just get it done, it doesnt matter WHO does it.    But what if it comes out bad??  Oh lord!!  What should I dooooo?
