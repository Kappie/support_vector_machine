Although I could be joint tied with someone else - :( Reading about Survivor on the web is NO where near as good as watching it live.  There is no tension, anticipation, trauma or upset (what kind of addict do I sound like?!! – Mental note for tomorrow: get a life.)    Despite sleeping through my alarm (well to be truthful I woke up, turned it off and went back to sleep again!)  I got to work on time.  The kids were SO excited to see me which was lovely, and with Paul and Hannah in tow we went to pick up Ruth from playgroup.  She apparently had been so excited that morning that I was going to pick her up.  We had some lunch and then went off to the Botanical Gardens to play.  They love going in my car because it only has 2 doors, so they have to  climb  in, which obviously makes it all the more fun!  Came home, built and painted robot models and then played on the computer.  Paul who is 4 is AMAZING on the computer and can do things I can’t!  Tea, bath, stories and bed followed and once they were all tucked up Jo and I sat down to chat.  She is now 39 weeks pregnant and has just about had enough.  She is going for her caesarean on Tuesday – so all prayers (or other random wafflings to God like I do) would be appreciated.  So I decided to treat myself.  I had to go shopping on the way home anyway, so I bought myself some ‘chips’, dip (NOT dill pickle unfortunately), tortilla wraps and my favourite yog-hurts (note pronunciation please). So normally I see food as bad or punishment, but I am trying to use it as a reward this time.  So now I’m in my PJs eating my dip and chips and feeling quite good actually.     Watched Pirates of the Caribbean last night – was good except I fell asleep with only about 20 minutes left to go!!!  I have decided that I am going to try and spend about half an hour every day just for me. So that might be watching a film, or eating something I REALLY like, or reading, or talking to a friend on the phone. But the only condition is that I ALLOW myself to enjoy that time and NOT feel guilty. So we’ll see what happens.  Goodnight folks  mexx
