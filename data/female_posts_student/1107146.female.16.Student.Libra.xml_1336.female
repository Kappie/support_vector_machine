Adam was talking about how he didn't like the "el", which for those of you not familiar to the Chicago area, is the "elevated train" much like a subway, only above ground for the most part.  Anyway, so that made me think of it.  Oh, and *clears throat* *bursts into song*  Happy birthday to you Happy Birthday to you Happy Birthday dear Jo-osh Happy Birthday to You!!!  OK, never again.  I have fully lost all semblance of sanity and it's all the stupid summer's fault.  Grrrr...  Call me.  I'm serious.  I don't beg unless it is a real emergency.  Which this is, no doubt.
