I knew right away that Nima wasn't going to happy about it. He told me that he was waiting for this day for days and weeks because he was going to spend his time with her. Then it just clicked that, I was expecting this day as much as he was. It was just that many things happened in between.   I went on so many rides I've never been on. I remember telling everyone that they could go without me because I was too scared. But always one of them would be with me. I felt so lucky to have friends that cared about me. I remember when we were lining up for "mine buster", I was all down. I didn't know why, I just couldn't handle my emotions right. Everything just didn't make sense. I thought the world was going to fall apart. I really wanted to cry about everything. I know I don't even have a reason to, but for some reason that I don't even know I just wanted to. I feel so dumb, I was always the one that would comfort others when they were upset, but everything was opposite now. I really want to be the same person as I was before. In the beginning of wonderland, I just wasn't in the mood. I wanted to cry on someone's shoulder, but I'm strong enough to know that I can handle this. I can handle through what happened. I can handle through my pain, and my fears. I can handle everything. I know I'm hiding my feelings, but that's who I am, and that's one of the reasons why everything went on.   At the end of the day, Nima won like 10 prizes. All for one person of course. It was funny how he spent so much money on one game. Krystal got 2, and Vivian got 2 prizes from Mark. I didn't get any of course, I didn't want to waste my money. It was my mom's money. Nima gave me one of his stuffed animals. I said if he gave it to me because he felt sorry for me, but he said no. He said he would never give a gift out of pity. Rain started to pour. Thunder was near. Everyone that was left was cold, and was hiding from the rain. Truthfully, I wanted to stand in the rain. I thought that it would make me feel better.   I always try to look on the bright side of everything. But sometimes I don't, but I tell myself that I'm living my life, I'm controlling it, I am who I am.   I guess if I don't hide my feelings, I should say that, I still love him. I don't know why, I can't deny it, and I'm not. I just do.   Some may think I'm crazy, but real feelings don't go away in one second. It takes time.
