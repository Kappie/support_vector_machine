Geez, do you think Barbie's a slut? Please don't ask, it came out of nowhere! She is I guess... why don't they have 'Three headed Barbie' or 'Mechanic Barbie' heeey what about 'I'm gonna go kick some ass Barbie' wow, I could work for Barbie! I can see it now... 'one girl was the whole reason that barbie went bankrupt...' err, great! Oh, my brother had Science GCSE test today! We spent all of last night revising then he said it was too easy today! Hey Laura you ok? Keep up those high hopes! (But please God, stop Izzy from singing!) Eeeek my birthday on the 9th and I still haven't got any party arranged! Eeek, oh and I have to ask about Rachel's party, I better go. Sorry about the boring blog, it's just it kind of looses the Vavavooom after you've typed the same thing about ten times. Have a nice day, bubi!
