But-it will be all good in the end! Anywho-I was so bored today! I went to go eat at Applebee's with my mom. It was good! Yummy...FOOD! I got to wear my new shorts today! I was so happy because me and Nessa wore them to school, it was cute! I also got a Frappuccino this morning! Mmm Mmm Good :o) Josuf came by today and visited me! He is so funny! We hung out for a little bit and got to talk because we usually don't get to...I played games today-it became a routine caus eI was so bored today! I had nothing to do at all! BORING! I am going to that funeral tomorrow! It is gonna be so sad. I feel so bad for the family. I wanna put my pic in this thing that is Hot or not thing...it is a webiste and supposedly people vote on whether you are pretty or not. I wanna do it because I am curious as to what people will think of me...So, that's what I will do for tomorrow..I just hope a lot of people do  not think I am ugly. That will be a discouragement! My brother was mad at me because there is this guy that he doesn't like that called  me and it got into a huge deal...I started to cry cause I thought he was mad at me. I hate when he is mad at me though! I also talked to Lucas, he is so funny! He makes me laugh so much and that is always a good thing when a guy can make you laugh a lot! Hehehe :o) So yah...I am talking to this guy Steve that I met through a weird way, but man, for those of you who know about Danny a.k.a the Faggot, I found of some stuff. He is so Stupid and so is his gf! I can't believe I ever believed anything he ever said to me. What a loser! But hey-we all learn from our STUPID mistakes! Or atleast I will! Never Again! It is so hard for me to trust poele though and that is something I am gonna have to work on. I just wish people would respect me enough to not lie to me! O well-it happens I guess. I wanna meet a guy that will truly care for me and like me for who I am! I mean, I want a guy that will make me laugh, smile, make me feel important and like, I dont know- I want A COOL GUY! My wish :) Yuppers...HI STEVE-SMILE :o) Thought I would say hi! Hehe...anyways-I am getting tired though. I still have no idea what I am doing on the 4th and I wish I knew! But yuppers, I have to go cause I am probaly being boring again :( Buh bye...Luv u's...Muah X O X O
