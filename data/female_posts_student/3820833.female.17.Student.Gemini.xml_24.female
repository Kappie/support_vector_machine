I took back my calculator from my younger sister even though she’s using it. I did not talk to my father. I don’t understand… Is it my fault again?  My mother left a plastic bag beside the rubbish bin. Inside the plastic bag still has some thing that she wanted to use later. My father threw away the plastic bag with all the rubbish (because it looked like rubbish). I reminded my mother not to put the bag there since it really looked like rubbish and I mistaken it this morning too. She did not listen to it and she just let it being there…. Then… When she came to ask me whether her thing was thrown, I know that she’ll definitely shout to my father if I don’t stop her when he came back. I tried to stop her. I explained to her. However, I feel frustrated that time. Trust me, I have already tried so hard to control my temper. Yet, I failed. I think I talk to her in impolite tone.   I don’t want her to shout to my father. I don’t want any wars to begin. It’s really very tired to see them argued everyday. I don’t want to see them scolding each other, complaining about another. Enough. It’s enough for me. I want a happy family. Not a family with hatred between the parents. I don’t want to listen to their complaints. I don’t want to hear them shouting to each other in the early morning… I don’t want …  Then, I cooked porridge to my sister whose face was puffed up after she went to the dentist. I planned to add in some egg to make the porridge tastier. She told me she cannot has egg these few days, then I asked her to got some porridge first before I add in the egg into the porridge. But she told me since THE PORRIGDE was not READY, and she did not want to have any. In fact, the porridge was well cooked. She did not appreciate my effort and yet she got on my nerves when I was irritated at the moment. Ok.. I saved some for her. I did not get any appreciation, not even one thank you from her. What I got? I got bad criticism. Why she must did that to me?   My mother scolded me. She scolded me that I purposely shouted to my sister because I want to show her my anger and dissatisfactory. Is it my fault? I did not mean that. She’s the one who come to irritate me.  I’m the one who did the housework today. I cleaned the laundry. I boiled the water. I cooked for them. But why they can’t see these?? Why they only saw the negative point?  Please tell me is it my fault to do so? Am I wrong?
