I woke up this morning so exhausted and groggy that I could not keep my contacts in (something that has never happened to me since I got them in the 4th grade) and was certain that the day was going to be awful.  But luckily I was totally wrong, I went out to lunch with Erica and Elie, went for a walk, got a pedicure and even had dinner with my family (grandparents included).  Then it hit me I hadn't even started on my homework, so from 8:00 until now I have been working frantically trying to get it finished.  On gorgeous days homework should be excused and there is nothing you can say to sway my mind....
