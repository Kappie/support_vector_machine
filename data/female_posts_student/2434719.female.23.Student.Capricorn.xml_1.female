(all people under 18 or family member or friends of family please disregard.)  ha did i tell you my mom found out i take birth control? it was hysterical.... she's like, oh, well, that's fine cause you're not having sex. i just smiled.   so i'm going to california! i'm pretty damn sure this time! i just wish i had definite plans about this fall. i don't know where i'm living.... that's hard. my bff was going to move up here, and we were going to live together.... but she might not anymore. so i was thinking i would probably be living alone, which is so expensive and that really really worries me. but my current roommate, who i love living with, said she wouldn't mind living with me again in the fall here at the apartment, which i would love to do too... but i don't know what i'd do about the summer. i wouldn't want to leave her stranded with rent. i couldn't do that. i guess i could find someone to sublease, but that doesn't seem too easy to do, honestly.  i know it'll work itself out, but you know how ancy i get about my living situation. i like things to be decided well in advance. i think this is one of the main things i stress about, my living situation. everything else can be chaos, but where i'm living has be completely settled.  oh yeah, i want to give a shout out to chuck! congratulations on your new job!! like i said, i can't think of anyone more deserving! you are awesome! (yay, go chuck go chuck kick butt kick butt).  oh hey you know what i miss....  MOST EXTREME ELIMINATION CHALLENGE SATURDAYS. now that's something to miss. and i miss having a washer and a dryer. i can't explain to you how much i hate not having one. can't explain...  catch yall later. love, hedish
