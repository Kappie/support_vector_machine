This song brings me memories from the summer of 2001 and my trip to Lappeenranta (http://www.lappeenranta.fi/) a few weeks before I traveled to Germany for a year. We had so much fun in the sun and in the evening with great people... It surely was a legendary trip, we were all single and so free. Now I'm not single any more (thank god!), my friends from Lappeenranta are even getting married and we're all much calmer now, but there are some songs that remind us of our wild past ;) And photos of course, too. Btw, added some new photos in the IRC gallery (www. irc-galleria.net).   It just so amazing how the time flies... I mean, year 2001 was about 3 years ago and in that time has happened so much. We've grown up a little once again, learnt something new etc. There are, however, also things that haven't changed, things that already were there 3 years ago and even before. Like being analytic, critical and so on. There are different forms of being "adult", I guess. I'm not quite sure if there's one right way to be adult, although a lot of people like to measure their being mature with parametres they have set for themselves. Funny. The older I'm getting, the less I know for sure. Even Sokrates said that the only thing he knows for sure is that he doesn't know anything. He understood how little he actually knows and that made him probably the wisest philosopher there is (or was;).   My studies begin on Monday. I'm excited, can't wait. My brain has been waiting for this for so long ;) And I meet new people, too! This means the beginning of studies that last for 6 years and after that I'll goddamn wise, haha. After that I'll be Phil. lic. i.e. MA (I guess) but I won't have a profession... So I'll have to think about that and try to find a job where I'd get practical experience, university IS, after all, pure theory.  I have a purring cat on my laps and I have only one hand free for writing ;) So I think I'll go and concentrate on the sweet Minka.
