After two strokes, a heart attack and much strife, happiness, anguish and joy over those years, Wally deserves a break.  Happy retirement, Wally and Henrietta.  Went to an  urlLink antiques show  this afternoon after spending the morning studying motivation and learning.  Found nothing of interest; acquired a sunburn.  Vigil Mass at 5pm.  Fairly normal (for us).  More to come...
