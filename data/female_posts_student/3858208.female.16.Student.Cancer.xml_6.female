Well, I suppose it is since it's completely my fault. I was up until 1:30 watching Thelma  Louise on TBS (good movie, sad ending but I loved it), then Chels and I watched Street Smarts until 2. So I finally got to bed around 2:15. Then Mom got me up at 9:30, yuck. I'm really going to have to start at least attempting to get back on schedule. Bed at 10, up at 6-6:30...Who am I kidding? I love staying up! And it's not like I can't function when I'm tired. Although, I do feel a hellva lot better when I'm well-rested. Oy vey.  I've decided that I need to take charge of this f*cking depression. I've been battling it for almost a year now, and it's about time I start really dealing with it. Maybe it's time to start a twelve-step plan or something. Actually, as lame as that could be, it might help. I'm going to work on that.  Sometimes it feels like the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that it would absolutely tear my family apart if I were to commit suicide. I hate that I don't feel like I have more to live for, but at the same time I feel lucky that I have  anything  to live for. Depression is a bitch in that you really don't know how to express yourself (such as now, I suppose) and that even when you do know how, you don't really want to. It's like it's easier to just keep it inside and try to ignore it away then it is to talk about it, deal with it.
