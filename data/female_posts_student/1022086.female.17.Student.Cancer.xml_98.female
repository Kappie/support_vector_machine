If you're part of the 2% who hasn't, copy this in your journal.   Whoa. I feel special.    For the past few days I've been up to saying hello and goodbye to friends and becoming ever more excited about my trip to Italy. I can't wait to see so many people and do so many things, and I can't wait to go through the old attic at our home up there and see what I can rediscover or actually discover-- Lord knows that uprooting and rerooting across the globe meant leaving so very much behind...  I have seen essentially almost everyone I had made plans to see, and that was very nice, considering that once I'll return I will be directed straight to hell (school, of course) and won't have time to do anything enjoyable for the most part. I even spent time with Ale. Whoa.Her life and mine have not exactly been coinciding in schedule very well lately. By the way, not only is the sucker going to see 311 without me while I'm gone, but also she may be able to get backstage passes. I'm happy for her and yet so very envious... hehe.  I'm having many mixed feelings about her tentative semi permanent move, but it had to happen sooner or later. It is really weird to realize that in only five years each one of us will have her own life and likely live in a different state or country than the other and spend only holidays together because that's all that life will allow. It happens. It's just that I love my sister so very much, so the aforementioned parting will be a little difficult, even if I have complained muchly about our relationship lately. I lied-- I don't honestly want her to go.   I have been packing, too. I haven't gotten very far, yet, either. Kind of not really as fun as it sounds.  My mother is getting on nerves more than she has been the past month, and I am glad to get away from her for a little while.  I'm not even there yet and I already fancy the idea of not coming back muchly. Furthermore, I am paranoid and think that something will happen between now and Tuesday at 4:30 p.m....  yes, I know, I know. I worry entirely too much... but I can't help it... and you honestly can't really blame me.    Whew.    I thought this would be semi-appropriate. Two more days, babay.
