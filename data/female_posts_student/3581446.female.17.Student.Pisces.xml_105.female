The modern cinema simply does not understand the concept of the Greek Hero. Achilles is supposed to be a mindless killer, not some guy who, similar to Eric Bana in Hulk(A horrid film), but to a lesser degree, tries to act all "deep" and feel bad about being a mindless killer.  Wow...What a great day. I've just been sitting here at home all day. That's ok though, the Florida heat is absolutely blistering, and the humidity, well, you could fill a cup with it...  I killed 6 wasps! *Rebel Yell, Harley Noises, Other Redneck Sounds* I have done my part to make the world a cleaner, safer, and more employed place. What have you done? Hm?  I just watched that movie Bowling for Columbine. I downloaded it...Heh.Heh. The joke's on you Michael Moore! Heh. Dude! Where's my...nevermind...
