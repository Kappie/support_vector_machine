Everybody, and everything, comes to an end.  When our lives end, someday, we'll live again in another form.   We don't know when our lives might end. What we know is that it ends.  So we better make the best of our everyday lives. We don't know when we'll be taken away from our bodies.   Do all the good things you can do while you're still alive - in short  magpaka- holy  kayo .  If you've done something bad, start a new life.  Read another book .
