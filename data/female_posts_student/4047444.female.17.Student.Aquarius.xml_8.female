Which wasn't exactly what I was going for...But... Also, what the fuck is with Danielle staying overnight there? Obviously she would have had to sleep right next to him, there isn't any other space. I haven't really ranted about that yet, but it really pissed me off to know that. Maybe they're just friends, but they always seem to flirt a lot and I wouldn't be surprised if something happened. I want to ask him, but I know he's not mine, and I don't want him to even get the sense that I'm jealous or trying to be possessive at all. Because really I'm not, I'm just damn curious...Cause I really don't want to be just another girl he fucks. I'm god damn sick of that nonsense. Maybe it's too much to ask to be the only current fuck friend. Whatever...  He did in fact call me Thursday and came and saw me and stayed overnight on Wednesday after work. But he obviously was too busy last night, our days off to do anything. Whatever, again. But I must say it was pretty fun when he stayed over, we had a threesome with Sheila. I must admit it was very interesting, I've never done it before. I was a very spoiled brat, because they bother we're just going nuts for me. And I was a little jealous when Steph and Sheila kissed and when he started doing stuff to her...But I guess it didn't really bother me, it was only Sheila...I would have been hurt if they had sex though. But anyways, there are other things going on in my life besides the rantings of boys... The situation with my parents is a little better...I don't really know what to say about this topic. There is soo much to go into about that they think, my "behaviour" and such. They're constantly rhyming these behavioural things I'm doing that they dislike, but I'm hardly caught in the act doing them, in my opinion. Like the last thing they got pissed off about what that Steph and I were up at 5am still and they were pretty pissed off. I don't know...I don't even feel like getting into this, it's stupid. It's also boring to rant about... On the upside, I plan on getting smashed tonight...I haven't been really drunk and much too long. So tonight, I won't have any weed, (although I'll be jonzin' for it, I can tell already) I'm just going to drink, cause She is having a little shin dig. Wooo! Now, next issue, whether to call and invite Juan and Steph....? I probably will, I don't want to disturb him and his girl of the day though... He is really sweet to me when he's around, but I can't tell whether is fake or forced....Who knows. Some guys are very smart like that, they know acting like they like you and being sweet with gestures and words will make most girls very attracted to them and more open for sexual activity..Which in my case is true. I'm not embarrassed about it either. It's not like it's a bad thing.... anyway...I'm very into my Nirvana and Kurt lately... Courtney Love was lucky, or was she? I can't quite tell. I shall write about the aftermath of this party...Of course I will.  Until then...
