Special bonus:  Tom-Tom Club (led by Talking Heads bassist Tina Weymouth) doing "My Boyfriend", currently being revived in (Honda, I think?) commercials.  But, of course, singer/ songwriter/ leader David Byrne is the major presence in this video.  If you've never seen it, GO GET IT!  Thanks to Ching for sharing her wedding pix.  Did she look happy or what?  Hey Net, tell the hopelessly Anglo among us (that would be me) what the tea ceremony is!  It's a Chinese thing, right?  At least you guys don't do English jokes with Tagalog punchlines anymore...
