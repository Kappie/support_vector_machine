A pair of pants has to go through several rigorous test.    1. They have to fit well around the waist.  I have to wear a belt most of the time though.   2. They have to have a good length.  They can't be too long because I'm not that tall.  But then they can't be too short so when I sit you can see my socks either.  3. This is the one most pants fail.  They must pass the shoe test.  I can not stand it when pants bunch up around my shoes!  I know this can be altered with a little snip and I usually end up doing this to most of my pants.   4. As vain as it may sound, they have to fit good in the tushy. If your pants are baggy in the butt it makes your butt appear flabby.  That's just gross.    shirts...easy enough.  Pants...a pain in the ass.    okay, so the thing that sparked that was my shopping adventure to Hollister yesterday.  I bought a pair of tan pants that are really cute, but I think they'll end up getting cut.  I also bought a pair of blue jeans that are going back.  Once I brought them home I realized they didn't pass two of the above tests.    Last night was my nephew Alex's second birthday party.  I have the cutest nephews ever and I'm up to argue that.  I kept my hair straight for the party and everyone said such nice things.  (Don't worry all, it's back to curly now) My uncle told me the only reason my dad doesn't like it is because I look more mature.  I can handle looking more mature.  Then we somehow got into the piercing thing.  I want to get my ear pierced up on the top and I want to get my belly button pierced.  My uncle asked me if I was in my rebellious stage.  Why is piercing considered rebellious?  This post has been brought to you by boredom. ~Kay  So I thought I'd just edit and add to this one.  Tonight Tyler, my dad and I went to church.  Mommy's really ill with the flu that has been going around our house.  It is only a matter of time for me I'm afraid.  I have the worst immune system!  This Sunday was more rewarding than the last.  I was once again reassured that God loved me!  It was Father Joe's last mass in our parish.  I'm gonna miss that guy.  He did a lot for St. Michaels.  I pray that God is with him as he trys to do the same for the new parish.  Alan didn't really sing as much tonight but let the girls in Morning Star take over the task.  This did not please me!  Alan is pretty and has such a pretty voice.  Joel was there tonight too.  I don't know what it is about Joel but everytime I see him my heart skips a beat.  I don't know how to explain it other than to say that I get really nervous when I see him but then I'm really happy that he's there too.  If only he was three years younger...or I three years older.  Hot boy from confirmation was there too.  Too bad he's going to the new parish and goes to O'G.  Damn, that boy made confirmation a lot more enjoyable.  Or atleast gave me something to look at to pass the time.  After church we went to Calvers.  I don't recommend the chicken tenders...they weren't very good.  Then Brad came over and we exchanged cds.  I definitely put in Sugarcult as soon as you left and loved it.  My cousin Courtney called today and said she's going to have a baby.  I think it's funny my uncle Terry's gonna be a grandpa. I have something else I want to talk about but I think it is too soon.  So I'll wait till a later day.   ~alyak
