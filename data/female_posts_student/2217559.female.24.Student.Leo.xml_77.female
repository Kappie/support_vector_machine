Guess we have crossed the canadian border. We are in Victoria, B.C. tomorrow then a day at sea and back in San Francisco on Monday. I have begun to pack up a bunch of things to send home. I don't know how I got everything on this ship initially. I have bought a ton of books while I have been here though. A lot of educational books and some "out there" reading.  I read the Idiot's Guide to the Roman Empire. Took me a couple of weeks to get through it but I learned quite a bit which helps me really take a stab at the greeks when necessary. I also bought an english to spanish dictionary and I didn't really read that one. Just skimmed trhough when we were in Mexico to brush up on my Spanish skills. I have a hundred dvds now as well.  Snding those all home. Hopefully I will not have any problems with customs getting these things off the ship.   I just got out of meeting and learned that I am getting a pay raise which is exciting. They are making it retroactive from January so it will be a nice bit to add to my savings. Yipppee.  Tonight's formal and I am running around getting last minute arrangments made. No Midnight Buffet tonight which is great because I hate hosting it at 11:30PM.  I am tired by the end of the night I just can't find the energy to be funny anymore. Hahaha. I am more on the lines of just funny looking.   I am looking forward to my toobing vacation in late June.  If anyone else is interested, let me know. I will forward the booking information to you for the cabins. I think we have confirmed June 28th or something - whatever the date is of the weekend BEFORE 4th of July.   OH YEAH - I finally saw that movie Elf with Will Farrell last night. Hysterical! I laughed my head off. "Who needs a hug??"  No news really here, just wanted to say hello and kill a bit of time. Sweet hugs to everyone and I will see you in 2 weeks!!! Yippee!!!  Shelly
