ANd i was with him last night he said those little words. like, actully whisperd them into my ear. Like, what the fuck am i s'pose to say to that?! i can't say it back, cuz i dunno if thats how i actully feel. I think people just throw the words 'i love you' around liek nothing. and i'm not saying I don't do i either. ANd i mean, how do i know Jamie isn't jsut syaing that to get in my pants? like, UGH! i wanna be single again! WEll no, i don't. just i love being single having the freedom of not having to worry about any of the shit liek this *this is off topic, but toothaches really suck, my tooth is freaking out in the back of my mouth* When Jamie said that to me i didn't know what to say back. I just asked him how he could love someone he's only known a little over 3 weeks. i can't remember what he said (and it's driving me crazee) but i never said it back, and i really dunno how he took it. And, i like him, alot. I just... don't think i'd be able to actully say the words out loud, if i was sure I loved him. Maybe if i wasn't so confused abotu the whole thing, and i knew for sure how i felt i could say them. but right now i couldn't. ugh this is confusing and stupid.
