I shall borrow Jenna's word, and describe it as the 'shiz'. Not only is it hilarous, it is enlightening. Having rather radical views of organized religion myself, I can relate to the movie's ideas of faith. For example: I think Jesus was married to Mary Magdalen, he had siblings, and the Bible is gender biased. I don't consider myself spiritual...more of an observer. I am keeping my options open.   On a lighter subject.... New Years Resolutions. I agree with Satpreet on the point of why try to make yourself a better person only once a year, but in the honor of tradition... here is mine: 1. Swear more.  Why is this a resolution of mine, you may ask. Some people may have one to actually swear less (like my sister for example). Well, in my head, I cuss all the time...why not express it verbally? People are always so shocked when I do swear, which is odd (at least to me) because words are just words. However, I absolutely despise when every other word that comes out of one's mouth would be censored on national television.  2. To get kissed by next year. At frist I debated whether or not to put this on my website, for the mere fact that everyone would be able see it. I finally said screw it, who the hell cares? I am pretty sure only my friends even read this, and they probably share the same resolution. It is embarassing that yes, I am 15, and yes, I have not been kissed yet, but neither has anybody I regulary converse with.  God... I am so glad no boys read this... that I know of...  Oh! I have a correction to make. I said I would be watching Dick VanDyke on new years... but I really meant Dick Clark. Of all the Dicks in the world....I get them confused.  Speaking of the name Dick.... there was a man arrested named Richard Head  a while ago. And, as we all know, the nickname for Richard is....? Yup, thats right...Dick.  Dick.....Head.... Dick Head. Wanna guess what he was arrested for? Child molestation. That probably had NOTHING to do with the fact he was most likely teased relentlessly as a child. Geeeezzzz his parents were stupid.   Hey! I just got a letter from this poem publishing thing I entered online, and they want to put my poem in a book. I am pretty sure it is just a rouse to get you to buy the book, but it still cool. I am gonna allow them to publish it none the less, so at least the poor saps that do buy the book can see it.  Wanna see it? Sure ya do...  The Water  The water washes As the sun shines As the grass sways And as the seagull talks. I walk with wind As the sand floats by.  Like it? I am not particulary proud of it.. it could be better... but hey!  And now I must leave you. Please don't cry.. it doesn't flatter your features.  Parting is such sweet sorrow.  Unless the person you are parting from is the person you never wanted to be parted with in the first place.
