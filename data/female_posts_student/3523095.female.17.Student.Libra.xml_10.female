Tomorrow is Monday...another week starts. Can I ask? Should I ask? Maybe its not inappropriate. Well, I know myself. If I were to make a comment or express my opinion...then things are going to get ugly. And the worst part is that its regarding some other people...but I have known about it and yet...I didn’t attempt to warn or advice or at least tell them to be careful... so is it my fault? If the parents come looking for me how? Its gonna look like I actually “endorsed” the problem. Am I annoying you by not telling what its about? Well I am sorry. The nature of this thingy is like that. I cant say it out. Its not about me...somebody else.  Oh wel... all I can do is pray. Am not stuck in this sticky mess because of my fault anyway. Its their “fault”. Personally I wont call it a fault. Its just a false sense of security. A sense of superiority. The alter ego took control. Hiazz. These things happening at a time like this. Seriously I just don’t know what to do. Am so overworked and now there is an extra problem to bug me. Here I am tell nanda to sleep early...but I am sleepin so late. Even when werk is done [which is neverending by the way] I keep thinking and thinking late into the night. Cant seem to stop thinking all kind of weird things. They just pop up when its nite time...the only time I entertain all these thoughts is at nite...so...I guess they get blown out of proportion by that time...paranoia sets in.   That aside...the lady who I met at wisma called me when I was having A math. Her name is caroline. Sweet lady. I told her that I am not in. She ask me to pass a message to myself to tell me to ring her. Confusing eh? Ya.  I’m wondering if I should give her a ring. She wants to um...sell me tickets to this church play. I dont mind going. But I dont have time on my hands right now. Neither do I have the money to buy it. My tutor said “you lied.” And that made me feel kinda bad. Actually I feel guilty. REAL guilty... you know... I think I am becoming this very emotional person. Its not necessarily bad. It just feels weird larr. Verrry weird. And I got so much to say these days. Think I have really gone nuts. You think so??? I seem to think so.  Someone told me my blog looks boring. Its too plain  too white they say. This is what I have to say: this is MY blog....i repeat  MY  blog. If you think its boring. Don’t come here. If you think the song it too slow...turn your volume down. You cant switch it off anyway. If I sound too cliché, don’t read. In short, get lost if you think I suck along with my blog. What you see...is what you get. I don’t fake my posts...and I dont need to write fancifully coz I aint that kinda person.  End of message...  Yet again, i have finished narrating my boring life to you. If you are here already...Thanks for reading. If you were waiting to condemn, you can do so now.  bubbye.
