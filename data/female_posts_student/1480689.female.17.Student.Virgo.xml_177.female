I wonder how's it gonna be, When you don't know me? How's it gonna be, When you're sure I'm not there? How's it gonna be, When there's   no one there to talk to  ? Between you and me 'Cause I don't care, how's it gonna be How's it gonna be? Where we used to laugh, There's a shouting match Sharp as a thumbnail scratch   A silence I can't ignore   Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in, Swings empty I don't see lightning like last fall when it was always about to hit me I wonder how's it gonna be, when it goes down?   How's it gonna be, when you're not around?   How's it gonna be, when you found out there was nothin' between you and me? 'Cause I don't care, how's it gonna be And how's it gonna be, when you don't know me anymore? And how's it gonna be Wanna get myself back in again The soft dive of oblivion I wanna taste the salt of your skin The soft dive of oblivion, oblivion How's it gonna be,   when you don't know me anymore  ? How's it gonna be How's it gonna be How's it gonna be Hmmm
