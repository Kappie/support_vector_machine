I do however need to do this. My summer will be lonely; I feel it. With Futt Buzz, Stino, Chocolate Momma, and Mr.Oscar gone I will wander around here with aching thoughts swirling around my head in circles. I hope that this will serve as a release. Up until now my release has been poetry. Due to emotional/physical experiences this has somewhat dried up but now and then a trickle does come forth. Here are most of my poems if anybody is interested. www.allpoetry.com/poets/Wind%20Child But I think that I will wrap it up here; I am tired and it's 12:30, I am wishing I were not here but 2 hours to the south, curled up in M's (aka Mr. Oscar) arms, knowing it can't happen, generally feeling sorry for myself, and very overfond of semicolons; they just look so useful.
