BUT NO!!! my god. and i got a good grade on my presentation too. so he really marked me down on the actual magazine. it's just not right. cuz my magazine looked pretty good if i do say so myslef.  grrr and the second point. my water polo coach came to practice mad. and yelled at us during the scrimage. i didn't even do something bad and he completely barked at me. (not literally of course) and then the other coach told me not to worry cuz it wasn't my fault. which it wasn't. so my first coach was just yelling at everyone today. and lemme tell you, when your coach is like 6 feet already, and then you're down floating in the water. IT's Freaking scary lemme tell you. Sigh yeah so i WAS having a good day. and then 5th period rolled around... and then it just went down to loo. poopoopoo. grrrrr hm ok well i think that's pretty much it.  Post again later -drea ps days till my b-day:3
