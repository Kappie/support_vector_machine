"cool people are cool because they make their own coolness." i like my hair when it behaves how it is supposed to. my bangs are out of line and need discipline. this weekend could possibly be terrible because i have a family vacation to attend. i'll just steal away into the woods and write deep thoughts in a secret journal. then scatter them piece by piece into the lake. at night. during a storm. this keeps getting better and better...
