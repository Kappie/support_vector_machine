I can annoy you all! :P Hey, I DON'T DO VIRUSES! Hallelujiah! Hmm... hallelujia! halelujia? hajellila? Hmm... let me go consult Microsoft Word... Aha! Wow... Microsoft is kind of good for some thing! If only it could do my homework! Hallelujah (It should have an i in it...) Definatly! Nih! Sorry, too much Monty Python! Mmm... every one went too serious today. Maybe too much for me, seeing as every one was telling me to shut up all the time! Ahh heck, who wants to be depressed? I better go... chop potatoes and stuff... Wohooo! Yeah, that's my hobby... chopping potatoes... Imagine doing a piece of French Coursework on that! Ok, so biiiii!
