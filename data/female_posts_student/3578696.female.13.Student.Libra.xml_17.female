Every time you are near?-----> it always happens to me.  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.----> i always want to be around him.   Why do stars fall down from the sky-----> yes why do they?  Every time you walk by?-----> i just fall for you.  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.   On the day that you were born  and the angels got together----> when were u born again?  And decided to create a dream come true---> o its a dream come true alright!   So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair---> that's why ur hair is so shiny!   And starlight in your eyes Like they do---> ooh those eyes!  That is why all the guys in town---> o really they d?!  Follow you all around---- u never told me that!  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.   If only for a minute  I’d settle for an hour---> 'cos its too long!  And if you could stay just for one day  That would make me so happy happy baby---> o so happy!   See it won’t hurt to give our love a try--> just once!  Girl don’t u pass me by---> yea don't just pass by love!  Cuz I’m that kind of guy--> cuz im that kind of girl!  Who’s going to love and treat you like a queen---> more like a king   That is why all the girls in town  Follow you all around---> o so now i have competition!  Just like me, they long to be  Close to you.---> yes they do!   Come a little closer baby--> come more closer than that!  Lay your head up on my shoulder baby---> come on cry! Boy you know I cant deny it--> can't deny love!  You done already set my soul on fire--> ooh come on baby light my fire.   Just like me, they long to be Close to you...---> yes they do!
