Work is horrid, relationships suck, and hole generated by the calories I burn at my job is immediately filled when I indulge myself in a three-dollar heath icerage afterwards. I need to call Ash but I'm on the depths of despair. I'm at the beginning of a long mood swing, a great bout of depression I haven't experienced in over seven months. I've had almost-longings of old friends, but thankfully haven't sunk so low to try to rekindle anything. Aloof and astute, that's me...or is it?    I HATE my depression. It comes at me in a rush, taking me by surprise (although in my subconscious I know it is inevitable) and leading me to a special hell reserved for my mind and body. A constant loathing of one's self, bitter hatred concerning one's body, occasional suicidal thoughts (none so far, this time) and a nightmarish feeling that every person is criticizing me all the time. This happens way too much. I hate it. I don't know if any words I give allusion to can represent these feelings as accurate as I would like. I read recently an article about silver amalgam tooth fillings consisting of half-mercury, a horribly dangerous neurotoxin, which leak mercury into your bloodstream and consequently your brain all the time (look it up if you don't believe me). 90% of people, after getting their silver fillings removed, never experienced depression again. I wonder if that's the kind of fillings I have...they certainly are all silver.     And like I said earlier...I don't have any clue about my newest assignment. The questions are hard. I can't comprehend them. They can mean any of three things to me at times. I wish they were easier to understand. Such as, "What are contemporary activities and influences from Greece that overlapped the early developments in Italy?" What the hell does that mean?    God this entry is dark. Just ignore it, okay? It's total crap things coming out of my brain from somewhere-I-don't-know-where.
