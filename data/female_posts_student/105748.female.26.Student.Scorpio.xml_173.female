My friends and I added the extra ones later on, Darth Vader as Adrian's Father-in-Law.  And Jabba the Hut as the Mother in Law... oooohhhh.  When the inlaws saw it.. they wondered who those caracters were suppose to be.   Well it was all in good fun.      Speaking of Steak, Last week was Restaurant Week in New York City.  Dot and I went to Smith and Woolensky with her cousin Kim and Kathy.  For 30 dollars you can order from the Prix Fixe Menu; appetizer-soup or salad; main course- Fillet Mignon; then dessert- Cheese Cake or Chocolate Mousse Cake.  Fillet Mignon is Medium Rare of course but for the 30 dollar price it was worth it!!!  Normally, a Steak dinner will cost around 60 dollars and up on average at Smith and Wollensky.  It will cost extra for the appetizer plus again for the dessert.  I think I spent about 200 dollars the last time I went at Smith's two years ago.   Glee, were you on a vegan or lacto-vegetarian diet?    Net    PS My brother Joe is running on the NYC Marathon this weekend. Volunteer water boys welcome...=)
