As I continued surfing, I came upon the Playboy 50th Anniversary Special on tv.  Hmmm...interesting...okay.  I stopped at that channel only because they were showing Kelsey Grammer and I absolutely adore Frasier.  And then I was hooked. I learned that my misguided thoughts of Playboy being some slutty, crude, pornographic corporation are completely incorrect.  While I do think that Hugh Hefner should be retiring soon, I do commend him for running such a vast empire into his senior years.  No matter what company, managing is tedious and difficult (I sound like I own a company and know what I am talking about).    Here's some things I learned.  Playboy publications are distributed all over the world in many (I failed to remember the exact number) different languages.  However, in China, distribution of these publications are banned.  Hmm...interesting.  Also, the girls who are the "playmates" are really nice.  Seriously.  I pictured some stuck-up whores who smoke and have bags under their eyes.  But these girls  have proved me wrong.  A lot of them attend prestidgious (sp?) universities like Harvard, they have down to earth personalities, and seem to be the type of girls that a man wouldn't mind bringing home to meet the 'rents.  One thing that does amaze me, however, is that these young girls--full of potential--are interested in having sex with Hugh--a hobbling, saggy skinned man in his 70s.  Truly, I think these gorgeous, intelligent girls could do a lot better.  At the party, the girls were all huddled around Hugh dancing and nibbling on his ears, when there are hundreds of dashing, charming princes standing with lonely tears in the corner.  It is just a mystery to me.  Hugh is the peak definition of a chick magnet.  Next, I tried to picture myself as one of those girls running around in the little bunny suits.  I thought it might be fun for a day, and then out loud said to myself a stern No.  It was the kind of No that when voiced aloud, the little voice inside your head says, What the hell are you thinking, *insert your name here*?!  With that, I turned off the tv.
