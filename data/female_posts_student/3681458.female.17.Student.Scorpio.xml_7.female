I, being the loser that I am wanting to hold on to this for future reference, made a copy of it, and threw it in my junk drawer.  His name was David and he was my dream guy.  He was 6'3, jet black hair and an olive complexion, and he had deep chocolate eyes.  His Mom was Haiwaiian, so he was gorgeous.  He was in a band, and played electric guitar.  He was musically talented and wrote songs for me.  He played guitar, drums, piano, mandolin and so many other instruments.  I don't think I ever got to the point of possibly falling in love with him.  I broke up with him, b/c I was afraid of "getting hurt".  I walked away from that relationship without crying a tear.  We were together for nearly six months, and it was my first serious relationship.  David now weighs nearly fifty pounds heavier, he never leaves his house, and doesn't talk to anyone anymore.  I broke his heart.     I look back and realize how many guys hearts I have broken.  The list is long and I'm only seventeen.  I have grown bitter against guys, and I'm not afraid to shoot them down.  I have decided I'm going to try to be nicer.    The reason I say all of this, is I'm letting my self be madly in love with Matt.  I don't to walk away from him and not feel a thing.  If my heart is broken, so be it.  This is what I want.  I want to feel love and pain in this relationship.
