     
      Been a long time.  I took me a few weeks to recover from the dual disappointment of the low turnout for the last show and the fact that Eric was leaving town.  Was ready to scrap the whole thing and move on.  Did some thinking about the format, asked for and received some interesting feedback, and have decided to give it one more shot.  Tuesday, June 29 @ 8pm.  Bassey.  Omar.  Who knows what might happen?  If nothing else, I'm going to have fun with it, regardless of what happens. Otherwise, what's the point?
