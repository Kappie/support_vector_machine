Anyways, on the up-side, I did get my History test and paper back and got 86% on them both, which is so completely awesome.  But regardless of this wonderful academic quality that I have, I still don't think that I should talk to any more people.   I've found that  I get loud and obnoxious when I'm flirting, and this happens unconsciously, as though the person the flirtation is directed act is going to understand this verbal act at all . Ugh!  And it's too bad that I've got this funny thing going on too... here let me impress you with my funny joke making skills . Ok, so I'm wondering, where are the awesome single guys at?  I soo hope I get kissed on the day that I turn 23. That would be soo very awesome. ...Ok I'm done ranting for now.
