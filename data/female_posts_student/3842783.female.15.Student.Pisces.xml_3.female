About my room, it is pink, It is small and nice, It is near my sister's room"najma" and that is a problem ;( except that it is comfortable. I have a very big bed, I can move from the right side to the left side. My first day, when I slept on my bed I fall on the ground more than once, Najma said : I heard  booom ..baaam ...Boom ...baam  :) I cleaned my room today, and I found my copybook when I was in the examination days last month. When I saw it, I felt my heart broken into two peaces ..ah .. ah ...........thanks god it ended. I love to pretty my own room with   bears   and the things that I love, because that give me back my memories and that give me good feeling.  you can also see when you look at my room' small desk, I have :   Stories ,  history books,and poetry books there are Islamic books too. I love read story, Islam and poem but the others, I don't .   the funny story to you , when I sleep, my eyes are nearly open and that scares. When my aunts came to Mosul from Baghdad, they didn't accept to sleep with me in the same room :( one day when I was sleepy my sister "Najma" told me  :  don't forget to close your eyes, ha ha ha ha ..That is not funny, is it ?? :) ........
