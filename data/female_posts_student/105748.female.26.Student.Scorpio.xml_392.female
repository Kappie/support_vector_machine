Is it also possible to justify the description on the side (where my short self-description goes)?  Sorry if I sounded so anal about this. I just wanted everything to be uniform. Thanks again! :)     Sheryll:  Nope, I am not sure anymore if I will be going back there in July. Jeff will be teaching summer school and Ching's wedding is in the beginning of August. I may not have enough time to travel back.  My whole family is planning a big reunion in the beginnning of August which I may not be able to attend to as well. It is a bummer I know but since I am only working part-time, I can't afford to pay for all my travel plans. Nothing is definite yet but, I will keep you guys informed if ever Jeff and I decide to go back.
