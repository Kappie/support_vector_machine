Okay so, it's safe to say that had they put everything in right the first time and not dropped my starter, I would have had my car on monday.  Now I'm not getting it until tomorrow...if all goes well.  The one thing that seriously pissed me off was that they put the same chick on the phone that I talked to yesterday.  This woman had absolutely no idea what she was talking about.  None what so ever.   You know what I love?  Nip/Tuck.  Great show.   I'm not looking forward to going to work.  So, not.  I hate my job.
