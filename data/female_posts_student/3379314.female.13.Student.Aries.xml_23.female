When I'm 18 i'm going on a road trip with zoe  When im 14 in the summer of '05 im going to Africa to help people One day I'm going to meet usher and ask him to marry me  But when we get the chance to do these things. do we? would if i do meet usher. will i bend down on my knee and ask him to marry me? will i actually go to africa where its very poor and help people. will i ever? but i still say to myslef that no doubt about it i will do it! i will drive for hours  with zoe and end up no where. i will! and thats my future. and thats how it may or may not be...  sam
