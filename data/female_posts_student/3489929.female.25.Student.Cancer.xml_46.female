You like to feel the waters around you, but now things seem to be more in the realm of action than of feeling.   Think about the tides. They rise. They fall. Things change. The waters will return. In the meantime, do something that nurtures your soul and makes you feel better about yourself.    And THAT is why I'm spending the day with my mommy at Hallmark.  Very poetic. :)
