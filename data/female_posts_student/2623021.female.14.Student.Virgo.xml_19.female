Life  is a game, play it.   Life  is a promise, fulfill it.   Life  is a sorrow, overcome it.   Life  is a song, sing it.   Life  is a struggle, accept it.   Life  is a tragedy, confront it.   Life  is an adventure, dare it.   Life  is luck, make it.   Life  is too precious, do not destro it.   Life  is life, fight for it.    Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.     Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.     A person's true wealth is the good he or she does in the world
