So here are the other links to the other sample templates, and maybe we can all agree on one that's not stupid looking ;o)        urlLink Star one          urlLink other one like star one       urlLink the one that reminds me of apples       urlLink the scripty one  (ooh it looks all letter like)      urlLink pinkish funky one       urlLink bluish funky one       urlLink "tequila" funky one       urlLink greeny one       urlLink blue version of "greeny one"       urlLink original one       urlLink original one in blue     Soooooooo pick one, and just tell me which one you want in the comments. PLEASE NOT THIS ONE! And anyways, this one isn't an option! It's cute, but just looks ugly. Hopefully later I can find one that we all like that's free. We can pay to get them done, but like - who has money to waste on this sort of thing, cause I sure don't!
