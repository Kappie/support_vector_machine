They ended up needing our seats, so we got $300 each in airline credit, plus our hotel and shit.  The next flight they could get us on left at 8:10 in the morning, but then we would've had to wait at the airport until mom could pick us up at 6.  So we took the 11:30 instead, had an hour layover in Detroit, and finally got to Milwaukee at 3:30.  Then we had to sit in the waiting area until 6, and by that point dad was pissed at mom for being late, then we all had to sit in the car together until we got to Janesville, THEN we had to go out for dinner... That sucked, b/c mom talked on the phone pretty much the whole time, including a long conversation w/ her boyfriend in fond du lac, all while my dad was sitting right next to her.  That was great... We'd been home two hours and they were already on the verge of killing each other.  But finally around 9 we got home, and I just took my stuff in my room and shut the door.  Said hi to my kitties and puppies.  Called Ken and he came over.  He watched me unpack and I showed him stuff, then he showed me pics from PA, then we talked and blah until he left around 1, then I went to bed.  Woke up at 8 this morning.  Did some random stuff for awhile, then got on the comp...  I still have to call everyone... Bethy, Lainie, Sam I'll call you for sure today.  Robert...  I'll talk to sometime this week.  I need to call Nicole b/c I haven't talked to her in awhile, and I have postcards for Mande and Heathy that I need to give you guys...  My dad's an asshole...  He never renewed our sub. to the milton courier... which would explain why we never got the one w/ the play pic in it, which I really wanted.  And I like to read it b/c I know people in Milton and shit...  Another thing - does anyone remember Tabitha Braden?  I haven't really talked to her much since middle school, and then last night I found out from Ken that she died in her sleep on sat. night.  That's depressing...  Earlier this week I was thinking about going out w/ Ken to see her sometime soonish, but yeah...  Anyway...  I get my wisdom teeth pulled tomorrow... That'll be great.  Just great.  Simply fabulous.  So Weds and Thurs are gonna suck, but I'm still going to try to find time to hang w/ Lainie and everyone.  Friday night I'm partying at Robert's.  I'm feeling party-deprived.   I really wanted to go to Robert's last night, too bad my dad's a jackass...  So yeah.  That's about it for now.  I think I'm gonna go start calling people and whatnot.  Later!
