It's about ready to rain, I started an amazing book today, I'm listening to good music, I'm talking to swell people, and I'm about to hang out with Danny, Meredith and Jacko! YAY  Anyways. I love storms.. well rain basically. I love rain, but especially warm rain. Oh man, it's one of the most beautiful, relaxing, wonderous things. I love rain! Me=freak. I want someone to ask me to marry them in the rain. Dammit, i'm hormonal again! Hah  About the book, it is called   Sophies World  , I think. Anyways, It's a great philosophical book, so far. I like it emensely.  Oh man, I was thinking, isn't it weird that you meet everyone out of pure coincidence? Basically, it's weird the world is the way it is.   Did you know it supposedly took the first "human" species over 1,000 years to develop their first utencil?  Through evolution, the human brain has developed a lot, obviously. Did you know that apes have tools to gather food and such? So maybe someday, they'll be like us... and just think what we humanoids will be like then, we'll probably be dead, but who knows.  I wish I could take away the intelligence of the modern age away from myself. Take away the modern schooling, the explainations about the world, just everything. I want to know how I would view the world, with a child's innocence and endless wonder and curiosity.
