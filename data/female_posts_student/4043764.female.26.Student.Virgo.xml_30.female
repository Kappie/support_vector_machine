For some reason - perhaps it was the stint in Sierra Leone (though I actually had CNN for the many months I was *there*) - I have not been able to get really excited about the upcoming presidential election. Certainly, I can think of nothing better than a sound defeat of GWB, but... I'm just not *feeling* Kerry and Edwards quite yet.  Anyone who knows me knows that my current political ennui is strange, because my first major political debate was in the second grade. I was standing in the lunch line, contemplating a second "white milk"  when the boy whose last name came before mine turned back to me and asked, "So, who are you voting for in the election?" As if 7 year-olds can vote. Pshaw. I answered defiantly, "Mondale, of course. My daddy went to DC to work for Carter, so of course, Fritz Mondale. What about you?"  "Are you crazy? Reagan."  It was my first interaction with a Republican, and I. Was. Aghast.  I wanted to know WHY someone would even consider such a thing, voting for Reagan. I lived in my little comfy, middle-class black neighborhood, surrounded by doctors, teachers, nurses, social workers - none of them clued me in, not a single one of them let me know that people would actually *vote* for Reagan. He was an actor for goodness sakes. On a side note, I did not know that he was governor of California, didn't realize that he had already served a term as president, but I certainly knew that whatever he did in the past was not so good. Besides, I saw him in that chimp movie on TBS and thought he was too silly to be president. But anyway, I digress...  I went home and asked my brother, "Can you believe that there's a boy in my class - he's voting for Reagan?"  My brother, J, in his astute wise new teenage way, rubbed his peach-fuzzed chin and replied, "Well, I think that people just vote for someone who seems popular. He seems like he's just one of the guys..."  Boy, J does not know how fucking prescient his little Buddha moment was. Have we, as Americans, moved forward since 1984?  So, the reason I started this ramble is because I saw this  urlLink website  on  urlLink ms. grits ' blog. You do the little quiz and it tells you which candidates best match your preferences on certain issues. I am most compatible ideologically (?) with Kucinich (71%) and Kerry (68%).
