Yesterday I took a five minute snooze in English and today in history I took a ten minute nap.  I think it might have to do with me getting up at 4:50 to run.  Hmmm...  Well do anyo of you have good topics on Women's Liberation Movement?  I only have two more pages to write on my report and I'm all thought out.  I have been trying to download a song from the internet but it is kind of hard when you don't know the title.  All I know is the phrase "when my baby smiles at me I'm going to Rio, bum bum, Dejenaro" (I have no idea how to spell that, I'll use phonetics). I have begun to read Jane Eyre and think it is a really great book.  So far. I hope i haven't jinxed it.  I gotta go parce que j'ai besoin de traveiller en mon report. toodaloo! katie
