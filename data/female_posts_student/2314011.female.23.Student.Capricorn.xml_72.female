So today's been nice and productive; well, more nice  because  it's been productive, you know.  Got more than a few cases to review for the first writing assignment of the semester.  Research always sounds fun/easy/relaxed, etc. before you actually sit down to do it.  That's when the mind goes completely blank and any specific, insightful, cut-through-all-the-irrelevant-issues-key words floating around in your head earlier are completely gone and the only thing you can come up with is: US Constitution.  You may as well start a search for the blue prints of NASA's Rover with "telescope."  Then, when you finally get on a roll, nothing seems impossible.  You could write the whole assignment in 12 minutes!  No one's going to find these perfect, spot-on cases!  Certainly not in the time you've found them!    Ultimately, you have to sort through the mountains of paper you've amassed because you've printed off everything that could, in any way, possibly be interpreted to bear a vague resemblance to what the initial subject was.  And, inevitably, as the sorting, shifting, organizing begins, you realize that none, or very little, of it relates to the manifesto growing at rapid pace in your mind.  Then it hits you:  you're going to have to read all these cases to determine which ones actually apply to the assignment, regardless of what thoughts passed through your mind at first impression.    "Where's that ONE I KNOW applies?"  You ask yourself, frantically throwing unstapled papers around your desk.  "Just ONE!!  That's all I need!"  But the ONE is lost forever in the pile of other ONEs; they've lost all relevance and you have no choice but to take them all home, examine each in kind to determine just how much more work you have now compared to how much you had when you walked in 7 hours ago.    In the meantime, however, I was able to forget Friday night's disappointment, if only for a few fleeting moments.  Tuesday will be the true test, though.  Only then will I know for sure where I stand.  Just wish I knew for sure where I  want  to stand!
