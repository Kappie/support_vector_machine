Jay is the coolest guy i have ever met. wow. so anyway, geoff lost, horribly, and jay left. then Geoff and i chilled 'til about quarter to 9. he left and i called mike. then Geoff called.....at like 9:15........and we got off the phone at like 11:15. all i have to say, is that was one of the best and worst conversations of my life, but it was so ungodly necessary. Geoff, i love ya.   so i call Mike back, at like 11:20 and he and i had a very personal conversation as well, Mike you mean so much to me.    Both of these conversations are for my reccollection only. thank you.   *note to self- revelations and epiphanies hurt, but are so necessary, i forgive you. also, it scared me, but I'm gonna be ok. no pressure right? yeaaaa.*
