It was a quiet trip which I found a little strange. As me and my sister, (a 10th grader), got off the bus, Willie handed me a candy wrapper. I opened it as I walked to our house and read it. Then my sister read it. She runs in to call and tell her friend about it. For on it he asked me out. How sweet of him. We went for a while. Lost contact. Remet. And in February were back together. Being young nothing much happened. But I wish I had never broke it off. Now I wonder what would of happened.   It's sad.
