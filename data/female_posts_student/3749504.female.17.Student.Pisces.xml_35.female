Tazz, big cat, is on the left. Syntax Error, little kitten, is on the right. Syntax often pesters big cat and Tazz absolutely hates her. Hiss!              That's my brother. In his homemade garbage bag diaper. He was filling it with water and running around in the yard. For kicks, I guess. What a freak.
