       
      And if you know what I"m talking about, you're my new best friend/BFF/LYLAS/HAGS.  I am three days away from completing the death march known as finals week.  I'll be back next week sometime after I have turned in all my papers, assed my way through several presentations, and burned my apartment to the ground because it's an atrocious heap and I can't afford a housecleaner.  Peace out.
