Well I was supposed to call Shane and tell him what time the meeting was but he forgot to give me his cell number during lunch! (sorry) And now I'm home alone, blasting music, and being bored, hence the title of this post (which is also a lyric from the song "Welcome To The New South" by Less Than Jake). Wow, I just said hence. What a funny word.  Jubilee is sitting on my lap. She loves me. (Atleast someone does.) So now I'm just listening (still) to Yellowcard because they are an amazing band. If you have some time you should check them out.   Song: Broken this fragile thing now And I can't,  I can't pick up the pieces  And I've thrown my words all around But I can't,  I can't give you a reason   I feel so broken up (so broken up) And I give up (I give up)  I just want to tell you so you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do You are my only, my only one  Made my mistakes, let you down And I can't,  I can't hold on for too long  Ran my whole life in the ground And I can't,  I can't get up when you're gone   And something's breaking up (breaking up) I feel like giving up (like giving up) I won't walk out until you know  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go,  there's just no one who gets me like you do  You are my only my only one  Here I go so dishonestly Leave a note for you my only one And I know you can see right through me So let me go and you will find someone  Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you You are my only one I let go,  there's just no one, no one like you  You are my only, my only one  My only one  My only one My only one You are my only, my only one - Only One - Yellowcard    So Blast The Music And Sing Your Heart Out, Maybe, Just Maybe, It Will Make Things Better For Those 3 Short Minutes.
