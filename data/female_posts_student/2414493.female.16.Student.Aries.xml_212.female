There's an old McDonald's breakfast in the toaster right now. It's done. I'll eat it in a second, especially after Grandma gave me a sound lecture on eating breakfasts first thing this mid-morning.  The bio AP heading in front of me says Thermoregulation. Page 222.  I'm honestly so ready for this to be over. I know that's not deep, but think of all the crazy things I'll have time for once I finish this one bio AP. Needless to say, I am also driven by the usual Lydia desire (often irrational) to do well. But once I step out of that testing room, I can start enjoying the fact that the license comes in two weeks. I can actually go to class and not do anything since the teachers have pretty much stopped caring. I can sit back and relax, a bit...grades are ok. Oh, what an idyllic life that would be.  On the other hand, Austin isn't faring so well. I must have slept through it, for an apparent tiff over grades ocurred in the kitchen this morning: I see his grade printouts on the counter next to the Mother's Day roses and the balloons and I know it can't be good. What has he been doing this whole entire time? It's not like they're absolutely awful grades, but I'd really expect better from him. It's a strange sense of family pride, I suppose. He has B's. Damn him. He's only in the eighth grade, too--I think I'd be more likely to forgive him if he was at least in high school. Maybe it's an attitude problem of his, I know he has one. Or maybe it's because he spends too much time bumming on the computer. Whatever it is, he's in for some trouble.   And some of you might be laughing--B's, ha! Sometimes I just wonder how I grew up the way I am. The funniest thing is that I can honestly say I like my life, even though it might not seem like it with the stress. I'm reluctant to give all the credit to my parents, since they largely ignored my school performance when I was young anyways, and by the time it really mattered I'd learned to fend for myself. So why do I care so much about doing well? Why do I get a rush when I do well? Maybe it's just environmental support. Genes. At any rate, if I ever have a child, I want them to be just like me, exept I'd loosen the parental controls. Is that too weird of me? Too voyeuristic?  Breakfast awaits.
