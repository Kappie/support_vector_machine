My life is exciting, filled with excitement, and I am almost certain that I made it onto Honors w. Distinction.  Most of this week after school I have had rehearsal for the play.  Actually everyday except Wednesday.  However my wallet got stolen with money and all my cards so I have been doing lots of running around and then I had to file a police report to get a case number so I could get my learners cause I have my road test on Saturday.  Lots of running around!  Then next week I think I am going to the school a couple days because the Mid Summer Nights Dream cast is putting together the set and I think Megz, Justine, Jenna, Mandy, and I are going to finish all the dances.  So yeah I am a busy girl and filled with like tons of chocolate right now!!  That is like all I have had all week, but honestly it tastes good and it doesn't matter what I look like.
