Hence, this post combines the last two days and doesn't distinguish between the two.  The big shock is obviously the defeat of the Aussies in the 4 x 200m freestyle relay to the Americans. Needless to say, most Australians were devastated; we've owned the event since 1988. I missed the match and still haven't seen it (if anyone knows of existing video, please let me know) but I've heard it was VERY close. I've also heard that one Australian didn't really do his part. I can only assume it was the relative unknown  urlLink Nicholas Sprenger  but I jsut found out he swam his personal best in the race. If not him, I would assume it's Michael Klim but without having seen it, I can't be sure.  Continuing the agony are the Aussie women in the 4 x 200 freestyle relay who could only finish fourth (despite a brilliant effort from anchor Petria Thomas) whilst the Americans grabbed gold. It really wasn't a great night in the pool for Australia; though the silver lining (ha ha) was  urlLink Petria Thomas' medal  in the 200m butterfly. Also of note was Jodie Henry's  urlLink breaking  of the world record in the 100m freestyle final; she seemed genuinely delighted  surprised to beat the WR of fellow Aussie  urlLink Libby Lenton , who shocked by failing to make the final.  Still in swimming,  urlLink Leisel Jones  continues along the journey to shake the  urlLink choker tag  by qualifying for the 200m breaststroke and champion swimmer  urlLink Grant Hackett calls  for the 800m frestyle event to be included in the Olympic Games, which I would completely agree with. There's no reason to cut off endurance swimmers like that. Boo, hiss.  Continuing the updates on our  urlLink tutu   urlLink security breach , he's been given a whopping  urlLink 5 months in jail ! Is this not the perfect example of an excessive sentence in the name of giving a warning to others?!  As for the upcoming, Australian basketballers have the  urlLink perfect chance  to beat the "Dream Team" from the USA on Thursday - if not now, it'll probably be never.  My beach volleyball girls Pottharst and Lochowicz are well placed to challenge the  urlLink favoured American girls  after  urlLink finishing top of their pool  by beating Mexico in three sets. Likewise, the Aussie men Prosser  Williams also went through to the elimination round after beating Canada. I for one was surprised to see the popularity of beach volleyball in Greece, when the tradtionally popular gymnastics stands appear extremely close to empty on TV. It seems I've found  urlLink the reason .  p.s. In all the disappointment, I forgot to mention Thorpe's awesome performance to  urlLink win bronze  in the 100m freestyle. He only just scraped into the final with the 8th fastest time and stormed home to finish 3rd. Congrats Thorpey - his first bronze completes a heavy set of Olympic medals :)
