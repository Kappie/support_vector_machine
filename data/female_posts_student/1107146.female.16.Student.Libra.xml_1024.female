To Whitney's school.  They were doing their DI thing, which I didn't get to see because I was sick.  They were REALLY good.  I almost didn't believe that they had written it themselves.  Anyway, Kelly Reedy and Julie Catterton came to visit today.  I learned how to play gin, which is ALMOST as fun as Scum.  Anyway, so I'll see yall Monday, I think.
