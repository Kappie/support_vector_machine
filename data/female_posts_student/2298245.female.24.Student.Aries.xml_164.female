Their general consensus was that he's an idiot who has nothing better to do with his time, so he runs for President.  They are concerned that he could ruin things for the Democrats.  They also seemed to think that he could better serve elsewhere without ruining the party for everyone.  Bottom line, Ralph:  the people want you...just not as their President. But then, I guess you already knew that.
