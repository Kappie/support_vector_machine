I often find myself perplexed when it comes to one individual.  I think we all know who I'm talking about when I say WTFSM (what the ...), yes the one the only, girls... "The Vegas".  So, I haven't talked to him in months and I still find myself wondering about it.  What happened last time that was so bad, or what did I do etc.  One could go off the deep end asking unanswerable questions like that.  I guess the question I pose is, does that ever go away?  Does "The Vegas" ever turn into a shady quebec casino and relinquish "The Vegas" title to someone more deserving or is he perpetually to remain the unatainable?  In true casino style, can you ever beat the house?  Can one live in Vegas and take in all the sparkle and glam or are you always a spectator looking in at its awe and wonder?  How does one person or Vegas rather, sneak into your thoughts constantly and take over without conscent?  What is it that makes us follow the light?  Is it the money, the chance of winning?  Is he like that?  Do I needlessly hold on to the possibility of what could be?  Or perhaps I like it this way and it is I that is unatainable and closed off because I need something to wonder about?  I need that light to follow?  Is that even a realistic possibility?  Why would I give up the chance to beat the house?  Hmm I think not!  Will I ever know?  Is Vegas supposed to be all glitz and glam so I'll keep going back and it (he) will never lose its alure?  Maybe I'm not ever supposed to beat the house, maybe he likes the plateau he sits on above all others looking down.  Or maybe just maybe I make to much out of things and I like the "drama" we all strive to avoid constantly in our lives?  Maybe it gives me something to talk about?  I guess its like they say, don't hate the playa hate the game.  I think the real question is would he even be my "Vegas" if I had beat the house on the first try...  No, sadly we all knew that answer, but he'll always have some title and he'll always steal the spot light, he'll always be the headliner regardless of where the location, seedy Quebec casino or Vegas...  Thanks Vegas or not so much...
