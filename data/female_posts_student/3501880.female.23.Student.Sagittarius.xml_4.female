Part of me really would like to cancel, but another part of me desperately hopes that THIS is the session we will hit the golden nugget of wisdom to spur the Gold Rush of Mental Health '04. But I know that this will not be the case.   I checked out the book he recommended to me last session. He described it as "a fun, enjoyable read with LOTS of useful information." This might have been true had I been fighting a problem with biting my nails too much or trying to swear less (though, I probably should fucking swear less).  The book turned out to be so trivial and condescendingly written, featuring case studies about how Ben Franklin became the wonderful American icon he was, and so I could I if I applied said principles.   Part of me just wants to tell him what a useful fuck he is, and how he has probably caused me more psychological damage rather than remedying the problems I already have. But as we all know, I will just spend the hour rambling about the exact same things I have already said in our past sessions, and he will just repeat what I said back to him. When our session ends, I will thank him for his help and leave. Then, when I see him around the office in the Fall to see my new therapist, I will smile politely, but think about how I wish his license would be revoked. The joy of Passive-Aggressive Behavior. ________________________________________  This last Friday, I met my friend, James, for dinner at our favorite "greasy spoon" diner. As we waited for a table, I noticed a young man waiting with his father. What caught my attention were the tangle of wires that protruded from his head and gathered together into a little pouch that he carried at his side.   I couldn't help staring. I just couldn't. Curiosity got the best of me, and I continually glanced out of the side of my eyes at the wires. What were they for? Could this be a new product by IGIA known as the "Portable Electro-Shock Therapy System"? Why just battle your shameful vices at home with Electro-Shock Therapy when you can do it on the go?  I tried to think of all the possible afflictions that would make such a treatment necessary, but then a strange thought occurred to me: What if this boy intentionally placed the wires on his head as a sort of social experimenat art installation? And though it probably isn't the case, this explanation seemed to make more sense than any other valid medical one. I can imagine more than a few people I know who would do such a thing in the name of art. What does this say about me and my circle of friends?
