I think so..  aloha Au revoir aufwiedersehn Goodbye sienara (Japanese I think)  ........................................  ok don't ask I have no idea  ok I will write a normal-ish one now  ok so today..........GERMAN.....that I believe explains itself ha  Ooh am soooooooooooooo tired today went running this morning and on ye old bike........went and got dressed and laid on my swing.....oopps thought I had only laid there 20mins. Had been two hours hahaha - well as they say.... time waits for no man - well it feels like it sometimes lol  ok so I have no idea what to write anymore, or even if I make any sense, my mind is turning to mush........ahhhhhhhh don't even think those nasty thoughts you lot lol hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  Ooh speaking of random here I go again...... how would you prefer to die by drowning or by burning? cremation or burial? (no I'm not planning murders.it was a conversation on the way home)  I think cremation.........heres my attempt at an explanation........ well first I thought defiantly not cremation because it seemed so final, like you were destroying any chance at an afterlife or your soul living on, but the more I thought about it, the more I think yes to cremation (and not just because I don't want to be eaten by the worms). I mean maybe it releases the soul from the body, no longer trapped but free, and then you have to consider the phoenix rising from the ashes - (here's a basic overview of the legend incase you don't know it - the phoenix is a supernatural creature living for 1000 years. Once that time is over, it builds its own funeral pyre, and throws itself into the flames, as it dies, it is reborn anew, and rises from the ashes to live another 1000 years. ) - don't ask how I no that - lol  feel free to comment and write your ideas on this subjuct, I would be interested to hear others thoughts and opinions  anyway i best be off love ye your Nat XxxxXXxxXxXxXXXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXXxXxxxxxxxXxXxXXxxX  ps i can't get the fairies to work today lol they will be back though mwhahahahaha
