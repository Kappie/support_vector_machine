And heres me trying to give every other girl directions to the club from where they are parked, when I've only lived here a few days.  First let me say, going out in Houston is not even close to being the same as going out in Austin. The party we went to was at the Cotton Exchange Bar. Which is the actual historical cotton exchange building. Huge vaulted, painted ceilings, tons and tons of suits and ties. A lady waiting on you in the bathroom, who you have to tip or she gets really mean. Chandeliers, wood floors, and leather couches. And I stroll in wearing a torn up Ramones t-shirt, jeans, heels that look like converse, a sparkly green scarf and aviators. At least Krys and I were a rockstars, two of the girls dressed as groupies and you should have seen the looks they were getting. A few of the suits asked what the occasion was, other than that I just felt really young.  Just last Friday night Krys and I talked about how when we started going out in Austin, we were always the young ones. But now when we go out in Austin, we are the older girls. Not that way in Houston, I was clearly younger by at least 5 years. Maybe it was just that the other girls had on dresses and pearls. I don't see myself ever fitting into that scene.  So we all took off, and headed for the Red Door. We ended up taking a cab because we had paid $10 for parking and didn't want to have to pay to park again. Just one word of advice, choose your cab driver carefully. Ours thought Krysten was a prostitute and really freaked me out. When we got there, there were over 50 in line and it was 1:30. Krys and I decided to bail when we realized we were only a block or two from my apartment. On the way home we passed some places that are closer to my speed, complete with picnic benches and flipflops.  So it ended up being an expensive Saturday night. But I learned a lesson, and now I know where to go.   I am going to pick up my books and first assignments at the school today.  And if I want to, I could call Evan today.
