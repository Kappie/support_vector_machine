Without a doubt, you've changed lots. Maybe it's just your personality. But why can't I stop thinking 'bout it? Why do I care 'bout it so much when you don't even realize how much this is troubling me? Why am I so stupid?    I miss talking to you day and night, on the phone or on msn. I want the old you back.
