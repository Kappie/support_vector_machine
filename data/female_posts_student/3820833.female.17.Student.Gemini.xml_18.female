Somehow we, the Form 5 seniors are not satisfied with the behavior that is shown by the juniors during the preparation for the gathering.   We do want the gathering can be carried out in a better mode. We hope for the best memory before we leaves the school. I do not deny that we have make a lot of request about the gathering. We request better food, we request better medal, we request exciting games. I know that we shouldn't demand too much. But, what we care about is just a happy and memorable farewell. At least there will be some sweet memory for us.   Anyway, I'm sorry and guilty to heard my teacher said "I think I'm the one who should be blamed on."  What does it means? My teacher advisor suggest to make the farewell party has more fun by having the party outside the school compound. However, what is in her mind does not match with ours ideas. Then, she feels that carry out the party in 5-6 hours is not a good idea since the girls and other teachers may not want to stay back. So, they make the decision to carry out the party in 4 hours, that means the party will be held at 8:30am to 12:00pm. For us, we think that they mean to carry out the party with no other meaning except to carry out the party as a practice every year.   After I listened to my teacher explanation, I was convinced that we were absolutely wrong. My teacher was meant to make the party as fun as it cans. However, we, who are childish jump into the conclusion that the juniors were not sincere in the preparation. Now, I just wan to apologize to my teacher advisor and the juniors for the misunderstandings. Sorry to those who are concern. =(
