So I think, with the exception of maybe a color change, I've found a good template for now.  lately I've been feeling quite, er, flippity.  I would like to kiss someone. a nice big sloppy kiss involving lip gloss and the transfer of gum. I got to thinking about it, and I've never technically kissed anybody. There was Taylor pleasant in 2nd grade, but it was only because we had just gotten "married", and there was a time at a party, but we were playing a game where they pair you up anonymously in a dark closet and I have no clue who's lip/eye/nose/something I planted a big one on, and there was one other time when I was dared to lick my friend's brother's face. But that's crappy! I want the real deal, firecrackers kiss. The heart pounding, face melting, wonderful kind.   that's why I have one oranje bracelet that stands for a kiss, and the rest are clear for hugs. I want that one to be perfect.  I played bingo today, I won a dollar!  and by the way, I lost all my comments with the new template, so leave me lots!   ya lublyu tebya... it means 'I love you' in Russian
