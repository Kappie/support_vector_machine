I'm just not going to follow that thread anymore, as I don't think he's going to stop posting there, and I trust that when he says I mean so much more to him than any of those girls, he means it.   Anywho. I woke up this morning with a particularly bad stomach ache. I've been having a lot of trouble with my stomach the past few months, but the past week or so I was all right. I think what it was this morning was that I went to bed on an empty stomach, and it was all acidic and unhappy when I woke up. So, naturally, because of this (and perhaps a bit of PMS-- I really, really ought to start keeping track of those sorts of things so I know when I can blame otherwise uncalled for bad moods on hormones) I was in a pissy mood when I got to school. 'Twas a mood that persisted through some of drama, though I spent most of the class laying with my eyes closed on two desks pushed together, as we're filming movies and two of the guys in mine were doing something else today.   Music went better than expected. I play the alto saxophone, and we had a playing test today that I only really practiced for last night. I think it was one of my better performances for a test, ironically, and my mark reflected that. Then we switched instruments and will remain switched for at least a week. I chose bass guitar, though I've never laid my hands on a guitar at any point in my life that I can clearly recall. I didn't actually get to play anything today, as the teacher was too busy getting the others adjusted to different mouthpieces and such. Hopefully tomorrow.  Third period, Challenge  Change in Society, was all presentations for our end of the term ISP worth 10% of our final mark. I did mine yesterday, and I am so very relieved that it's over with. Pretty sure I did a crappy job. But at least I'm done. Fourth period, English, we were supposed to spend working on our book-to-film ISPs, but I've yet to find a copy of classic  Dracula  to compare to the book, so I spent the entire thing reading a book I took out from the library ( American Gothic  by Michael Romkey. Frankly I'm getting disappointed with it, now that I near the end.).   So, yeah. I've spent my time since getting home watching TV, resting (because I'm bloody tired after being up 'til about 12:30 AM talking with Taylor, having also not gotten to bed at particularly decent hours any other time this week, either), sending back surveys in response to the ones Taylor and Anna sent, and random chatting. I may post what Anna and Taylor said about me in their surveys at a later date-- I was quite touched by both of them. :)  After I post this, I'm going to clean my "rat" out of the drain in the bathroom (a.k.a. a mass of hair that collects over a week or two that is mostly composed of my hair, as thick, long hair sheds horribly as it gets warmer), then working on a free signature for someone I randomly met on Gaia last night. Normally I charge for my work, but her present signature just in text inspired me to make an image to go with the words. And then I shall watch Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, and Futurama. What an active life I lead. ^.^
