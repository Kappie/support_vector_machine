I can't count the number of times I'm going to need to drive down to Fashion Valley and back in the coming days.  But, apparently, LeeAnn will keep me company.  I love LeeAnn a lot.  Today was great.  Really nice and warm.  College on the east coast would really be difficult for me, I'm thinking, just because I work best with all this sun.  I miss Chuck in physics.  He was such a part of that class, and now he's gone.  Well good for him, Chuck has always been good at doing what he wants.  Then there was English.  Haha that class is so funny with Brunk's interpretations of the books we read.  He spots the sexual undertones in everything.  At lunch I talked with Brenna about stuff, and that was good.  Calc wasn't too bad.  Chowdury was so nice about my scheduling this week.  I told her she was preparing us more than any other teacher for the AP test, but she didn't believe me.  She really is a great teacher with how much she takes care of us.  After school was hours of e-mailing and filling out applications.  I'm going to have a killer summer, and hopefully all this stuff will pay off.  Besides, I'm kind of having fun pretending to be a professional.  My mind is swimming, but I don't think that will last too long.  Time always makes me feel different about things.
