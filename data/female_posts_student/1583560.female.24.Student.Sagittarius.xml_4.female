Hopefully, the person about which I'm gonna write will never read this cuz that could be somewhat embarassing.  On Wednesday, I was leaving work, and so I headed to the elevator.  There was a guy standing at the elevator, and he introduced himself to me.  Let's call him "A."   Anyhow, we had a very nice talk as we left the building.  Eventually A and I parted ways because we had to catch buses at different places.  That night, I was looking around Friendster, and who do you think I saw?  That's right, "A!"  What a crazy coincidence, huh?    Anyhow, I've been hoping all day to run into him, but it seems unlikely cuz I very rarely see people from the other offices on the floor.  I've even taken a couple more elevator trips than usual today.  So I have a little crush, and I might even consider asking A out (I know from his Friendster profile that he's single) if only I would see him again.  But I've been working at Odyssey for 3 months and I've only seen him maybe 3 times, with Wednesday marking our first conversation so the odds don't seem very good.  Ah, the trials of romance....
