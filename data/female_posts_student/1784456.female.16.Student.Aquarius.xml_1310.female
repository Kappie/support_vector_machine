I found a currency convertor! Finally, I actually know how much things cost! Ahh. Oh yeah, I'm ill today, that's why I'm not at school. I actually had some damn freaky dreams! One was where my mum died, and I was gonna see this lady he liked... apart from I was in the PE changing rooms after we had had PE and suddenly Mango appeared, so I ran down to the gate and threw him out. Loads of guys were there, and they were saying 'did you see those two things' and some one said 'one of them you might have seen, one of them you shouldn't have seen' or some thing like that, then one of them said 'one of them was a skull and wearing a tutu'. So Death of Rats and Death were in my dream! *Read Thief of Time to get it* C'est tres bizarre! Mmm... other freaky stuff happened but I forgot it. Oh, I also dreamt some one poked me in the head and it woke me up. (Weird huh?) Definatly ill, I always get freak dreams when I'm ill! Ahh I better go do some thing ...useful because it's becoming hard to type and spell *must be illness kicking in* or it's just me... Hmm... definatly me.
