Because I honestly don't have too much to say, other than that I love the weather, A is  finally  15 now, and today was rather boring.   And damn right I love the weather! Mud and rain and grey skies are what I live for!! April and March, best months of the year. This is when everything is growing and wet and alive!! Spring is my favourite season. And fall. And winter. And... man, I love every season as they come. It's great to be me, non? hehe. The only problem is that this seems to be roadkill season, too >_    *wipes away tears* Anyways, today was boring, because everyone seemed to busy to talk to me!! Plus I wasn't in my usual hyper-happy mood, so people kept giving me funny looks since I wasn't being crazy ^^ I mean jeez, can't a girl be  depressed  for once? ~v~ ~v~ The Curse of Caleigh: people automatically think you're considering suicide if you are not bouncing off the walls and grinning so hard your face is coming unscrewed.   Hehehe, I think I've just used my whine-points for the next thousand years or so.    Have I ever said I love A Perfect Circle? God, I love them. *huggles* They're just... wowie! They're like ei-music. That should be a new genre. A Perfect Circle is the epitome of ei-music, btw. All others who wish to become ei-music should look to A Perfect Circle for A Perfect Example.   *dies*   I'm sorry. I'm bored and I feel very unloved, unlike A, who is very loved ~v~ Happy 15th and we love ya, babes! (Babes, as in, young and naive and helpless ^o^ don't kill me!)   And, despite the fact I need to look up most of em in that awesome site A gave me, I love using anime smilies, at least in my blog. They're just soooo damn cool.   Movie, anyone? Tomorrow night?
