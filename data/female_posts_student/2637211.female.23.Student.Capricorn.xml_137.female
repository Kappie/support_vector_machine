I've hit a road block in my writing, as I wrote down a quote and forgot to put the page number, and now it seems like it never existed and I hallucinated the whole quote. But it's really good and I need to cite it, damn it! Crap, and I need another movie quote... whew, just need some food and another cup of coffee, I can get through it, I got nothing to do today but sleep like a crackhead who stayed up all night, except replace the crack with coffee. Okay, just a few more hours till sleepy time. Oh, and who knew there were so many trains in Davis at night? I've heard so many, and I think the tracks are fairly far away. But I think sound travels better at night. Oh, the crows are getting loud, I think the sun might be rising. Weird. Ok, back to writing....
