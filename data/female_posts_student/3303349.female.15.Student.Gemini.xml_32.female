We went to see Anchorman, which was preety funny, and we were the only ones in the theatre but for these two guys that were there all alone. And they looked at us all the time. It really flipped me out. But back to the actual date. I was sitting thorugh the first half of the movie hoping that he would do something...like put his arm around me or hold my hand or something! And then! then half way through the move he put his hand out and I laced my fingers in his and I was so happy at that moment. If only a bit nervious. I kept tring hard not to start shaking. It may seem so cliche that I was so happy about him holding my hand but it really was what I had been wanting to happen since he had told me he loved me. So I am just basking in the perfection that is my life at the moment. Oh perfection...so good....
