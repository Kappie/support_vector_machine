So, who will it be?   urlLink Paul Martin and the Liberals  for a fourth straight majority government?  How about  urlLink Stephen Harper and the Conservatives ?  He shares the same birthday with Hitler, by the way.  Or perhaps  urlLink Jack Layton with the NDP ?  Personally, I'm so disillusioned right now I would vote  urlLink Bloc Quebecois  if I was allowed to.  I could always write that in on the ballot, or cast a vote for the  urlLink Marijuana Party  as a protest vote.  I have to vote by advance poll, so I think June 19 looks like my date.  More to come...
