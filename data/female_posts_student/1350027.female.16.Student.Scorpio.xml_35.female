Really, it was.  I was trying to economic. I had the SAVE MY PARENTS MONEY plastered on my forehead.  I figure I might as well give these simple shampoos another chance since they've improved over the years and somehow managed to have good propaganda and assure you your hair will look like Portia's in Ally McBeal.  They have never worked on my hair. And now I'm damn sure that they will never ever work.  I didn't sleep the whole night. My scalp was itching like mad. I was so angry wondering what I did wrong. I mean, I started off the shampoo a week ago and it was fine - what the hell went wrong? Did I leave shampoo in perhaps? Unlikely, I rinse my hair like mad. Did I use the wrong thing? Can't be. There's only one bottle of shampoo in the bathroom. Sratch sratch sratch. Itchy. Itchy. Itchy. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. *pulls hair* And the fact that split ends were all over the place didn't help. Dry, itchy and just bushy. :(  Paul called at 5AM. I told him I need new shampoo.  He came at 11AM. We bought new shampoo at 3PM.  I just used the new shampoo. I feel so good. I put a hair mask. I feel so clean. And though the damn thing coz a bomb, it's all so worthied.  Okay. I don't know why I wrote all of that; but I would like to point out that --  "Salon Products are good products. Don't let your hair be victimized and pick the right brands and the right shampoos! And remember to mask atleast once a week and get your hair trimmed every 6 months!" :D
