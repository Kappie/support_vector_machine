I've decided to go with a whole ambivalent theme, since that's my favorite word, along with "Alienated" and also "Authentic." Funny how they're all "A" words. I'll have to think about any other words that I'm into. Oh well, now I need to look for stuff to comment on. Shouldn't be hard, considering the state of the world lately!
