Relaxed a bit more as each mile flew by.  Had Christmas in Burley today.  Tomorrow's shopping in Idaho Falls.  Yay.  Wonder if the boy will want to do lunchy; hope he can handle Mom.  She's really fun when she's been getting good deals.    Might get into the details of the night after finals at some point; now, though, it's time for bed.
