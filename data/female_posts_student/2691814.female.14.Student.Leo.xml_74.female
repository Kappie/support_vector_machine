I try not to look at it as a bad thing but...sometimes i can't help it. lol...quite funny.  Spring break starts on Friday!!!!!! yay...Thursday is our last day meaning tomarrow lol. I sooo want to see the Yankees train down here!...The Mets are in kissimee and the Braves are like 3miles from us!..My 2 fav teams are yankees(hehe) and Mets. I used to watch baseball games with my great grandpa. He'd always make me sit down with him drink coke and watch the yankees.(tear lol) I guess ryan is going to see one of teams train today. I think that'll be fun. Hopefully we're not doin anything tomarrow so i wouldn't have to go to school but I have dance rehearsal for chorus and i can't miss chorus CLASS. she's like making us comit to it. but thats alright cuz MPA festival is coming up and we're gonna kick some serious ASS if only we weren't in those long black dresses. For chorus we get to go to MGM and spend the day there!...wow i haven't been there since i was like 4 or 5. Mom took me at the age where i can't really remember much. But it'll be fun.   Anyway....I really don't care if anyone else cares about what im writing. its the stuff that im feeling right now. I'm gonna post later. Today is a short day! we get out at 3.   ~*Toodels*~
