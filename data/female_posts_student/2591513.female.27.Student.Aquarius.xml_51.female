UGH  I love going to school, but am wondering if I am going to be able to afford it.  I hate having to resort to student loans, but I honestly want to finish school and unfortunately I cannot fund my school on my own.  I am trying to find some sort of job though.  So I am not just lounging around wanting money to fall into my lap...sometimes I do....but not all.  I have more respect for those who went through college on their own.  More power to you guys.  I will be paying for my college forever and a day, but hey, if I get it done right?  Thankfully when I do enroll for my 4-year, my dad's VA thing will kick in and then I won't have to worry so much.  Well I better get going.  I have a ton of stuff to do around the house, like find FOOD.  It has to get better right?  It will.  Oh, I got distracted...I wanted to say that last night I prayed to God to come into my heart and that I surrendered my problems to Him.  I told Him that I needed help and that I knew that He would help me in my time of need, as He always has in my life.  I just had to let go and let Him come into my life.  I felt better after that.  I don't know why I let myself go far from the Church.  I need to go back and not worry about what the pious think of me.  I know my sins and acknowledge my wrongs and have confessed them to God.  I know He has forgiven me and will not dispose of me.  Sorry, I didn't mean to go on and on about this spiritual note.
