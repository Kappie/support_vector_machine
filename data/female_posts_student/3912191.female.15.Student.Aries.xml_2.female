I am currently single but i am still madly in love with my jerky ex-boyfriend... but tonight i went to the Putnam County fair with my best friend BerWhi and had a great time with Sam, Matt, Pook, and Cody. SOme of my ex's friends...he was supposed to call me when he arrived at the fair but " he didnt have his cell" so unfortunately i didnt get to spend time with him.. he was there the entire time and didnt even get in touch with me so i mean i am kinda getting the clue that he isnt interested.  I had a really great  time with his old best freind Matt, but he has a girlfriend and i wouldnt want to mess something like that up they have been dating for like 8 months...anyways i am really confused in the whole guys situation.  Although i am playin a good match maker... i hooked whitney and sam up tonite. They are talkin on the fone...well i guess that is enough for right now i am sure that i will write again soon...3 always, ash x0x0x
