So...I won't repeat what I said there about why I am also majorly fucked up.  I know I have been for a long time, but now it's gotten much worse.  *sighs*  Anyway, this weekend I'm going to Birmingham, leaving Friday and coming back Monday, so I will actually be out of town.  Don't know if I'm taking my computer and also don't know if I can connect to the Internet while I'm there...ANYway, I am alive, albeit screwed, and that's about all I know.  Cheers to all of you whose lives aren't shit.  ~Z
