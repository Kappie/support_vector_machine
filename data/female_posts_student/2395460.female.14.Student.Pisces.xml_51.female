The  urlLink The Hairmax Laser Comb  "activates cells" that stimulate the hair follicles, which is supposed to give you fuller, healthier hair. It's a low-level cold-beam laser so you won't end up with scalp burns in any case.   I would buy it for my ever-shedding dogs if it didn't cost $700.  Get yours at  urlLink Blissworld .
