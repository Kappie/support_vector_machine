Even though the sound of it  Is something quite atrocious If you say it loud enough You'll always sound precocious Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay Because I was afraid to speak  When I was just a lad My father gave me nose a tweak And told me I was bad But then one day I learned a word That saved me aching nose The biggest word I ever heard  And this is how it goes:  Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Even though the sound of it Is something quite atrocious If you say it loud enough You'll always sound precocious Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay So when the cat has got your tongue There's no need for dismay Just summon up this word  And then you've got a lot to say But better use it carefully  Or it may change your life One night I said it to me girl And now me girl's my wife!  She's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!  soz i had 2 put dat on it sooooo funny
