Went with one of Mom's colleagues (don't ask; it's a long story) to 9/11 and took a trip with Dad out to the grandparents in the evening.    The movie was about what I expected.  Still have to divorce the man from the message when it comes to Michael, but I'm glad I saw it and it gave me all the more resolve that Bush must go.    Coming back to myself a bit more after a trip to Burley today for (the other) Grandma's birthday celebration.  Picnics in the park have a way of doing that.  Just getting ready to do some outside yoga, the first since the round on the beach last July 4.  Then I think I'll settle on the front porch with Book 4 and a Fat Tire.
