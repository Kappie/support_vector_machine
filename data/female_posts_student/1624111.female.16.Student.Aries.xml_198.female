Anyway, i thought i should post. as i have some free time waiting for eSTEVE to get out of the shower and then tell me whats going on tonight.    SoTuesday i got myself out of fencing, but into trouble, so that wasnt so great. but i did get to watch i love the 90s. so...score? i dunno. i didnt do much on tuesday. i almost got together with emily (pasch) but not cause after she did her stuff she didnt feel like going out again or something. but i did get to talk to her and hear her talk back to me after having not done that for almost 2 weeks. which was nice. i got a new game boy game cause i recently decided im going to start actually using my game boy some more cause soem of the games i have are genuinely entertaining and i did pay good money for them at some point.     Wednesday... ah yes, Emily drove me to the library. MY library. and i returned my pirate book and we looked at the kids books and adult books and neither of us got anything and i discovered theyre selling a bag full of 12 romance novels for only $1.00! how cool is that? i told liz. shes excited. i hope one of us buys them before theyre gone. hehe. aaaaaand... hmm... emily drove me to the cool park by the mall. Deerpath park? or something? but they have this awesome playground called "Kids Castle" and it had monkey bars and so much cool stuff. and a tire swing! and emily and i...especially emily... and fun on the tire swing and got dizzy and sick. so then we played on the regular swings. and we laughed at the little kids. and then the big kids came and talked to us and we made a friend...oh, what was her name? christine? crystal? something like that... aaand... the one kid didnt believe we were 16 so we showed him our drivers licenses but he said he was older than us anyway. (and where was his license? exactly.) aaaaaaaaaand...then we went to the mall to get smoothies which werent really all that great but its okay cause we were both thirsty after the hot park and the hot car ride to the mall. and theeeeeeen... we went to kb toys to look at the little kids toys and we laughed at the new hard games and talked about toys we had when we were little and it was fun. and then we got candy from the candy store. and then i showed emily that american eagle moved a long time ago and then we argued about whether aeropostale moved or not and what happened to that corner? and then i went home and slept and then i went to fencing which was not fun but not horrible cause we fixed weapons for a while. and then on the way home i stopped at caribou and got a mint cooler or something and i saw jenna so i stopped and talked to jenna and her friend liz for a little bit. which was cool. and then i went home and slept some more.   and then THURSDAY... i didnt do much either... i figured out what was going on with great america and was happy that everybody wasnt going without me and emily still might be able to take us later. i went to the dentist. that was boring. i came home and slept. then i went to fencing and it sucked and i didnt like it. then i came home and read all quiet on the western front and watched i love the 90s from wednesday and thursday.   Friday... i got up and showered and went downstairs and found my mom looking at old pictures of me when i was little so i looked too for a little bit... and then i called emily to see if she was sleeping over or not... and then i went to deerpark and got my hair cut... and then i came home and slept. and then i called emily again. and then she said she was going to sleep over. and i was very happy. and then i cleaned my room and watched mrs. doubtfire till she came over and then we talked for a little while and listened to her los lonely boys cd cause its like the only cd shes ever bought. and then i showed her my pictures and then we played outburst and i learned julie would never play games with emily when they were little cause julie was always reading. stupid julie. and i learned... that emily doesnt really like martha. but not really. and that kara's a bad musician. (not kara kara, other kara) and...that Emilydoesnt like evan enough to say theyregood friends with evan... poor evan...and that she hates julie. but not really. but i alreadyknew that.then we listened to some more music and talked some more and i learned a bunch more stuff. and eventually weslept. and bob magically appeared next to me during the night.sounds boring, but i enjoyed it mucho.   and today we got up at 9:30 and talked some more and she went home at 11 and i let her borrow Shakespeare in Love cause apparently they have a DVD player now and i cant stand watching movies with her cause i then i cant talk to her...so the only movies i ever want her to watch are the really good ones... but those are the ones i really cant talk through or shell miss it and i want her to see it. so i didnt want to watch sakespeare in love cause i would lose 2 hours of talking aaaaaand it would probably make her sleepy. i tried to get her to watch it in tucson but she fell asleep. stupid emily. you only had to pay attention for 2 movies! bah! but its okay cause i told her to take it home and watch it. huzzah. i solved my problem. and then today i went out and bought some bagels cause i really wanted to yesterday but 22 and its closednessscared me. and...then...later im gonna do something with emily and heather i think. not sure whats up with that yet. but we'll find out. and now since emilys in the shower and emilys not online and heather doenst know whats up, im gonna go sleep for a little bit. or osmething. cause im tired. cause i had emily sleep over. yaaaaaay! :-D      As for the important questions: one no, and one maybe. which is good.
