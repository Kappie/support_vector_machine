I had just finished junior college and was planning on transferring to a university. I was the manager of the local coffee shop and the owner was planning to sell the business to me once I got my bachelors degree in business. I was rooming with my best friend since 3rd grade, Tarissa Florman, we were trying to get used to the fact that I was moving to a dorm 200 miles away. I still miss her so much. My boyfriend at the time, or should I say  ex -boyfriend, wasKelvin Mitchell. He decided to end our 1 1/2 year relationship a week before it happened, said that he couldn't 'handle the whole long distance thing'. Tarissa and Kelvin were my closest relations, we had our group that we ran with on Saturday nights, but I didn't really  know  any of them. I left home when I was 19, and haven't talked to my parents since. They were fighting a lot and on the verge of the big 'D' word, I decided that I couldn't handle it and moved in with Tarissa. Tarissa and I stayed up all night talking for the first week we lived together, a slumber party every night. Then we matured, we developed our routine, our group of friends, our lives together. On Monday and Wednesday I would prepare breakfast for us, my classes didn't start until 10 a.m. and the assistant manager did a pretty good job at the coffee shop until I arrived at 3 p.m. and Tarissa had to be out the door by 8 to get to her job as a receptionist. On Tuesday and Thursday mornings, Tarissa would whip together something for me, I had a morning class at 7 a.m. We both had Friday mornings off and would cook together. We both loved cooking so much, and loved home made food. So our apartement almost never contained any pre-packaged food. And it was always cheaper for us to cook from scratch. Most of the time our rent money was tight, Tarissa worked weekends and good pay her share usually, but I worked part-time and needed to pay for school (Tarissa decided that college wasn't for her). But after I got a student loan everything was fine. My life was clockwork, I was going to college with a full scholarship, I would move back to the same neighborhood after I finished school, and then I would own, and probably still manage the coffee shop. Then Kelvin broke the news to me, I didn't grieve at all, instead I went along in a sort of trance, just doing what needed to be done.  Then it happened, I woke up and I was not myself. I woke up in someone else's bed, in someone else's body. I knew who I was by instinct, but I could also remember my life as Carly. Though I was severly confused, I was able to get through the day okay, living someone else's life. Since then, I have lived a different life nearly every day. A few times I stayed in one body for a week or so, but that's it. Through all of this, I can barely remember that girl I once was, Carly Morgan is a stranger to me now. I've always wondered if everyone's life is like mine, switching constantly. Sometimes I believe it's true, but that I am special, in the fact that I remember who I once was. I used to wonder if every life I lived had a purpose, if I was completing a task for someone, like in a weird sci-fi show. I can remember the people I have been, bits and fragments of their lives are carried with me. With every day I only told one person what happened, and I knew from the moment the words came to my mouth that it was a mistake. I risked it, and it wasn't a good idea. I just had a feeling that this was my own thing, I couldn't share the burden. So I just went on, like I did after Kelvin. Until it started getting really weird, the lives of the people I was started to intertwine, and then they started to intertwine with Carly.
