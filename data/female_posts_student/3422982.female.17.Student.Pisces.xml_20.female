The only thing he does is lie, and I now understand why Mom divorced him. First thing that pissed me off: He tells me he's going to drive me down to Kansas for Rachel's birthday. We were going to leave on her birthday, but Cody leaves that day and he needs to drive him to the airport, so we're leaving the next day, Thursday. I asked him, looked him right in the eye, while I was on the phone with Rachel, "So when are we leaving? That Sunday?" And he said yes. What did he tell me yesterday? "I never said that. I'm not staying out there that long." It's not even five days. It's barely four because of the long drive, what? He expects to go out there say hi, then turn around and come back? Then Sherri called me earlier today tell me that Krissy had two extra tickets to County Thunder and I was invited. Well I had to wake Dad up like an hour ago because he's working a tweleve hour shift and when I asked him he told me no. That it was too long of a drive. I'M SICK OF HIS SHIT. To me, three hours is not that big of a deal. And it's not like I'm doing the driving. For the past three or four years, he's been constantly telling me that I'm young and I should spend these years having fun. WHAT THE HELL FUN CAN I HAVE IF HE WON'T LET ME DO ANYTHING?!?! I know for a fact that Mom would have let me go. She told me herself that she loves seeing me getting out of the house and doing things with friends. I haven't left this house since the baby shower and I hadn't left the house before that except to go see Spiderman. When Sherri was here the only reason I got to leave the house was because she can drive and she has her own car. I know I can't really blame Dad for not taking me anywhere because he has to work, but if I have a chance to go do something fun do I get to do it? No. I live with the biggest hipocrit known to man and I'm sick of it. I'm fed up, I don't want to deal with this anymore. Every year he breaks his word, and every year I'm stuck in this house complaining I have nothing to do. Well I'm done. I'm not even gonna bother moving out here after high school because I hate the neighbor like I said in my last entry. I might stay in Washington and go to BCC for a year for my break and then move on. I don't know what to do anymore. But first thing tomorrow, I'm calling Mom and getting the fuck out of here as soon as I can. I'm done. No more.   later dayz
