Or is it a millipede?  i dont mind flies, mosquitoes and spiders.  I freaked out about them too much at camp and got rid of my phobia there.  but i DETEST centipedes.  *shiver*  My friend's aunt has a p-pet hedgehog and it was my job to feed it LIVE millipedes and centipedes.  My friend held the hedgehog in a blanket to stop it from inserting spikes all over the place.  So i was standing with an open cup of wriggling bugs trying to escape over the top.  I was terrified.  The light bounced off their bodies as if they were covered in slime and the way they moved just made me shudder.  They were orange and red and furious.  They were attacking each other and trying to climb out of the cup.  I slammed the cup on the floor and backed away.  I looked at the hedgehog, my friend, the centipedes/millipedes, and the pincers in my hand.  I slowly picked up one of the wriggling bugs with the pincers.  It writhed violently and dropped to the ground.  I shut my eyes and could hear it scuttling across the floor.  I jabbed the pincers through its body and fed it to the hedgehog who snapped the bug's body in half.  I was disgusted.  Though the bug's entrails were sliding to the ground with a dull plop, the body kept on moving.  The hedgehog snorted as it swallowed a white tendril of intestine hanging out from the body.  I picked up the second victim/bug quickly.  I had to feed the hedgehog 5 centipedes.  The worst part was that the hedgehog was very selective about it's food.  As soon as i put the second bug in front of its nose, it let out a huge burp/sneeze/snort which blew the centipede across the room.  The bug fell splat into a small box which were the hedgehog's living quarters.  After hours of wrestling with the bug in the wood shavings, i fed it to the hedgehog who, again, snorted the bug away.  I was lucky that i had moved away right after i had dropped the bug onto the hedgehog's belly.  The bug fell on the floor where my leg had been a minute before.  I handed the pincers to my friend and ran into the washroom.  After a few minutes of retching, i decided that though hedgehogs were cute i would never feed one again for the rest of my life.  It was a terrifying but good experience and i know that i am not the kind of person who can touch bugs.  I was really stupid to think that i could feed the hedgehog.   Which ends my story about my fear of centipedes.  I hope never to have to see a writhing and half eaten body of a centipede anymore.  When i found that centipede in my bathtub, i drowned it quickly with burning water. until it fell down the drain.  I never want to see squashed centipede insides anymore.
