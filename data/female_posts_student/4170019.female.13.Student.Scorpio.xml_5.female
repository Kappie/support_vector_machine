Meera the representative of the student councillor group told me that shorty wanted to talk to me after school at 1.30pm but I said to Meera that I have Science remedial at that time. At 1.30pm, Miss Kathijah decided that she is not having her Science remedial as we are in a mood of going home. Well I went to the Concourse finding that shorty but all I saw was Ade and Meera. I asked Meera where that shorty go, she replied that he went home. I think he is a coward as he run away go home when he supposed to wait for me to talk to me what an idiot and coward he is. I think he wanted to talk about personal matter but not school matter.
