Much love to the Parkerites   In other news, Hailbop/Ferret won the sunglasses, Brittles attempted to slide but instead did some slightly painful jumping into my arms, Jolly Ranchers now come in blue raspberry, and Emily Chase came to visit us.  She looks amazingly like other Hailey.  It is the smile I think.  And we won.  3 to the law enforcement.
