Mmm... don't mind me, I'm  eating  a  rolo dessert  *muhahaha!* Yeah, not an every day recourance *eek spelling* but hey, I had to put up with sitting next to Pete in history with him nicking my sheets and standing on them! He found it stupidly funny and kept laughing like a maniac all the time. I'm beginning to think that he's a maniac (I think the laughing gave it away) Hehe... soo any way, I had a totally alright day! Yeay! Happy happy! And tomorrow's Friday! Every one say "INVINSIBLE BUBBLE!" And NO! I don't know HOW to spell INVINSIBLE! YEAY! And eww... I found a de-popped bubble of dead skin that was a blister from when we went ice-skating! It's soo gross! (Keep going, we  really  want to hear about it) I'm sure you do. Oh, point taken. I'll be going then...
