For example, I have this friend who shall remain anonymous and this guy liked her but didn't tell her this until months after the fact.  Not to mention he tells her right before he's leaving.  I know I'm a hypocrite cause I do the same stuff.  Except I usually don't tell the guys at all I like them after the fact.  Also, maybe it's just me, which it probably is but I can never tell when a guy is being sincere.  Well most guys I can but the guys that are really close to me and I know they love me, but o who am I kidding this doesn't even make sense to me so I give up.  Well I went to the fourth or should I say third of July thing this morning to do my monologue.  I went back tonight to listen to some music and watch the fireworks with my dad and some friends.  It was fun.  Maybe tomorrow I can get people together to go see fireworks in Greenville.  Wow, the big city.  Hanson's gonna be there yipee ay oh ki yay(I just butchered that.) As you can tell I'm so excited *rolls eyes*.
