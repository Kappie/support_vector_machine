I've never done it and neither has she, so hey, what's the worst that could happen?  Unfortunately, as far as timing goes, this probably isn't the most opportune moment to start up something like this, at least not on my end.  I've just returned home from the first leg of a downright absurd road trip, which will involve me seeing 7 baseball games in 7 cities in 4 different states over the course of 5 days.  Yeah, I'm pretty much a dork that way.  Well, okay, I'm a dork in a lot of ways, but that all will be revealed in due time.  So, for the remainder of this week, if anything goes up on this little heap of bandwidth, it's gonna be the lovely Grey putting in all the work.  Rest assured, though, when I get back, I'll throw myself into this project for all it's worth, give you the lowdown on me, and hopefully link to stories and pics from my week on the road.
