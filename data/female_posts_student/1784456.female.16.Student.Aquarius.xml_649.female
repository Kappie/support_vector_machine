But any way, I'm less pissed now but my fuse is still short! Hehe, angry Katie = not good! Any way, I'm getting a bit angry with every one in our class judging us! I mean if we say some thing then they go and do their 'talking about it' thing. Why are girls so bitchy? So that's why I'm happy with my ear turned off! Boys fight stuff out, and come of with it but girls go all cagey and bitch behind peoples back. Wow, isn't that nice? Mmm... ok, so maybe I am still a tiny bit angry. Oooh get well soon Laura! Cause she was kind of half dead today, she was going through this crazy "I feel sick" then "I feel hungry" thing today! WEIRD! Any way, funny thing for today! This boy in our class found some panty liners in his bag! Don't ask why but he did! And every one was laughing at him, and then a boy stuck one on the wall and some one was trying to walk out with one but Mr Kelly took it off him! Teehee! Then Mr K dropped it in front of a female teacher and every one started laughing! Oh madness days!
