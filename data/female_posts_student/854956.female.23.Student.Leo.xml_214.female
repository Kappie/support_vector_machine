Melissa is finally 21... and trust me she showed us how 21 she could be!  :-)  Friday/Saturday at Midnight we went down to 6th street for her to get her free shots.  We had an awesome time.  I got a bit tipsy, and had a great time.  Melissa... well... she was drunk... but we won't talk about events of that night unless she doesn't mind.  I don't want to upset her if she doesn't want everyone to know about the events of that night, minus the people who were there to see it all unfold.  Okay, then Saturday was her birthday party at Travis Lake (at Brianna's lakehouse).  I had a good time, til about 7ish when I started feeling REALLY sick.  I made it through the rest of the night (after spewing)... and when we got back to the apts. around 1am, I just fell asleep on the couch.  Yesterday I still felt a bit groggy and such, but today I'm feeling like normal again.  I don't know what it was that got me so sick.  I think it was a combination of spicy sausage, sugary soda (that I'm no longer used to since I drink diet now), and some motion sickness action from sitting on the moving dock.  At any rate, I'm better now, and that's all that matters at the moment.  I'd like to thank everyone who was concerned about me that night, and found ways to help make me feel better.  And I'd also like to say a thing about Ruthie right here and now:  She is an incredibly, wonderfully NICE person!  I have never met someone only twice and had them show that much concern for my wellness before.  :-)  Okay... now I must go.  I'm gonna eat a bit of breakfast and then get ready for work... eventually.  :-)
