(I.E It's sunny today... hey that reminds me of this one time when I was.......) Don't get me wrong, I can create meaningless chatter with the best of them, but when it comes to large crowds and thus a large amount of meaningless chatter, I seem to feel whipped. So, in order to help myself create meaningless chatter I have decided to blog, since that's what I usually put on here anyways. You know what...  I changed my mind, I'm going to continue the bucky saga today. We last left bucky thinking about stealing sir sparrow's mom's green bean casserole recipe. He was hoping to take it to Mr. Roo, who was ancient and couldn't remember anything anyways, and give it to him so he could complete his quest.   Bucky toyed with the idea of stealing Mrs. Sparrow's green bean casserole recipe. He thought, "If only I could see what the real green bean casserole looked like than maybe I could compare the two and take a calculated risk." Bucky was hesitant, because he knew that, although Mr. Roo was ancient he could still take bucky in like two seconds. The deliberation was killing bucky, so he finally just decided to steal the casserole. "The ol' kook won't know the difference.", Bucky told himself. Little did Bucky know that Mrs. Sparrow was not from the Earth's moon, but, from one of Saturn's moons. The green bean casserole recipe from Saturn's moon is much different than that of the Earth's moon, for the green bean casserole from Saturn's moon has no green beans at all!  Thinking highly of himself, Bucky approached Mrs. Sparrow. "Mrs. Sparrow- I was just wondering if I could get some of that delicious green bean casserole to go.", Bucky said, "What do you think this is?? A Drive Through?!", replyed Mrs. Sparrow. Bucky only nodded for they were at a drive-through. It was called "Mrs. Sparrow's Eats to Go". "Than why did you ask to get my green bean casserole to go if you were already in the drive-through??", Mrs. Sparrow questioned. She was very suspicious, almost to the point of where she could have discovered bucky's plan and sent him flying towards the safe haven of the camen islands. But Bucky was clever, he only replyed, "Mrs. Sparrow, I have money this time." Mrs. Sparrow immediately got the green bean casserole and apologized for her temporary insanity.  Ok, so it wasn't as inspirational as some of the other Bucky tales, but I'm a little rusty on Bucky. Stay tuned for the next episode, where Bucky actually tries to give Mr. Roo the Saturn moon green bean casserole.    Hip Hip for da Chimmeys!
