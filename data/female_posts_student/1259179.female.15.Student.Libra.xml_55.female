And this makes it even better.  I went for a short visit at  urlLink  ~ Sandee's ~ .  Hey chicka, I love you mucho mucho.  Just remember you could always talk to me about anything.  That is what OLD friends are for.  Now I will get on writing my Christmas card, so have a nice evening and.............. Be Good
