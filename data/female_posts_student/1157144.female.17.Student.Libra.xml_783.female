I'm going to say though, that due to the nature of such a corny film... they will alliance against a greater evil, and once that is killed off, fight each other but of course, it will be a standstill, and each will wander the world aimlessly never knowing a great opponent.   Ok how about not?  What do you guys want to do this evening? I feel like eating cheese on bread. Not that that is an activity, but I think I will go do that now...
