I still have 3 ½ hours left and this is going to drive me mad having to wait that long. It’s a good thing I have my blog otherwise I would have nothing to do on my down time. Today the only thing I have going for me is waiting patiently for my cousin Bernadette to have her baby girl. She went into the hospital at 3:00 am this morning and the baby should be here any time (crossing my fingers). I am awaiting the call from my mom telling me so. It is always so exciting to hear of news of a new member of my already large family, remember that my mom is one of 13 children and each of them average 3 children of there own and it goes on and on.  Well I should be going now, I have some work to do finally... yippy!
