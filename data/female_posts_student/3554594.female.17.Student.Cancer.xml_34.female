Yet it’s too late to wonder now Coz I love you with everything I am  The warmth embrace of an angel’s wings Do comfort me at night Oh how could an angel kiss so sweet? I’m so thankful you are mine You plummeted down from heaven high Down right here to my waiting arms Oh how could an angel’s kiss Be so fierce? It makes me wonder why. You’re everything I have hoped for How could an angel love me so?
