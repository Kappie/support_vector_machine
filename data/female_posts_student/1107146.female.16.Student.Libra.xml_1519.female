It is thus that I've resolved to make at least one short post a day on here, just to keep this mofo alive, and I'll probably say something extremely random as well, and I would encourage the remaining members (Scott, Will, Z (maybe?), as infrequently as you all frequent this wonderful establishment) to either make fun of me or add your own equally random rantings and whatnot.   And let it be said, that I am a lonely old man, struggling for attention using trite speech patterns (L337, anyone?), ridicule, and strange, borderline bizarre, analysises (trite speech pattern) of my surroundings and events that I predict  could  happen and be amazingly funny if this proverbial outcome were to be reached.   This is mostly because I miss my girlfriend, and I feel to vent my frustrations in a manner consistent with my innate retardedness: hence.   So...two things.  One: popcorn is really good. It would be better if I hadn't saved the wuss bag for last, the bag that decided to set itself on fire and burn everything within to a buttery crisp. But it's still good, even when accompanied with tasteless, horsepiss Caffeine Free, Diet Pepsi.  Second: there is a band called Drunks With Guns, and their name is painfully apt or so I've heard. I'm going to download some of their songs now and I'll give an analysis later.   Later, team! w00t!
