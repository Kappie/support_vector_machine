I understand that the seasons are changing but I am getting fed up with the changes in the temperature. It must be nice to be a meteorologist. I hope someday that I can have a job and be wrong at any given time and then just say oops! I don't believe anything that I hear about the weather anymore. If I step outside and it is raining, then hey, I guess it is going to rain. Pathetic.
