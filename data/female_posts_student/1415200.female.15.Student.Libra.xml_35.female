You might think that because im cheerful in school. Im cheerful all the time.  You thought wrong. I can be deciving. Three months untill permit time, and 8 months and three days untill freedom. Forever until I get a life, and make things right. but whats new. Im gonna go, because no body cares. Well a few people might.  And, that's another story kids.
