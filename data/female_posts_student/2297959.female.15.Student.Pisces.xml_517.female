I'm sick of being someone i'm not Please get me out of this slump I'm sick of clapping  When I know I can do it better for myself I'm sick of waiting  Sick of all these words that will never matter  I'll wire these nerves together Hoping for a chance to think on time And I'm tracing over your letter To see if your intentions are as good as mine  But you're getting worse  I swear it It's hard to prove you're an understatement You're getting worse and I know That you'll be calling me again  I'm done with everything That had to do with you Don't worry you pictures are already burned I'm done with new friends Don't sell yourself short You'll lose it in the end  I can't help how I feel
