So yesterday I had to do a timed 2-mile run, at the very beginning of a double lacrosse practice. Me and Jen finished in 18:45, not too bad... not great though. Then there's Kendahl who finished the whole thing in like 10 minutes. And by the way, it was also snowing... a lot. I wasn't a big fan of this. Then during our fantabulous hour-long break between double practice, we kidnapped some food from Kelly's mom.... Poptarts and Girl Scout cookies and such. Anyone who went near my cookies had their eyeballs ripped out. I was also getting a lot of weird looks from people as we walked around eating because I was definitely making some sexified sound effects the whole time I was eating. Honestly, I quite enjoyed it. Then practice #2 went something like this: passing/ catching drills ("quicksticks" and such), then some sprinting/ throwing/ catching weird sort of shuttle drills for a loooooong time. Then we played some keep-away type game things then did a normal game-ish sort of thing... 5 on 5's or something like that. Of course I ended up covering Linda in the first round, who is ridiculously good, and I also suck crazy bad at anything defensive. Put me on offense, and I'm good to go, but defense, its not my thing. Then after that we ran a few laps, died, went home, did some random stuff (talked on the phone with Nick for like .002 seconds before I flipped out on my dad and told him to shut the fuck up, then was no longer allowed to use the phone, almost got in a fight with Rob, and probably Nick too, then just gave up on everything and went to bed.... and cried through pretty much all of that), then passed out.  As for today, I was pretty obnoxious today, but that's really ok because it put me in a good mood. Faber and Lasher took quite a bit of abuse from me, and I will not apologize for it because I enjoyed every second of it, but they are cool kids anyway for taking my shit. As far as lacrosse went, we did a lot of circuit training type stuff, but it wasn't too horrible. Except for the background music. Some of it was ok, but seriously... Really slow techno shit doesn't work for me. Its supposed to motivate us to play, not motivate us to cut off our ears. But anyway, after that, we did random rotations, 15 minutes each of running, stick work, and... basketball??? . Yeah. My little group consisting of Amy, Allie, Kelly, Alyson and Rose did our nice little half-assed 15 minute run... We jogged mad slow around the upstairs of the school and took like 5 breaks. Normally we have to run for at least 30 minutes, without stopping, and with coaches watching our every move, so it was some well-deserved nothingness. Then there was the whole basketball thing which I really do not understand at all. But I have no say in these things so whatever. So out of 3 hours of lacrosse practice, we used our sticks and did something actually somewhat related to the sport for a grand total of 15 minutes. THE LIST is being posted supposedly on Friday, so I take it we are also getting uniforms Friday considering we have a scrimmage the next day. Allie and I are definitely looking forward to the game against Jefferson on the 7th because we have acquired quite a few enemies over there in J-town. Could it be because we kicked their asses twice? Or just because we're assholes? Hmmm... w()()t.... I'm so looking forward to running a timed mile tomorrow.... yeeeah not. But hey, its nothing compared to yesterday.   Oh well.... I'm in a strangely good mood. I don't know why. I think I'm bipolar or something haha.... Yesterday I was in a really really bad mood and today I'm in a good one. I have weird random mood swings. Oh wellllll, it doesn't matter. At the moment, its all good in the neighborhood.  Now I think I will attempt to work on my history research thing a little bit and wait for the kid to come home from where ever he is, 'cause at the moment, I have no one to talk to, which is why I am continuing to ramble in this thing. But now I'm done.
