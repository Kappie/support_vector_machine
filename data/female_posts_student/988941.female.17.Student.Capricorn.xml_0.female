LOL. Stress stress stress! Perhaps we should all take up yoga? Or learn another language fluently so that if we fail really badly we can move to that country and be a whole new person. Wouldn't that be quite good, if when your life got so bad you could just step out of it and into a whole new one! Brilliant.  Well, people, blog!!!!
