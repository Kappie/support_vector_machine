Katy P joined us (the plane was an hour late) and we introduced ourselves to the church. It was only a three hour service with lots and lots of singing. We got most of it translated. After that we got to sing with the youth choir. When I say sing - we danced and tried to pick up the words in Xhosa but were not very successful! They had a welcome meal for us afterwards - Chicken curry and rice.   After lunch we went back to the accomadation to do a lot of planning and preparation and we had our first afernoon of good weather! Before that it had been very very cold and wet - quite miserable.   Anyway - 'm sure that this evening someone else will be on this to update from today (Monday)  Viv
