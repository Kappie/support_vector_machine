Im waiting, waiting for the day to come Waiting for the only One To show, He love Please, dont let me run away Im waiting, waiting to see His face   He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed.   Im waiting, waiting for the day to come Waiting for the only One To show, He love Please, dont let me run away Im waiting, waiting to see His face
