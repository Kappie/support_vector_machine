I can help you move your blog, if you want. You just need to invite me to join and set me as admin so that I can make changes to the settings (and template, if need be). I do it this way because I don't want to know what your Blogger username and password is -- that's your private information. That's the way that I manage Brian's (and Pia's too when she has problems) blog. I just fix stuff, but I won't post anything (because it's yours).    NET: I thought you were migrating your site to Golden Sushi? What happened? There's still plenty of room here!
