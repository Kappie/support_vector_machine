I dreamt I was in my Con Law class from last semester, and the professor was making me go over my answers to his exam...in front of the whole class.  He was very kind about my stupidity though, but since it wasn't really him, I'm not going to give him any credit for that one.  Anyway, it was very weird.  And since that class is now over, it's strange that I would dream about it now.  But dream it I did.  And I still remember it now, which is also strange, because I usually never remember my dreams longer than a few minutes after waking up.    Oh, well, speaking of sleep...I feel rather like taking a nap...
