Spike is my dog who thinks he´s human, and is perfect, although he has a bit of a barking problem, is overly-attentive, and tried to kill Tracy once.  But, really, he´s only a red,miniature dachshund   here´s a portion of a recent email from my mom : Hank understands, "Don't bite." He also understands, "Where's Spike?" Then Hank goes to look for Spike, and yes, bite him. When your dad says "brush" Hank stares at your dad adoringly and allows your dad to brush him. Spike understands,"Where's Rachel?"Then he looks around and seems confused, so I won't do that any more. Spike also understands "stay," and sometimes he will. Aren't they smart? Well they are smart, disobedient, willful, and have little impulse control.  Thanks Mom, that made me laugh!
