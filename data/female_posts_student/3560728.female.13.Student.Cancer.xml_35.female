My song writing is all sucking, probably because I'm all depressed because I can't write a song like "Oh the world is cruel/I cannot go to the wartped tour and see Taking Back Sunday, Story of the Year, Hazen Street, etc." Well, I could but it would suck worse than usual...Anywho, I don't know if I mentioned that my brother ordered Revolutions on Canvas for my birthday. I'm stoked to read it! Other than that my life's been a whole lot of nothing lately, although I suppose I haven't been tempting fate or anything while I sit around and eat large quantities of food at home. I did go to Becky's for a sleep over, but I think I'm allergic to her rats or something because I've never sneezed so much in my life! LOL! They R adorable though..Everyone is always like "rats??! EEW!" but they R so sweet! People judge them just because they have creepy tails. They can't help it! Yeah, so yesterday Becky, Melissa, and I went shopping and took the wrong bus, and we had to call my brother and be like "Uh...how do we get to Park Royal from Phibbs Exchange??" It was actually incredibly hillarious, cuz it's kinda hard to do what we did. Well it was funny except for the fact that we were on a bus for 2 and a half hours and we ate lunch at like 3:00. But, shopping was good. It was kinda our attempt to get Melissa some new clothes so that she can avoid the whole skank label next year, cuz she's going to a different highschool than Becky and she has this tendancy to pick out the worst clothes ever. At one point she found this lime green mini skirt that was all frilly and we were like "Umm...there's something about it that's not quite right..." LOL! Oh, and I haven't seen N.P. since grad, but I have yet to forget him...
