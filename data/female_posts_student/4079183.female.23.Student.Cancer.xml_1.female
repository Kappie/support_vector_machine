I would love to look back and see what others put for their first blog but then again this is me, so here goes. I am Brandy as those of you who have previously known me know. I just had my 23rd birthday this month along with my first wedding anniversary with my ever so loved husband Robert. I am the mother of my two beautiful daughters: Allysha (7) and Allyssa (3). My daughters were not fathered biologically by Robert however he is the only father that I have ever considered them to have. I was introduced to blogging by in reality by Jane, the wife of an ex-boyfriend that I had many years ago. That's pretty basic for now...
