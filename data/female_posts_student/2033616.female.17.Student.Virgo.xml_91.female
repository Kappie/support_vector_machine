I don't believe i will go into too many details, but things are better.  Sunday at church, after certain events... or certain non-events... i was left with the feeling that i must be some horrible Christian, a horrible person who doesn't deserve such friends--really Godly people can't possibly have such horrible rifts in their social life.  I felt like there was something wrong with me, there had to be.  Funny how even though i have so many people i love so very much... this small population of ones that think the lowest of me can bring me down.  Maybe you were right Sean... low self-esteem.  But!  My faith in myself has been restored (thank you for a second chance Sean).  I am very happy.  I have this thing about loosing things... anything.  I loose my favorite pencil, i tear my room apart.. my favorite CD, soon my floor is littered w/ the contents of my room... a friend, and I'm devastated.   So now, to end.  A quick word of thank you!  Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
