They're moving to San Diego without me and I'm extremely distraught. As a friend of mine wondered, Why does everyone live in San Diego? Because, dear friends, it is sooooo much better than this dry and hot dump we call "Sacramento." I digress. We talked until it was time to leave to go to Bob's apartment.       Sarah, Josh, Ashleigh, Paul, and Derek were already there. Obviously Bob as well. I tell ya, if there's one thing Bob has a lot of, it's booze. I was the only minor in the room so I wasn't allowed to drink anything. They were more than willing to fix me up a margarita or something, but my dad told me not to drink any alcohol. Because I'm a good girl, I didn't drink anything more than lemonade and root beer.       ...  or did I ??? Hmmm ...       A couple of people got wasted but overall it was a good night. No music at all, but it wasn't a party. I at some Flamin' Hot Cheetos when I wasn't supposed to and paid for it. Blluuurgghh. Almost felt like purging out my guts at one point. Josh and I were talking about suicide and the different ways to do it. He was talking about how stupid it was for some people to jump off the cliff to their deaths only to find out that going over the edge only means another level of cliff. So they end up mangled up at the end and surviving. I don't know what I found that hysterically funny, but I was cracking up so hard. I think the worse part about committing suicide is actually surviving. I think guys are the only people who would discuss this type of thing with me. Peh.       Anyhow, the Ways drove me back home and my sister was home from Chicago. I dragged her out and we said good-bye to them for the last time until we see them again in October. About one o'clock in the morning, I checked out all the cool stuff my aunts and grandmothers from Chicago got me. I got a super cool pink plaid watch from Guess (which is extremely swanky for me), a red sweatshirt that says "Columbia College of Chicago", and something else that I can't quite remember now.       I've been stuck in a conciousness of peach fuzz. Time is unlinear and my memory has gone down to the toilet. I think all that helium I've been sucking over the years has finally caught up with me. My brain cells are screaming as they die. I need to excercise the remaining cells with school this year.       My doctor says I need to have "fun" this year. "Fun". What is this "fun"? Such a foreign concept. Drawing constitutes as fun, right? If I draw enough pretty pictures, will that equal a sufficient amount of fun?       I'm going to continue drawing now. And screaming at the computer. Eventually I'll get tired and sleep.       = Cristie
