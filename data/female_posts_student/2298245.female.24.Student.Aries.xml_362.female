Most annoying.  No time to check it out now, so hard to say whether I will like it better or worse.  In deep trouble exam wise.  Feeling pretty good about Evidence tonight.  Had a crisis moment on Saturday studying with someone from another section.  But returned home to studying what my prof has taught me, and I am feeling more confident now.  We shall see come tonight for sure.  The problem now is Business Organizations.  This class has been a thorn in my side all semester, and now it is getting ready to pay me back for all my neglect big time.  Here's hoping I don't fail.  I keep lowering my expectations, but right now, lack of failure or a D or something is really all I can ask for.  And hopefully I'll do OK in everything else this semester to help balance out the lot.  My new mantra:  It'll all be over on Wednesday, it'll all be over on Wednesday, it'll all be over on Wednesday...
