I don't think I am that bad. But then again, I haven't actually interacted with other cars, so who knows. I have really never had the need to drive anywhere anyway. My friends are all starting to drive now, Leah drives, mom will take me where I need to go, and then I always have lived right across the street from school and now that I am homeschooled it definitely doesn't matter. But yeah, I believe it is time Bre makes it out on the road!      Moving on, I have been one busy person the past few days. It is craziness. I see it now that the summer is slowing down to the end, I find I have so much to do. Like I said, craziness. Well, yesterday like I mentioned was Brickyard Sunday. Good ol' Jeff Gordon won. I don't really care too much who wins, but I find it exciting just to watch knowing that race is down the street from my house and is being broadcasted everywhere, well kinda. So yeah, as I sat and watched the race Leah and dad finally returned home from there trip. We all finished watching the race and they of course told stories about their trip. Well after the race was over I found I had so much energy inside me, I was ready to let loose alittle. I seriously was just running and jumping all over the house cause I wanted to so something, anything really. Well finally come 8:30 Sunday evening I IMed William and asked to do something. He agreed. So we went to Dairy Queen. I wanted to get the new Brownie Batter. THEY WERE OUT. So I wanted to get the Reese's Cup Blizzard. THEY WERE OUT. Was I cursed or something? How did an ice cream place be out of two of the top things on my list? So I was on my way to see if I was going to get strike three. But thankfully, they did have a Heath Blizzard. So after all that, we took our ice cream over to the park and sat and ate it. Being filled with the yummy ice cream we went and swang, slid down the slides, went on the merry-go-round (which I think he got sicky feelin' on).  The we decided to just sit and talk til my curfew. Yes, this time I made it home on time. I made sure to read my clock when it came close to 12.  So we came home on time. We sat around for while talking with my brother and parents. Then they left around 12:30 in the morning to go do some stuff.  So I told William he could just go on home and I would just go to bed. No way was that going to happen. He thought he should wait til the parentals returned. YES SIR! Such a protector. So they returned about 1:30. We all sat around and joked and talked more. Mom decided to go to bed, Dusty went to sleep out in the cottage and my dad stayed up with me and William for alittle longer until he was out. Yes, you could tell he was in a deep sleep from the way he was snoring. So William and I just sat around some more and enjoyed each others company. Finally around 2:30 he left. I went to bed and all was good.  I woke up today alittle after 11. I watched Breakfast at Tiffany's. I love that movie! They I chilled around the house. I talked my mom into getting me a chicken quesadilla too. Mmmmmm was it delicious! Then I decided I would take a shower and go do something with my dad. We went to Galyans to get him shoes, Dairy Queen again to get him a MooLatte, Home Depot to get my mom a back porch light, and Target to get my comforter, but they didn't have it so we went to Meijer and got the other one I liked. Finally made it home around 11ish. I chilled some more drinking a Dr. Pepper straight from the bottle. I love drinks that come from out of bottles. They taste so much better. Cause personally, Dr. Pepper is nasty straight from a can. It is so flat tasting.  But dad being a coke bottle collector, I get to drink alot from bottles. But he did get the Dr. Pepper ones while on his trip. I think that is why I like Jones Sodas too. They got yummy flavors that taste great. Root beer and Cream Soda in a bottle is awesome too. Ok,ok no more about bottle drinking. Just because I do say things taste better in a bottle doesn't mean I encourage any acoholic drinking from bottles. So yeah, today was fun stuff!      Ok, wow, I have typed so much it's amazing. I could so say more. But I have plenty of more opportunities to talk about other stuff, at another time.  Life can get pretty stressful. But I am learning every day to just at least smile and try to be happy. I just am soooo full of energy!!!! Well, so I can go let some energy out, I am outtie!
