I was wondering about many things today. Why are people obsessed with their weight. Why do people spend millions of dollars each year or whatever amount of money just to make themselves beautiful. I think the answer, ladies and gentlemen, is that people are so wrapped up in image. I know a handful who aren't. I'm not wrapped up in image. Why spend millions of dollars trying to perfect faces when we're all going down the six-feet hole anyway? The answer is, in this life, there is no sure thing. That is the beauty of it. We are all *creatures* chasing the wind and we all end up in the ditch and then the afterlife. Our life has to be meaningful-and chasing the wind can be enjoyable. We shouldn't kill ourselves becuse a problem comes along the way. There is always the chance that you will breath again the fresh air of hapiness. I hate when war comes and destroy's people's order of lives. People should just love each other and you know I'm right. So there.  Dear Mark, You are my bitch.
