You know? *I've got a really varied assortment of days!* Yup... then there's the psycho balloon popping blood day *see IT for futher details* and the help I've turned into a marinaded chicken day and I can't spell marinaded. Is that it? No really I'm sane! Don't adjust your volume control! *that isn't me screaming no!* But really... what have I done today! Wait a minute... I probably killed a small gathering of trees in maths today. ... ... Okay, so I destroyed a whole forest trying to work out what was going on! So sue me! *eeek, don't!* (Actually, me and Izzy put together probably destroyed the Amazon *shhh!*)
