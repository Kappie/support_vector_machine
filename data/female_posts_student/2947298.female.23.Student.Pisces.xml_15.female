It was right in D.C. and well it was great to be so close to the rally.  It was also cool to be so close to the musuems.  I also saw my Grandmother Nikki, Rolf and Bill.  Sorry to everyone else I missed this time.  I will be having lunch with my Aunt Goo whom I have not seen for over a year!   urlLink    The count last I heard was over a  Million .  They had only permits for 700,000.  Pro-Lifers were no more than a hundred and some were even arrestted for protesting with out a permit. Our own pictures will be up shortly. Ross was interviewed by the  urlLink WASHINGTON POST  and College something. We got there around 10:00am and met up with other  urlLink Ramapo Students  listened to speakers such as Hilary Clinton and then Marched on Washington at 12:30pm.  After completing the circle which took about a hour and a half we sat and listened to speakers from all over and from such organizations such as NAACP, and celebrities and the like. Well it's true many people feel strongly about this March for Women's Lives  but why do I do this?  (prepare for rant till links below - i've had better but its early right now)  They consider  urlLink Emergency Contraceptive  to be an Abortion by THEIR RELIGIOUS VIEWS.  I do not. All Pro-Lifers just have this religious stance, and well not everyone is Christian, not everyone follows your God and I certainly don't! And well, "If you don't believe in abortion, Don't have one" I believe what I would choose for myself is not what others would choose. I would not, nor have I ever had an abortion. But some people can not pay for BirthControl, some people can not pay for the Pregnancy Test, and some people can not pay to have the abortion or to take the time off work to have the child, or even to pay for the child once in this world.  So I believe that it is for them, to make abortion more accessible and to make REAL SEX ED more accessible. I do not aggree with our funding to be dedicated to Absitinence, I believe teaching prevention and knowledge is the best way. I do not think it should be a choice between eating dinner that week or getting an abortion. It should be a private issue. I do not think WHITE MEN should decide WHAT IS OKAY FOR MY BODY. It is my CHOICE, do not decide my choice and everyone elses based on your own choices. And how dignified can you be waving baby fetus' around.  They weren't your's and they are not from abortions they were form late term miscarriages. Could you imagine being that Mother's whose unborn child that is getting waved around at Marches. It is okay to give birth to a child, it helps feed the war machine.  It is okay to kill SONS AND DAUGHTERS once fully grown in WAR.  So long as we have enough BODIES to send over THEN ITS OKAY?! I am a Catholic Anti-War Pro-Choice college student. It makes more sense for me to have abortion, I do not believe EC kills a child, I do not think in 72hours that is a child. I still have the choice. They are Pro-Choice so that they can kill whatever 18 and up person they can find. Carring a DEAD SOLDIERS picture would be illegal! To me those people fighting deserve not to die in vain. AND I DESERVE MY CHOICE - MY FREEDOM!
