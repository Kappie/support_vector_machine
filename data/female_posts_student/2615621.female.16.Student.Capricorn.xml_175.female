"all of this" and how mark didnt sound like himself but i could hear tom? well..thats cuz its not mark..its the dude from the cure...duhhhh. lol im so bright.   I showed bay, ash, and mikel my song tonite. it made bay upset and ash and mikel were deeply impressed. i didnt think i would get that kind of reaction. here it is:  Prefers to fly   walking through a storm as the rain pours down on ur soul life has taken its toll  u dance with the angels holding their hands tight as u wish to fly away you think their the answer, the solution, the friend but they dont want to know u until the end.  i talk to angels,but u prefer to fly.  running down lifes path  with a lot on ur mind u see a stone and wonder why ur not strong enough to kick it out of the way  u dance with the angels holding their hands tight as u wish to fly away you think their the answer, the solution, the friend but they dont want to know u until the end.  i talk to angels,but u prefer to fly.  you come in one door but want to leave through another the medicine is out of date  and the cure is too weak to mend your fate   dance with the angels holding their hands tight as u wish to fly away you think their the answer, the solution, the friend but they dont want to know u until the end.  i talk to angels,but u prefer to fly.  There ya go..theres my song. "prefers to fly"   *much love and fairy dust*
