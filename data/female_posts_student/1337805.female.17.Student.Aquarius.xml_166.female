At least my mom isn't sleeping onsite. I'd freak.  Reletively happy though, might get to see Adam before I leave. Have a moment of rest before all hell breaks loose with the LDC. Still no forms for HALF the people who I KNOW are going. (They've called, and said). So..makes life funner.  Been making HELLA money babysitting. It feels weird to have money. Dying my hair now :) Mystery color, for everyone.   Gotta go convince mom to help me dye my hair now. Mwwahaha....
