The weeds looked out of place because they grew in random places as opposed to in the straight lines of the legit plants. Then I pondered about how realitive the concept of order was, or rather how we perceive order on such a narrow wavelength. The legit plants in the row were not in a perfect row, it would be impossible for them to be in a  perfect  row. They would all have to be clones of the same plant with a perfect symetrical branch system, and the line would have to be straight down past the subatomic level.   Then I realized that the amount of order it takes for even a plant (a weed, even) to grow, from the electrons surrounding the atoms of the elements which form the molecules and the compounds and the way they wrap around each other to form an organism which feeds on water and sunlight and reproduces itself an infinate number of times is far FAR FAR more orderly then any stupid fricken line of bushes on the side of my house. And then I wondered why I was destroying this, when it occured to me again that even a concept such as destruction follows a very specific order... nothing of the plant is actually "destroyed", it simply enters into a process of assimulation with its surroundings. Eventaully some of those atoms will end up in other plants. Which brings me to a theory of mine, which is that even something as seemingly chaotic as "decay" is merely inperceivable order.  Chaos is inperceivable order.   Even the idea of hitting something and it breaking is cause and effect. Even the concept of death, which is considered by a few atheist's I've talked to be the crowning proof of the fact that humanity and the world is in constant decay, even death is a begining/end style deal. The idea of "decay" suggests that something is going from more order to less order... which means there has to be order to start out with. But the concept of decay is egocentrical to humanity's wavelength of order.   All those astroids flying around up there in space wacking each other are following a very complicated system of gravitational forces and physics. When light hits something it reflects in a very predictable manner... the idea of predicting something implies you are observing a *pattern* and drawing the lines to see where its going next and how its going to repeat itself.  I'm pulling completely random examples, but everything is an example.  So back to my original point... which is that weeding is a menial, useless task. It's like standing on the beach screaming at the incoming tide. You can't stop them, they'll just keep coming. But unfortunately I am part of another system, which is a family structure... which means I have to do what my parents say or else I don't eat. Logical? Yes.
