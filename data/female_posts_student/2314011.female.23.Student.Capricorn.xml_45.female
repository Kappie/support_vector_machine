Just thought I'd check up on my email and favorite blogs, and suddenly, I don't feel like sleeping.  Think it had more to do with the movie we'd just finished watching: "Pirates of the Caribbean".  It would have been sooo much better had it been an hour shorter.  No Disney movie should be over 2 hours long.  Especially not one about a damn ride.    Okay, this is going to be cut a bit short, as I'm engaging in a conversation with my first fan.
