Francesca sent me her questions and one really got to me...it was very personal and i couldnt say the whole thing on the survey but, i e-mailed her back on a private e-mail telling her everything. It seems alot of people, are falling in love, and i feel abit, lonely, i mean i know how they feel, honestly i do..but now a days, i just dont feel like.......me. Seriously i've just had the worst of luck this year, besides meeting good friends the whole relationship thing just isnt working. I mean, there was Jeremy, oh god..dont get me started lol, and from him on i really didnt go out with anyone, then cheston and josh came along, what can i say lol...but they were total jerks and i failed to see that until my buddy franny helped me realize. thanx for that. Then ryan, nothing changed,,,that whole rule about not dating your friends came into play. I just didnt feel the same as he felt for me. but, of course we're still great friends. So now here I am, meeting hot 17 year old Alaskan guys while being single at the same time. So im gonna go back to listening to my All-American Rejects cd....right now im listening to Why Worry.....i love this cd, it states exactly how im feeling.
