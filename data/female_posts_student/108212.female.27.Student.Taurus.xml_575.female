Dont know why he calls it that but thats how I remember the car.  I read somewhere that BMW re-released the car last year, but I for one havent seen the new series out on the L.I.E. (Long Island Expressway).  I wonder if it can still fit 4 comfortably.  That is.. one adult and 4 kids!  =)  Ha! Ha!    6 more days till the Vegas Vacation.  I cant wait.  Dot is bringing the Panasonic Cam she bought 2 weeks ago.  I for one am just glad that I can take off. The last two months have been brutal work wise.  Not a day that I start worrying about work.  One word... OVERLOAD!  The countdown begins.    Net
