Some people believe that we live, we die, boo-hoo cry my a river, build me a bridge, and get over it cuz I don't care about your problems. Some believe that God is our savior and will guide the way to happiness. And then there are those who just say "I'm alive" period. Nothing more, nothing less. Just a simple answer that expresses a million feelings of confusion into two words. What's the purpose in life? Is there a reason for everything, or is that just all in our heads? Is God supposed to be what guides us, or are we really all on our own just trying to get by? Do I  deserve  the bad in my life? Is there someone meant for me our there somewhere, or is that just something a lonely bastard said one night and the whole world uses it as an excuse? That's me. The confused. The messed up one. The one who comes to a fork in the road and asks everyone for directions and  still  can't find the right path. It's hard being this confused. You don't know what to do about anything, and it ends up causing more problems later on. To be quite honest, sometimes it's good to have an open mind about things. Instead of always having to choose the same path, you can switch around and experiment a little. But a lot of my friends aren't like that, not that I'm dissing them in any way, it's just harder on me. Sometimes I just need to handle things by sitting right at the fork in the road with a map on my legs and watch the cars pass me by. Especially with the religion topic. Some of my friends believe that God is what lights the way to a happy life. That's fine that they think that way and connect with Him that way, but I'm not like that. I believe that he loves us, but I don't think I can put my whole heart and soul into something that has never helped me in the past. I tried that road and it was way too bumpy of a ride for me.. And sometimes I feel like they don't accept it. It may just be all in my head, but that's what I seem to be feeling. There are so many issues like that, and it's hard to work through sometimes, cuz I'm very dependent on my friends, but I like to do my own thing sometimes. I don't know. But what I do know is that no matter what it is that you think when someone asks you about your view of the world is what makes you you. I hide in the corner watching the world go by..What do you do?
