His name is Davis, good lord hes hot, he lives in Milwaulkie, i dont know how to spell that by the way. Yeah, so Lynzi better call me because i really want to go to the zoo tomarrow...so because i dont really have anything else to say other than happy birthday jessica!! im going to leave you with lyrics of my favorite song right now, another lonley day by ben harper...  Yes indeed, I'm alone again. And here comes emptiness crashing in. It's either love or hate, I can't find in between, 'cause I've been with witches and I've been with a queen. It wouldn't have worked out anyway.  So now it's just another lonely day. Further along we just may. But for now it's just another lonely day.  Wish there was something now I could say or do. I can resist anything but the temptation from you. But I'd rather walk alone than chase you around. I'd rather fall myself than let you drag me on down. It wouldn't have worked out anyway.  And now it's just another lonely day. Further along we just may. But for now, it's just another lonely day.  Yesterday seems like a life ago, 'cause the one I love today, I hardly know, You I held so close in my heart, Oh dear, Grow further from me with every fallen tear. It wouldn't have worked out anyway.  So now it's just another lonely day. Further along we just may. But for now it's just another lonely day. For now it's just another lonely day. For now it's just another lonely day.
