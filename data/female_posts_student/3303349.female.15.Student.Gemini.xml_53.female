Very good but it made me miss Paul more than i already do! some of those lyrics were so intense that I just couldn't stop thinking boaut him! I know it sounds funny but it's true. I realise I am so lucky to have him. I know we've got something special. I amuse myself by picturing the couples walking stiffly down the hall holding hands and the girls who use guys and vise versa and I am just so glad that Paul and I have something so much better than that! sure it's only been about 3 weeks and we've only gone on one date but I already know that this is gonna be the real deal. and for that i thank God every day.
