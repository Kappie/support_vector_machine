Because really, something is going on in the cosmos and it's fucking my shit up. I find myself in a rough transitioninto ordinary life these days and I don't know what the hell it's about. Everything just seems a bit off...quirky, in fact.   For starters, my garbage disposal is protesting my return to the apartment by just humming when I flip the switch. No disposal to speak of...just humming.   I broke my hot Calvin capris. They have completely supperfluous straps across the tops of the pockets that snap on to the side. Must have been too zealous with the one on the left becausethe snappopped right off and now I must live with a flapping strap above my left pocket.   I can't stay awake past 10 to save my life. Want to read (because I can't get enough of Book 5 already)? Or watch the late re-run edition of Will  Grace? No, sorry. The eyes start to water and head droops long about 1007 and it's downhill after that. And THEN, I can't pull myself out of bed before 7; consequently, I'm getting to work later and later as each day goes by.   Speaking of work...it's a fucking fridge in here. My productivity level is lower than usual, as my fingers are numb, which doesn't make for the best typing. And I can't get enough junk food while I'm here. Cupcake at 1030? Sure. Hotdog, Doritos and Wild Cherry Pepsi for lunch? Absolutely. Doughnut for dessert? Why the hell not? Take the stairs to compensate for the cuisine and drive to work on account of the above-mentioned lateness?Ha! Surely you jest.
