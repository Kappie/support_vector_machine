But yes yes, that is very goot. I took the SAT in 7th grade and got an 1100 or something and they were flipping out, even tho a lot of other kids did hella better than me.  I was Seattle, hoo-ah! If that doesn't complete the "die from a heroin OD when I'm 30" bit, I don't know what does.     Congratulations, you're Seattle, the Emerald City.  What US city are you?  urlLink Take the quiz  by  urlLink Girlwithagun .
