I went to the gym this morning and am going to eat healthy - really healthy for the rest of the week except Friday cause my Dad is coming in, and I think this time he is stay and going to live with us again.  And well we are going to Peters Drive In on the Friday he comes in.  I did an hour and a half workout of cardio this morning at the gym and about half an hour of weights.  I am eating healthy, working out, I SHOULD be able to loose weight.  I mean I know I heard of what happens when people get older, and they gain weight and stuff but AHHHHHHHHH I am only 16!!!!!!!!!!!  Yesterday Chels and I went to Harry Potter and then got ice cream, though she barely ate anything.  No wonder she is so thin!  And well I went to the stampede breakfast at Walmart and got free food and stuff.  Today I have to vacuum later on, water the garden, and get all the dust out of the bathroom mats.  I have to drive my Mom to the hospital on Wednesday for her surgery and then I get to drive her back.  I think on Tuesday she is also going to show me how to get to Bishop Grandin so I know how to get there for Summer School.  I am excited for Summer School.  I will get to meet new people and well it was be a STRUCTURED Social class, instead of like the independant stuff they try to make us work with at BOB.
