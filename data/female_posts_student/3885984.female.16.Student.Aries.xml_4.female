Now, I'm not as good with poetry as I am with stories, but I do love this poem, so I thought I'd share it with you. It might seem silly or even stupid to some of you, but oh well!   .:.Acceptance.:.  She's too short, He's too tall, Her eye-brows are too thick, And his nose is too small. She acts too sad, He looks to weird, Her freckles are too big, And no one likes his beard. Her mouth is filled with metal, He has four eyes instead of two, Her hair is way too dark,  And his eyes are way too blue. She paints her nails black, He always wears a tie, She'll never smile,  And he'll never cry. She won't be noticed, He won't make the team, Her name will never be in lights, And he'll never achieve his dream. Why must we all be judged? Why is being accepted so rough? Why do people try so hard? And why are teenage years so tough? No one should be judged,  No one should hurt from something you say, No one should be excluded, And most of all, no one should be treated this way. ***  Well, that's all for now. JKM OUT!
