Its been raining here for three weeks.  I don't live in Seattle or London, I don't particularly enjoy the rain anymore as its keeping me cooped up inside and I'm getting the "cabin fever".  Today the rain is making me reminiss.  I want to go barefoot in shorts and jump in the puddles and splash around like I did when I was younger.  I want to go to Sam Murphy's house and make mud pies with all of her moms good spoons and forks and brand new tupperware, I could go to Nico's house and play office with the old business supplies lying around.  I want to go to Molly Beth's house and play dressup and put on her mum's makeup or to Adam's and build a fort out on the huge rock in his back yard with a tarp his dad gave us.    Sometimes I think I want to do my life over.  To not lose track of some of the people I miss the most.  Not waste time or give up the aforementioned people in lieu of people who will turn out to not mean anything.  I know if that happened I wouldn't be who I am today, but whats not to say that I couldn't be someone better than I am now.  Someone who has completed college, someone who has a bright shining future.  Someone who is comfortable enough in her own skin to not need to wear all these masks and be such a chameleon.  Sometimes i wish I could just be me...
