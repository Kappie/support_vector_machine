The food was bad, I thought.  I liked the Jester performance.  Although, I suppose I'm a bit bias.  I will admit it was fun getting all dressed up.  After the Madrigal Renae and I hung out with Lizzie and Sean for a tad bit and sorta just drove around and did random things.  Such as photo developing and socializing.  Also on Friday I admitted somethings to myself that I'm not sure I'd like to repeat and therefore choose not to on the internet.  But they say the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem so maybe by admitting these things (even though I wouldn't classify them as a problem) I can overcome them.    Today my mother woke me at noon to tell me that we were going out to the mall because she wanted to be done with Christmas shopping.  Normally I think the mall should be a happy place.  I mean Santa is there and today they had carolers and a 4-piece band playing.  But the mall is not such a happy place.  Having to wait 20 minutes to try something on and then another 30 to pay for it does not make me happy.  Once I convinced my mom that we would shop another day we came home.   I really need to do some homework.  This still means I'll do it tomorrow.  At the moment I'm sorta stuck at home with my brother.  The Person parents went out tonight and asked me to stay home with the lil' bro.  So I'm here.  Writing in this.  Ya I'm cool I know.  ~tata
