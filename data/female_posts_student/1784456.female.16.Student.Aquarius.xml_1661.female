And I'm not gonna tell you where it is :P Ahh freedom for thought! Well yeah... what's changed since Wed? Oooh, I went to a yoga class! *this last time i chose to do exercise was when i did ballet in year 5* Hehe... so as you can guess I was the one at the back of the glass who cheered when the lady said 'don't do this if you feel that you can't'. Yes, once again Britain's youth is up shown by the older generation who were happily snapping their back in two. *don't worry, Laura came with me and she was the one doing the back bending* Also, our friend Dave fractured his skull! :( He was playing football and somehow ran into a wall! He was unconscious for ages. :( I hope he gets better! Ahh it's not as crazy and random without him! I wanna hug from Davvveeee!
