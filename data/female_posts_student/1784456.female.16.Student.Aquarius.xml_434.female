Anyway... Did any of you see Martins scars today they were absoultly disguisting!!  If he tries showing them to you run away very quickly. Do you know what Daves problem was today?  At one point i was really parped off with them both.  Wow I think that this is the longest blog that I have ever written, and I'm touch typing - wow!!! So I have not got anymore news really apart from I would like to say ta muchly to Snizzy for forgetting to apologise for me. :(
