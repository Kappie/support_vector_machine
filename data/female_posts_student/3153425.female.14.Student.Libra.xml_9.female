I was so happy. :) She said I deserved it after being so obediant with my school work.  You know what? It's so freezing right now.. I hate winter. It's horrid.  God I don't want to go to school tomorrow.. It's gunna be a total judge fest as it's casual clothes. Maybe I should just go in my uniform? I dunno.. I really dread it. Does anyone else dread it, I wonder..? Man it's cold.. I need a blanket or something.. As you can see this is a very mixed up post.. I'm fairly stuffed from today's doings.. Oh Well.. Life Awaits..
