I don't know what possessed me to try it today.  I felt a little bit daring, though, so I thought what the heck...perhaps I just felt like moving, to just keep on moving, carried away by the tunes from my iPod.  Whatever spirit moved me, move me it did, right on up the escalator.  And at first it went rahter well, if I do say so myself.  I was proud of my prowess, as I weaved and dashed between those less bold souls who were contendedly relying on the motor to carry them to the top.  I was graceful and lyrical.  Then, the song changed and I caught my foot.  My knee crashed into one of the escalator stairs.  Now I have two holes in my knee - battle scars from my hard fought war with the escalator.   Just in case you're keeping score, it won.
