Now we know why they made it using a computer. Hehe, it didn't even get to the cinema. It's quite sad actually, all Barbie's are stick thin. Do we all have to be stick thin? That's like every one being clones, if we all looked like super models would the world be better off? I bet every one would suddenly like large people or something strange. Hmm, getting a bit too deep Katie, snap out of it! Oh by the way Izzy, I have your birthday and christmas present! Can you tell what it is yet?
