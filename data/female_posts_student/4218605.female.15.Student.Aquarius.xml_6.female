One of those times it was dead-on. Pissed, yet somewhat satisfied at the same time.  Shit, I just remember I have a  urlLink Xanga . Whatever. I hate Xanga with a fiery passion.  Anywho. Back to .. whatever.  I feel like watching  Fight Club . The need to destroy things is .. pretty intense right now. But, I have nothing to destroy. Except for myself. So .. why not.  He pissed me off. He will continue, but I don't have anything to worry about starting tomorrow. Tonight, he can have his fun. I can deal. I can deal with myself, and not take it out on him. It's better. I'd rather be pissed at myself than him. Er, I dunno. I'd rather .. take pain than him take pain. I s'pose I'm used to it.  I drove around with Alex for a while. We picked up Joseph, too. And visited Tristan. Stopped by MLK (and I flipped it off, with both hands), and stopped by Rocketown to see if anybody was working, besides in the skatepark. No. They come in at 5, I remember. I need to start working there again. And Gumby and Ira can come visit me. It'd be pimp fa sho. I might go tonight, I dunno. If Alex can get the car. If he wasn't incredibly late. Stupid Alex.  I'm out.
