I traded in my Game Cube, (soon to trade in these tomorrow) Gameboy Color, N 64, some controllers, and Xbox. My cousin spilled milk on our PS2 and we were pissed..(we=brother and I) I wanted to kill him. Hopefully I'll have enough store credit at Game Trader to get a PS2. I hope! I want to buy Final Fantasy XI and play with mah boyfriend, Terik. Speaking of Terik..I miss him. I haven't seen him in a couple of days. I'll be gone for a week starting on the 12th of June. His birthday is on the 24th, and my mommeh's is the 28th. Jeez...Too many. Lol. I don't know what to do now..Im just writing this and drawing on a spare sheet of paper I found. I feel like RPGing with someone. I have horrible memories witht hat though. I was fucking retarted because I cheated on my boyfriend with an internet guy. I wish I could take it all back. I hate myself for it everyday. I try to forget but. . .I know I fucked up real bad and would spend the rest of my life to make up for it. I do what I can for him. i try to do everything but im only human. I love him and I guess I didn't see that before. I love him now and I know I always will. Oh well. . .I miss him right now. God it's hot..*sweats*
