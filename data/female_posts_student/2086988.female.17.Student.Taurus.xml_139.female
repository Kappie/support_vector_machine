I think when I turn 18 I'm going to do something cool, like either get my belly button pierced or my tongue...hmmm  Today was fun, after tanning and taking the ACT test, I hung out with my girls, Em and Danielle. It actually felt normal, for once I could just take my mind off everything and have fun. I bought a really cute outfit and then after the mall we went to Em's to watch movies. Thirteen was ok, but we should of watched Eurotrip first, funnier and more naked guys! yeah! =p Wow, I'm hyped up...and there's no one here to talk to :( Oh wells.   It's not me you're dying for Now she's feeling more alone Than she ever has before
