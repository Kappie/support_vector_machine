I ate enough to feed all the hunger in the world.  It was very good, ribs, crepe, ice cream.  Moderation was key as usual.  We then went to see Shrek I never though I would like it as much; it was a very sweet movie.  One of those movies that makes you come out wanting  to hug your neighbor and smile like a fool, that is until you realize your neighbor is insane and likes to smoke too much pot while having wild parties and shouting that he is going to kill you when you complain about it, good times.    On the disturbing news front,  urlLink a men  committed suicide after having sex with a hen.  Perhaps the hen told him that she was seen somebody else.  The villagers afterwards killed the hen.  Maybe they wanted to save her from the mental turmoil or maybe they were simply hungry.  We have the fake news in the form of journals like The Onion and yet amazingly enough real news can be just as bizarre.   I am trying to steer away from TV which I usually don’t usually watch but the power is too great.  I love watching the cold case files, and seeing how they catch somebody after many years.  I think that is quite a morbid taste but I can’t stop watching.  I wonder what that says about me.  I was reading the other day that  urlLink 1 in 75 American men are in jail , what depressing bit of news.  A country where crime is lower and lower every year but where more young men end up wasting their lives in prison.  Sadly it is probably the fault of society, we are so obsessed with entrainment and only the most chocking will do.  Whenever there is a murder in as city as safe as mine it plays in the news weeks and weeks on end.  People start to believe that our cities are unsafe that we need to be tougher on crime that smoking a joint deserves years and years in jail.  I am probably part of the problem with me liking shows like the cold files.
