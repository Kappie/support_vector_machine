I'm curious and excited to begin writing more of my thoughts down. it feels thrilling and dangerous, to open up my mind and my words and expose thembluntly for all to read. however it will be benefiting.    i'm patiently waiting for stef, pretending there is still a chance he might show up, come online rather. we were suppose to meet at 2am but there's been no word and it's almost 4am. i feel like giving up, because its the obvious thing to do. but i've started this journal now, why not write it.    ahhh stef. i can't help but laugh at my own antics when i find a new crush. its been a while since i last had a crush on someone...i just haven't met anyone i can be around in a relationship type of way. maybe i'm too picky or perhaps too fickle? i've felt very free and independent lately, and i must admitt i quite enjoy it. I love being on my own schedule with lots of random fun with different people all the time. i feel like a true air sign - a free individual flying the sky.    but it feels good to have met someone i feel very interested in. and especially fidning out from jamie that i "sparked his interest". it made my heart jump, as i had been thinking about himall saturday, trying to figure out how to see him again. my first impressions seem to feel he's a sweetie pie with a heart. but still a stable individual with substance and being. i can't wait to talk to him about politics and conversations that get me excited.    it's 4am, he's definitely not coming on. i probably tired him out from lastnights' game of questions that lasted til 5am.    I love his subtle, but very impacting ways of flirting. I've never met someone who is so careful and precise with their courting. i enjoy the anticipation of feeling vibes from someone as they begin to put more moves on you. midnight madness morning (haha) being the perfect example as stef offered me smokes and sips of wine. it started off slow and friendly (like when he came to sit near me at the fire)...That's where i think his flirtation began. he says it was when he found out i was of legal age, around the time we had a smoke or something, but that was so much earlier in the morning (technically). so after we retreated to she's bedroom (conrad, she, juan, danielle, stef, and i), i developed a seat on the floor (eventually beside stef) with the three on the bed and danielle perching over us like a stubborn bitch. i wish she would have just gone to bed. it would had made this so more relaxing and comfortable for me. but it was obvious to her that stef and i were sending out vibrations. ;)    whatever...its over now, i've ranted enough of the danielle torment.    its time to gets back to the amazing feeling i have for stef right now. i feel so good, happy, excited, raw, hyperactive, alive, full of expression.    oh and despite the mother problem...which i don't even feel lik getting into right now. That's a deep, black wound no one wants to start in on. it will just consume you whole until your existence is bare and naked. like its been combed too many times. and massive, red welts will form on your skin until you become paralyzed and throw yourself onto a sheet of blazing hot razor blades.    anyways...    i better go off to bed so i'm well rested to face to fiery dragon slaying festival tomorrow.    I hope stef comes home on wednesday, that would be a pleasant surprise.         i will write again.
