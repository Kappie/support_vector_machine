I remember I sort-of 'pang-seh' my 2 other frds juz to work wif him alone. Heyhey, it's b'coz he knew no one there mah. He's partnerless, so I cant leave him alone. He's very serious working. Haha..our job is to ask people to fill in their particulars for lucky draws organised by LGM (a local company). He said to each go a direction and ask..den it's more efficient. When I hear him say tis, I'm like "Wow! So 'jing ye' (professional)"  That day was a very memorable and lovely memory for me. It's so beautiful and I still can remember clearly dat day...Coz we went to take a break, den he go buy the 'bing tang hu lu' (candies dat look like cherries n red in colour. It's the sweets from olden days). So I followed him. He bought 2 sticks. One for him and one for me. So sweet!!! Haha..I didnt even say I wan lor. I was quite embarrassed oso la. Coz I dun reali like the candies...cant remember y I dun like oso. Haha! When he ordered 2, I told him I dun wan. But he insisted on buying one for me. It's reali sweet of him. I'll explain later y. After he ate his share of candies, he ask me for tissue. (Coz the candies were abit sticky) Den he ask me wipe his mouth for him. Gosh! My 1st reaction was, 'Er...tis kind of mushy thing u ask a friend to do??' It's not like BOTH his hands were unavailable or wat. I was quite shocked when he ask me to help him wipe his mouth. Haha..like I said b4, u can always expect the unexpected from him. LOL! Of coz I didnt do dat la. So malu! In public..somemore we only friends nia~ I juz passed the tissue to him and said coolly, "Wipe urself la. U dun haf hands meh?" LOL!!!  We went to a near by shopping centre to eat. Cant remember the name le..coz both of our finances werent dat gd at dat time, we opt for food court's food. I mentioned earlier about him being very sweet rite? It's b'coz if he didnt buy the candy for me, he would haf enough money to eat. Den I lent him money to buy dinner. Hee..coz he didnt haf money left, and I brought my water bottle along, he asked me if he could drink my water. I was quite reluctant initially. Coz I dun haf the habit of sharing water wif ppl. Haha! But both of us no money to buy water for him, den I let him drink lor. After the 1st mouthful, he commented dat my water haf MY TASTE. I'm like, 'hey pal I let u drink my water u still "sian"??' Hahahahaha..reali mah. I tried to snatch my bottle away but he dun allow. Damn funny guy!  Later both of us went to Mac Donald to eat the 50cts ice-cream. (Or izzit 25cts?? Cant rem le..) Den we started toking abt alot of things. He suddenly feel like singing..den he sang lor. Hey his singing not bad! He was quite tired and slept there. Den I wrote a note to him coz I wanna go toilet. In the note I wrote sth like tis, "I go toilet for awhile. No need to come find me. U continue sleeping..I'll be back!" haha..abit siao ar me! Yea lor.  His dad's b'day coming up. So he was thinking of buying shirt for his Dad. We pass by Giordano (if I rem correctly) and saw the shirts got discount. We dun haf enough money mah. So I suggested borrowing from Xueting (who was working dat day too. But she was wif her own frds). Xueting quite close to me..she oso very nice. Of coz she lent me..or rather HIM. Hee! Den he went to try it on. (He  his Dad almost same size) Now dat I mention abt his Dad, I must say dat he reali dotes his Dad. Admire!!
