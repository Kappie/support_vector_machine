NOBODY Angela | 03.14.04 - 6:52 pm | #  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------    oh man. so last entry all of that shit was said, and i read it earlier, and at first it actually got to me, why? cause I'm critical of myself, and hate being hated. but i thought about it....and this was just fucking hilarious. ok  a.) I know I'm not the prettiest person out there, but I know I'm not ugly. so um...fuck off? b.) I think that my poetry sucks too, so what was your point? c.) the "ur a dork" part, was hm....incredibly original. oh! as was the "ugly stick beating" d.) that last one was just stupid to type. no one sucks at life that bad to go die. Idiot.  and seriously, who is such a bitch to tell someone to die.  it is a bit inconsiderate.   for future reference, i know that i am loved, so you saying anything...really wont get to me.
