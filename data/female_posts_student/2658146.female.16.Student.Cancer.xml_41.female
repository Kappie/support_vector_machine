It's just not who I am. Yeah, I'm a cold and heartless bitch. So fuck off already. He really confuses me sometimes. I don't get it. I've given up on him. And, like Ryan, I'm still attracted to him. I've just realized that no way in hell will I ever get to be close to him. It makes me sad. I wish I could get into his head and just find out already. Goddamn me and my morals and personal codes!  Apparently my blog is PG. I gotta work on that. Post some nude or violent pictures or something. Yeah, you'd like that you sick pervert.  Supposed to get a new wardrobe today. Yeah, we'll see how THAT goes. Pa doesn't want me to wear jeans ripped in the knees. Because, y'know, those are my two most comfortable pairs of pants. Damn it all!  Layout change. The other layout was too yuppy.  Doctor's appointment Friday. For checking out my back problems. My back makes me feel old. I'm not supposed to have back problems when I'm sixteen. It's just not right.  People make me sick. Don't ask me why. I don't feel like explaining right now.   Current Mood:  Blank
