Five shall be the number thou shall read, and the number of reading shall be five. Six thou shall not read, nor shalt thou read four, excepting that thou then proceed to five. Six is right out. Once the number five, being the fifth number, be reached, thou shalt clickest thy Holy Button of Commenting with thy mouse, and typist thou a comment.  That was lame.  The List:  1) Ashley stayed over last night. I haven't had anybody over at my house since Phoebe in eighth grade. I just don't do it. We had fun, but I kept excluding her to check my email...nobody came to get us today, so we called Treola and her mom came for us. We squished in the truck, it wasn't terrible. But since four people needed a shower this morning, I only had time for a quick rinse. And I went with her to church last night. I've decided that a lot of Christianity is Pagan. Or the other way around, but we stand in circles to pray and we sing and stuff. Same with band, but I'll discuss that later. Anyway, when we were supposed to be silently praying with our pray partners, I pretended I was a tree and had roots and the prayers we were sending were the leaves, growing with good energy then falling and flying into the wind to the person who needed them. I'm a little heathenchild. But a bunch of people from band go. Anyway...there's another part to this story that I shall discuss later.  2) Guard camp is le suck. I only had to march for two and a half hours because of orientation, but I'm still tired. It's getting fun, though. My tan lines are evening out because of the car wash, but now I have bikini lines AND a neckline. Which means I have to find somewhere for topless sunbathing within the next week. I know tanning is bad, but if I'm going to be involuntarily dark, it's going to look right. I refuse to throw out EVERY SINGLE shirt I wear because of tanlines.  Anyway, band is very Paganish (I know I'm throwing the word around incorrectly. Shut up). I mean, think about it. We stand in circles and play music and march, which is basically dancing, and we chant. We're raising energy. We have a circle ritual that we do EVERY TIME we do a circle drill. Band is also like a cult...you don't let anybody leave without a grudge, and people are always recruiting, and yeah.  3) The Guard had a car wash today. In front of the West Fork branch of the Bank of Fayetteville. We didn't think we'd get any customers because we were having it IN West Fork, but we made WAY over 200 dollars. We can buy tops for everyone, and get half a pole apiece, and the school pays for the rest. All WE have to pay for is our pants and rifles. And we're having another car wash after school starts, we're putting signs up around the school. That's how I got my bikini line, I wore a bikini top and short shorts. Which brings me to a tangent.  Joseph Keck was my cynic buddy in English. He was the first person to accept me here and we would sit around and make fun of everybody for being stupid. When we read Julius Caesar in class, we always got the main roles and made fun of everyone for reading monotonously...Joseph got accepted into the Maths and Sciences School in Siloam, so we never get to talk. I HAVE his email, but I forgot it. Some old game with a V that's a double entendre...I'll have to google it, I guess. Anyway, I MISS Joseph. I'm pretty sure he thought I was stupid and spastic towards the end of the year, when I went psycho for a couple weeks, but I still want to talk to him. Anyway. I was standing in the parking lot of the bank dripping wet in my bikini, spinning my flag. And he drives up. To get his car washed. I didn't say anything to him, I didn't get contact information, I feel SO STUPID. I'm honestly a huge idiot. His dad is running for state rep, so Joseph gave us little propaganda cards to hand out to customers. The only thing I said to him was "Nice propaganda, Joseph." :-( I'm still kinda upset.  My sunburn hurts like a bitch.  Missy, Peggy, and Amanda Grace went for lunch at the mall. They come back two hours later. TWO HOURS. There were only four people washing cars for about an hour. And at LEAST one person had to hold the sign the whole time. Oh, and when we were leaving, Peggy and Missy volunteered to stay behind and clean up the parking lot themselves. They should have gotten there MAYBE fifteen minutes late, and even that is giving them the benefit of the doubt. Instead, they skip practice.  Maybe Joseph will come to a football game.  4) There's a mission trip Saturday with Ashley's church to help a children's shelter, dishes, yardwork, painting, stuff like that. I wouldn't go if they were spreading godly propaganda, but I'm fine going because this is great charity work. A bunch of girls from band go to church as well, some people I really enjoy. I'm not going to be a churchie, I'm a heathen and as such, I need time to worship my computer. If I started church, I'd be forced to work Saturdays and Thursdays, and I already don't have enough time off.  Anyway, here's my schedule for the next few days:  Tomorrow: Laundry Nail polish Pack Practice Guard at threeish? Home with Ashley Mission sleepover  Saturday: Up around 4 Leave at 5:30 Little Rock to help Home around nine thirty  Sunday: Work! (I have no choice, I NEED the money.)  5) I got out of an hour and a half of marching practice and sectionals because there was junior orientation. You couldn't get your schedule or anything without your parents there. I didn't know that. They never said anything. I call my mom, she refuses to come until she's eaten dinner. She shows up, barely late, I get my schedule which is exactly the same as it was when I planned it in May. I see Joe Doke, Monica's brother. They're in the same grade...I have a serious agenda relating to the secret I may or may not have mentioned. The secret I want to keep for a bit. Hm.  Anyway, I saw a bunch of people I don't really like, Treola and I are the juniors in Guard, and we were sitting one table apart, and we kept looking at each other when he mentioned the dress code because Treola ALMOST showed up in a halter top. It was all she had, but Stephanie loaned her a t-shirt.  I love being in Guard, because now it doesn't matter what happens, who doesn't like me, I have people who are forced to be around me, and that makes me feel welcomed, superficially at least. But after this week, I think the Guard is actually FRIENDS. I like these people, and I'll hopefully get to know them better. I want to. It's going to be great catty fun. Apparently Stephanie told Treola that Amanda's fat...Amanda is NOT fat, Amanda's GORGEOUS. And really, really sweet.  Yeah, the principal is delusional. He's proud because 44 percent of the juniors last year are proficient at reading. He's like, deliriously proud. And that's weird. Why? Because the numbers in TEXAS were like 83 percent last year, and I was in a fairly low school...  I'll pick this up tomorrow, because I promised five and yea verily I have finished.
