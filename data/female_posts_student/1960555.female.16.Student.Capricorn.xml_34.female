Another friend is having problems, and once agian, I've been rendered useless. 3.  I'm very confused by the fore mentioned guy. (very confused) 4.  It's a whole nother guy I'm dealing with. 5.  I hate science class.  I'm overly confused by oh, ALL OF IT!!!  1.  Can't help. 2.  Can't help. 3.  To scared to do anything about it. 4.  Not sure I wanna do anything about it. 5.  Gunna fail my test tomorrow. :p  Life is blah.  No one is good right now.  It seems like everyone is confused or frustrated about something.   I'm... upset...
