I juz sat there  talked to a new friend, Adeline. She's from my next door class. Of course, nothing can stop my hands from sms-ing. Rosa  Poh Ling's posted there too!! Saw them.. was kinda excited..at last! Someone I know! Today I wore my CHIJ uniform. Hmm~ guess tomorrow I'm gonna wear my band muffti. The campusuniform won't be on sale 'til this wednesday. PENGZ.. anyways I'm like... unsure whether to stay on since my appeal is still under pending. I'm feelin' kinda confused now! HOW!!! STAY ON OR NOT!!! Never mind I shall make up my mind slowly. Go through this orientation first!
