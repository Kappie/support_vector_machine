A mood where beauty is throughout my little world, in the darkness of every corner, everywhere a spider creates it's home, wonder so overwhelming tears could rise. I know better, not to show a weakness amongst this world, with it's judging ways, and it's fingers pointing directly at me. Eventually their eyes will wonder and their laughing will become no more than a horse grumble, this is the time where i will be safe in my own skin, when they choose another to judge so harshly for every mistake like they did to me. Then bliss will come, when my soul becomes so light that it chooses to drift among to clouds but it is not my place and i will soon be dragged down again where all the eyes watch me anew and the laughing is stronger than ever.
