It was made up at a time when I was bored, cold and sick of Michigan. My guess is that a higher power read the dismal crack at being artsy, because he/she/it smiled down on me and said:  "Lets bless that little town where Katherine lives with one...maybe two days....of real, glorious, uplifting sunshine....so she'll stop writing crappy poems...."  I and so it shall be.  And for however long this lasts, I will be in a much better mood.   To quote Jason (THE MAN) Mraz:  "Good day sunshine, I'd like to say how truly bright you are...you don't know me, but I know you, see you're my favorite star..."  I mean... I friggin played GOLF yesterday! I had ICE CREAM!   If that doesn't count as jubliant, unabashed joy......  What does???  Song of the day: "Who Needs Shelter?"- Jason Mraz
