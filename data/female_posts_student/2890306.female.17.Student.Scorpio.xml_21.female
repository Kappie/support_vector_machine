Yesterday, I decided to dress up for school.  You know those spur of the moment thoughts in the morning that just scream, "You want to look nice today, don't you?"  Well, I had one of them, so I went with it.  Of course, this one day I decided to don a knee-length skirt and tiny dress shoes is the one day it decided to snow.  "Oh great."  Nevertheless, I stepped out in my springy ensemb, my mood lifted by my fanciness.  It was so much fun, having everyone ask why I was dressed up and compliment me.  Who wouldn't have a good day with all that attention?  I really do have the best friends around.  They're so observant.  Tee hee.  After school, I learned that Chase was organizing a bunch of us to go to the highly-anticipated movie,  The Passion of the Christ .  Everyone was affected by that show, all of us in different ways.  It had a powerful message that backed up its equally powerful visuals.  I hope everyone has a chance to see it.  Regardless of your background, you should.  Next, Cindel and I went to dinner at Coyote Canyon.  MMMMM!  I love that place!  We ate our fill and then went to visit Jacob at HyVee.  He was very happy to see us, as was I him!  He is one of my very good friends (Hi Jacob!!)  Consquently, I took Cinnie home, and then it was off to Chase's house.  There, we watched a little bit of the movie  Johnny English  while hanging out and talking.  I always enjoy times like those.  When it got to be about 10:30 P.M., I took Geoffrey home and said goodbye to him, for he will be in Minnesota this weekend with handbell choir.  I hope he can have a good time without me, though I highly doubt it is possible.  I mean, who  can ?  *wink*  Coming to today, I worked from 7:30 to 2 P.M. and am currently enjoying a very much appreciated period of rest.  It will end at about 8:30 when I get to go babysit a little 2-year-old girl whose parents are attending a Bat Mitzvah.  *hums the song "Hava Nagila" quietly*  Until we meet again...
