What may be the best thing for you to do Sometimes it the hardest thing for you to do And thats real Cause I know that I love youI know how I feel about you But I also know that don't make everything alright And for that reason I gotta say goodbye Tell me have you ever been in a  Situation where the best thing you could do  Is the hardest thing you've ever done  But you try to do whats right And I know that deep down inside That I really wanna be there by your side But I can't stand to see you cry Not when its because of me  And its over,  I'll never love another I'm always thinking of him,  I'm doing this because of him Don't wanna say goodbye I don't wanna let him see me cry Looking out the window and wondering why Did we have to say all those things that we said last night  Baby I don't wanna say goodbye So I'm just standing here wondering why Just don't like to see when you cry So I'ma say goodbye If you think I cause I packed your stuff That inside I ain't really really cracking up Cause you're wrong I just hide it good Cause I know thats what you need And there's more to life than loving yourself You gotta learn to love somebody else And thats why I do the things that I do  And its over,  I'll never love another I'm always thinking of him, I'm doing this because of him Don't wanna say goodbye I don't wanna let him see me cry Looking out the window and wondering why Did we have to say all those things that we said last night Baby I don't wanna say goodbye So I'm standing here wondering why Just don't wanna see when you cry So I'ma say goodbye  There's no one in this world that can ever take your place All the love that we share, it can never be erased And I know that, that it hurts so bad And its so that, that you're the best I've had There's no one in this world that can ever take your place All the love that we share, it can never be erased And I know that, that it hurts so bad And its so that, that you're the best I've had There's no one in this world that can ever take your place All the love that we share, it can never be erased And I know that, that it hurts so bad And it's so that, that you're the best I've had There's no one in this world that can ever take your place All the love that we share, it can never be erased  And I know that, that it hurts so bad And it's so that, that you're the best I've had
