I cut my thumb and it hurts. oh well. I slept until 9 this morning. I think thats gotta be the longest I have slept in in about a year or so. probably longer. >. REALLY  like HIM. I'm going to marry Ville when I grow up, even though most of the time her looks like a woman...when he doesnt look like a crazy whack head. >. .> lol when I previewed this it looks really small. but when I look at it here, there is alot of typing. lol. I am odd. and you know what? I liketh it VERY much. I wish I could speaketh french more better. >.
