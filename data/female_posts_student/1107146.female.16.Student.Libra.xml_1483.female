That's almost as hard to explain as the time a bunch of five year olds in a Christian group noticed my painted toenails while swimming and were convinced that I was the devil and would put a hex on them. Consequently, I abused my power greatly but it was a barrel of monkies.  I enjoy painted nails, I just wish my sis hadn't stolen my pretty black...  And here I am, a guy that could be vaguely homosexual having feminine product battles with his sister. This is the part where I shut up and let everyone make fun of me for being dumb and saying too much :)       ©Bonus©
