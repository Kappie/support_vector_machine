(ok, except the chem and math part. and the 'ruining my social life' part too.) people were friendly and they were easy to get along with naman. found myself several new friends already and they're great. in fact, i can't wait until saturday! fortunately, i survived my economics chapter test. it was actually pretty easy. tomorrow's my physics chapter test. i'm not sure if i can survive that! feeling bubbly now.. got my friendster account back!!! although i kinda hate the 'salarin' (can't think of any word) for meddling with my accoount, at least he gave it back to me na. but i do hate him for erasing all my messages... especially marc abaya's message. arggh.
