My little siblings were pissing me off and stressing me out when my dad came in from outside. He asked what we were doing. "Catering to their needs!" Was my reply, and it had quite a bit of anger in it. I love my dad so much, because he said "no, that's not right. boys, upstairs now! Leave andie and tyler alone." So they left , but don't worry, we weren't alone. My little sister, chelsea, age 12, was still there. Oh well. We watched the movie together and that is all that counts. Then we had to go upstairs for prayers so that the little kids could go to bed. Earlier that evening tyler had given me a present, but I refused to open it in my angry state. The little kids, however, would not go to bed until they saw what it was, so I had to open it. When I did I was completely speechless. It was a porcelain Tinkerbell with 24 carat gold inlay. It is of Lenox make, so it is extremely beautiful, fragile, and expensive i'm sure. He got it for me when he went to canada last weekend. This is the link to a picture of it...I hope.  urlLink http://www.lenox.com/images/pg/product_images/087992_w3.jpg  Links and pics don't usually work for me, which is sad. Anyways, tinkerbell is currently in her box hidden in my room, away from the kids, until i can get a shelf made to put her on. After the movies we went outside, looked at the stars, and just sat there. Eventually he left. I didn't want him to go because I knew that it would mean that the day was over, and we would be one day closer to his departure. Needless to say I cried myself to sleep last night.
