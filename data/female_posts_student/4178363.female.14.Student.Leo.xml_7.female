I was performing on stage for with my fellow Chinese Orchestra peeps... and something terrible happened (see la, go and make me do detention on a day with such an important practice!!! Haiyo... Wrong timing leh, 'cher)!! I forgot I was supposed to come in after 4 beats (or was it eight? see, s2pid 'cher, make me serve detetion on such a crucial day!), but I go and come in so much earlier... So damn paiseh! Sheesh, crap lar...      Anyway, the better parts came after CO was over *whew*. Me and my Didi had plans to go to Bishan to buy a present for my birthday. I came out of the school building and hopped on a bus (after waiting for such a long time) to Bedok MRT. Ever so strangely, the escalator going up to the platform had broken down (*sobs* too bad) and so I took the long way up and boarded a cabin that I usually don't choose due to laziness issues~. I boarded a train and that's when it started. My Didi SMSed me saying that he was on a train from Buona Vista coming down to City Hall, and I was at Aljunied then.   Just about the same number of stops until City Hall... When I got out of the train to change over to City Hall, the North South line (I think that's what it's called anyway... The red line on the MRT? Which goes Dhoby Ghaut, Summerset, Orchard, Newton, Novena, Toa Payoh, Braddel and finally Bishan, where we had originally planned to meet...) train had just arrived and the doors were open. I rushed over to the train and found one of the cabins less full compared to the others. Running in, I managed to take the earlier train *Yay!*. Little did I know that my Didi was in the same cabin as me... When he said that he assumed that I had missed this train, I told him that I had managed to board it, but didn't know where I was. I could've seen him, really, I could. But apparently my eyesight isn't the best in the world, somehow I didn't notice him sitting down diagonally "quite-beside" me (whattheheck)! Well, that's just about it on the whole coincidental thing... as I was about to alight the train at Bishan, I saw him standing up, but I couldn't call him coz even if I did, he probably couldn't come over to where I was coz there were, like, so many people... I decided to see if he would run to play catch up with me~ [Don't get angry, k, di?] So I just walked towards the escalator and up I went~ Of course, yeah, he did catch up~!     Didi bought me a set of nice earrings~ I love 'em, too bad I can't take out the earrings I used to pierce through my ears... not 'til next Wednesday anyway... so sad! Otherwise I'd wear it now... Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my didi *Er Hem!* Thanks~!!!       ©2004 LeoVYN. All rights reserved
