My intention is for us to be able to keep it as a class journal much in the way we would do if we were keeping a written, bound journal. The way I understand it (yes, I'm still trying things out here), is that after I put your email in you have to "join." You should have received an email "invitation." Then, you are able to post to this blog.  I'd like to start out by setting up a first prompt for you to respond to: how do you perceive class going so far? I'm interested, particularly, in knowing how you are responding to some of the "freedoms" that writing workshop allows like being able to define your own writing tasks--things that you want/need to write about, etc. How do you feel about being given writing time in class rather than it all being given as homework? What would you like to see as a feature of your class??  The other thing I'd like some feedback on (and I'm going to be asking you in class about this, too) is what you might want our webzine (and print magazine) to look like. What should its title be? We have to start thinking about how we will invite other writers to join our little party, so it's going to be important to make some of these decisions soon.  I can't tell you how long I've waited to teach a creative writing class. I am really enjoying what you've done so far. You just have to promise to push me as hard as I push you (well, maybe not that hard :)  Post your thoughts! I think I'll stumble over to the blog for portfolio_princess and journal my thoughts for the day. . . Let me know if you set up an online blog for yourself (or if you already have one you want to keep working in). I'll have to make note of the URL. Ms. H
