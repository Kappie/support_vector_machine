If u look bak on it there has been a lot of good times and some bad.. yet in the end I've realized that I've had worst. U know I came to mac to get away fom all those bitches that roamed crestwood, well they werent exactly bitches btu i just didn't like em, so @ mac it was so much more free. and i came with seema and kristen who happen to be my best friends so i wasn't alone at all tho i didnt have classes with em. I did meet lotsa cool new ppl for example breanne n aaron who happen to continue to read my blogs or so i think..( oh well u guys are damn cool!!!!). Well in the beginning of the year i had religion which happened to be my favorite class. I actually looked forward to that class each day. We had so much fun with our dandy little plays and of course thats where i met creampuff. Everythin else was quite borign class wise until i came to love the class math and science.. for .. certain reasons. overall putting together the hyperness, some luscious boys i seem to have it really bad for, dancing to Candie in bio, crazy jokes that make no sense, and air humping.. it was a pretty good year over all. thanks to all my friends that make mac standable.
