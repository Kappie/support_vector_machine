They just stood around for about 15 min, waiting for who knows what. Finally, they decide to order something, and one comes up to me. He goes, "You look really familiar, no seriously, do I know you?"    Now here I am thinking, what a cheesy pick up line, but why the hell would a guy like him be trying to pick me up. So I go along thinking that he's serious. After all, when he did come in, he looked like this guy that went to Appleton West last year: Drew Peterson or something like that. But anyways, he said that he had just moved here, and didn't know anyone. Then he asks me when DC closed. I'm like, "10:30." And he asks me if I'm closing tonight. I say yes, and he goes, "Well, I guess that I'll be back at 10:30 then."    I said whatever, not really thinking that he'd come back, and imagine my supprise when at 10:29, here comes this guy through the door. He said that he thought I droped something, and hands me a napkin. I'm like, ok, and he leaves. I'm about to throw it away, when I see that their's something written on it. I unfold it, and there's a cellphone #. So all night I'm contemplating whether or not to call. Eventually, curiosity gets the best of me when I get home, and I call. I hear a recording. I was devastated. He didn't give me his phone number, he gave me a rejection hotline number.    I felt so stupid. Like a complete idiot. How could I have possible thought that a cute guy like him would have ever gone for someone like me? I wanted to cry, but then I realized that if someone like him was mean enough to do something like what he did to someone, then they aren't worth one second of my time, or one ounce of my tears. Besides, I cried enough today.    I pierced my eyebrow today! It hurt like hell! And when I called Tracey at work today, she said that she didn't really want anyone to have any sort of facial jewelry besides the basic ear stuff. So I had to go out and get a clear spacer to put in for work so that no one could tell. But when I got home tonight, after I got over that whole phone # incident, I put my curved titanium black barbell in. It took some shoving, some whimpering, some tears, and a few disgusting pops of breaking skin, but eventually I got it in. It has gems on each side, and let me tell you, it's hot! I love it. And what's better, today, I took my mom's credit card, and bought $60.00 worth of piercing stuff online. Now I'll have it all: the hollow needles, the clamp, the tongue ring, and the nose ring. Everything I need to be a full out punk rocker!    Or something like that. Well, I guess I'm gonna go mope around tonight, cause their's nothing to do. I'd go kickbox my punching bag, but that's hitting a little to close to home at the moment. Or should I say, a little to close to the mouth...    Well, as always, until next time,    ~Ani
