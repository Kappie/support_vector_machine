I was really good at the whole drunk goggles thing. It's crazee because I can walk a straight line with the goggles on but I can't without them on. After is was over Carol and I walked around the mall for a bit. I realized I have a thing for guys with lip peircings. I don't know why, I just find it extremely hot. I think it's the rebellious side in me. I feel as if my mom trusts me way to much (not that it's a bad thing). If she knew some things about me she wouldn't let me go anywhere for a looong time.  Thursday- I had to babysit Paige. Then we went up to camp and went tubing. It was wicked fun but the water was so cold. Then Makenzie, Paige, Kelsey, and I took the Sea Sprite out on the lake. We were about half way back to camp when we ran out of gas. I was about 2 minutes away from trying to swim to shore and get someone to help when this nice old guy gave us a tow back with his jet ski. I felt so bad because he was burning all his gas just to take us back to camp. Then I ate dinner there and drove Paige home and them came home. Then Gavin called and asked me to go see Spiderman 2 with him. So I got ready real quick and got lectured by my mom on how it was storming and we were going to be struck by lightening. Then Gavin came and we went to the movie. It was pretty good. Then I came home around 12:30 (?) and went right to bed.  Today- I didn't even wake up until 12:30. Then I called Carol and talked to her for a while because she's leaving for Brantingham tomorrow for 2 weeks. I'm going to be so bored for those 2 weeks. And now I'm just online listening to Allister. [Edit: 4:30- I just got my field hockey stuff in the mail. I can't wait for it to start. I'm playing summer league. The first game is the 6th at 5:30 against Sauquiot. Come watch if you want.]  Later I'm not doing anything I think. Tomorrow Emily says we are going up to camp for a 4th of July party because it's supposed to rain on Sunday. So I guess I'll be there all day but I'm not sure yet.  Listening to: [It's Just Me by Allister]  outside I stand sorta cold I used to know how to get warm sometimes you still let me in but I'm not so welcome anymore  why don't you recognize me is it hard to see how much I've changed it's been a while since you despised me but take a look and you'll find out it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight the one who lied messed up that night it's just me  outside I stand all alone and you come and stand next to me maybe now you'll let me in because I'm not so messed up anymore  why don't you recognize me is it hard to see how much I've changed it's been a while since you despised me but take a look and you'll find out it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight the one who lied messed up that night it's just me  it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight it's just me it's just me the one who loved you held you tight the one who lied messed up that night it's just me
