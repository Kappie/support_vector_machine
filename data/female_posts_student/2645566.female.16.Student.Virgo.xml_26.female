"Oh gawd" (as Russell would say) it was so much fun!! Apparently I am "married" to Jesse because we have a love-hate relationship. We even had a divorce while we were there (thanks to good ol' Vern) and got back together...stupid Jess-dash-e claiming he got the car...Anyway it was good stuff. Lindsey Jo was awesome. So was "I AM BETTY CROCKER BITCH" and "I CAN'T READ!"...let's not forget "COMPTON!! WHAT?!? COMPTON! WHAT?!?" and Russell's butt dance. Yeah, this stuff is going to take a lot of explainin'...and it sucks that I have picked up on the whole country accent thing...oh well...It was good stuff Man...Good Stuff.
