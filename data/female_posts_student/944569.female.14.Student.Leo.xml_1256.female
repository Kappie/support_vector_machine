It was a good movie..but still...its so friggen long!At least its the last one so next year it wont be nomminated for anything..then other movies will get a chance to win.  But the best part of the Oscars were Will Ferrel and Jack Black singing the "lyrics" to that song when they cut you off.    "Look at Catherine Zeta-Jones, she's snoring" haha
