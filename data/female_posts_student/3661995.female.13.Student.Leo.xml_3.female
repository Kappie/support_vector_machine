Honestly, why do they keep changing the stupid timetable?! It's not only annoying, also very iriitating!     My mother and I are the only ones home for this week. My elderst brother is in Bangkok, Thailand to perform. Lucky him!!! My second brother is away in the army. Yay! The computer's all my now!!! Well, at least for a week...    I have recently downloaded some new anime. Yay! Now I can watch Inu Yasha and many others in their original voices! I hate dubs, their voices suck! As you can see, I'm a really big anime/manga junkie. I will be really snappish without my daily dose... sounds like addiction... -_-|||     Anyway, school today was VERY BORING! I miss my old history teacher, Ms Fazlin, though I hate her homework. She's really amusing and witty. However, I like my new literature teacher more than the old one. Ms Tang, that's the new one, is pretty interesting, better than the dull Mr Goh... I think his jokes are worth less than 1 cent... no offence, but they're really LAME!    I'm going off now... to surf some sites. I wanna play gaia. The pics are soooo good..^____^ See ya!
