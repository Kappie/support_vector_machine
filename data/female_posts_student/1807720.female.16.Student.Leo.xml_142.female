I actually talked to someone in my Bio class today too which is good consider I was freaked out that NO ONE would talk to me because there are like no grade 11's.  It almost feels like I failed it really, but maybe I will make alot of friends or something, but it's hard cause most of these people already know each other.  I think I did bad on that fist Bio assignment too because she wasn't like really clear about what she wanted so I think I did some stuff wrong.  Even if I do bad on it though, I have to remember that it is only the first assignment and there are MANY others - because I mean I failed the first quiz in Chem but I didn't do totally horrible in that class - I did pretty good for my skills and abilities.  Drama was sooooo fun today.  That is like one of the best classes I have in my schedule.  We did so much and the class felt like it just kept going and going, and we were having so much fun.  Tomorrow we are doing fitness testing in Active Living tomorrow and I just know I am going to have like burn out by the end of it - especially if we have to do the 30 minute run.  But I can handle it - I'm not in that bad of shape.
