It was worse than a bad day. It was a horrifically-bad-messed-up-shitty-asswipe-day. Forgot my damn lunch.. Failed a cooking prac.. My assignment disc fucked up, got into trouble for it being late.. Got a detention FOR A FUCKING IRRELEVANT REASON!, and Mrs Walton waffled on for 2 hours about how laddida-fuckin' great she is. FUCK IT ALL! On a happier note. Went to Clare's house for her birthday. it was greeeaattt being back home.. I was so happy. :) SEE? I CAN BE HAPPY!!! I have graphics tomorrow with Rusty.. Blah blah blah. I wish he'd go away or something or that I didn't like him. It's so STUPID. STUPID STUPID STUPID! FEELINGS ARE STUPID! EMOTIONS ARE STUPID!  Like I said in my last post, I'm not depressed. I'm probably just a raving lunatic struggling for freedom in a community that expects perfection and conforming. HAHAHA. Anyways. Smile if you're not wearing any underwear. Steph.
