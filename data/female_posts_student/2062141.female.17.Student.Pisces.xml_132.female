We're starting to register for senior year classes, I don't have to take business classes (I thought you HAD to, but whatever) because I'm on the "art and music path", so that means I have a whole slot in my senior year free! So I went to see Mr. Grossman (art teacher) and he said I could do an independent art study and just like make up my own class! Yay!!! Then he asked me if I had any ideas for a senior project.. and of course no I don't even know what my Junior project is... and he wants me to paint a mural on the school! (!!) So awesome!!! I can't wait. I'm already thinking of things to do. I'm thinking a monkey, surrounded by dancing pineapples. Yeah... just kidding... damn.   Wow Josh your website should come with age restrictions, NC-17... for... not...c(k)osher....17. It's like reading a porno I never signed up to read. Your website should come in a paper bag......  :p Love ya!  Poo.... it's grey and dreary again. I really do love rain, but I'm ready for the sunshine. At the end of summer, I feel the opposite, where I'm sick of sun and want cozy rainy days, but NOT NOW. It'll be sunny by Friday apparently. :) I plan to have a good weekend.
