I thought it would be awkward, but it was as if nothing had changed at all. He still remembers all the embarassing stuff Kelly and I did so, he has blackmail...     That's the only problem with knowing people for so long. they know you as much as you know yourself. It's kind of nice having people like that. Like Kelly. I love being with Kelly.      When things are looking down and I hang out with her, just...spending time with her makes me happy. It reminds me of being a kid. No worries. None at all. I have so much fun every time and with David...I feel the same. I love the kid more than I love myself...and that's a heck of a lot. :) Heh.      I miss him. It's tough having him all the way in Georgia, but it's ok. After two years, we still see each other when he comes around, which really solidifies my belief that I'll never lose him as a friend. He's a lifelong buddy. He'll be there for the long haul. I can't honestly say that for many of my other friends. I just can't get over how carefree and happy I was just being with him.      Well, enough of that. It was also great seeing Nikki. We don't hang out too much anymore, but it's always fun when we do. We always have a good time no matter what.      Well, I have nothing more to write right now. On the way home with Kelly, the song, "What a Wonderful World," came on the radio and I was quietly singing it to myself thinking...maybe the world's not perfectly wonderful, but the people I spend with in it are.
