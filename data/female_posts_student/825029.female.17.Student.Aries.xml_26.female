Sidenote--Melissa.  thats all i gotta say cause putting in little adjectives would take away from the greatness that is melissa.  And... yep, saw harry potter.. it was ok.  no more no less really.  I just wish harry would grow some balls, be less of a Freddy from scooby doo and more of a Matilda from Matilda...  u know, he took the attitude of "lets go into the spooky place unprepared for anything and pick the least violent way to deal with it all"  when he should have blown stuff up with his magic fireball spells.  o well.  not much else to say other than thatttt.. overall, the weekend certainly was a weekend.  i think ill leave now cause the site has been sitting here for too long and i dont want to try to think to write any more.  thats right.  it is.  right. mhm. yep. k then ok gonna leave k byebye latar.
