Well, I just walked to my uncle's house from the orthodontist. Guess who gets their braces off next month? :)if u said Stephanie..ur riiight! I swear to God a tear fell down my cheek and i just got THE biggest smile on my face when he ever told me. lolol Today we had the English MCAS at school which was incredibly easily. The only thing I'm worried about is Math. I sucked and 1/2 at Math this year. Geometry sucks...bring on the Algebra! lol This week, they put me on the schedule for work on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. And figures, the first Saturday they put me on, I can't work cuz I have the Kiss 108 Concert :). So now i'm panicking to find someone to take my hours...which seems to be impossible. So I think I'm just gonna go sometime today to tell the guy that I can't come in. And thats the end of my story...I'm off to listen to some Maroon 5...gonna see them on Saturday :)
