No, more like all the more reason to do my  own  research instead of letting an email forward dictate who I should vote for. It is sadly not surprising how easy it is to dupe people by skewering the facts to fit your agenda. (And regardless of the business of her late husband, it  is  Mrs. Heinz-Kerry's money to do with it as she pleases.)     Maria Teresa Thiersten Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry was born in Mozambique, the daughter of a Portuguese physician, and was educated in Switzerland and South Africa. Fluent in five languages, she was working as a United Nations interpreter in Geneva in the mid-60's when she met a handsome young American, H. John Heinz, III, who worked at a bank in Geneva. He told her his family was "in the food business." They were married in 1966 and returned to Pittsburgh where his family ran the giant H.J. Heinz food company. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1971, and in 1976 he was elected to the first of three terms in the United States Senate.      Several years later, in 1991, he was killed when his plane collided with a Sun Oil Company helicopter over a Philadelphia suburb the same traveling between Philadelphia and Washington, DC. The senator, his pilot and co-pilot, and both of Sun's helicopter pilots were killed. He was survived by his wife, Teresa, and their three young sons.      Four years later, after inheriting Heinz's $500 million fortune, she married Senator John Forbes Kerry, the liberal junior senator from Massachusetts. She became a registered Democrat and the process of her radicalization was set in motion.      Heinz Kerry is not shy about telling people that she required Kerry to sign a pre-nuptial agreement before they were married. John Kerry may not have check-writing privileges on the Heinz catsup and pickle fortune, but he is certainly a willing and uncomplaining beneficiary of it.A lot of hard-earned money, made through many years of hawking catsup, pickles, and soup, has fallen into the hands of two people who despise successful entrepreneurship and who believe in the confiscatory redistribution of wealth.      Confiscatory redistribution of wealth  is just a nasty way of saying "they don't mind paying taxes."     So how does Mrs. Heinz Kerry spend John Heinz's money? Just one example:      According to the G2 Bulletin, an on-line intelligence newsletter of WorldNetDaily, in the years between 1995-2001 she gave more than $4 million to an organization called the Tides Foundation. And what does the Tides Foundation do with John Heinz's money?     According to the blurb at Snopes (see 'more information' links below), the money she donated was to be used exclusively in Pennsylvania.Allocating her donations elsewhere would be illegal. So perhaps saying that the Tides Foundation used her money to fundsupposedly nefarious projects or implying that Mrs. Heinz Kerry funnelled money to unsavory organizations is a  bit  disingenous.     They support numerous anti-war groups, including Ramsey Clark's International Action Center. Clark has offered to defend Saddam Hussein when he's tried.     We never should've gone to war in the first place so I'm all about backing people who are about  peace.  That's the Christian thing to do, after all, isn't it?    Furthermore,  somebody  has to defend Saddam. But what exactly would he be tried for? Harboring WMDs? To beat a dead horse, where are these weapons? And why should we care since we're the ones whosold him the weapons in the first place? (I refuse to believe Reagan was unaware that Oliver North was selling WMDs in the basement of the White House; but that's another post entirely.) PerhapsSaddam needs defense for the atrocities he committed against his own people (particularly gassing the Kurds inIraq) when he wasruler. But then, maybe we should have had an impartial collective such as the UN  punish him at the time he committed it,  instead ofseveral years later when it was convenient for Dubya.     They support the Democratic Justice Fund, a joint venture of the Tides Foundation and billionaire hate-monger George Soros. The Democratic Justice Fund seeks to ease restrictions on Muslim immigration from "terrorist" states.     Hate-monger? No, he's not a hate-monger. He just feels that "The main enemy of the open society, I believe, is no longer the communist but the capitalist threat." (1)  Communism has becomea red herring and the diversion for big corporations intent on screwing the working classes blind and the environment to extinction. And right now we have a president catering to those businesses without even trying to fake compassion for everyone else.Soros fled the Nazi regime and the communism of Hungary--he's hardly pro-totalitarian regimes. He's just calling society on its economic vices.    Besides, not all Muslims are terrorists. Why should all Muslims get a bum rap and be denied entry into the United States because of a few nutty fundamentalists? It's called discrimination and the more tolerant people in the US realize that and seek to erase unfair restrictions.      They support the Council for American-Islamic Relations, whose leaders are known to have close ties to the terrorist group, Hamas.     Considering the divisive nature of Israeli-Palestinian-US policy, I can imagine that some people in CAIR would support HAMAS. But does the organization itself  support HAMAS? Cite, please.     They support the National Lawyers Guild, organized as a communist front during the Cold War era. One of their attorneys, Lynne Stewart, has been arrested for helping a client, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, communicate with terror cells in Egypt. He is the convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.     Lynne Stewart was only doing her job as a  court-appointed counsel  to Rahman.  (2) What Ashcroft is really trying to do is bully lawyers into not representing any suspected terrorists at all--and then what is to become of the wrongfully accused? Everyone should have confidentiality rights with his/her attorney, but Ashcroft has already denied suspected terrorists of several other rights through the Patriot Act  (5) so it's not surprising thathardly anybodyblinks an eye at the demonization of Lynne Stewart.      They support Planned Parenthood, the National Abortion Rights Action League, and the Abortion Action Project.     I'm pro-choice so this doesn't necessitate a defense to me.     They support the most violent of all homosexual action groups, ACT-UP.     Violent? How so? Is it wrong thatthe Tide organization financially lends itssupport tohomosexuals, then, or justsupposedly violentones? Furthermore, ACT-UP promotes civil disobedience, and takes its cues from  Handbook for Nonviolent Action . That's right:  non violent.  (3)      They support the "Barrio Warriors," a radical Hispanic group whose primary goal is to return all of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas to Mexico.    I did a little research on the Barrio Warriors and the most pressing goal of theirs seems to be to raise social and cultural awareness of Raza and help Raza youth. Nowhere did I read about returning the Southwestern US back to Mexico. (4)       These are but a few of the radical groups that benefit, through the anonymity provided by the Tides Foundation, from the generosity of our would-be first lady - the wealthy widow of Republican senator John Heinz, and now the wife of the Democratic senator who aspires to be the 44th President of the United States.       And these sound like just the sort of liberal organizations a liberal   would   donate her money to.     If voters will only try to imagine a woman such as Teresa Heinz Kerry, the fairy godmother of the radical left, laying her head on a pillow each night just inches from the President of the United States, hopefully they will decide that the only way these two will ever be allowed into the White House is with an engraved invitation in hand.     If voters will only try doing some research on the issues instead of believing whatever any crackpot--from any area of the political spectrum--tells them, they'll be more informed and likely to make an educated vote on election day.      Tell everyone you know about this. NOW.      Yes.   VOTE FOR KERRY IN NOVEMBER!      Sources:    urlLink   (1)   urlLink  George Soros   .  (2)   urlLink  Lynne Stewart   .
