I feel like I can be myself around him which doesn't happen to often. I don't feel comfortable around that many people so I can't act myself and be who I truely am. In fact, he's the only guy I have ever been able to completely act myself around. He makes me so happy. Whenever I'm around him I can't help but smile. I'm so happy that we are still friends after all that's happened. I don't know what I would do with out him as a friend. I hope we can hang out again sometime soon.  So today I talked to Molly about everything for a while and then I got online.  Tomorrow I have to babysit my cousin Paige for a while. And then Saturday morning I have to play with jazz band for graduation.  Listening to: [Vindicated by Dashboard Confessional]  Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of which has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing  I am captivated  [Chorus] I am Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along  And I am flawed  But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intentions Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye And rendered me so isolated, so motivated I am certain now that  [Chorus]  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away [3x] So let me slip against the current  and let me slip away [4x]  [Chorus]  Slight hope It dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...
