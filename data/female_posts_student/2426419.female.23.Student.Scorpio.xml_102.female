Well, sort of. I hate discussions about debating how important baptism is to salvation or whether "faith healers" are unbiblical. Kill me now. I always feel as if people are trying to convince me to believe a certan way. This friend is a very conservative church of christ friend. well, sort of conservative. but our conversation was not about doctrine. It was about silly stuff that was somehow incredibly insightful.  We talked about Bruce Almighty (and I know that you guys are going to talk about this later, or maybe already have, so don't kill me if i mention something about it now). We asked each other what we would do if we had the powers of God for awhile (luckily, no lightening struck us) and this turned into all kinds of questions about why God does things the way he does. I wish that I could type our whole conversation out. I thought that show was okay, but the really interesting thing about it was how Jim Carry asked how he could make that girl love him if he couldn't jazz with free will.  We talked about what we might look like in heaven. And have you ever seen Shallow Hal? How that guy dates someone that everyone else sees as physically unattractive, but he sees her as Gwyeneth Paltrow? I think it would be cool to see people that way, through God's eyes. Do you think that maybe God sees us like that? That he looks at our souls? Or maybe he sees everything - how we are physically, what we have the potential to look like spiritually. And of course it changes everyday. Every flashing millisecond.  And why, if God created us in his image - so maybe he has both feminine and masculine attributes - did he separate us into men and women? Maybe to limit us in some ways?  There's this awesome essay by Plato called Aristophanes' Speech on love that talks about in the beginning, we each had eight limbs, and both types of sexual organs, etc. but we were too powerful so Zeus and the gods sliced us in half like a wire through a boiled egg. Now we scramble (ha ha - get it? scra . . . sorry) around frantically trying to find our other half, struggling together to return to our origin. And love does the best it can to help us back to that on earth. Not that I'm comparing God to Zeus or anything. (I may not even understand what the Tower of Babel story was about completely - if it is comparable to that). I'm really just midnight rambling.
