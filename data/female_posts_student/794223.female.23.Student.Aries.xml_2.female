His name is Trevor, and he works at Dell.  He used to be a computer science major, but after he spent a year in Mexico, he decided that it was better to actually study something that he enjoyed.  So he's switching to Latin American Studies very soon.  Bad-ass.  It was, by far, the coolest thing I'd heard of in a long time.  I've got a Latin American politics midterm on Thursday (with a mountain of reading), and a project in Spanish prose on the same day.  I better get cracking on the books.  (When do I not?)  On a random note, I still love my new Mac :-P
