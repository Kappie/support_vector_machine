Run to the water by Live     Oh desert speak to my heart Oh woman of the earth Maker of children who weap for love Maker of this birth 'til your deepest secrets are known to me  I will not be moved I will not be moved "Don't try to find the answer  When there ain't no question here Brother let your heart be wounded And give no mercy to your fear" Adam and Eve live down the street from me Babylon is every town It's as crazy as it's ever been Love's a stranger all around In a moment we lost our minds here And lay our spirits down Today we lived a thousand years  All we have is now Run to the water And find me there Burnt to the core but not broken We'll cut through the madness Of these streets below the moon These streets below the moon And I will never leave you 'til we can say "this world was just a dream  we where sleeping now we are awake  'til we can say In a moment we lost our minds here And dreamt the world was round A million mile fall from grace Thank God we missed the ground Run to the water And find me there Burnt to the core but not broken We'll cut through the madness Of these streets below the moon With a nuclear fire of love in our hearts Yeah I can see it now Lord Out beyond all the breakin' of waves And the tribulation It's a place and a home of ascended souls Who swam out there in love  Run to the water And find me there Burnt to the core but not broken  We'll cut through the madness Of these streets below the moon  With a nuclear fire of love in our hearts Rest easy baby, rest easy  And recognize it all as light and rainbows Smashed to smithereens and be happy Run to the water and find me there Run to the water     What's Up by 4 Non Blondes                                            25 years and my life is still  Trying to get up that great big hill of hope for a destination. I realized quickly when I knew I should  That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man  For whatever that means  And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed  Just to get it all out what's in my head And I,  I'm feelin' a little peculiar And so I wake in the mornin' and I step outside,  Then I take a deep breath And I get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs: "what's goin' on?"  And I said hey yeah yeah-eh-eh  hey yeah yeah   I said "Hey! What's goin' on?" And I said hey yeah yeah-eh-eh  hey yeah yeah   I said "Hey! What's goin' on?" Woo, woo woo          And I try, oh my God, do I try? I try all the time in this institution. And I pray, oh my God,  do I pray? I pray every single day for a revolution. And so I cry sometimes when I'm lyin' in bed just to get it all out what's in my head. And I,  I am feelin' a little peculiar. And so I wake in the mornin' and I step outside,   Then I take a deep breath And I get real high And I scream from the top of my lungs what's goin' on And I said hey yeah yeah-eh-eh  hey yeah yeah   I said "Hey! What's goin' on?". And I said hey yeah yeah-eh-eh  hey yeah yeah  Woo, woo woo          25 years and my life is still  Trying to get up that great big hill of hope For a destination.
