Check out www.emojoe.com for all the quizzes and other fun stuff. Here are the results!  -How Emo Are You? First of all, I never knew emo was short for "emotional." I always thought emo's were a different form of punk rockers but I was wrong. Turns out I'm 55% Emo!!  -I am 10% Hardcore Emo.  -I'm 5% Punk.  -I'm 5% Hardcore Punk.  -I'm 30% Punk Poser.  -I'm 5% Ska. I have no idea what the fuck ska is! The only reason I got a 5% was because I have long curly hair, is that my problem?!  -I'm 20% Skate Poser! Matt would be proud!  -I'm 65% Prep! YAY FOR PREPS! Sorry, I'm a prep guys...  -I'm 20% Loser! YAY FOR LOSERS! My parents named me Lauren for a reason...L is for Loser!  -I'm 40% Kaitis...whatever that is...  -I'm 10% Freak.  -I'm 20% Smob only because I like shiny objects and listen to MTV and all that.
