"i'm seein little green goblins. is that healthy?" whoa that scared me a little but after a while he jus started crackin me up so bad i didnt care. he was outta it really. but anyways...i dont think i need to say anything about that. he knows who he is..and dont you try flying off 2 story houses either!! ...if he reads this. haha. Well, I'm going to go watch a movie. My bday's 2moro and I better have something to do. If I don't then I'll take u up on that offer Brad..if I can anyways. movie. that's where I was headed. . . . . .I'll write 2moro maybe. :) *Please God, let 2moro be flat out GREAT!!!*
