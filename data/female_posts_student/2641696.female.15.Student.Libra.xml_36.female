I am terribly excited, for no reason except for that which I will neeever eeeever tell! ^_~ don't ya'll hate me?   Oh, and I've decided to challenge myself... I will now use those funky anime smileys from now on. They just seem cooler and more interesting and pretty. ^_^ Yay! Don't you think they're cool? Hmm... for all of you who don't understand those (and if you don't, you're a loser, I'm terribly sorry but anyone who spends any amount of time on the computer should know...)... here is a translation!   BTW, I'm sure there are more, except I don't know em. This is probably just a phase anyways, because it takes too long for me to find the ^ key, but whatevah.   In fact, I'm positive there are more, because I only know three :) err... I mean... ^___^ heh.   ^__^ = smile / equivalent to :p >__ ^__~ = you're not stupid.   Anyways, other than my almost-reasonless excitement, life is just okay. School bugs me. And I think everyone shoulda skipped choir this morning. And I'm tired. But that's ok! Because it's gonna rain today, and I love rain ^__^
