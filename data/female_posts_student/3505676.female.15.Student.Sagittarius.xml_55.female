The ride was hot, but hey at least i got some exercise.  I found this lady's gold mom bracelet for her in the lost and found and she got soo excited on the fone and then when she came to pick it up she brought this HUGE can of salted peanuts and gave them to me! *haha* Which reminded me of eating jana's peanuts in geometry class last year--good times right there! But yeah, so me and pat opened the can w/ a screw driver cuz we dont have a can opener @ work.  *hah* Then everyone ate em [[myself included--i ate WAY too many]] and then they were all gone! But hey..it was a nice thank you even though i didnt exactly do much!  Closed out by myself after saying goodbye to my buddy who was there again for lifeguarding.  Got home around 9.  Bed around 12 after finishing The Rescue by Nicholas Sparks.  Plans for today?  We shall see...
