We didn't meet up till about 9 ish, which is usually really late for me but actually it worked out REALLY well today cause i was out helping my mom gardening and cutting down trees (thats right mother nature! i destroyed a shit load of trees!) and by the time i was done it was like 8:00 which is perfect timing cause i went inside had a superb shower and was on my way to meet Cisco. We went glow in the dark mini golfing (only thing to do in oakville) and then after that we just chilled out in my car, talking and stuff...i know it sounds super boring but i had a lot of fun:) hey come on! he had an accent! i could listen to him talk about shit and i would be happy to hear it all cause of his sexy accent. So we had an excellent night and everything went well. Tee hee he paid for mini golfing and i got spin an wheel and he got a damn free cookie and i got a damn cupon for 15% off golfing. So yeah i had a really good night, nothing went on...my mom never called my cell phone once cause well i earned the night away from yelling or screaming..OMG! MY MOM VACUMED THE HOUSE AND I'M NOT BEING YELLED AT WHEN I GOT HOME! tonight was an awsome night and i haven't had one of those in a while!  Considering i didn't get home till like 12:30am i didn't get yelled at or anything at all...my mom was in a happy mood so thats awsome... Well i'm on the phone with my sexy friend Chris and he needs someone to talk to  so i shall save my sexy man! ta ta people! Good night!
