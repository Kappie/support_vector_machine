When I went to the checkout there was an Enquirer with Rush Limbaugh’s face on the cover and a heading that read something like this. “Rush caught in Drug Scandal!”  My husband and I simply laughed it of, thinking that the enquirer paparazzi had struck again.  Today, while checking my e-mail, I happened by the MSN home page.  On this page was a heading about Rush Limbaugh being addicted to drugs.  The cover of Newsweek magazine with Rush’s face on the cover.  He apparently broke-down and admitted to millions of listeners on Friday that he was addicted to prescription drugs.  It was stunned.  My husband Matt and I listen to Rush’s show, I would call us fans.  I couldn’t believe that a man who’s advice and strait-forward tell em’ like it is radio was popping pills.    You can read more about the story here…  urlLink  “Rush’s world of Pain” at Newsweek on MSN    All I really have to say, or shall I say my only opinion on this matter is that I commend the man for being big enough to come out with it.  Granted he had already been outed, but it says a great deal for the character of the man when he had the courage to tell the truth.  Truth is a seemingly foreign concept to America these days. Ever since Bill Clinton lied on the stand and to a grand jury about his involvement with Monica Lewinski, lying seems to be a HUGE fad! Liberal mouth Al Franken was quick to condemn Rush about his problems.  Can you believe it, a LIBERAL calling Rush a hipocrit!  What a jerk…what a total Jerk!  So to make a long story short, if I could say one thing to Rush, I think I would say; “You go Rush.  At least you had the courage to come out and say you have a problem.”  ~Kristyn
