Anyways...Today has been pretty boring...woke up and went to organ lessons...*yawn* And then I've been sitting around the rest of the time....I made banana bread to prove I can bake something since nobody round here thinks I can. *shrug* So yeah....Im bored since Kims on vacation..pretty sad that shes the only one around that I can do something with. Tracy lives in Sanborn...and since we cant drive...yeah...And I really can't think of anyone else who I could do stuff with so I'll sit here being the loner like I am. So yeah...I really am bored and I have nothing left to ramble about so I'll let you all get back to your lives...Tho Im really startin to think no one reads this anymore...which is fine by me...I guess I'll just keep writing cuz I like to...so yeah...Later.
