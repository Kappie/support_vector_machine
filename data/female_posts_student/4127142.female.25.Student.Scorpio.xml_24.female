And Eileen, I did go to Able Muse and look up your poem you posted but I can't post a comment there because I can't remember my password from when I signed up there months ago (I never went back to the site after signing up). As soon as I get my password from AB, I'll post. I thought the comments there were mostly good and insightful. The site seems excellent, and I'm looking forward to learning a few things there. Great to hear from you, Jennifer. And congrats, Lisa, on your poem!
