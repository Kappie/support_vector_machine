My mommy's coming home today, so I'm slaving over the house trying to get it clean enough before I leave.  Josh, please come to church today.  Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease.  I don't really have a specific reason for you to come.  I just don't know/like anyone there except Gossett.  So if you get a chance, come by.  We'll sneak out and go to Starbucks.  I'll buy you an espresso (expresso, haha).
