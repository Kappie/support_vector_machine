I'm not a nice person, I fake that I like people who I can't stand, I use people and abuse the feelings they have for me, and I don't contribute to the world in any profound way. I'm just a waste of space and air. No one really cares about me. Everyone will say, "I love you," but how many of them actually mean it? I don't think anyone does. I mean, saying it is one thing, but actions speak louder than words. If someone would actually show me that they loved me, then I would believe them, but I have yet to have this happen. I feel like life is a journey and I'm left to wander alone. Occasionally, someone will join me for a few miles, but then they just go off onto another road like all of the others. Then, I'm alone again. I get so lonely sometimes and it makes me depressed and mad. I get mad at myself. I wish that I had someone that I could connect with, even if it's just for a minute, because that's what life is...a series of moments.
