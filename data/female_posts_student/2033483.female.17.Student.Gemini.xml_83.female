The documentary was extremely powerful and moving.  I hated Bush going into this film and hate him even more now that I've seen it.  I cannot put into words how much I don't like him.  I'm proud to say our own Senator makes an appearance in the movie a few times.  This one particular woman was in the film that talked about her son that died in the war and she was crying while reading his last letter home.  I couldn't help but cry with her.  I don't care if your Republican, democrats, or just don't give a rat's ass about politics you truly need to see this film.  It's our world and you need to know what's going on.  Their are a lot of people that don't agree with the film and think it's all a bunch of political propaganda but it is really hard to argue images.  I guess you could twist facts and statements but you cannot argue those images.  They are too powerful.  At the end of the film the entire theater clapped and cheered.  I've never been in a theater that did that before.  That's how big of a statement it made.  After the movie Erica brought me home and I just sat around until about 5:15 then I left for the mall to meet Logan.  Once there we met up with Alisha and Renae.  From there we went to the skate park to see this show.  This show sucked.  I'm not gonna lie, I've been to worse but this one was pretty bad.  The first band was horrible.  The second band was okay, but I was too busy eating my Subway to really pay attention.  By the way, my stomach isn't feeling too well, I blame Subway.  The Spill Canvas was last...of course.  They never disappoint.  Erica had to leave before they started so it sucked that she had to witness the horrible bands.    I'll be honest, I woke up this morning with every intention of not going to this show.  I knew this one person was gonna be there and to be completely honest, I didn't want to see them.  I didn't know how I'd react or even what I'd say.  But I'm glad I went because I made myself confront something that I needed to.  The confrontation wasn't anything.  It was just me seeing them and not feeling anything.  I didn't talk to them, but I didn't need to.  Just seeing them again was enough.  I'm gonna be okay.    When I brought Logan back to his car we saw Sean in the parking lot.  So Sean, what did you do to get the mall security on your ass?  Just curious...
