I'm doubting that decision, and I'm pretty sure i just lost a really really great person. since the break-up all i've dreamt about is him. the night it happened, i had a dream that ryan drove mike over to my house to give me back a shirt or something, and i could just see his face, and mine, how sad we were, apart. i went to give him a hug for my shirt, and he shrugged me away. and i could feel the hurt, i could feel it while i was sleeping. i woke up, in tears. then last night, i had a wonderful dream. Mike and I, were at Parker for some concert thing i think and him and i were standing around bla bla bla and ppl were coming up and giving me hugs, the one that stuck out was Spoon, he gave me a hug, adn Mike got pissed. i just leaned over and gave him a kiss and smiled. Everything was fixed. then we sat down for.......something i dont remember but he was laying in my lap, his fave thing actually, and i was just stroking his hair. then cut to him golfing (eh....i dunno) but i was laying down in the grass, and he kept looking at me and smiling, and i was smiling back.  then i got up and miles dykeman was at the hole in front of mike, so i hit his golf ball onto he green. yea i rock at golf apparently. and then Mike gave me another kiss. (man i didnt realize how much we kissed lol) then i was standing with him on the green and just with my head on his chest and smiling. cut to happy joes where clay and brittany were working. i bought Mike a pizza Bread thingy and some ice cream, it was 12:25 when i got is, and i needed to be at work by 1, so i was like oh shit how and i gonna get this food to him?? hes at parker! and i got all upset and before i could bring him the food, i woke up. I really dont like not having him. and i havent had any chance to talk to him. which i need and want to do.  I'm gonna cry.
