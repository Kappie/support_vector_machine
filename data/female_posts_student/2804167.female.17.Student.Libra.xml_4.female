At first I would be too frightened to leave my bed or even move a muscle for fear of dark-dwelling demons. I would lay for hours in itchy, overheated sweat, hoping my covers would protect me from fearful malingerers. Since then I’ve learned to listen to music or read a book. I’ve read a lot of books and watched a lot of terrible late-night TV from my bed.  	I woke up one night at what the red dashes proclaimed as two forty-six A.M. I laid for a few moments trying to go back to sleep, but it wouldn’t come. At last I threw back the covers and slid my legs out of bed. I live alone, so I didn’t bother to put on the sweats thrown over a nearby chair before going downstairs in search of a drink.  	Why is it that that night I wanted a glass of water? I’m pretty sure that’s never put me to sleep. It was surprisingly cold downstairs. I planned subconsciously to turn up the thermostat in the morning. 	I walked into the kitchen and turned on the halogen light. It takes a while for it to warm up, so it was still pretty dim in the room as I fetched a glass and held it under the tap. I looked out the window in front of me as I waited for it to fill, trying to discern individual shapes from the fuzzy blackness.  	As I left again I happened to glance behind me as I hit the light switch. I thought vaguely that I must put in a normal bulb - the room hadn’t much lightened in the few moments I was there. 	It wasn’t until I was a few steps away that I realized that there was a man in the kitchen, standing against a wall in the corner, his hands folded demurely before him. 	Panic washed my body like a cold shower. I walked through the rest of the dining room, the living room and up to the front door. Tears slid down my cheeks and my hands shook the water from my glass.  	I couldn’t help but run the last few steps to the door, and in my haste to twist open the lock I dropped the glass. It shattered loudly, and behind me I heard an anguished, masculine cry. I watched my hands opening the door, my ears and mind behind me. I sprinted from the house, across the lawn. 	At the nearest neighbor’s house I screamed and pounded on the door with my fists. Behind me I heard him coming; I looked - he wasn’t there. I saw a movement in the shrubs beside the porch - he wasn’t there. Screaming and sobbing hysterically, I pummeled the door with my fists until it opened and I fell into the neighbor's arms.  	Two days later a policeman stationed in my house found him in the same place, two fifty A.M.   	The man told the prosecutor he had used my phone every night for seven months to call his grandmother, whom he had smothered to death in this house six years before.
