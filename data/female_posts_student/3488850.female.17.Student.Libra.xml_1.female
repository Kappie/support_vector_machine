I felt so warm with them... the 12 of them who turned up.   We did knots and lashes. And 3 of us seniors tested them. It all went smoothly, well, mostly, it's because it was a small group. They learnt fast and willingly. Glad to see their kind of good attitude. Suddenly felt like throwing away all my responsibilities in my poly, and come back to help my guides, but things are not under my control.   BAck in poly, i join a CCA related to music. I do not feel the warmth there. There is no unity in some ways. Though i must agree, people are friendly at first.   Talk about my poly life some other time.   I just feel so happy to be with the guides. Maybe because i feel 'accepted' there, and also the warmth and belonging.   Peace I received, Peace I given.
