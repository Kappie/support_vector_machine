Okay sure the ads for porn sites/magazines/downloads are prominent, but its not  REALLY  smut, is it?  Basically, one of these guys that works here asked me to check online for something then  came around  my desk (I hate that) to see what I found for him... meanwhile, what HE found was Savage Love.  (It seems the  urlLink Wall Street Journal  takes a long time to load up.  Dammit I knew I should have just opened up a new window!!)    Alright, YES, I read Savage Love.  SO?  He giggled and then stated that I have "too much time on my hands."  I tried to explain to him (while probably turning beet red) that it was a) not what you think! and b) actually a pretty funny column in The Village Voice...no really!   Ummm...yeah.
