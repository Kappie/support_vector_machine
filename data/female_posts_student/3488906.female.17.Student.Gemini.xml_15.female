( wheneve i see this word, i was thinkin of you ) 3) the msg u typed " who cares about sleep .. blah blah blah " that was when i started to learn from you. too bad we dont really keep in touch. 4) 18 june 2003 . u were at the club.. your pose was so cool ! leaning against the wall.. i will never forget bout that. i even sms-ed keson and told him about it. we talked for a while, only a while. i appreciate that though. 5) u loved to buy tissue in watsons .especially the cute ones. i think of you on kuching age group swimmin competition 2004 while i went to watsons. i missed u alot that day. i bought tissue that day too. 6) i can remember on year 2003, during swimming competition, u dont bother to get in the pool for warm up. it was a sunny afternoon and it was definitely very hot. u were reading your books. i like u since. 7) i kept most of all the sms-es u sent. guess that's why i don feel like changing a camera phone. ahah. nice fren.
