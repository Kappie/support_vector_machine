My mom who had told me she had "only a dollar" somehow managed to get a lot of crap from the auction for only a dollar. But its okay cuz she got me a watch from Nordstromm's. I'm happy. But, right now I'm sitting in the basement of my new house as my dad and brother play pool. My brother sucks really bad. I'm super bored right now that's why I'm writing dumb stuff. Right...
