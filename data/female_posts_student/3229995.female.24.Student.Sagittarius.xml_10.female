By 1997 she was ready to take the step out of commercial pop and venture into new territories of music.        “Impossible Princess”  was to become quite an impossible release for the pop princess and its release would almost go un-noticed in most countries. The recordings was a hard trial for Kylie who was left with almost all the control of the albums development because of her deConstruction A collaborator Pete Hadfield’s ill health. This also meant that she was writing more than she had ever done before and this is the album where she comes out as more than just a singer, but also as a songwriter.    Kylie poured all  her emotions into this album; she gave it all she had, she also showed a far darker side to her personality and the lyrics were highly personal. The recording sessions could stretch way into the night and it was a fight for Kylie to make this album, but it was also what she wanted, full control. Faith can be cruel and the release of this album was to be an unhappy event; one week before the release Princess Diana died and the release was postponed. The album would be re-named due to Diana’s death and would be Kylie’s third eponymous album, simply named Kylie Minogue, the same name as her last release as well, it only retained its original name in Australia however.    “Impossible Princess”  was a flop, none of the singles entered the Top 20 in any major Chart Lists, the album would do quite well in Australia, but in Europe it completely flopped. It was, and still is, her greatest critical success, it was received well by critics and is considered by “Q Magazine” one of the hidden gems of the 90s. It was the audience that abounded her, they where unwilling to accept a more serious, darker and complex Kylie.   The album is  truly a hidden treasure; its best track “Breathe” is a soothing, dark and dreamlike song, which showcases Kylie’s song writing capabilities. “Did it Again” is also an extremely well written song, released with one of her best videos to date and a song that has a lot of attitude. “Impossible Princess” is a dark and complex affair; it challenges the listener and shows that even pretty girls can have “deeper feelings”.   If you ever  want to silence your mates when they say Kylie is overrated or un-talented, put this record on and they won’t even believe it is Kylie that is on.    urlLink The Official Kylie Site
