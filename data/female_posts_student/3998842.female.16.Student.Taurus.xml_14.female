Delicate and painted  blood-red with malicious  protective thorns  slowly dying,  murdered by your sweet kiss  by the beautiful touch of  your skin  that leaves me unprotected.    Without prick or flame or claw.  Open and raw,  laid out before you,  vulnerable and yours.    Naked before you,  you’re holding your knife.    Make me bleed  for you  I will like it  but please don’t hurt me    I need you too much  Claim me, babe,  and make me yours.    I’ll love you forever  and I’ll love you for  always  if you’ll promise you’ll  always  be mine.        ~fin~
