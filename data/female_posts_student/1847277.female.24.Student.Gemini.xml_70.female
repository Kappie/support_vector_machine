I'm also feeling rather unsettled.  My advisor said that I'm on top of things, that I'm actually ahead of schedule, but man, I don't feel like it, especially now that I'm drifting in lack of prelim paper topic land.  I talked to both my advisors about possible topics today and neither had ideas that sounded particularly appealing to me.  Phooey.  I am remotely excited about maybe doing something with some skeletons, but I don't know that I'd be allowed to, and I don't have the required skills quite yet.  Worth sending out an email, though, I suppose.      Oh well.  I should probably study.  Fun.
