MEGA superstore. loblaws of the dessert avocado the size of grapefruits I love the peace of grocery store Delillo had it right     walking home with two pillows form MEGA   watch the ethiopian women carry their babies on their back   the ethiopian boys playing soccer, perhaps they are nigerian.   imagine how in canada, those hills would be rolling green hills instead of buildings on sadn dunes.   I feel like the desert     I think that will let me sleep tongiht!!!!!
