I LIKE IT! I have always love Paine! Her hair and everything. But I kinda don't agree with her skull badge. Her costume is fun and cool, so is her sword. Did I mention that I bleached my hair again? Now to Ash Brown color from Gatsby, thanx to my brother who volunteered to streak my hair. My hair looked like coffee stain all over it. (*o*) He said he wanted that color coz he can pass it off to his DM that that is his 'natural' color. And please, his March holiday is just next week and my mother promised him that he can color his hair any way he likes for next week, duh! He just won't listen. Oh and that means I am putting ammonia and hydrogen peroxide and other too difficult chemical terms to type in here, to name a few. You can always go and glance at the side of any Gatsby hair dye box. It's all stated on there, Jap. people are real honest guys...
