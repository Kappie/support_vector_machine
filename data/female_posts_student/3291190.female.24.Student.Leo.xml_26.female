Evan  I drove for 4 hours, then spent 8hrs waiting in line to get in to the camp site. Around 4pm we were stuck on a bridge  we saw all of these guys running  screaming. Apparently one of their friends had to use the bathroom  stepped off the bridge (which appeared to be 5ft off the ground) -to him...but he was on something that was fucking up his perceptions b/c he ended up jumping off a 25ft bridge! w/ only an inch of water  jagged rocks...????? I got out of the car, people were pointing their flash lights at him. He was laying there,  looked like a chalk outline, there was a dark ring of blood around his neck....I don't think he died...but still that shit was scary!
