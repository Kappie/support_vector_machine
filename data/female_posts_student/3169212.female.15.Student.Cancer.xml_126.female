(sarcasum *drip drip*) Once again i was only comparing being hung with liver failure, savvy?  But if you wish to ask my opinion, i agree with CJ that crucifiction would be horrable and humiliating.  Did you know that the word excrutiating came from crucifiction because of the pain and agony you go through, mate?  I also agree with CJ that being torchered would not be wonderful either.  Many pirates go through that if you take hostages but i am not that ruthless.  Also the british officials, namely norington, are not smart enough to torcher pirates.  Although, mate, if elizabeth swann was a pirate hater i would never go near port royale ever again, savvy?
