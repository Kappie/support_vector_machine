Basically we're people from different cultural backgrounds who joined together to defeat the Evil Chairman and his Evil Teapot.  I was the Finnish girl Wayne Gretzky, Kendra was the German Keg Drinker, Nadia was the ghetto Bronx girl and Kristen was the Ultra Smiley Spanish person.  I was also the voice of the evil chairman.  If i tried to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand, so i'm not going to waste my time.  you just have to watch it.  We also watched this video of our whole group going to prom and it was acted out in the form of barbies.  I went to prom with a guy that lost his leg in a freak hockey accident, LOL  DALLAS WINS OVER COLORADO 5-1!!!!!!!!  WHAT WERE THE ODDS OF THAT!?!?!?!  My mom told me that my Niko did so good tonight (i didn't watch it because i was making a movie) and i'm so proud of him!!!  WHATS THAT CHEER WE LIKE TO HEAR? GO DALLAS GO DALLAS GO!!!!!  Wow this made the whole day seem alot less crappy.  Alright, sleepy time now.  "I will defeat you with my hockey stick of justice and my icy puck of truth!!!" (lol kendra, nadia and kristen!!!)  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
