(Hmm... that Fushigi Yuugi sentence didn't make any sense!) Oh well, like the rest then. Sorry about not blogging about interesting stuff, but I've started using my journal for that cause some things are ...private. You know? Like all this crap I share with every one, but I actually have stuff that I don't! (That's almost as hard to believe as trying to believe that I have a life!) ALMOST!!! Better go watch new Star Gate! Yeeeay!
