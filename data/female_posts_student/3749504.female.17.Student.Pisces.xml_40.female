Why just politics? Because it's my premier passion, and everyone has a right to decide what they believe in, and should not have to read my writings about my political opinions unless they choose to. By choosing to read this journal, you are choosing to read my (and hopefully in the future, other's) political views and opinions.  Hopefully I will not incorporate any personal evaluations into this journal; my personal life is on the stand at my other journal, Sublime. This one is strictly politics.  I encourage all of you who regularly read my journal (all four or five of you - Lor, Ryan, Urza, Lotos maybe, and even the people I have recently met - Grant and DeAnn) to talk to me about joining this journal so it can, hopefully, become a place where different people can post their own opinions - instead of constantly reading about my own :)"  Okay, so that's most of the first post. But you get the gist, hopefully.
