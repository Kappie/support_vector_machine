He says my feet are toys with the internet cables, I can't help it if I have the longest legs in the house, that stretch to the far nether regions of the computer desk!   I swear this is a 5'3 living breathing full grown man. Thus he is the Gnome.   I realize that I am posting very often. Once the novelty of this online journal blog deal wears off it won't be nearly as often.   That guy who does coaches corner for hockey seriously annoys me. Don what's his face, ya him. I don't care about what he has to say and he has an annoying voice! Grrr.    ♪Sunshine lollie pops and rainbows everywhere!♪ ... I've gone off to my happy place. Humm the me in my happy place is hungry (again) must eat...  My Unifriend isn't responding to my emails. I wonder where she is. Or if her computer is being rude to her again. I sent out a party invitation to her about a Lord of the Rings night that my three close friends and I could have and she had still to get back to me about it. It's already been like twenty-four hours! What has she, like developed a life or something!   Oh ya I'm hungry. Must leave... Must check Laurell K Hamilton's Blog... MUST EAT!   P.S. I've got to ask NeverMore if she will be attending the party as well.      P.P.S. Gnome just said I have monkey toes, I must go now to beat him up!
