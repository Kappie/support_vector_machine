It's a draw really; the student is either damned if she reads the meaningless material or doesn't.  He'll either skip right over it saying:  "It's good to be exposed to the historical backdrop upon which our modern system is based, so if you read the assignment for today (all 20 pages of it) consider yourself exposed.  It's not on the exam and I'm not going to spend any time on it."  Or he'll take the material line by line, asking only the most blatantly obvious questions, which are sure to confound the conservatives in the front rows.  My favorite trick of the professor, though, is his condemnation of the book's authors for including such irrelevant material and poor organization of the concepts discussed in the book, as though he has no power in how the class and the readings are organized and presented.    But, next year's students will have a better time of it because of this test-run called his first year of teaching, and that's an encouraging thought.  I suppose.  In other news, socialist hippies make great lunches and even greater atmospheres in which to enjoy said lunches.  And postal workers who refuse to send comic books via media mail because of the advertisements included therein can bite my ass.
