In all of life's trials and disappointments, there is none too destructive or harmful if you have friends to stand beside you. And that is my life, for without those friends--and I do not speak so strongly of all of them, only the truest--I would have nothing. And I would be nothing. But I am much more than that. A bright future still awaits me somewhere, and as long as I have faith in that, then someone out there must certainly still have faith in me.  "One day can make your life. One day can ruin your life. All life is, is four or five big days that change everything." -Riding in Cars with Boys  Well, I just woke up and couldnt get back to sleep cuz I had a dream about snakes...and I can't go back to sleep after dreams like that. Yuck. Went to see LOTR last night...freakin owns. Get to clean today. How exciting.  Well, adios you crazies.
