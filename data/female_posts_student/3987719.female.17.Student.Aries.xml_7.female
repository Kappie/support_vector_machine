Detroit who tied last years win total Friday lost due to a three run homer by Sheffield in the fifth. A-Rod with a good game as well going three for five with one RBI. The Yankee relief almost automatic with the two all-stars Tom Gordon and Mariano Rivera who closed it out with his 33rd save. Even though a good start with the two run shot from Eric Munson in the second they couldn't hold on. Starter Gary Knotts dropped to 1-3 in his last five starts bringing his ERA to 5.15.
