Hey that one was probably gonna be crap any way. (Good point) I was on the phone to Izzy and the next door neighbours dog was rolling all over our front lawn! It was covered in mud so I very bravely opened the front door and it stood and stared at me so I shut it. (Woos) Yup! Then it came over to the door and started barking! I was gonna get Izzy to come and scare it away if it didn't go but it did. But still, damn scary! (Yawn) Okay, okay.  It was a dark and lonely night and the tomato ketchup bottle had been walking for miles, he needed a refill and it was only a few centimetres to the factory but still, it seemed like a far way to him. He was about to go into the factory when a fat policman pulled up in a car and picked him up... Okay, this is going nowhere! Bubi!
