It was so cute I didnt want to get up - even though I had to pee really badly. Poor kitty I woke him up about 5 minutes later when I just couldnt hold it any longer. He glared at me with a look that said, "I knew I should have litter trained you."  Oh and among the national/political news there is this tiny headline that say recent Whitehouse Medicare commercials have been ruled as illegal. They have been determined to be propaganda paid for with tax payers money and without Congressional approval. These are the recent series of ads depicting the Medicare changes as a boon to seniors and having a "reported by" tag with a name like "reported by Karen Jones" at the end. In reality these commercials were paid for by the feds and sposored by the Whitehouse, but no where in these ads does it say so. In fact the group that is in charge of monitoring these thing also said some of the informtion within the ad is not correct and suspect. And that it is misleading in presenting itself as a news report. But he could hang the "illegal" label on the commercials when there was no recognition of government provision or funding. I wonder what will happen to Bush  Crew over this? It hasnt generated too big a stir yet, but has AARP sunk its teeth into the issue yet?  Well onto textbook reading! --Mack
