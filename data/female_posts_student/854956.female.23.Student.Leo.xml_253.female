We started in the kitchen, and we were packing up their plates and bowls.  We noticed that there wasn't that much newspaper left, so we drove the bus route to get issues of the Texan from all the bus stops.  :-)  We got back, and we finished packing up the plates and bowls.  After that we started packing stuff from the pantry.  Man, that was fun!!!  We played basketball, throwing away stuff that was old, or bad.  We found some weird and interesting things.  Then we went to the store and got some stuff for the night and the next day (paper plates, napkins, toilet paper, a pan).  Then we came back to the apartment and cooked dinner.  Amy came over for a bit, and we hung out awhile.  Then after she left, we did some more packing... I finally decided to go to bed around 3:30am... I was really tired.  The guys stayed up all night long packing.   Saturday, the guys got up around 9:30 and left before 10 to go over to the new place and get the keys and all.  They took their hanging clothes and the T.V.s at this time, and I stayed at the apartment.  They were gone a long time, and I got bored, so I cleaned up the kitchen a bit.  I cleaned the stove, the drip pans on the range top, the window in the kitchen, the counters, the front of the refrigerator (there was old food and magnet residue all over it)... Then after awhile, Ricky's Dad got in town, so I let him in, and we started on some stuff to get things ready to pack up.  We got the sofa ready to go, and Ricky called after awhile and asked me to start on the sausage for the breakfast tacos.  So, I started on that, and then the guys got back, and Long came, too.  We ate some breakfast tacos, and started on packing around 12:45pm.  Yep, sorry to say, I wasn't much help in the actual packing up of stuff to go from Sterling to Le Montreaux... BUT, I carried my weight when we got stuff from the trailer into the apartment at Le Montreaux... Damn arthritic knee!  Going up and down 3 flights of stairs about 5-6 times made my knee begin to hurt so bad... so, I was more help once we were moving things into the new place.  :-)  At least I didn't feel COMPLETELY useless.  We finally finished all the moving around 9pm!  Man, what a long day.  But, we decided we shouldn't go out and do anything... because quite honestly I was POOPED!  I think Ricky felt kinda bad that we didn't actually go out and do anything, but we can do something all together next time I come into town.  And, there's actually a slight possibility I can come the end of August.  :-)  So, Ricky shouldn't feel bad anymore.  :-)  Anyway, we all just went to Sonic after Jennifer and Druck got there, and then we came back and we were awake a little while, and then fell asleep.  We all woke up the next day around 2pm!  haha  That's funny because I had said I wanted to leave around noon...  hehe  Anyway, once everyone woke up we decided to go eat at Fazoli's.  Mmmmm  It was so good!  Minus the fact that we didn't get more breadsticks... and I made a boo-boo when we threw away our trash... I poured a bunch of Dr. Pepper in what apparently was their bleach water solution to clean off the tables.  :-\  Ooops.  I really didn't mean it... I thought it was a little resevoir for leftover liquid so it wasn't in the bag if the bag had a rip... so it wouldn't drip all over... yeah... OOOPS!  At any rate, everyone else thought it was quite funny...  I got back home Sunday around 6:15ish... and, THANKFULLY, I fell asleep by 11:30... so I had no trouble getting up this morning to be at work at 9:15 for training.  It was a long day at work, and I was talked into teaching a class that Teresa was going to teach.  They gave me the reference book, and I got teary eyed when I saw her little notes in the book.  :'(  Anyhow, that's next week.  I have SO MUCH to do next week.  Next Tuesday we go to pick up our stuff at the support center at 8am to take it to the site and put it in our cabinets that we left there.  It's exciting, but not... then on FRIDAY THE 13TH we have the "Meet the Parents" at Steubing... we'll have a little table set up, and some brochures... which means, we'll end up with like, 20 more files the 3rd day of school... :-(  It's bad, but it's good... cause if we get our 80 kids, then I get a secondary, and I get to pull outta ratio, and get another staff member.  As of now, I'm in ratio, and that's gonna be difficult.  On the otherhand, I sorta hope that the numbers stay low, cause I'd like to have a smaller number of kids, and a more intimate relationship built up.  It's easier to devote more time to each kid.  Okay, I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to sleep now, I think.  Ooooh, and thanks Kate for letting me know your AIM sn... hopefully we can chat it up sometime.  Oh, and thank you to a certain Raccoon that is very dear to me for the special birthday present.  ;)  It made me feel quite special, I only hope that I'll get to return the gesture on your birthday!  :-)
