I'll have this um, steak-y thing, this one here," Adam says, pointing at the picture on his menu.  So bloody expensive here , he thinks.  "And you madame?" "I'll just have the  salmon ," Jane says, glancing childishly at Adam and his shirt, "With the lemon dressing."  wow, it's so cheap here!  she thinks. "A very good choice," says the waiter, also glancing at Adam's shirt.  Aaaahaha,  he thinks, smirking,  That guy will never pull her with that shirt! Mwahaha.   And off the waiter went, grinning once again.   And so they sat waiting for their food. "So... what have you been up to in the last few days?" "Well.. I gave some Yao and Tom and some other people a promotion.. you know, they really have been working very hard hese days." "Oh," was all Adam managed to say.  Yao, Tom, does the list never stop? So much competition...   "And you?"  "I've, yeh, I-I've been good." "Yeh? You know, you never told me what you do. Where do you work?" "Oh.. well.. I um, well, I work at this school." "You're a teacher?" "No.. I'm just a kinda music helper kinda sorta.. um.. thing." "Hahaha."  "So, explain what this google thing is again?"
