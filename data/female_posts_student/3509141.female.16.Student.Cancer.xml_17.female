When two people have shared as much as you and I have, when they've opened up their hearts, shared their dreams, thoughts, and fears.  We have come to know each other well enough to know if sadness is hiding behind a smile or if happiness is glowing from the others eyes. We have shared so many laughs,  and we know when each others pain at times has triggered some tears.  We have come to believe in one another and are always sincere to the other,  we have trusted one another with the truth that lies within our hearts. Our true love has yet to be seen with the eyes,  but it's felt with our hearts, we have gained trust, understanding, secrets, loyalty, and sharing ones deepest passions.  This love is rarely found in life, but when it's found it has a profound impact on one's well being, strength and character.  A true love does not need elaborate gifts or spectacular events in order to be valuable or valued.  True love needs what I have to give to you now. I want to give you my undying loyalty, unmatched understanding, unsurpassed trust, and the deepest of enless soulful sharing and love that I have for you.  I love you with all that I am and all that I will be for the rest of my life.....  http://library.lovingyou.com/poetry/201/201084.shtml
