She had better get back to soon, though, she's gonna have a hell of a hard time catching up.  I got threatened by Lance in English that he was going to give me a wet willy... but not the tongue kind of wet willy.  I wanted to scream they're so immature.  Science was what ruined my whole day.  I was talking to a few kids that I sat near about the ban on Gay marriage and how it's discriminatory and wrong, and it sounds to me like we're back in the 50's and 60's discriminating against African Americans.  One girl, who I used to respect because she's a really good student, even said that men and women only get married to have children, and since homosexuals can't have children, they shouldn't have the right to get married.  I wanted to slap her across the face.  Then two other guys went on about how it was just wrong and disgusting, and how 'fags' shouldn't be around them.  It seemed that no matter what good support I gave, they refused to listen... I was wrong, no matter what.  I at least have the understanding that people may be against it, but they still have no right to limit other people's civil rights that are guaranteed to them as American citizens.  If we start taking away good people's rights, what will be next?  Will we start taking away our freedom of speech rights?  Freedom of assembly?  Many people are opposed to it because of their religion,   but that is precisely why the Church is separated from the government.    I give up for now.
