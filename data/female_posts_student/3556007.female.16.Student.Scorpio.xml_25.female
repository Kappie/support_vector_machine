All that I can say about this is that she needs to take things with a grain of salt. She is being like my sister; she takes everything sooo personally. Also, if things don't go her way, she pouts about it. AND she is being like Hunter. When people don't want to come over to her house she gets mad. Okay, maybe the second was an unfair comparison, but the first certainly wasn't.    so... Cassie was pissed this morning. For some reason she decided to bring it out on me and bitched me out completely.    From Cassie's side of the story, she was late, and Ellen was like, "Do you have five minutes?" Cassie said that she was having a bad day and told Ellen that she didn't have time. Then Ellen was like, "Fine then I won't show it to you," and Cassie started going on about how Ellen can't take 'no' for an answer...    And you know what she said? Almost word for word about what you said to me earlier. About how I can't take a 'no,' and I get all pissed off.    Hmm maybe there is some truth in that... Especially since it is coming from both of us now. Have you ever considered that, Ellen? Wait. NO! If there wasn't some truth in it, they why would you take so much offense at it. If you didn't believe half of it yourself, you'd be able to brush it away because you'd know that it wasn't true.    So... thanks. You know, Cassie is to both of us a friend, and I thought that she meant more to you than being just a medium through which you can feed bullshit.    Just see my comment above. If you didn't believe it, you wouldn't take such offense at that. Aside from the fact that I am not telling her bullshit about you (hmm I told her why you were mad at me on Sunday; because I came out and said that you can't take 'no' for an answer which is true BTW), what does that have to do with being her friend? Are you implying that I am using her to talk to you or something? Because you know for a fact that I am not scared to just throw whatever is bothering me in your face like I did on the way home from church that one day. Why would I need Cassie as a medium? I talk to her because I am ticked off with your actions, and you are always pissy about something whether it be that I talked to Brian or I talked to Hunter or I didn't walk home from school with you or whatever the tragedy of the moment is... Please name one piece of 'bullshit' that I have told Cassie. Wow. Look at that; you can't. Why? Because I tell her the truth instead of bending it so that it makes me look good the way that you do in your LJ.    Cause its wrecking me and her's friendship.    Yeah, I'm wrecking your friendship. That makes so much sense. Your friendship includes you and Cassie... and I am where? Yes, I am there, but it is your relationship not mine. What I am telling her is what happened. I may not be right, but I tell what I perceive. The only thing keeping me from telling her the complete truth is you because you won't even tell me what the hell is going on. I ask you, and you don't want to talk about it. What do you do instead? You cry, you turn to cigarettes, you write mean and distorted things in your LJ...    Ha... I really feel like I am friendless.    Now this is the kind of shit that just pisses me off. Helloo? Friend. Right here. Though I may not seem very open right now, it is because someone needs to slap you in the face and take you out of the stupid box you've been living in all of tenth grade. What about me? What about Cassie? What about Andy? Speaking of feeding someone bullshit, what have you been telling that poor kid on walks home? If it is anything like what you write in your LJ then your lying to him and to yourself. Dont you see that you are doing it to yourself? We are right here. We have been right here all along, but you keep pushing us away. Everytime that somethign doesn't go the way you had planned it to go, you act all ticked off, make yourself unapproachable, and refuse to talk about it. Now who is not being a friend? You should have been happy for me when I started going out with Brian. Instead you started choking up on the phone and telling me how you can't breathe. Like you said next...    Everyone has motives, right?    What is your motive behind all this? What are you hoping to achieve by playing these games? Freaking out over things, overreacting, pushing others away, refusing to talk about it. What do you expect us to do? Wait. We ask you and you don't tell us. Why? Hell knows why because you won't even look at us. You just sit there with a scowl on your face, unapprochable until you decide to talk about it. Then, like at LP concert, you try to use the excuse that *I* am being unapproachable when I am hugging Brian or holding hands. I am the same fucking person as before. I may have changed or been influenced by him a bit, but I am the same Kirsten. When you talk to me, I am going to pay attention to you; I am not going to ignore you. What are you avoiding? How am I unapproachable? You don't feel comfortable talking to us when we are together? I don't know I am just guessing? Do you feel like you're intruding on something? I don't care! How many times have I told you that I am not going to pull a fucking Lisa on you. I don't know if that is what it is, but you won't freaking tell me, so how the fuck am I supposed to know what is going on?   Returning to motives... What are you implying that I am trying to do? I am not plotting to turn Cassie against you or anything if that is what you are thinking. That is stupid. Why the hell would I want to take away one of your friends? This is the only conclusion that I can come to... ???    I don't know. Maybe I am being a complete arse and everyone but me can see it. But I can't see it so how do you expect me to fix it?    But you can see it; you've acknowledge it before. You know that you freak out over little things that aren't a big deal and you know that you make yourslef unapproachable and you know that you avoid approaching me and Brian and you know that you are hard on Cassie when she can't do things. And you are hard on me when I can't do things either. Like when I was sick and you came over to my house, or when Cassie was sick and she couldn't come (though I do admit that until I saw her on Sunday I didn't really believe her) and when I was sick and couldn't see X2 and you just got all pissy on me (  Then she wrote a bunch of other stuff about how she is just going to go and listen to Hoobastank until some Godly insight comes to her. Then she commetns on how fucked up this week has been...   Ok... Please enlighten me. What is so soul-crushing that everything else is just trivial? If it just SoCo, that is ridiculous. You needed to be realistic and not get your hopes up so high for SoCo because 6 hours away is a loong time. Aside from that, I don't know what else there is so be so fucked up. If you start telling me about school is stressful and stuff like that you might as well be a broken record, so nice try if you are going to excuse your attitude and feelings with that. Ugh I really want to read this to you, but I would have to reread the whole thign because some of it is directly to you, and then the rest of it is to some invisible person. Whatever, maybe I'll just read it to you anyways.
