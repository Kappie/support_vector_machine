I decided that I like this blog because it let's me be ponderish, one of my favorite things to be, and then I get to see what people think without clicking on the comments button. Let's toast to that.   This is for my Katie: Will you be my warmie? *cheesy smile*   To everyone: Hey, I dare you to move.  Why is it that we spend so much time ina hurry to grow up but then when we finally get there we wish we could be young again? Is it because we wear diapers when we're small but once again when we're wrinkly? Why is it that I sit here, finally looking at my senior pictures, wondering where my life went? It seems as if these last few years have been on aslight fast forward and now it's only going to get faster. I wanted so badly to grow up, but now I find that I'm just a little bit scared to grow up the rest of the way. I hate to bring this up once again, but I find that it crosses my mind quite a bit lately, and I suppose I can't be the only one. I have officially finished my first senior thing and now I think I'm ready. I'm ready to actually classify myself as a senior. Indeed. Louisa Mae Soli-Holt has proclaimed herself a senior, one year away from starting her first year of college. I think I can handle that. I hope I can anyway. =)  This being the end of this post, good byes are in order. Look for a long survey on my blog...  urlLink www.jiggymae.blogspot.com  ...in the near future. Come to Coldstone on Thursday night and see me all dressed up. Smile a lot because it'll get you through the hard stuff and accentuate the best stuff. Remember that I love you. Because I do. Okay? Okay. =)  **Louisa**
