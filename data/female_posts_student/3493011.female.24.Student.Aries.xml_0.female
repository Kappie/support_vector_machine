Honestly, I shldn't have cared less..but another side of me was "shit, I muz try to get back to sleep so eerie" Indeed, I retire into dreamland... yet, I wished I hadn't cos I'd a dream of my dad fetching me and my kiddo bro from sch... we were very young then...   Oh yes, memories are made of this... dad will fetch us in the morning to school and after classes, he'll fetch the both of us hme.. Those were the days when the 3 of us were havin heaps of fun in the car tryin to figure out Acronyms for freeways and international organisations..I used to have dah kick of making me little bro look like an ass... hee hee since, I'm older I reckon I have accumulated more knowledge than him... Yah, dad will always tease us and formulate his own unique Singaporean acronyms like FOC = Free of Charge, PAP = Pay and Pay...   Mum never understands why I was close to dad, it is memories like this that makes me miss dad so much... I love my dad lots but if I ever see him again, I know how awkward it'll be.. it's like fancy seeing an old lover again... the uncomfortable silence of not knowing what to say... I have not idea where dad is and my dream has made me aware that even till now, how I wish he'll still dote on me and make me his favourite.. I miss my daddy and wonder at times if he misses me too or even us as a family....  Morning like this is hard to bear especially when the break of dawn draws on memories of the past... Love you daddy, can you hear me?
