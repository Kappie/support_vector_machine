If no one guess Paul told me he loved me last night which was the best thing that could have possibly happened to me at this point. And being called perfect by your boyfriend doesn't hurt much either. I am just overflowing with happyness right now. Nothing can hurt me...nothing...god I didn't know I needed this so much. So much I couldn't say until this was out in the open. So many unnamed feelings that I have found to be love. It's can be discribed by nothing but being perfect. We've been talking alot about the future. This relationship is gonna last for a long time. We've decided 3 years at the least. Till the end of high school. And I love that prospect! I mean how many high school guys are ou there who would seriously stay with a girl for 3 years! The rest are too concered with how many of them they can possibly date in a year! So I consider myself very very lucky to be going out with Paul. I realised last night, while sitting through the most boring barbeque, that I could see not see myself with anyone but him...and i love it! I get to spend three years of the most stressful dating with the greatest guy I could even hope for! I am excited for the future and whatever it may bring me!
