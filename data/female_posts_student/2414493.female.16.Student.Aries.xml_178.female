There's nothing as humiliating on a Saturday morning knowning that you might have to spend that kind of money to repay for your stupidity.  It's going to be a good day today, I hope. Piano practice, then lesson, then library to return that renegade SATII lit book (didn't help really, you see) then the mall. By myself, yay. I hope I find Faulkner today. Or just good reads in general.  My room is a mess, and I have no intention of cleaning it up. Someone keeps on cleaning up downstairs for me, so I guess I'll just stay and work here.
