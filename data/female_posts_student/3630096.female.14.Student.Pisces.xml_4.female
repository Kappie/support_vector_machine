I was damn scared and nervous even though deep down in my heart, I know I can do this. I've done this for so many times. Who couldn't!? But turning around, I saw that many people had prepared well for this special test. Big pictures, scripts, a great amount of cue cards, decorations, everything. Panicking, I thought I should get something done. Well. At least I can paste my pictures on a vanguard sheet... I made my decison and bought a vanguard sheet shared with Haina and glue. Then I went to get the form for the computer lab and dashed upstairs to get a pen, come down, search for teachers and found someone I wanted to see. Miss Yani.    I looked around and Miss Yani is my only hope. I went up to her and asked her to sign the form for me. She agreed, I was in joy! so much in joy that I asked her about the t shirt, since mine is so large, I simply can't fit in. She agreed! I was filled with joy and happiness. Then I ran off.    I headed to the bookshop to get one piece of paper. Then I met Ying Ge with Qiying together with Xue Yi over there. What an unlikely trio. I saw them holding the form and thus asked whether they wanted to go with me, since I already got it signed.    So we went to Com lab1, which refered us to com lab4. After we reached com lab4 with running and panting as if we had run for miles, we sat down, worked for 15min before a teacher stop us. Hell! She told us she booked the lab for remedial! But there're so many computers! Can't she spare us some!? gee. I ran back down to com lab 1 again and saw somebody there. (But of cos on the way, I met somebody...) Nizam, talking to mrs low. Maybe I'm really that easy to be influenced, Nizam is somehow more smugly and more shuai than usual..haha. We headed in and mrs low had given us the left side of the room. I was grateful for that. We start to work, when I was all ready, I found that the printer had NO INK!!! But with the help of Ng Li, Junyi helped me to print. hehe. (He was the someone whom I met along, afterall) Thanks, kor! Haha. But I simply couldn't speak it out of my mouth during that time. Seeing his cheeky face simply reminds me of that time...    Then I dashed up to the fourth level again. Gee... why couldn't our class be on the first level!? I was about to faint when I held on and ran into the classroom only to see the entire class in disaster state. I sat down, grabbed the glue and ruler and started to tear and paste. After thirty minutes of pasting and decorating, finally, it looked like I had done some work...    So we went down to the Drama room even though we knew that we were late. But the class was not dismissed yet. After 2/10 came out of the dance room, Daphne came to me. Her visual aids was really well done but she hadn't gotten the chance to present it this week. I was impressed. So we went in to the usual smelly dance room and sat down waiting with excitement for our turn. Somehow, time passed and my turn still hadn't come. I was about to die from waiting! That kind of nervousness... And the day ended with the last, Qiying's presentation. My heart sank with disappointment. After so much preparing, after running like hell from level to level, is this what I 'll get in the end!?I was so...frustrated. I did not want to wait until the next week! I didn't want to have more fears hanging in my heart! So I, with amira, "begged" the teacher to let us present for the day, so that I could be relief. She agreed! YAY!! So I waited again for amira's speech to end, it was really great, it was a kind of important presentation she had given. I stood to my feet once more, the script clenched in my hand and the visual aid in another. I spoke and I looked up to have eye contact with the audience. I stuttered though and I paused for a few moments. But it was great. It is great afterall...    The desperationdied after the speech...   On my way out of the school, I saw michelle and grinned my broadest smile ever with the most content feeling... She returned me the smile and I had the urge to tell her "It's over! It's finally over!" but I couldn't. lol. I came to a halt at the bus stop station and met Grace over there. We talked for a while and she got onto 307. I had the urge to go home too but I was held back by the downpour of rain. Afterwards, Amira came by. So we talked again ad 175 arrived. I boarded the bus and tapped my ezlink card and walked on...   The bus drove away as I saw a familiar figure...    The figure of a pale boy carrying a tortoise bag...     And I just can't avoid looking back...............................
