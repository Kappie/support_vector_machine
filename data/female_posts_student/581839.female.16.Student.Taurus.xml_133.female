It kept on icing outside, yes i like to call it icing, aren't i wierd, so last night, my friend, who's mom is a teacher at my school, IM's me saying"no school tomorrow! my mom got a call!" so today, i sit in my room, so excited that i am missing school. there's like, three layers of ice snow outside, and i'm going to clean my room today, its decided. i will organize it completely, and then i'll do homework for class. and i'll read a book! and drink hot chocolate! take a shower! and all that good stuff! there's so much to do! So last night i went to bed at one, and i woke up at 1130. i feel oh-so-refreshed.and its almost one in the afternoon! which means that i don't have much time to complete all that i want to complete! so i'm going to go turn on my mini fridge/heater and make some hot chocolate and i'll report tonight about what i did!
