Anyway, Tony, Lindsey Baylor's boxer, came over and played with Brandy and Maddie today.  They were sooo cute.  Well, Tony and Maddie were, Brandy just kind of slept.  Hey, she's old.  She can't help it.   And, um, oh yes... I have *drum roll* ALL of my make-up work finished.  Done.  Complete.  I did 9 weeks worth of work in a little less than 3 weeks, which just goes to show that we are wasting precious time in school.  Hmmm, what else?  I've got say something because my blog is really getting boring.  How about this, I'll just tell yall what we (Josh, Liz, and Me, and Will, some of the time) were talking about in fifth today.  Josh was talking his dad watching Star Trek obsessively and how he would have to say something really weird to get his attention, like "Dad, I've hurt my genatalia!" (yes, I probably didn't spell that right, but in my defense, it is only due to a lack of practice) at which point I start cracking up, wondering, why not arm instead, but he wanted it to be outrageous.  Anyway, so from there we go on to talking about peeing on electric fences and from there to people doing odd things with their "genatalia" while they are drunk, namely putting it down fire ant hills, which is probably not a very smart thing to do, even for a drunk person.  So, there is my story to try to spice up the blog once more since no one is having any more crises at the moment, except for my little phone "competition."  So, post back, hopefully not about genatalia, because I think we've had enough of that in this post, but about something else, perhaps even more disturbing or interesting, or conversation startering, or something like that.  I gotta go before I make an even bigger fool out of myself, which I'm not quite sure is possible.  Anyway, I'll see yall later.  Oh, and also, I have not have ANY caffeine today, so this is ALL natural, which is kind of scary, too.
