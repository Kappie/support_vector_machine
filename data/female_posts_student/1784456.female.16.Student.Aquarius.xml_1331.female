Normal people just walk past it, I however have to trip on the mat and throw myself at the wall or hit the door frame. Or maybe it's just me... Do you really think that every thing changes? That scares me! Change always does, I think that's more scary than the thought of change scaring me, the fact that it does. All the major changes in my life haven't been the best ones. I figured that if I stayed the same, no one would notice me and they would have no reason to pick on me or any thing. If you become the backround then no one will see you. Sadly that doesn't work. Bugger, aye? Some people pick you out of the backround for no reason and turn you into the foreground, because they're actually cowards who are trying to cover up the fact that they're cowards. People always try to cover up their insecurities by pointing them out on other people, maybe it's like a cry for help or some thing.  This was from ages ago but my computer wouldn't work! But it's better now... Yeay! *read next blog for uninteresting info on it*
