I dunno, it's just him that I have been talking to. And all we do is argue, and, I can't be friends with someone like that. I really don't think anyone can blame me, either. And because I won't/don't talk to Tony, Phant want's nothing to do with me. Which sucks. We have such a close bond. **sigh** I am just in the worst slup. Then, people I know are online block me. It's just a bad feeling, I guess what comes around, goes around, right? I am just soo unhappy, and I have had some AMAZING things happen to me. Maybe if I talk about the good things, I'll perk up a little? Well, I have talked to Matt a lot this week. It's been really cool. He calls me "Night Owl". I love it! And since I'm ALLLLLLLLL the way in St. Louis, and he's in LA, and since he know's that I have had a rough week, he is sending me a copy of the "gig" as he put it, see, His dad records all of his shows, and I was sooo, touched that he would send me that. He is the sweetest guy I have had the pleasure of knowing. I am just so happy that I know him. Thank God for FFF to put him in the video. Speaking of FFF, I am the E-mail of the week there. For my e-mail about my birthday, I was really happy about that. Mom thought it was cool too. I can't remember if I wrote about the Reign Kings yet.. hmmm... Well, they are this incredible band from AZ, they're local, and I listened to them, and I loved it! So I joined the message board, I told Matt about it, he liked them too, Left a message on the RK board about that. Scottie, the lead singer e-mails me telling me that I have been choses the "Fan Of The Month" so they're sending me an autographed cd and Poster! They're production manager loves me, he said that I'm his new best friend, lol. Um.. what else.... actually, I think that's it........ grrrrrrrrrr. I don't feel better :(          ~~Breena          The feeling overwhelmed me.     I'm at the bottom of my grave.     The mud, and dirt starts falling     There is no escape     Up to my nesk.      I am paralysed.     Time to take my last breath.     My last though?     You.     Everything fades away.      Your hand reaches down     Saving me from certain death     A Halo over your head     My savior.     You.
