I'm starting to like coffee a lot. I think maybe my brother is a genius. Possibly I am underestimating everyone in the world and they're all much smarter than I think. Everyone in the world- Sorry. I suck.   I'm kind of regretting moving my blog. It was fun thinking that someone was reading it, besides the tiny bit of internet strangers and Henna. Oh, God. Maybe I'm becoming a extrovert. It's a small step from web-journal-show-off-ism (stick with me here, people) to jumping off a cliff wearing nothing but a flag. And then I set the flag on fire on the way down.   I'm psycho.   So, on a completely minor and unimportant note, I got Netflix today.  urlLink Netflix . Netflix! I told Henna, who really doesn't have that much to gain from it. Her response?   HENNA: "OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  ME: "I know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"   For those who don't understand the importance of Netflix, let me tell you this: The main reason I got a job was for Netflix funding. Uh huh. That's right. It's that important. And I'm that crazy. Still not convinced? I have a whole rant especially built for people like you. Do you know how much DVD sets of television shows cost? $60 per season. This is for something I would watch maybe twice. But with Netflix, I pay only $22 a month and I can get unlimited movies. No late fees. Very convenient, too. And there is so much I want to watch. Over vacation I compiled a list of over 200 movies to see. They run the gamut from  Lost in Translation  to  Monty Python's Flying Circus  to  Weekend at Bernie's . And then there's  Groundhog Day . And  X-Men . And  Sex and the City . My friend, Netflix is no small blessing.   And you were right. They are paying me to advertise.   I let my brother pick out one movie from the first three we were allowed to order. He said he wanted to see  Bonnie and Chester , which I'd never heard of in my life. Searching for it brought up nothing. If Netflix, which has thousands and thousands of DVDs, doesn't have it, then it does. Not. Exist. Period. But tell this to a 6-year-old. Ian was insisting stubbornly that I click on the links he saw on the page.   IAN: No, check on everything!  POIRE: I am, I am. Jeez! There's nothing here. Ian, pick a different movie.  MOM: Ian, if you want a story get your butt in here  now !  IAN: Wait!  POIRE: Pick a different movie and hurry up.  IAN: Nooooooooo.  MOM: Ian!  POIRE: Mom's going ballistic. Hurry up... Oh my God! Fine, whatever.What's this movie called?  IAN:  Bonnie and Chester .  POIRE: Who's in it?  IAN: Bonnie and Chester  MOM: Get in here!   At this point Ian laid down on the floor and started bawling. Later it was discovered that he was thinking of  Rocky and Bullwinkle . Yeah. With the moose. He ended up picking  Spider-man vs. Doc Ock: The Animated Version  as a replacement, though. The weekend with that around is gonna be mad fun, let me tell you. Sigh with me, people.   The rhubarb pie my mom made could really use more sugar. I want to go buy good bread and cheese and eat a lot of fresh vegetables. It's the healthy period blues. Good night.
