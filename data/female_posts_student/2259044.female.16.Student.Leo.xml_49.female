(can't spell again!) and people wonder y i nap so much, well geez, it's cuz i'm trying not to let u all down, i'm TRYING to give u all my attention, goodness sakes i'm trying soo hard to be perfect that i can't even think anymore! i'm being nice to this person, then that person, while trying to solve these problems over here and fix my own stuff ALL AT ONCE!! and i can't do it anymore! so if i screw up sometime, if i let'cha down ever-so-often, well...i'm sorry, but ur going to have to try and understand that i'm NOT actually superwoman, and i can't do it all!  wow, venting feels good! changedfish
