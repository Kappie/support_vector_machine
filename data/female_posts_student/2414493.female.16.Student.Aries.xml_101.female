I still haven't gotten over the fact that it's March, but I've forgiven myself already since it's only day two and I can't expect much. Just got back from volunteering at the hospital, and every bit of me is tired. T was there doing her training hours today, though, and she went with me on 'most every errand--we transported a funky flower balloon arch, cooed at the babies in the nursery, did more mundane things. So that was satisfactory. Very much so, actually.  My friendship with T always makes me wonder where I stand on her friend spectrum, if it can be called that. I'm sure she has much more interesting people to talk to and all, and I can hardly be labeled as the type who could associate with her and be on her good side, but apparently I've stuck around for longer than I expected, lol. She's a good person and all, and I think preparing myself for the fact that I can't depend on her for everything is what? a spoonful of sugar when the medicine goes down, or however that goes.  I am slacking off so much in journalism that it makes me Cringe. Yes, with a Capital C. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if I just had a rest break in the middle of the day, but I just don't want to upset Mrs. B, and I'd feel evil if I was using her. So I just finished B's editorial today, and I still have to finish the Dick van Dyke story and start the one on the library. lol. How the hell am I going to do that one?   So B is bi. Thank you.  Why does loss of innocence come in stages? I used to be so detached from wild society and then I found out about parties and druggies and the like. And now I have somewhat gained a little more freedom, only to discover other disturbing facts. Is it unusual that I am always a step behind? What does that say about my development? Outside perception (if it even matters)?  Read more Pablo Neruda.
