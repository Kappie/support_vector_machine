Because I couldn't find my sunscreen today.  And like an idiot I thought: I'll just go to the beach for a couple of hours, I can't burn that quickly. Well, guess what, yes I can.  I was online checking out other people's blogs. And I looked up and saw the suncreen sitting on my desk right out in the open.  Just thought I would tell you all that (you all, of course, being no one at all).    Anyway.  Here's a blog I liked:  urlLink http://karolewrites.blogspot.com  maybe I just liked it because she is a new blogger and her's is sort of a personal diary like my own which doesn't seem to have a lot of readers (i only say that because there are no comments posted).    Also, I forgot about the following website and recalled it for no reason today.  I find it highly entertaining:  urlLink http://emotioneric.com   okay. that's it for now.
