Can't really be sure can we. *eyes pen suspiciously* But anywhosit the pen exploded all over my hands..and now my keyboard is slightly green. Most horrid really. However I am certain I can get it off *cackles*...  I hate when pens explode, I'm lucky enough that they never do it at school, and I've never stained my clothes off of them..but they annoy me. My faithful pen that suddenly has had enough of writing for me decides to sacrifice itself. Maybe it is a noble way to die in the pen world...I think if I were a pen I would just wait until I ran out of ink, it would seem as though I had had a better life.  But I guess if the person had sweaty palms and got sweat all over me all the time; I too would explode to save myself from that horror. But I don't have sweaty hands so I can't imagine what the pen had against me. Unless I held it too hard..or pushed to hard..alas! I will never know.  It would be interesting to know how things feel. For instance my keyboard or Mr. Fanful. Who is my computer by the way. He's very faithful, always on and he usually does as I ask him. I rarely have trouble getting him to do things and he's never shut down completely on me. Mr. Fanful is rather loud but other than that I love him, and I've gotten used to the sound of his fan. But I often wonder if it takes a toll on him, considering I never shut him down or put him to sleep. I also wonder if my keyboard gets tired from be pounding on it practically constantly.  However the keyboard will get a considerable break once school starts in a few days. On wednesday the 18th to be exact. Then I will not be able to sit at the computer all day...for I will have to be in class, learning 'important' things that will get me through life. Yes, those days of writing with a pencil and taking notes, and tests, and labs and so on are back. Though I have to say this summer has been great; I did practically nothing and I loved every minute of it. In a way I'm kind of glad that I have to go back to school, it will give me something to do, and I'll see my friends again. Not that I have that many to see...but you get it...and if you don't its not like I care.  Today I found this new kind of Nickel..yes, a new nickel. On the back it said somthing about the louisianna purchase..and it looked shiny and new. I've never seen a nickel like that so it must be some new thing. Like the new twenties and such. I wonder what was wrong with the other money? Why change it. In case you didn't know, I hate change. Change is annoying, everything simple could stay the same you know. For instance curtains, why get new curtains?! The other ones are perfectly fine. And why rearrange the furniture..it was doing just as well where I am used to it being. I really hate when the furniture is moved because then I have a tendancy to run into it...I always know just when to move in my house to avoid hitting the couches and chairs and tables..and then someone comes along and moves them over an inch or switches the chairs with the couch, and then I come home and run into things because they're not where they should be.  There was nothing wrong with the money so why not leave it alone? Seriously...*shakes head* It's hopeless and I have no say in the matter..so I have to deal with it. I suppose I will live..because I'm not willing to die just because I don't like how the money looks. That would be kind of silly. Especially when you think about how many people die every day for important things.  And reading over that I notice "Wednesday" ...who thought of spelling the word like that..seriously..wendsday..thats how it sounds. Wednesday; if you said it like its spelled it would be saying it wrong..the horror..who comes up with these things and why do we need a name for every day of the week? couldn't it just be 'day'? Apparently not..Ack...yon evilness of the computer time restrictions..oh well I've wasted enough time today writing down meaningless thoughts...hehe but I do so amuse myself while I do it.
