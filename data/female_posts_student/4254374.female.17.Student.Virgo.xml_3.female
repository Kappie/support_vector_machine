Or perhaps, I just want a site where I can note down events significant to me, maybe not to others, so this place isn’t a secret but it’s not important to me whether others read it or not. I’m not sure whether I should let my friends know about this site. The more readers, the more inclined I feel to type entries that will interest them. (shrug) Anyway, I’ve done enough blogging. It’s getting late,  I should start mugging. I’ve got Ling, Math, Music,  Psych to do  I haven't started!!        Planning ahead is one matter; carrying out the plan is another.
