I kissed Jason, several times in fact, and each time was just as passionate as the last, i want him so bad, i'm hungry for him, he kissed me and i just melted, my hands were on his neck, and his back, and kissing him and his neck, and his hands were on my arse and sides, and then we walked off and we were up against a wall and my hands were grazing his chest and i was kissing and biting his neck and i could hear his breathing slow and deep and feel his body pressed against mine, i have to have him, i will have him. He wanted me and the moment his lips touched mine i wanted him and his breathing and his hands told me that, i just want to have him all to myself, satisfy this need just for him, i look at him and i need him so badly, i can hardly keep it to myself, i just need him, once, well maybe more than that, and maybe he needs me, i'm going to get him, i'm going to get him, tease and touch him until he can't handle it.   ~Lisa~
