I know I should forgive him, but right now fuck him. I can't believe he tried to convince me that he was any different than the rest. Can't believe I was buying his load of crap. He's the same at the rest of the population that has a dick. I don't want to see him right now. I asked him if he was sure. Fucker.  When I say, "they're all the same" Alex wants me to say, except him. He did the same fucking shit to me. He betrayed me. I can't fucking trust any guys right now. I do it to humor him, but he doesn't know I know what he's done. Gah!  How can someone keep up with so many identities? I don't understand. I wish I knew who the real friggin person was. All I can do is remember the good times. The time we fell asleep in the hammock, and when I was chasing him around the yard. When he wrestled me so his psycho cousin could beat me up. When we washed his car, watched movies. Drove around. Got caught by the cops. Got caught in the Love One Another Church parking lot..  I dont' want to be anybody's friend right now. I want to push everyone the fuck away. Leave me alone. I hate you all.
