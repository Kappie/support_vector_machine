I can´t wait for Rome all the Jamón here is getting icky,  I need pasta or pizza or something yummy.  We are going to get back Sunday night around midnight, sweet.  I am glad Duane from St. Thomas is coming so it won´t just be the three girls staying in the center of old Rome, now we have an escort.  Its funny, people keep saying, oh, well you might get robbed in Rome, wouldn´t that be scary, I started laughing, ¨Yes, it is.¨  Karen and I had a beer last night over dinner and it put both of us out of commission for the rest of the night.  I went to bed super early.  Oh and remember the class I had to fake a case recitation in, well Prof Maloy, knows my name now and when he´s calling role says my name then says, yes she´s here.  Oh and at breakfast he says ¨Hello Rachel¨ which is a little unnerving and not what you want to hear at 8am from your prof who gives the most reading.  I can´t tell if he likes me or if he suspects I had no idea what I was saying.  He said I did a good job, though at lunch yesterday, and that means all the other suckers in class will be called on before I will.  Haha.  Triumph.  Well, its not 104 here, hope you all develop innovative ways to not get scorched.  I am stalling I still have reading to do, hey mom, ¨Love you most¨ and someone tell my heathen brother to email me or I´ll have to make good on my initial threat.
