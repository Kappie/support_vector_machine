If you're not a member, just click on anonymous or whatever so it'll be an anonymous comment. Then just type your comment and say who it's from so I do know who all is commenting. :-)  And I guess if you didn't pick up on it earlier, my previous post was written by me. Jade told me I need to share my writing, so I decided that I'll start doing that.   As for other news... (In my old school random form, haha Sara and Allie!)  *Today I had work. I seriously hate this job SO MUCH. But only another month or so of it and I'm finished.   *I'm going to be taking Driver's Ed. soon. For insurance reasons. It cuts down the cost. So I'm taking it from this old black guy and I think it's going to be fun! I seriously need to learn how to park. Haha.  *Tomorrow Virginia and Charles leave for camp!!!!!! Hell yeah!!!!! This is gonna be great.  *If you want to come to this John Mayer concert with me, tell me. You'll have to buy your own ticket, but I'd be happy to bring you along!!  *That is all.
