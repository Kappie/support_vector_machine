Heeheehee. Tomorrow night. Oh man. That's all I can say. Tomorrow night. Wow. Then on saturday we're leaving for vermont. I'll be glad to see people before I go. Man. Tomorrow night. Well wait, I guess it is past midnight. Tonight. Oh man. I can't wait. That's all I can say though. Poor amber. Can't come. She's going to college. Ha ha. She'll be back though. Yarr. P-D (that's the pirate smily face) Ok, well I'm tired, and anime is starting again. Can't get enough of that sweet sweet anime. I need a life.  Can I have yours? Or maybe just you.
