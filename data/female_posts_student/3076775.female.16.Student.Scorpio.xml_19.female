Me and several people discussed a joking we're going to play on someone, so that took up most of the day at school. I gotta make sure I don't laugh though, or the jig is up. lol. I just hope that nothing bad happens from this joke. Ah well, I'm sure it won't. After school we went to Goody's and I got a shirt. It says "I make dirt look good." I had to get it! lol. Ooh, and we went to Logan's after that and the bartender accidentally shattered a glass, which flew into my food and on me. So, our food was all free. I really REALLY miss someone....and you know who you are. ^^ Well, blog at you all laterz. Love, Shannon "If a Vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat?"
