(Don't ask, I'm in a poetry mood and if you've ever read my poetry then you'll understand that from this point on in the blog nothing will make sense) Wow, how do you do that? (Erm... deep breath?) Any way, sorry I was uploading and writing more. And yes, you should be afraid if you ever go to  urlLink http://www.fanfiction.net  and run at the sight of 'by stilldreaming', oh and don't take it personally if you're included. Mind you, if you're a WSL then I won't really care. (People who don't know WSL, just nod.) Hehe... MUHAHAHA! (Here, have some drugs) *grabs them* MINE! ALL MINE! HEY! You gave me minstrels! Give me the hard stuff! (Oh, ok then) Ahaha! CALPOL! YEAYYY! *oh btw, I don't actually do calpol or drugs unlike  some people   *stares at izzy*  (Calpol girl!) Mmm I better go bug my parents, sorry kiddies. X X X (Geez you must really be loopy if you're leaving kisses) *they're bombs... shh*
