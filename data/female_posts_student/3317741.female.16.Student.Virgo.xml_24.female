What can I do, what can I say  To make you understand  How I feel about you each and every day  Is it that my heart skips a beat  Every time you pass   Or how the walls around my heart  Came down with just a glance  I toss and turn all night in bed  Thoughts of you running through my head   I don't know what to say to prove it's real  Words can't express the love I feel  Just hold my hand and look into my eyes   If you see tears falling to the floor  Then you will know it's true  I do in fact, love you
