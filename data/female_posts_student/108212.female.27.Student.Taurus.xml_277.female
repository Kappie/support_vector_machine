But there are a couple of downsides: (1) there's an ad that appears at the top of the page (you can get rid of the add by paying $12/year though), and (2) you can't upload any files to their server. Let me know what you decide, either way.    Here are some templates that you could choose from:  urlLink blogger templates . Let me know which one you'd like to use and I will get it set up for you. If you have specific design ideas, just let me know and we will create your own custom blog template together.
