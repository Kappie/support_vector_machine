I'm using this song to talk about how Summer really brings the better sides of us out. How so? Well, my head is overloading with love for everyone I know, especialy the JC. Why? Because summer is making me go good crazy! How? Because there's no exams to worry about, no stress, no jerks to deal with at school. It's good times, and it makes me wanna hug all of you until your eyes pop out and shake my head to a rock song! The only bad thing, 1 person rule. But maybe Steph will be able to drive and we can have a convoy! YES! I can see it now. The JC presents it's wheels...  Speedy Reidy! Can go from 0 to 60 in 60 seconds and is older then all of us! Backup will be Car Killer, which by the way has an Awsome stereo system.  The Iponator! Just a work in proces, but we can't really name Steph's car until she has one. But a thought.  Oh man! let the good times roll! For example...  Tonight, I pick up Dyllan at his place. What you wanna do I ask? How much money you got he replies. Enough. Were going go karting. After an intense 10 minutes of hard core racing, we made our way to 7-11. On our journey Dyllan comes up with this Awsome plan. Lets go visit PJ! With our stomachs full, we went to his house with a surprise, and it turned out to be a night of watching   The Last Sumurai  . I probably spelt it wrong, but what an AWSOME movie. Dyllan and I cruised back home and here I am, inspired by the warm hot summer air to write this blog. Let's Rock With Love!    It's the time of the season for loving
