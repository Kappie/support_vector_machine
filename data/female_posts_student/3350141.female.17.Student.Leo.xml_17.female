I won't be home. Don't even think about stopping by. Don't think of me at all.  I did a what I had to do. If there was a reason, it was you.  Aaah, don't even think about getting inside. Voices in my head. Ooh, voices. I got scratches all over my arms. One for each day since I fell apart.  I did, oh, what I had to do. If there was a reason it was you.  Footsteps in the hall... It was you, you. Oh, pictures on my chest... It was you. It was you...  I did a what I had to do. Oh, and if there was a reason... Oh, there wasn't no reason. no. And if there's something you'd like to do. Oh, just let me continue to blame you.  A footsteps in the hall... It was you, you. Oh, pictures on my chest... It was you, you. Oh  so later days             MEH
