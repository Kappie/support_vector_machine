"thanks" to martin who was seated beside me.. jodette even had to transfer to another seat because she's not feeling well.. redgie was in a world of his own.. he's not talking to anyone!! jodette and i wasnt in a good mood.. but right before zoo she saw her "crush" and drag me to the canteen just to get a closer glimpse.. sumakit talaga ung paa ko.. at mejo sumama na rin pakiramdam ko nun!! but i remember laughing before i went home.. when redgie blurted something about jodette leaving him after he waited for her..        passed zoology lec prelim..         you read it right.. i got 66/75!! it was quite a good grade.. im really contented.. it became my inspiration to study hard.. im really happy about that!!       bout the frog         we started coloring the skeleton of the frog.. we'll start the dissection next week.. im really anxious!! both excited and nervous.. im excited in wearing my new laboratary gown.. hehe!!!
