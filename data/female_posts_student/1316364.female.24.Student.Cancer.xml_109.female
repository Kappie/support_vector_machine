Text taken from the email that was sent to me.            "The proud warriors of Baker Company wanted to do something to pay tribute To our fallen comrades. So since we are part of the only Marine Infantry Battalion left in     Iraq     the one way that we could think of doing that is By taking a picture of Baker Company saying the way we feel. It would be awesome if you could find a way to share this with our fellow countrymen. I   was wondering if there was any way to get this into your papers to let the world know that "WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN" and are proud to serve our country." Semper Fi   1stSgt Dave Jobe            The attached photo was forwarded from one of the last     U.S.     Marine companies in     Iraq    . They would like to have it passed to as many people as possible, to let the folks back home know that they remember why they're there and that they remember those who've been lost. "
