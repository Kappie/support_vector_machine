She was just like "Lindsey, you know I'll support you in whatever you do." which I know already, but forgot, but she really does support me in whatever craziness I get myself into, except for when it comes to Ryan, then she pwns me, but that's ok, because by that time I need to diem, but other than that is very supportive and I love her to death, she's the bestest friend ever.  *Gasp* Thatwasaverylongsentence...  But she's the coolest coolest coolest THANK YOU FOR NOT BEING MAD AT ME ABBY!!!!
