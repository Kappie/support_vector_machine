But now you are mourning for someone to love, and for someone to love you. You had it all, and you threw it away. And I laugh at you. I almost have it all, I'm just waiting for the time to be just right to snag him into my love trap. We'll fall back in love together, him and I, throughout the ages, and you'll be sitting say why? Why did I throw it all away? Life's not going to well, and you're stuck for an answer. Discussions in class got you thinking, thinking damn, I had it all and I gave it away.  I'm laughing, laughing so hard. Until I myself fall down to the ground in a love shattered cloud. But I won't come crawling to you, because you gave me away.  I'm roadside trash.
