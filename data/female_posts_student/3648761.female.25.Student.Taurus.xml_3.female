I took this strength training class with Patty, OH MY GOD!! That is the best class ever, I have never done cardio and weight strengthen all my muscles in 1 hour, it was great. I would suggest everyone try it. Then I picked up my kid, and visited with my sister. I am really starting to feel this workout this mourning. It hurts just to bend my hamstring to sit. Started ordering books today for the Fall semester, it'll be here in no time. Hopefully tomorrow it will be nice so that I can go to the lake and swim a couple of miles. I should really do a mild workout after the one today.
