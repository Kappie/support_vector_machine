I feel like we go in circles round and round and round if ya get me hahaha....sooooo much effort....like im sorry for hurting u and all...i really am but i cant do anythign anymore but move on and while u cant it makes it hard ofr our friendship to try and work...so what can i do....nothing....the longer it goes like this...the more cut he gets and the more pissed off i get...so yeh thats why i am being drained by that him....{would u i care more if u cared less...the answer is yes} - = 2nd him = - well this him makes me want to go C R A Z Y haha lol....la di da di da hahaha.... u make me sooo happy but man i cant figure you out...probably why u interest me soo much...not much more i can say really about this him but as any girl who has ever liked a guy b4 (which is all of us) u all get what im saying...btw i dont want any guy telling me girls are harder to read cause the truth is at least we say how we feel and dont hide stuff...usually...but yeh....anyway haha enough about the hims..i thoguht i would put a poem in here that i wrote...kinda corney and doesnt have a title yet but yeh here it is:  Your looking at me looking at you… I’m starring at you, your eyes so true I’m looking at you looking at me… What are you wishing we could be? Is there a future for us to share? Or is a friendship all our hearts can bare. Lets take a chance and start to live, We have love only we can give. When I’m with you I’m on a cloud so high, Looking down on others, letting time pass by. It seems so easy to be with you, Like my most favourite dream, finally come true.  You’re the only one on my mind Its like our love is one of a kind.  You make me want to open my heart to see whats inside I though it locked away for good but form you I just can’t hide You’re the reason I wake up the reason I dream so true The reason why I smile each day I cant help but love you  checkyas laters ....mwa
