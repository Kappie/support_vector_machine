But I feel I owe it to the more excitable folks in the group to give a little update on the mom situation.   she was gone all afternoon, giving Devon and I time to fester. By the time she came back at 5pm to pick us up and bring us to have dinner with our uncle mike((who is not really our uncle...)), we had festered up a storm.  digression: 10 years ago Devon and I had our picture made and put on coffee mugs which were doled out to certain family members, including uncle mike, who was my grandpa's best friend, eventually adopting the title "uncle mike" by my mom as a child and then by dev and I. For the past 10 years, uncle mike has proudly drank his coffee out of that mug, then caringly washed it by hand and sat it on it's spot by the percolator. It's quite recently that we got back in touch with uncle mike, so I was quite surprised to see that mug sitting on the counter unfaded, cracked, or otherwise, most unlike the other copies of the mug that people have held onto over the years.  so there we went, dreading a meal with my mom and apprehensive about the emotional juggernaut that was bound to hit when we presented uncle mike with another mug that sported a recent picture of Devon and I and a caption reading "We Love You Uncle Mike!", which I had bought while in Dallas. Of course, he more than loved it.  after a nice but fairly sullen dinner, we went back to uncle mike's to compare the mugs. He said I looked like a young Lauren bacall:     I think his chimichanga may have gone to his head.   the ride home is where it gets bad.   for approximately one half hour, she drove us around and screamed at us. Except this time, she said it was the  fact that we never did our chores and she spent all her time and energy making us do chores  rather than us alone. For future reference, if you ever wanted to see me cry until my eyes roll back in my head, just scream at me steadily for more than 5 minutes. I hate yelling. I-HATE-YELLING. There's just something about loud voices that if you blamed me for world hunger with your voice jacked up a few levels I would probably believe you and if not, just be quite upset for quite a while.   when she finally let us out of the car dev and I were, for all intensive purposes, puddles. We ran wildly to separate bathrooms and then proceeded to wail and choke and cry unlike we have since we were four. This continued for several minutes until I hacked up my enchilada and a staggering amount of diet coke, which also quieted Devon because we had been listening to each other and she heard what she later described as "chunkies"((the two bathrooms aren't connected, but they're right next to each other)). So I sat and blubbered less violently until mammaw needed to pee, at which point I let her in and stood behind the shower curtain while she peed and I mumbled some explanation for the histrionics. Apparently mom had left as soon as we got out of the car and had gone to a hotel. So mammaw called mom and had a fight with her, which made me feel bunches better((Sarcasm)).  once mammaw hung up and stormed to the patio, I listened to Devon run water for a few minutes. At first I thought she was trying to drown herself, but I knew she was too scared. I too stared at the razor and the faucet for the longest time, considering my options, but decided against it at the last second. A while later, mammaw came and told me mom was staying out all night, so dev and I wandered out of the bathrooms, bleary eyed and exhausted. dev told me that she was going to drown herself, but instead sat in the full bath tub with her dinner clothes on for several minutes, peeing on herself in defiance and then skulking out of the tub when she considered the grossness of sitting in piss.   "I'm too lazy of a stupid ingrate to piss in the toilet!" she said.  "then I must be too lazy to digest my food!" I replied.  around 11, after Lauren had come over to stay and we had gone to the store and gotten some cheap therapy((chocolate cupcakes)), mom called and asks us what we wanted to eat. She had sobered up, realized a few things, and was on her way home. Once the message was across that nobody was hungry, we decided a midnight run to wal mart might cheer us up. Mom apologized quite profusely, saying that she had a good point, but not a good delivery, and we forgave her. I bought the Yeah Yeah Yeah's CD "Fever to Tell" and some strange looking light bulbs that emit a low green glow and make our room look like the set of a porno ((I did not intend for the end of that sentence to rhyme)).   we got back around 1:30am and Devon and Lauren passed out around 2am. I stayed up until 6, listening to "Fever to Tell" 3 times and wildly cleaning our bedroom around dev and Lauren((honestly, if you can sleep through the yeah yeah yeahs, I would be checking for a pulse))((but they did)). By the time I reached the couch, I was quite droopy.  today was much better. I slept until 1, had a waffle, got the Distiller's "Coral Fang" CD off of eBay, then had McDonalds for dinner, which is only mentionable because there is something, I believe it is a French fry, stuck in my esophagus. Actually it was there until about an hour ago when my grandmother got an inexplicable but unignorable craving for donuts. How can I resist fried dough??? I think the donut must have dislodged the french fry because I can't feel it any more.  mom has gone to a cocktail party and then to a friends, mammaw is going to bed, and I plan to have a lovely night to myself consisting of talking to pumpkin head and enjoying some tranquility.
