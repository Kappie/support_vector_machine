That's probably because its the second time I've left my house in a month, other than to go to school. It started out with me being woken up at the ridiculously early hour of 11 am by my wonderful, loving mother (cough cough bitch cough). I ate breakfast, got dressed and whatnot, then was dragged to my great aunt or something's house in Belleville for her 85th birthday... and that's quite sad considering she has outlived everyone on my mother's side of the family. You know what this means. I'm going to die soon. But anyway, there was a bunch of random people that I've either never met, or haven't seen since I was in diapers. However it was quite strange how I was the only one of my sisters that anyone recognized. I don't really look the same as I used to. They say its because I look exactly like my mom (shoot me in the face) and because I have the same personality that I had when I was little: Shy super-ADHD kid. Hey, if it makes a mark in people's memories, then I'll keep it. Its the only thing I'll ever stand out for. So this little family gathering, it was as boring as could be expected, a few verbal fights between my aunts, and me being attacked by a gang of 5-year olds. I pretty much spent the entire time sitting in the living room watching Spongebob Squarepants all day. Finally around 5 or so my mom decided it was time to leave. So after a round of hugs and kisses, we headed out only to be driven around in circles through Nutley for an hour. My mom decided to take a nice trip down memory lane. Literally. We drove passed run-down houses and abandoned factories (hey this is starting to sound like an Ataris song...) as she told us all the fantabulous things she used to do. Like sneak out and get drunk with her friends. Now why is it that I get in trouble for these things? I don't understand it. Not one bit.   Eventually the tour ended and we started out for my other aunt's house in Denville. We stayed there for an hour-ish while my mom and aunt discussed some random thing, and I entertained myself with an entire bag of chips. Then we left my aunt's house and somehow ended up at the mall. Somehow I found myself wearing a prom dress. Oh the prom shopping experience, my tulle and taffeta nightmare... I'm not a big fan of that whole thing. Oh well, after saving myself from the wrath of this long itchy tangle of fabric, I waited anxiously for my mom to do whatever it was she was doing so I could go home.   On the way home, my mom kept irritatingly turn of the radio every time she said something that no one listened to anyway, so in the most annoying voice possible I just sat there repeating "RADIO" over and over again until she turned it back on. This process was repeated every time she turned it off, and believe me, it happened a lot. I am obnoxious. I love it.   Anywho, we eventually arrived at my house, which automatically ended the chance of anything interesting from possibly occurring. End of story.
