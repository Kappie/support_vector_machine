I hope to one day be associated with such a prestigious group.  I definitely thought they were all very knowledgeable and very commendable women.  I felt so honored and inspired to be in their presence.  I will post more about it because I am just so speechless right now.  I know they probably will never come across this, but I would like to acknowledge those kind and generous ladies for their scholarship.  Getting this has made a world of difference in my path to my goals and dreams.
