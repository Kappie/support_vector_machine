Me: Well alright then, I'll have a vodka and cranberry. (ah, what the hell, my choices were limited, so I might as well go for the gold...) Bartender: Yes Miss. Me (to Steve): Doesn't the bartender look like Terence Stamp? Steve: Who? Me: Zod. Steve: Oh yeeeaaaah...  I wanted to tell Mr. Bartender to go put on some make-up and head to the Australian Outback to get me something fizzy but I didn't.(obscure Pricilla Queen of the Desert reference)  So the place was pretty frou-frou last night and totally not me, but the company was awesome and I didn't pay for the meal which also rocked!  (Thanks, GG!!)   [ Aside: How long do you think I can milk this graduation thing? I mean, it was a great achievement for me...Think I could stretch it out and get free stuff and gifts after my party next week too?!   ;-)]    Finally met my friend's wife last night and her sister.  I've heard so much about them I felt like I already knew them and they didn't disappoint.  Also met a college friend and a co-worker of his wife's who were just really great people!  A few of them work for Disney and so we all talked about their animation and all that.  It was waaaay fun!! It was also somewhat surreal, on a personal level, because I haven't seen my friend in f'in FOREVER.  Soooo much has changed since we last saw each other and our lives are so different now!  That said, it was sooo wonderful to see him again after all this time.  Sniffle.   Star Sighting Alert!  Nicole Kidman walked into the restaurant and actually smiled at us as she passed!!  Okay, I think it was due the fact that we were gawking.  She was absolutely STUNNING and very tall, actually...  I mean, she was totally done up like she just came from a movie premiere or something.  It was cool.  My friend's wife also SWORE up and down that she saw Russell Crowe later on, but none of us could vouch for it...maybe it was the wine goggles. (heh heh.)  Then her sister thought she saw Tom Cruise after Nicole left, but it turned out it was a waiter that looked like him.  Actually, our waitress looked like a mixture of Tori Amos and Cate Blanchett.  So what gives?  Maybe it was just a Nicole look-alike since the restaurant was filled with them!    Naaah, it was definitely her.  But I digress...um... where was I?  Oh yes, frickin' tired, that's where.  So yeah basically, I'm going out again tonight.  It's so weird, this me going out business.  I don't know if I like it very much.  HA!
