Anyway, to Sarah and Ash (even though I already talked to Sarah today) I hope you feel better! *hugs* Summer should be happy! (Not that we have much control over what happens, but you know what I mean. I wish it were happier for you!!)  So...my summer has been uneventful since the last time I wrote. I've been stuck at home, which means I've been doing a lot, but nothing too interesting: reading, journal-writing, listening to music, watching TV/show choir tapes (yes, I *am* a choir dork!), cleaning, etc. I did go to church and youth group on Sunday, which meant my brother and I got to drive home through the storm (but no tornadoes!). Oh boy. :-P  Needless to say, I need to get out of the house. Granted, I have several times in the future when I will be gone on trips, but in the meantime, I can't just spend all my time at home. I'm not creative enough to beat the monotony. At least I'm starting music classes at LC next week, but that still only takes up the morning. Oh well, I'll figure something out. Until then...  "Don't worry. There's more birds in the sea. Wait! I mean, fish in the sky..."
