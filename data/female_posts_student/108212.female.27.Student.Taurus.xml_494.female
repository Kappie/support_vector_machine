I think it'll be great to visit  PageResource .  I am sure you know most of the basics since you can do all the marquee and fancy images.  The best way is to look at other people's blogs so you can see how they are made. I have a number of links in my blog. Check them out! Send my love to all your bro's and sis. :)    BTW, it looks like you and April have a lot in common! :) Especially that uPpEr  LoWeR cAsE posts that you both have. :)
