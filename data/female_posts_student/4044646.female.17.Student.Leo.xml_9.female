I had no idea on what to do... luckily i was infront of the RaceTrac so i walked across the street to use the pay phone, well they didnt work so im like well shit now what so i went inside and they let me use a phone inside... so i called my mom and she called my dad... so i had to wait for about 20-30 mintues for him to show up... Then it took another 30 minutes to change the tire... so yah i was about an 1hour late to rehearsal... and so now i have 2 messed up tires from something in the road and the lovely curb which scrapped my back right tire and put a buldge in it.. so yeah this is gunna suck cause its going to be a pain trying to get back and forth to school... But on other news, im great fortunately due to my accident... sore and tired.. im just ready for this week to be over and done with, the heat mostly... *sigh* well i think im done for now.. still a lil upset from this afternoon but i'll be okay..  *Kaplooey*
