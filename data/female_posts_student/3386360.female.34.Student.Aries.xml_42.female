Today I will go and find out if the kids did what they were told to do last night if not well Travis will find my boot up his ass so to speak. Last night all hell broke loose but it is nothing compared to the shit that will happen today. Last night I got real sick, went into my room and could barely wake up let alone deal with anything. So when Travis' friend Hailey didnt have a place to stay I said they could stay at the old place tonight ONLY and it better be finished by the morning (hey I was going to clean it but was sick) then come to find out Rachael and her daughter in law had a HUGE blow up and she is sleeping on my couch. I was furious. She just moved all her crap into my house NO NOTICE. So today she and I are going to sit and have ourselves a TALK. I talked to her daughter in law last night and I was NOT thrilled at what I heard. Now I dont know her daughter in law that well but I do know when someone is telling me the truth. Rachael has been lying. So I will tell her flat out. A. she cant move in she can stay a couple of days but that is all due to CPS. B. I dont want her using my name for her shit anymore or I might simply say 'Get Out'. Depending on what happens with Travis and her additude today. I say depending on travis because IF he did what he was suppost to last night then he has a grace period of staying. If not his shit is out on the porch and there will be no coming back. Hey it's a good excuse to get him the fuck out. Lol. Maybe. Ether way I will NOT deal with Rachael for very long. I just dont need her bullshit stress. Nothing from A.C. and I'm starting to get upset. Gods Iw ish it would rain here and cear up this oppression in the weather. I'm seriously thinking of asking K to take me for a drive today so I can clear my head but knowing him he will be busy Lol. Well I'm outta here to make a call and then to go to the old place and deal..
