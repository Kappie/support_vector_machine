I was also supposed to pick up my brothers bass, which he is letting me borrow, because a friend of mine is going to teach me how to play. hey, I figure if my brother can do it (and he's quite good) then I can do it. Plus, I always wanted to be a rockstar. ;)  For many reasons I did not make the long haul to my mom's house today. Nevertheless, I am not at work, and I'm loving every minute of it!
