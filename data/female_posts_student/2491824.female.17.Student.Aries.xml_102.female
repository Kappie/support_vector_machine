Happy Birthday Justino!  ...oh, and it's one month until my birthday... wheee! Oh, and I already have birthday plans... For about 5 or 6 hours, I'll be sitting on a bus on the way back from the State Thespian Festival in Charleston! Wheee... :/  I didn't go to school today either. I could have, but didn't.  Parent-Teacher conferences are tonight, and Mom is going... I'm scared...
