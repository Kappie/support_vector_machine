Can't blame this place, everyone that's good is in the CITY... Anyways, I have a job interview next week with Panzanella, an Italian style bread and sandwich shop in town. Seems like that will be my best bet in getting a good decent summer job. As for the photo place....uhhh well...lets just say, not my type. SO i guess I can say i KNow what it feels like to not have a job and living on what I have...which is almost NOTHING...I NEED MONEY TO PAY BILLS! Hey, who doesn't right. Life is tough....hmm kinda..    Hood River is a quaint little town, where almost everyone knows everyone, business wise. This town is like the Newport of Rhode Island, except that tourist are mostly windsurfers from north south east and west are gathered here to be a bum for three whole months and eat their food from  samplers  supermarkets give out to customers....it is so true! ok I do consider at some point I am a bum right now, but I definitely do not hang out at supermarts waiting for food to be serve! hahhaahha.     I have been trying to start a photo project, I guess I can call it "Summer Life in HR". Been going pretty slow, yeah that's what I mean I am being a bum! And I do have a bit of problem trying to get my films develop, professionally, without getting wrecked at some point, which happened to me!  I will be posting those online at some point this month.
