I think I figured out that I never really did like him all that much though, because it didn't hurt me so much that he asked someone, but that there went another person that would have been fun to go with. I don't know. I feel like I'm just destined to be alone for the rest of my life. I guess I'll have to live with it. I can't let these things get me down. I have to try to be optimistic.
