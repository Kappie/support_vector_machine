I went home, had some lunch, and drove over to Big Woods park to play tennis with Erin, Moe, and Melissa. Traffic on Wilson Street was the worst I have ever seen it on the way over :P. And oh, my... I got so incredibly sunburned today; I am probably the reddest I have been all summer. We left the park at about 3:00, so that left me with about two and a half hours to get showered and do whatever before Melissa, Steph, Poawtah, Erin, Moe, Matt, Marjorie, and I headed to TGI Friday's for dinner. I drove over there with Steph and split a cheeseburger with Erin; it was pretty good. We didn't really have any plans after dinner, and Steph had to be out of her house for a good part of the night because of her mom's teen-aphobic "friend" named Ken, so we decided to have a bonfire at Marjorie's place. That was... um... interesting to say the least :P, involving "band nerd tipping" (as opposed to cow tipping). I won't go into detail, but it was lots of fun (Thanks, Marjorie!). I was supposed to leave at ten, so I did. I played the piano for a while once I got home, and that takes me up to about right now. So that was my busy day.      Last song I listened to:   Zak And Sara  by Ben Folds.   Last album I listened to:   Rockin' The Suburbs .   Last meal I ate:  Half of a cheeseburger and fries.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Yelling "step and close!" at our little bonfire when we were counting.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Watching wood and marshmallows combust and making aluminum oxide.   Last person I talked to:  Carl.   Favorite song today:   Fired  by Ben Folds.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Dinner at Friday's and the fire at Marjorie's.   Funniest thing that happened today:  Watching Poawtah laugh and laugh and laugh... As always. But it never gets old.
