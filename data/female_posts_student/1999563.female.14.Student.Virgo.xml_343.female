I was the Sheet MASSSTAAA (I always got the paper towels *smile*)  Inge was the "Ultimate Quen of the Unvierse", Eugenia was "Cheese Whiz" because she is a math whiz so we just added the cheese, and Katie was the "Super Scooper" because she scooped the salt into the jar. hahahhahaha   Then Eric gave me his SPOON!  Hhahahahhahahahahahahhahahaha  (only certain peopel will get that... *wink*)  Hahah.
