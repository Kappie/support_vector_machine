Well, just simply have this sudden urge to rattle about how much I love you Singapore, and how much I hate those Singaporeans how hate Singapore… Singapore has provided us with a very conducive environment. No to mention, we are living in a very peaceful place, where there is no war, riots, nor any prejudice or discrimination that is as serious as countries such as Afghanistan, where women have no rights. Yet, these hateful Singaporeans take them for granted.  I do admit, sometimes, the raise in taxes, the increase in transport fares are inconsiderate acts of the government, but sometimes I wonder, are these really the government’s fault to be blame? Or should we be pointing our finger at the transport companies which are monopolizing the transport market?  Well, nevertheless, I still love you Singapore!! Nothing, and nobody can stop me from loving you!!! Yeah~!!!
