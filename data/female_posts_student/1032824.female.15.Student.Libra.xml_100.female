However, I'm way too ecstatic to and I'm intoxicated with my sisters because they keep talking about it. I have no idea when is he coming back and I've gone ape! So if I happen to feel an extreme itch, I  will  not hesitate to catch the movie without waiting! But I'll trrry my very best. Haha.   On a brighter note, my parents have arrived safely! My father mentioned that it was one of my mom's elite holidays. I'm glad that they relished their stay there, because eversince my mom had stopped working at MOE and transferred herself to work as an admin manager in a school, she has been too caught up with work to even spend quality time with us. She rarely smiled, and has become so 'blur'. Now that she's back, she's all smiley smiley!  :)  Yet I'm quite sure she misses her work. She's such an efficient worker, she does her typings on the computer at home and revises her 'homework' as well. I am so proud of her. Oh yes! My mom and dad bought us such adorable keychains for our mobiles, and also bought other stuff such as handphone pouches, scarves, winter clothing,  bracelets  and handbags. And it's amazing, the stories they've related. Life at the moment is so fulfilling.  I am learning , to be grateful for all the things in life. It means to be thankful and express admiration... It also means to grow or appreciate in value. As you  appreciate life , you become more valuable, both to yourself and others.
