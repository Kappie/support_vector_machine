Tomorrow, I have to give a powerpoint presentation of my summer research project to a group of other medical students who have received the same research grant. I absolutely hate giving presentations. I am totally the type of person that dislikes getting up in front of a group of people and talking. Hell, in high school, I even refused to talk in class even though it cost me participation points and dragged down my overall grade.  But, the day has come. I have spent the past hour or so practicing my presentation, so that I don't sound like a complete idiot tomorrow. I suppose I will practice again tomorrow, just in case. What makes matters worse, or interesting, rather, is that my boss/mentor might be there when I make my presentation. On Sunday, I sent him a copy of my slides, so that he could look it over and give me recommendations and corrections. He told me that my slides looked excellent, gave me a few tips, and then asked when and where I would be presenting, because he wanted to come. If he doesn't have to be in the OR, that is.   I am flattered that he is so supportive. I don't recall any other mentors coming to their students' presentations. But, this does make me extra nervous. Hopefully, things will go well. Wish me luck.
