But for others who havent... my name is Velly. I’m a 17 years old girl and i live in Indonesia at this moment. I’ve just been graduated from my senior high school this year and i’ll take my bachelor degree on september. I joined accelerate class in my senior high therefore i needed only two years to finish my study in senior high, whereas other students got to do 3 years studying in senior high before they go to university. So many people think dat i’m greatly clever when they know i joined the accelerate class... well, i just can tell ya that i was just very LUCKY :) end of statement... he he. Cant hide dat i’m pretty proud with all those stuffs though... :D   for my family... här er min dagbok... hoppas du all vilja bli mer förstå jag och tack själv så mycket för varelse alltid nära till jag när jag er i behov. Jag älska du all.  and for my beloved cousin, Luucas... Bättre börja din svensk lektionen nu! Kom i gång , Kompis! Jag tänka du er den bara svensk vem icke tala svensk!
