And when I woke it was light, gorgeous sun streaming into the world. Funny, that I am so moon touched, and so sun grateful. Its a dichotomy I choose to ignore in me.  I am abandoning this town today, in favor of a plane ticket and some change, but I'll be back, return with a little flush in my cheeks I hope.  Along with this town I plan to abandon any baggage which has chosen to cling in these last few months thinking in particular about a long train of thought missing some cars  Not much of a post, but that's it for now I suppose.  Peace and well rested heavy eyelids.
