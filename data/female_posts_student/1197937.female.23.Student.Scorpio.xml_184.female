( urlLink listen  /  urlLink lyrics )  another artist to check out:      if you think i ought to be rewarded for all this free promotion, please make a check out to the laura-wanna-fly-to-chicago-for-a-taping-of-the-oprah-winfrey-show foundation.  yesterday, i purchased my first snowboarding outfit. i live by the theory that if you wanna be good at something, you gotta look the part first. the thing is, when i came home from the store, i discovered that the clerk had accidentally given me TWO of the $200 burton jacket that i bought. hm...what would william hung do in a befuddling case such as this?   i doubt that he'd consider e-baying it...  okay, my computer is doing very weird things that me no like. goodbye.
