Jesse ended up being a not so good thing tho.   Ok, my insecurity about Furby is that he won't like me after he meets me in person. I also had a couple dreams, like he met Amanda, saw how beautiful she was, and then totally ditched me for her. I cried sooooo much. I've been crying recently and it REALLY sucks. This one song that I have really reminds me of him. New Found Glory "Story so Far" I can't listen to that song anymore without thinking of him and getting all choked up.                                       ::cry::           I know I know, I'm pathetic.  Really really pathetic.            I'm gonna end it here now.
