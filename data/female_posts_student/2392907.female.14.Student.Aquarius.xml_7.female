So she walks.   OK. I am gonna kill Malpreet.  She stops walking.  Wait, why should I? She's the one who hasn't done anything. And really, Adam hasn't done much either. Because I've been doing the same with Ryan. Well... we aren't really making out but..  OK, so just relax. That incident in the loos.. That was nothing. Nothing to worry about. What am I doing, thinking about it??? It was perfectly normal. Normal normal normal for a guy like Adam to get off with some girl at a partay. Because any normal guy would do that. He's normal. If he didn't he wouldn't be normal. And that wouldn't be good would it? People should be normal. OK, stop thinking about normal. Is it even normal to think about being normal??
