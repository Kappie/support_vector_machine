She is the third beautiful baby in the world. They named her Peyton Ryan. Now that the birth is over I can go run tonight to make sure I get my 4 run week in.   Tuesday's run. I decided to take off from my house instead of driving somewhere. I mapped out a few routes the night before using my mom's tripodometer (every car NEEDS one). I ran a 5.0 mileroute with a few hills. I didn't bring water and it was HOT out. I didn't wait till the evening like I usually do in the summer. Luckily I put a 20.00 dollar bill in my key holder and remembered as I past by a 7-11 store. I was dying in the heat by the time I got half way. I trudged on through and finished the run.   I learned my lesson to run either in the morning or in the evening. I seem to be able to run further and better when its not so hot.   See it, Feel it, Trust it!
