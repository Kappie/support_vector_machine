This blows.  Blah blah blah blah blah anyways I got very very drunk last night.  And then I started throwing things?  Don't ask me why, I'm telling you, I've never acted like that when I'm drunk.  Must be the meds.  And when I woke up this morning I threw up and my whole body of course aches sooooooooo bad because of my Actonel. Damn you Actonel and your pain inducing power.  So I was 2 hours late to work, but only because I called in around 8 and Sherry said I could come in at 10. Then I left early too. Amen.  Je ne me sens pas bien.  I'm getting really really really really really sad lately. Like this Zoloft doesn't do shit. In fact it really just blows. I just...don't give a fuck anymore.  I am going downhill. I'm such a wasteland.  Okay okay.  Leaving Friday.  Tomorrow I meet this lady about some job opportunity she wants to offer me?  I have no idea who she is or what it's about...but...okay?  7 pm. Can't forget.  I need to wash my car really bad. It's awful and crazy. Rofl. Yup.  Okay boys, that's it for now.  carefully fall apart, crazies.
