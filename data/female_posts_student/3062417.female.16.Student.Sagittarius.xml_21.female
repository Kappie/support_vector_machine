Bet you can't guess what I was thinking about. Yea, that's right, you guessed it, it's Gavin. I really hope he doesn't read this thing. Well, anyways, I was thinking about how much I miss him and how I would give anything to have him back and I realized I don't miss the person he is now, I miss the person he was when we first started going out. I still love the hell outa him but I don't miss the person he has become. Well, that's it for now. More later maybe.  NO Song
