Well, I knew this was coming, because this weekend is even more overloaded with stuff she has to do than one of her average weekends.  I know she has lots of stuff to do every day, I just can't recall what any of it is.  I could never cut it as her personal secretary.  Not only can't I remember her dates and appointments, but I also can't pull off a good look in a miniskirt and heels.  Damn my husky build.  Work was decent last night, even though I was swamped for a good stretch of it because we had entertainment.  (By the way, for the occasional stranger who may come across this blog, I'm employed in a bookstore cafe in the suburbs of Chicago.)  It was just a girl and her guitar last night, which I always prefer to some 6-piece outfit trying to cram their way into our place and then proceeding to blast everyone out of the store with their wall of sound.  She's been in our place before, and she's pretty dang good.  She did a lot of stuff she's done in previous shows, but last night she also did a cover of "Your Mistake" by Sister Hazel, a song which is a personal fave.  On the downside last night, I didn't get to go wall-climbing with my friend Katrina like we were hoping to.  Three people called off, so we couldn't align our breaks and head over to Galyan's.  Don't worry though, when we finally get around to doing it, I'll be sure to post all of the public humiliation that will undoubtedly result from me attempting an athletic endeavor.  Well, that's all from me for now.  I've gotta write some more code and swear at my computer while it gets all twitchy with what I'm trying to upload, and then it's off for the always-unpleasant midshift at work.  Until next time...
