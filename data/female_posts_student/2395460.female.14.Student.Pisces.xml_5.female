If you've been in an arcade in the last two years or seen  Lost In Translation , you've seen those dancing fools going crazy trying to keep the beat with on screen dance-off opponents.  Maybe it looks silly if you're as arrhythmic as I am, but it turns out, people who are addicted to  urlLink Dance Dance Revolution   are getting a serious workout. It makes sense, since the game gets faster and more intricate as you get better.   Check out some of the personal stories of people who've slimmed down on  urlLink GETUPMOVE . Matt Keene says he's   urlLink lost 150 lbs.  playing DDR.   DDR is available for XBOX and PS2 for about $40 and the dance pads (also about $40) and other accessories are available at  urlLink DDRFreak . The newest version of the game,  urlLink DanceDanceRevolution Ultra Mix2 , will be available later this year from Konami Arts.  Read more  urlLink here  .
