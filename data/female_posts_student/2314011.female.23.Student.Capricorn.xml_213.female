       
      And the Seattle weather that wasn't there when we were followed us home.  Even though I miss the good ol' house-rocking T-storms of Poky, Moscow definitely has the apocalyptic-cloud-thing going.  The wind's picking up as the day turns dark and I hope I'll get through this post in one piece.  Just heating up the remainder of the Boy's impromptu Vegetable-Beef-soup-turned-Pasta-Stew and surveying the too-empty apartment.  Should balance the checkbook, put the extra blankets and pillows away, finish arranging the new wall decorations and vacuum.  But I won't.  Have just enough energy to eat dinner, put on some new mixes, burn a thank-you CD for our lovely hosts, tell the story of the weekend and call it a night.    So the Boy and I have reached the point where we know what we want to do, where we want to go, etc. in our city.  Every visit feels less like a vacation and more like a return to something very familiar and deeply missed.  The transition time between the initial gasps of child-like wonder and squeals of "We're  here !" and easing into the city we hope to one day call home is growing shorter.    Thus, we spent the first evening reconnecting.  At first with the skyline, skinny sidestreets and Broadway; later with old friends, even though it was a first meeting for some of us and a much-overdue reunion for others.   urlLink The General  (Laura) and her  urlLink Boy  (Brandon) met us for remnants of our Thai food and  urlLink the soon-to-be Driver  (Jen) followed soon after.  The Boy and I were looking forward to kicking off the festivities with a few laid back beers at the Wild Rose, the dykiest bar west of the Cascades.  But the $8 cover charge changed things and our group headed back down Pike street to the sleek, chic Manray (read: opposite of the Rose).  We found wall-to-wall well-dressed fags and the long-lost gay thump and it felt like coming home.  We bonded over too many drinks, unattainable but hopeful goals (four-somes, being forced to turn down three numbers because of the winner in the back pocket, etc.) for the next three days and fondling strangers.   urlLink Just Jack in the Big Easy  even stopped by for a few minutes.  It felt like old times at Shermer's with the Argonaut crew, only this time we were older, wiser, hotter, gayer and on top of our respective games.  And we had the entire weekend (not to mention the rest of our lives) ahead of us.  The Boy and I were left to our own devices Friday and we had new sights to see.  First stop was the new branch of the  urlLink Seattle Public Library .  We watched in awe last summer as the skeleton emerged from the mess of steel and insulation.  We stood speechless this summer inside looking out on the gorgeous, clear summer day shining in through the ceilings and walls, drooling over the slanted stacks with rubber call numbers on the floor, imagining taking Sunday worship in its reading rooms.    Such a temple could only be followed by the Elliot Bay Bookstore, a staple we've somehow managed to overlook until this trip.  It's the omega of independently-owned bookstores, something Seattle manages to do well without trying.  It lived up to the hype, with its hardwood floors, walls, and shelves, unending levels, rooms and rows of books, and incredibly eclectic selection.  Leaving emptyhanded felt dirty and wrong, but I was not about to force finding the trip's signature book.  Levi found more than enough loot, on the other hand, bringing his total for his trip into the double-digits.  Took a rest on the pier and wished it could be 3 p.m. Friday forever.    Stopped by our favorite comics store in Pike's Market before heading back to the hotel to prepare for the big night ahead.  A lazy drive back to Capitol Hill and a stop by the Pussy Bookstore later found us at the Broadway Grill for dinner where new big stories were told and old ones were remembered.  Wanted to give the Rose another chance, but the $2 increase in cover charge killed that idea.    Made it to R Place just in time to escape its $4 cover (suck on that, lezzies!) and began drinking what became a river of vodka while catching up on our gay dance fave videos before heading upstairs to the dancefloor.  It's a good thing we had a Vanilla (vodka) Coke and two Vodka Tonics in us each, as they were the only things keeping us going while the DJ played hip hop after rap after R song.  Not that there's anything wrong with that type of music, but we came for the cheezy, light, peppy, downright GAY music!  All we're asking for is some Madonna, people; maybe some Pink and No Doubt on the side, Kylie, Bonnie Tyler, ABBA, something.  And what the fuck is the deal with last call at 120 on Pride Friday?  I'm seriously, you guys.  But the greasy pepperoni pizza from the closet across the street made up for the night's shortcomings.  Oh, and scoring an empty Absolut bottle from a Dumpster on the way back to Harley.  Hmm...still need to get that out of my car.  Started Saturday with coffee and donuts before meeting the party-planning crew for lunch at their favorite Asian-cuisine establishment.  The curry was divine and we swapped Mom Stories as the Immaculate Collection made its second pass on 'repeat'.  The fivesome decided to split up for the rest of the afternoon, but made arrangements for gay bingo and a barbershop opening later.  Levi and I made it to our last favorite bookstore, where I finally cleaned up...scoring not one but three books to commemorate the occasion.  YAY (times three)! As the coffee shop next door (where God was last spotted) met its demise in our absence, we made do with a new favorite for our routine fondling and petting of the new acquisitions.    Gay Bingo was tossed over for pizza and Trivial Pursuit, which ended in a stale-mate between the genders.  Meeting Wyatt at the Barber opening later completed the Argonaut circle and I couldn't help remembering the pained look on his face as he tried to swallow his first shot as he stood before me, shmoozing away and drinking like a hot gay fish.    There's just something about sitting on an open patio at the corner of Denny and Bellevue with a perfect gang of favorite people, watching the sun set over the Pacific, telling stories of the hottest and most interesting sex we've had (not necessarily at the same time), with the waxing moon watching over us and the skyline that makes a girl smile.  The night proceeded back to R Place where the music was the same and the patrons were still smashed.    Managed to make it to the girls' place the next morning for the infamous pre-Pride Parade party and ditched it in time to see the roaring Dykes on Bikes who kicked off said parade.  Some of the novelty and much of the free shit (beads, cool stickers, etc.) had evaporated in the time between this and our first parade, but I still got misty when the PLFAG parents walked by.  And there's something to be said for getting a sunburn in Seattle.    The rest of the afternoon found me watching the clock, partly because I knew the longer we stayed meant the later we'd arrive back in Moscow and mostly because I kept hoping it would say something other than it was time to go.  But the day finally got away from us all and before our three hosts collapsed for the afternoon, they saw us off in our bargain parking lot.  Leaving the city gets more difficult every time.  The pouting and chest tightening starts earlier.  The "I hate when things are over/I always cry at endings" feeling sinks deeper.  And then there's the trying to get out of the damn place.  For two years in a row now, it hasn't let us go without a fight, as though we have the strength to pull away.  This time, I-5 thought it would be fun to hide from us.    Took about half an hour on the road to realize there would be no return to work Monday and the day off was the perfect ending to the adventure.  We spent it on the futon with books and conversation, at the Grind with books and more conversation, and on the futon again with AbFab and Scarlet.  The return to reality was hard, but playing the new mixes helped tremendously, as did a yoga session of long-lost stretches.  Hadn't done any poses since Friday night in the back end of the Pussy Bookstore and tonight marks the one-year anniversary of my first class.  Good times.    Now sleep is calling and I don't want to pull myself away from the memories of the last few days.  Maybe I'll bring my new books to bed with me like I used to do with Curious George and Sesame Street.
