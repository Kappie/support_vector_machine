Their company is sooo rich....they gave us prizes, free t-shirts, caps, candy, breakfast, lunch and a kit with a pen and tons of papers about how to go to an interview and type resume.  I helped stuff envelopes with cheques for my aunt.  The company doesnt seem very careful of where it puts its money.  There are 42 different departments.  Each meeting, the company gives out free food and stuff.  Wow...they also invite kids to their offices for Christmas and give out tons of gifts.  Last year, i got a portable radio/phone.
