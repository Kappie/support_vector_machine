What's the point of life in general when its just depression and broken hearts? What's the point in making friends and lovers when they just are bound to hurt you and bring you down at some point? What's the point in comforting another when you are just shunned when its your turn for vulnerability? What's the point in giving someone a chance to come around when you just sit there growing hurt as you watch the clock tick on by? I'm almost learning a life's lesson here actually....Do not show or express love to another until you are sickly and crazily positive that the feeling is mutual. What's the point in doing otherwise when you in the end wind up hurt and have no legitimate answers?:( what's the point in trying to fix something when it apparently doesn't want to be fixed? Its hard watching something that you know is so huge and beautiful..Crumble to ash. Am I the only one who wants to succeed? Am I the only one who loves w/ their whole heart? Am I the only one who is still gonna care just as much as the beginning, when the end appears? I am tired of hurting..Tired of wondering what's up..Tired of wishing things had never changed..Yet needing to know why they did. I am not stupid here..I see what's gonna happen, I'm just waiting feeling empty as hell:( I don't deserve this..Why doesn't anyone like me gd:( no one can have anything good with me..Or if they do they freak out and cant handle it:( this sucks..Feeling like you are worth shit Sucks:( having the one you love just want to hide from you and brush things under the rug, just kills. Excuse me for wanting answers and wanting things to be good. What's the point in giving my love when its practically handed right back to me, back in my very own hands:(:( its funny..you can think all you want about how people feel for you..Yet its their actions in times of need and repair that true feelings arise for all to see. What's the point in anything....Anymore :( good things never last..They might indeed stay true but some people cant handle a good thing. Well, when they want it..Will it be there? cuz I want it right now and previous times before but does it seem as if I have gotten such a thing?? No:( of course not. LOL I am so crazy for thinking anything good that involves me stays good. Everything I touch I apparently love to the death..kinda like squeezing a hamster too death..Your intentions aren't to kill just to fill w/ love:(
