I turned quickly hoping to dear God that there weren’t pigs flying in my house, I just wasn’t ready for that. Unfortunately what I saw was much worse. The two girls who had tormented me most in elementary and middle school were sitting on my couch.  Hilary, the shorter rounder girl, somewhat resembled a pig with bleach blonde hair. She had tanned herself to the brink of bacon, and it was her I heard squealing. She was wearing a mini skirt, and a shirt much to tight for her. It was hard to believe her when she claimed she was just “big boned.” That girl was down right porky, and there was no denying it.  Cassandra had been the one to make Hilary laugh. She was tall, gangly, and looked much like a tall grasshopper with freckles and light red hair. She had tried to bleach it out, but to no avail, that girl’s stringy red locks shone right through all the dyes. She sat with her arms crooked at her sides, making it look as if she was ready to hop off at any moment. Which was exactly what she did when she noticed me.  “What are you doing here?” She demanded. I stared at her like she was nuts. “Answer me!”  “I live here. What are you doing here?” I challenged. “I don’t know if Jack told you, but the party must stay on his side of the fence, you need to get out of my house. Now.”  “Stupid, we know you live here,” Hilary said callously. “We live here too. Cass meant what are you doing out of your room. You’re not supposed to be out here if mother’s not home,” I froze. Had by some horrible twist of fate had my dream landed me as sisters with these to witches. I wanted to kill them both. I imagined running a knife clear through the fleshy skin above Hilary’s knee, and then right through Cass’s stomach.  “You bitch!” Cass screamed at me, “How dare you! Mother’ll have your head!” My mouth dropped open. “That’s right, I know what you’re thinking, don’t think we don’t. So go back up stairs and lock your door. If you even try to hurt us, Mother will kill you.”  “I’m not going back to my room, and the both of you are getting out of my house,” For just a moment Hilary scrunched up her face, and a snout popped right out of where her nose had been; then it was gone. Her hand flew to her face to see if what I saw was true.  “Liar. Go upstairs.” She stood up and flounced right up next to Cassandra, who was hunched over, her skin was flickering green. Both were glaring at me.  “Get out!” I shouted, the house shook, and Hilary fell on the floor. She squealed and shook her hands and feet flailing in the air while she tried to get up. For a moment her feet looked like a pigs. I laughed.  “Shut up!” Cassandra shot at me. Her skin was now a permanent green.  “Get up, Pig, and get out.” Hilary sat up and glared at me. Then she noticed her feet.  “Ah, ah, ah…Cassandra, get them off me! Look what she’s done! Help me,” and then she saw her sister. “Oh my god! You’re turning into a bug!” Hilary scooted across the floor as quickly as she could to get away from her. Cassandra rushed to the nearest mirror.  “What did you do to us?” She bellowed.  “I didn’t do anything!” Wings began slowly sprouting out of her back. Hilary’s snout was now stuck. She was squealing more than ever, she kicked her poor little piggy feet in an effort to make them disappear. I couldn’t decide whether she was more afraid of herself or Cassandra. Cassandra was tearing at her wings with her hands which were slowly becoming permanently bent into the forearms of a grasshopper. Suddenly I couldn’t help it, and I began to laugh.  “If you don’t turn us back…” Cassandra trailed off, all she could do know was make chirping noises with the backs of her legs, and she was doing so furiously trying to convey her message. I was laughing even harder.  “Help me, please. Somebody help.” Hilary was crying, her body was still intact, but her face had completely changed. It still looked like her, but a little less burnt, and without all the hair. “I’m sorry,” she sobbed. I stopped laughing and stared at the two. Both were helpless. Cassandra’s head and neck stuck onto the body of a grasshopper. I stared at them for a long time. Cassandra furiously rubbing her back two legs together, and Hilary holding her piggy face in her piggy hands squealing and crying. It felt good to see the two of them hurt like they had hurt me in the past, but I was still upset for them.  Finally I turned away, I didn’t want to feel pity for them. They were evil, and I never wanted to feel any emotion towards them. So I left hoping that I wouldn’t have to deal with them again. It was hard enough just trying to convince myself this was a dream without the two of them causing problems.
