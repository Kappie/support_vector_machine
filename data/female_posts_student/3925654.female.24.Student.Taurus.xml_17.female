No, we didn't spend the remainder of the afternoon milking cows or harvesting corn. Instead we patronized the small store the owners have set up there, where they sell fruit, vegetables, and apparently some pretty special  urlLink chicken .  We bought a couple enormous tomatoes, an onion, a few apples, some fresh mozzerella, and a homemade ginger molasses cookie. Baker bought the cookie, but I had a taste and I must say it was delicious, probably because it was baked there that morning. The tomatoes may have come from New Jersey, though.  Anyway, the atmosphere was very rustic and farm-like. The experience of shopping there was reminiscent of the old Four Seasons, that great store we used to have in Darien. Or Morning Glory Farm on Martha's Vineyard. So even if the produce is shipped in from Mexico or New Jersey or wherever, it makes you feel like what you're buying is so much more fresh than what'd you get in the grocery store. And that makes it all worth it.
