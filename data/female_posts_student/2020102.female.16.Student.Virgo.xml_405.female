Anyway, here are the lyrics:  I believe when they put her in the ground I think they buried part of me Cause I’ve been searching I’ve been looking all around But I cannot find the heart of me The heart of me  So I put my fingers in this soil upon her grave And I will plant for her a garden And every flower a reminder of her face Will grow up graceful as a pardon  And all that grows is her story told As life unfolds here before us The peace I’ve found in this broken ground I can see her in the harvest Of all that I have sown  And long before I was covered up in grey Before the old had bent my bones We grow our children in the red Georgia clay They were our garden and our home  And that grows is our story told As life unfolds here before us The peace we’ve found in that broken ground I can see them in the harvest Of all that I have sown  And when my life is done I pray the kingdom come Take me to glory And its living inside me It was planted like a seed All to tell a story  And I believe when they put me in the ground There will remain a part of me Cause I’ve been searching And the joy that I have found Is living in my family It’s all that I have sown  It's a very pretty song. At the concert, he told everyone that he wrote it about his grandfather after he died. Or maybe it was right before, I can't remember. Anyway, I was listening to that song, and I guess I didn't really realize it the first forty times I've listened to it, but it just sort of sunk in that that's the kind of legacy I want to have, and whether I think it's likely or not, I will get married and have the chance to have that legacy. I've always had the knowledge that yeah, SOMEDAY I'll get a boyfriend, I'm not going to die alone, probably, but it always seemed so far away. But I'm almost seventeen, my birthday is the beginning of September, and back in "the day" of like, the Roman Empire, people got married when they were like twelve. So I'm already really behind!   No, not really. But in a year I'll almost be old enough to get married. I'll be gearing up for my senior year of high school and almost eighteen, and even though I fully intend to finish high school and go to college somplace, I don't hold it completely out of the question for me to meet or start dating someone I already know and then marry him right out of high school. Jen graduated last year and now she's engaged... I remember thinking it really strange to know that this girl who was running around in a Braveheart costume and a painted face on Field Day of my freshman year and living it up as a senior, this girl who would come up and try to shove me in my locker even though I'm several inches taller than her, this girl who would run up and talk to me whenever she saw me after Seminar since hers was two doors down from mine is getting married. She's only three years older than me. I'm not sure how old Josh is but it doesn't matter - you can tell how much they love each other. And it's sort of hitting me how badly I  want  that, because it's a chance to start off a process of changing people's lives, if that makes sense. You're starting a new life. You're making a huge committment to another person. You're promising to be there through everything that gets thrown at you. You're having kids, making decisions for their future, you're helping them grow up, you're God's tool to shape their lives. Hopefully they are making friends, they're impacting other people's lives, they're becoming adults, they're getting married, they're having their own kids... there are family reunions, holiday get-togethers, cousins rolling around on the floor eating crayons with each other... or maybe I'm just remembering my own early childhood. But I'm also remembering how much fun it was. Back then, I didn't know any better, and neither did they, so their parents' issues with my parents weren't our problem. We didn't care that in a few years, my mom would start sending my sister and me to public school even though my aunt was absolutely adamant for us to be homeschooled like her kids, because apparently, that was the ONLY way for us to get a good education. It just didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was that we were happy now, and we were having fun right then. And for a five year old, that's okay. We didn't have to worry about anything yet. We just played house, or guessing games, or Reader Rabbit on the computer, and watched Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego and Veggie Tales on my grandparents' big screen TV.   There were so many of us in Texas that there was a birthday practically every other week, and we lived close enough to my grandparents that whenever we were driving anywhere, my sister or I would always ask "can we go to Ama's house?" And usually, the answer was yes. Now, they live in Colorado Springs, which is about an hour away from us. I was hoping that, when they were moving here, they would live down the street or something, so that now that I'm old enough to take care of myself in most ways, I could just walk over and see them. But I can't exactly walk to Colorado Springs. I also can't just randomly pop over and say hi for ten minutes. I really wanted that.   Maybe what I really want is to give someone who is just a twinkle in someone else's eye all the things I wish I had right now. Like... going over to see my grandmother randomly at three in the afternoon and being able to get AWAY from the rest of my family instead of being stuck with them in the car for the hour trip there and the hour trip back. Or the happy environment I never understood when my dad and my granddad and all my uncles would sit in the living room and watch the Cowboys lose, again. (Of course, for my kids and nephews and nieces, it won't be the Cowboys. It will be the Avs. And they won't be losing.) Or the excitement I always felt when I knew I was going to get to spend a special night over at Ama's house with my Aunt Katie, who was still in high school when I was born and would take me to get snow cones every single time we "hung out" and one time she even pointed out one of her ex-boyfriends to me in the grocery store and told me not to mention him to my grandparents because "they don't like him very much." (I of course never told.) Or the somewhat interesting experience of prying crayons from a toddler's spit-covered hand after they had been slobbering all over it, wondering if it tasted the way it looked, and the laughter at the expression that graced their faces when they found out that it didn't.   And I'm thinking, is there anyone I could see myself spending my life with, who will be reminded of me when he looks at flowers, who loves me so much that he's not afraid to admit that a part of him died with me? It sort of blows me away that that's possible. I was watching the coverage of President Reagan's funeral. I was crying when they gave the flag to Mrs. Reagan... it was like that was the final confirmation for her that he was really gone. When she went up to his casket and put her head down on it... it was just so... real. You could just see how much she loved him. I want that kind of love. Maybe this sounds morbid, but I really want to be able to honestly cry my brains out at my husband's funeral, assuming he dies first, because I won't be able to remember what it was like without him. Or if I die first, which I'm not ruling out because that would be stupid of me, when I'm in the hospital hooked up to a million tubes and he's sitting there holding my hand and looking desperate, I want to be able to tell him that I had fun. It wouldn't have been without him. And that it's not really goodbye. I'd probably be seeing him in a few years anyway, assuming I'm not hooked up to a million tubes for some reason other than dying of old age.   It might seem silly to someone (like my 12 year old cousin who has already had four "boyfriends" - be assured that I refuse to let THAT aspect of childhood into at least my OWN kids' lives, I wasn't allowed to date until I was sixteen and they won't be allowed to either) that I haven't had a boyfriend yet, and I haven't even been aware of a guy that likes me as more than a friend, but I guess I've somehow always sort of known that someday I'm going to have that. Even if other people say things that or I make myself feel ugly and fat and retarded. Some guy out there isn't going to see that, and the ones that do aren't worth it. He could come along tomorrow or I might have to wait a while longer. But just the fact that he's out there is enough for me to go on when it comes to guys, for now.
