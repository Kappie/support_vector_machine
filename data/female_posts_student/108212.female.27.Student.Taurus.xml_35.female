For a while, we were buying up movies all over the place - but they really need to be   re  watchable.  We've got a bunch of stuff we'll probably never watch again:   Bird on the Wire  Vacation  His Girl Friday  Liebestraume  The Fisher King   etc.   All the stuff we bought this time hits the rewatch mark.  And  Fantasia 2000 , though not as good as the 1940 one, is certainly one worth seeing a few times.   Crouching , though?  Probably not.  Daf
