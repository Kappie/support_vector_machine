I am sort of turning into the way i used to be- and lately ive been SOOOO afraid of being abandoned... i dont even know why. the alice thing? maybe she sucked all my self-esteem out of me like tad is doing to her. but im just really scared that like.. all the people i love will spontaneously decide that im stupid/fat/annoying/whatever and just abandon me. which is insane and stupid...i wish i could just tell my brain to shut up. i am also really dissatisfied with boulder. i want to go on a vacation with dylan. boulder is like... this town where a whole bunch of hippies suddenly got a bunch of money and then it all went horribly horribly wrong... but its not so bad, i guess. i would just rather be somewhere else, as always... i really want to go to santa cruz with dylan.  i had a really good weekend, though... i went to glenwood springs with jessie which was fun. i smoked opium for the first time, which was cool. im soooooo sore from snowboarding 2 days in a row, and when i got back i smelled like eggs from the hot springs. oh god! i put myself in a swimsuit and realized how incredibly fucking white i am!!!! i want to go somewhere and fix that. i really want there to be no school. my birthday is in 8 days! yay! i'm excited. This year im going to have an awesome, kickass birthday. cause every year my birthday sucks, and this year im going to make up for it. plus, i have dylan... he's so wonderful...hes making all these plans, and its cute. He loves me :)  my kitten is so goddamn cute.  my mom bought me all this makeup today cause "i need to be more girly." so maybe ill wear it, who knows. she got me eyeshadow, mascara, lip stuff, the whole shebang (shabang? shibang? who the hell made up that expression anyways?).  i'm going to be a nanny this summer! for these disgusting little kids, but oh well, im going to make so much money, i can get a car and drive to see dylan every day! whee! oh god, its 11:30... i better go to bed, i have to get up all ass early tomorrow and go to school. poo...
