We also drank some unbelievable spanish liquer if thats how you spell it, which was very unbelievable, and also very nice. then we went to the field and sat around, discussing all kinds of things. Would write more, but it's just possible that my heart is fucked, so I wont. (only joking, I think its my lungs actually.) Here is a gd quote. Rob: Bring me something sweet and alcoholic. Bri: Me?
