I hope my child will grow up to be just like him.  Anyway, back to the inspirational.   "Who wants to see Lil' John and Barry Manilow collaborate (because they both have cool hair( i.e.  urlLink awesomeness A  and  urlLink awesomeness B )  ).

The ingenious last line to my poem, wow, i can tell I'm going to fail this class already.
