Wonderland tomorrow! Yayness! ^^ Can't wait! Bethel! YayzZ~! I miss Will a little... (don't worry Nima, he's just a really good friend of mine~ besides, he's too old for me haha!!!) We have our little talks once in a while. The man in the white cap! ^^ Anyways... Yeah... I miss Nima.  Ohh you know what? My mom likes Nima... as in approves of him! Yayness! HahazZ~ She's actually okay with us going places and stuff... Usually she doesn't like me hugging people (guys, not girls) but she seems to have accepted the fact that I grew up in Canada and that I'm not a Chinesey person where guys and girls hugging isn't "good" at our age. It's supposedly disgraceful. -__-" Riiight. Anyways... she's okay with it so yay! ^^ I'm glad my mom's okay with it! But my dad isn't. -__-" Gayness.  *sighzZ* Blahness... I miss Nima. :( I wish I could give him a hug before I go to bed or whenever. I wanna see him. I miss him like hell! Ahhh! I'm gonna diiieee! Haha! At least I'll see him tomorrow! I'll wake up, get dressed, put on my usual eye make-up (can't go places without the basic stuff) and then microwave some sheperd's pie from Shneiders... then we'll go pick 'em up! Yayness! ^^   Hopefully, we'll be there by 12? Picking them up at 11:30pm. Hmm, I usually wake up around 11-ish! Muahahahaz~ Lazyness! *yawnzZ* A little tired... blah... I'll go to bed later... not now...
