One of them gave me a stuffed Tazmanian Devil. ^_^  Oh - and this was wonderful! - some girl was wearing a shirt that said, "Guys make  nice  pets".  Suffice to say the boys teased me  . . .about a lot of things, actually, but finally we all managed to agree that  my  girlfriends were cuter than theirs.  (Dollface and LadyN., that one's for you. ^_~  XOXO)  Conrad will like this - the ticket for the safari said, "Monkeys  WILL  Cause Damage".  Other than that, life goes on.  Dollface is absolutely wonderful - my other favorite lesbian lover (I really am saying this too much, one of you is going to hunt me down and kill me eventually. ^_^)  *sighs*  And you know what?  Softball coach was right - men aren't worth it . . .we really all *should* be lesbian.  Stupid propagation of humanity and all that.
