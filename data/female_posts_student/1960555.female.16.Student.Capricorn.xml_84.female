You must make sure that before you take any steps towards asking a guy out that you concider the rule "Chicks before Dicks".  Now in typical Amanda fashion, I must once again question this rule.  Do I check with just my closest friends, or all of them.  Do I have to check with my "in class" friends as well as my good aquatences?  Where does it end?  When does it finally become okay to inadvertantly hurt someones feelings?  Why isn't a fend for yourself kinda thing?  And why does this rule apply at all?  If your friend had a chance with this guy in the first place, wouldn't he have asked her out already, or shouldn't she have asked him?  Why does this stupid circle continue to go around!    Should I tell him how I feel, or should I try and concider everyones feelings?  Can I just... think about myself first for once...  A wise man once said, "It is easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission."
