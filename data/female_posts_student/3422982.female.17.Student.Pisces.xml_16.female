They said they could take the bands off, but they couldn't put them back on because they might use a different proceedure than my ortho. They also said I couldn't leave the bands on like they were either because of the way they were jamming my gums I could end up with an infection. And as sensitive as my gums are already I was not looking foreward to that, so I let them take 'em out. Much blood... But at least my mouth no longer hurts. They said if worst comes to worst, my ortho. will just have to put spacers in those spots so they can replace the bands. I can only pray that those teeth don't move, but with my luck they will and I'll end up with another month of braces. Fuckers. Dad's working everyday until we leave. So Cody and I have full control of the tv, it's very nice. Well, that's all. later dayz
