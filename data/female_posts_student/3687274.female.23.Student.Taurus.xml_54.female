This guy, organization, whatever, attacked Harry Potter (audio on home page) because it's teaching us (maybe kids, mainly) that witchcraft is good and fun.  He said something about the wizard of oz too.  I don't understand it.   There are two kinds of Christians.  There are the hardcore Christians, such as myself, and there are those psycho christians, this guy.  We, hardcore Christians, will pray, thank God and joke about Jesus making Tammy fall in the dog water all in one breath.  But psycho Christians also pray and thank God, but then they try to force others to do the same.  I don't think that's cool.  People have a right to believe in whatever helps them get through the day.  If it's knowing that God sacrificed his only child for us, then great.  If it's because **Robin knowledge goes here**, great!  That doesn't bother me.  I must admit that I don't like Satan worshipers though.  Animals should not be sacrificed, that's what children are for.     I don't read the bible, it's more of a point of reference for me.  It'd be better if the index was more specific.  That way, if you were considering killing someone you could just look through K's, find kill and read all the scriptures about killing and hopefully see that it's wrong.  If nothing else, at least you'll have made an informed decision.  But, (paragraph point) I don't think the bible was meant to be followed to a T.  If so, what's the point of us being here, we'd only be living to die.  It makes absolutely no sense to me.  I'm going to live my life.  I won't kill anyone, partially because the bible tells me not to and partially because I think it's wrong.  I won't steal.  I'll try not to covet my neighbor's wife...I'm only human.  But, I won't do anything to intentionally harm another person.  How's that?  I'm pretty sure the God that I pray to thinks that I'm a dandy person.  I would have to agree with him.   I had a whole lot more to say, but I don't want to anymore cause believe it or not, I've just bored myself with talks of religion.     Can't believe he mentioned mel gibson.
