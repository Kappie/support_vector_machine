I can still shed a tear thinking about what happened to my  urlLink favorite skirt  in 6th grade. That tragedy could have been avoided if we'd had a urlLink Maytag NeptuneDrying Center . The Neptune has both a regular dryer and an upper drying closet that lets you speed-air-dry items without risking shrinkage. You can even add fragrance to the air to mimic the scent of fresh air dried items.   Win a Neptune and a year's worth of "drying supplies" in the  urlLink Maytag Sweepstakes .
