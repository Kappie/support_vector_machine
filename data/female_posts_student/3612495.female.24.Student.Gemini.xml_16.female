But the university had started, and I said to myself that I need to be more hard working than last semester. Besides, in this winter holiday, Gavin spent many time with me, I am glad :-)  On last Saturday, Gavin bought me to watch an expo, it's about sex, I had never watch such stuff, interesting. The people at there will not feel shy, this the different between chinese and foreign people.
