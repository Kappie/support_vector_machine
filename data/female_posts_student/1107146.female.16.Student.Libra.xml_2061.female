It sounds really hard but I didn't like it mainly because she did one with alot of clashing cords...don't like a whole piece of those. The Beethovan Sonata, those are fun! The dynamics are like wow I love those. Ok Chopin, prolly because it's like Kay's and LiLi's fav composer. Mozart...I couldn't care less for. I mean he's great but I think overload int he beginning. Also the fact that the variation and the polonaise sound similar it's really not...what I want in audition set. Anyway enough piano. Byebye
