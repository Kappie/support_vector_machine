Does everyone/anyone have a link on their Dashboard page that says Edit Profile? According to Blogger Help I do, but I don't. I want to change my name, which will probably show up here as arden toryn lyn or some such. Since I don't really have to continue the alias here, I may as well call myself Eilatan. Or some such...  Wow, Mel knows trichorders. Yes, they are portable scanning devices on Star Trek. No, Jake 2.0 wasn't on; right before it was due to start, there was a notice saying it wasn't going to be on that night due to Miriam moving into the Big Brother house. Because Channel 10 is renowned for its customer service...  If I don't show up here often, I'm probably at my Live Journal, so go there, or just bug me lots. Or don't bug me...  toodles natbat kersplat  P.S. What part of the alphabet would look like if there was no Q and R. P.P.S. Yes, I am a stickler for grammar/spelling. You can write that way if you like, but I am uptight. Leave me be.
