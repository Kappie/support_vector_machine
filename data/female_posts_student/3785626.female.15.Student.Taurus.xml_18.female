Then I played on the computer and played Dr. Mario on SNES(Old Skool Baby) And then, Tregory called and then it stormed, and so the power went out for like 10 seconds. Then he called back. Um...then I went to bed. Then afterwhile he came over I was asleep. Lol, Then anyways we went to see I, Robot, which is a really good movie. I say A-. 4 1/2 Stars...Anyways that's it. I'm bored. I'm tired. I'm going shopping!!! Later. Love Cherry
