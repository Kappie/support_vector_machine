There wasn't much work, so I spent the day listening to some good Celtic music and e-mailing this nice girl named Arpita.  I would say I spent more time emailing than working which was what made it a good day :)  I went mini-golfing with my friends tonight, I got two sixes but still managed to tie with Kelly.  Catie won with a score of 53, good job Catie!  Then we got some noodles, at Noodles.  My parents had to go a funeral today so I was left home with my brothers and sister and the worker guys.  I took Maggie Rose to the beach, and wanting to get a tan, got a massive sunburn on my neck where she forgot to put the suntan lotion.  We went to Colonial Cafe for lunch and I got some grease with a little burger in it.  It was seriously running down my hands, it gave me that gross heavy feeling but then I swam two laps at the beach to hopefully burn it off.  We had the worker guys over here all day which was really uncomfortable.  I can't go upstairs and its me and 4 strangers in my room without my parents in the vicinity.  Not that they were inappropriate, but still.  Now my sister wants me to take her to Blockbuster and I want to get  Wuthering Heights  anyway.  Until next time amigos, adios!
