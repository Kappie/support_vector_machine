I got to meet Tanya, Jose's sister.  She is such a sweetheart.  I am so bummed that Ed missed her.  I think he would have liked her too.  She was so sweet...Jose and her come from a reaaly good family, I can tell by them two.  So anyway, I have been trying to clean up because Ed is coming back home.  I miss him.  I worry about him too.  So Kata and I had poopie duty.  YUCK!  Gosh I don't know how many times I came close to throwing up...now I know why I don't want a dog.  haha  I will post more later....I have to get back to cleaning.  We are going to SD later (tomorrow)....so I better get some cleaning done.
