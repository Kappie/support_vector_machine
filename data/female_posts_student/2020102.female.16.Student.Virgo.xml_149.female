I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black Riders try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said.'" - The Fellowship of the Ring, p. 97  "'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said Sam fiercely. 'If it don't let them go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw it.'" -Fellowship of the Ring p. 133   "'But you won't send him off alone, surely, Master?' cried Sam, unable to contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor. "'No indeed!' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. "'You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not'" (Fellowship of the Ring p. 304)   "'Shelter!' muttered Sam. 'If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof make a house.'" (Fellowship of the Ring, p. 325)  "Once I do get to sleep...I shall go on sleeping whether I roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my meaning." (Fellowship of the Ring, p. 386)   Frodo: "But I am going to Mordor." Sam: "I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you." (Fellowship of the Ring, p. 457  "I made a promise, Mr. Frodo! A promise! Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee! And I don't mean to. I don't mean to." (Movie version, Fellowship of the Ring)    "...I'm coming too, or neither of us isn't going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first." (Fellowship of the Ring p. 457)    "Frodo, Mr. Frodo!" he called, "Don't leave me here alone! It's your Sam calling. Don't go where I can't follow!" (The Two Towers p. 384)   "I'll get there, if I leave everything but my bones behind," said Sam, "And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart." (Return of the King p. 232)
