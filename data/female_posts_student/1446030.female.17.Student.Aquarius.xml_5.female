This whole week, jus after e last period before recess, she would automatically come find me to do 2 e canteen with her. *haha, so fortunate* I feel like we are back 2 wat we used 2 be...but is this permanent...or is this temporary...? I sumhow feel that she knows that i've been blogging...and she knows what i've written...creepy. If not why izzit that she treats me so well out of the sudden? She said that she wants to go JC after her O's...that tells me that she has forgotten our promise...she said she wanted to go Poly with me and enter the same course... Her words had made me give up JC to go to Poly...but now...she broke her promise... That time when she said that during recess, my heart gave a loud "piang!"  (i reali can hear it...) Heart ache sia...that night i reali cry...cry the hell outta me.. Why izzit that things that i can remember she cant? Izzit becos my memory is extremely gd in remembering unimportant things? Can it be considered as a fortune or misfortune? I don't know. Sometimes i wonder if she keep her promises anot..whether...she remembers wat she said beforehand... She doesn't seem to treat her own words seriously...okay we'll stop here relating 2 this topic...change topic. Hmm..yesterdae she sayang my head...so gd dat feeling. then we went outside school to go to e provision shop nearby n buy ice cream and eat. Hao xin fu wor~~ Den we had a nice little chat before returning back to school.she sayang my head...haha.. it feels so nice to have ppl stroking ur head...especially the person stroking ur head is...*ahem* k larz stop here..hope daes after or week after i'm still as happy. Byez~
