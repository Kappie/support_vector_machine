What today is normal practice for a large amount of the poplulation. Premarital sex in these day was a crime worthy of death.  Written from the point of view of the woman given a sentence worse than death, living with the shame of her transition. This book opens up your thoughts to dealing with trials that seem to much to bear. Not a happy book, but still a beautiful read from the symbolic and poetic character of the "elf-child" to the ailing minister this book is a reflection of inward struggle and should be read by all who have ever struggled under the burden of a load they deem to large to bear.
