I likE to Say theSe thinGs to him.. by one of the greatest song I know*  balisong by rivermaya  Your face lights up the sky on the highway. Someday, you'll share your world with me someday. You mesmerize me with diamond eyes; I try to fool myself to think I'll be alright. But I am losing all control - My mind, my heart, my body and my soul  Never in my life have I been more sure, So come on up to me and close the door. Nobody's made me feel this way before; You're everything I wanted and more.  To speak or not to; where to begin. The way dilemmas I'm finding myself in. For all I know you only see me as a friend. I try to tell myself wake up fool; this fairy tale's got to end.  "Never in my life have I been more sure, So come on up to me and close the door. Nobody's made me feel this way before; You're everything I wanted (more)." (Repeat 2x)  You're everything I wanted
