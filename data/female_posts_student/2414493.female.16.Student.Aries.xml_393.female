It still makes me smile: Mom, Mr. Jeng and Tren's mom are going to start an after-school program for 3rd-5th graders for 25-30 kids. Mom's going to teach computers--so she's putting that computer science degree to use! Maybe I'm still in shock, but to me, that seems so awesome. I can't complain anymore that Mom's not  doing anything  with her education. Of course, this isn't hardcore work--it's only 3-6pm when school's in session--but still, it's a project. I'd be so willing to help out if they needed me. I don't mind donating some of my old stuff. I wonder if Mom still knows how to deal with little kids, since Austin and I are a little past that age group now. Wow, it's just so great. It's almost like formal recognition that Austin and I are growing up and that we can handle things ourselves. For one, I can drive myself to school and lessons and stuff, and drive Austin too, if need be. I wonder if Austin's as excited as I am.  And then we talked school. It's nice, I think the parents have finally realized that I'm almost done with this darned testing/puffing yourself up for college process. It makes me doubly happy to know that they're happy with the way I've turned out too. Emily's dad volunteered to coach me for the USC baccalaureate/med program interviews, haha. I love Mr. Cheung. I think there's at least a hundred TOCS kids out there who'd agree.  Wow, this is great. Life is good.
