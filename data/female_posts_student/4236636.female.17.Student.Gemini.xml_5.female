Me and my sis split a beef sandwhich (it was huge) and then we all had some cornbread. Then the guy that owns the place (who was really sweet and funny) gave us a taste of "the man" i had litteraly a dab, i mean i could harldly see it and my mouth was on fire! then when we came home i kept snackin, i ate so many pretzels and cereal and kept dippin into the frosting, I don't know what was wrong with me, it's not like i did anything to work up an appetite. Now I feel so gross, not to mention my stomach hurts... luckily I have tryouts tomorrow, that should work it off. I swear I gained like 5lbs!   Other than my eating problem, my day went pretty well... I went to get my physical, apparently I've shrunk and inch, lol I think they miss did my hight cuz last year I was 5'7 and this year I'm 5'6. We had to wait for a while in the waiting room but it wuzn't that bad.   I almost forgot, the season finale of "Summerland" is on tonight at 9, can't wait for that, should be a good one... it's almost time for all the other shows to start back up again, well it's a month away but I'm excited for that even though fall is pretty busy for me and I don't get to watch a lot of tv which is probably a good thing. Welp thats about it. Hope everyone is doin good! GOD BLESS
