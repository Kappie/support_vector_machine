I came home, watched a movie, went grocery shopping with my mom and now I think I am going to go take a long nap. So Noah comes up to me in wind ensemble this morning and he's like "Congratulations, are you ready to go make out?" I was like uh....okay. It was funny. So I'm telling my friends about how I have to kiss Noah on stage in algebra, and my teacher, Mr.Zizzo was listening to our conversation and starts asking me all these questions like, How old is he?, Do you have a boyfriend?, Make out?! Is it a passionate kiss or a friendly kiss? Oh my God, I almost died right there!!! It was like, okay, stop talking please! Ugh weird. Anyways, I'm writing this piano accompaniment for One Acts, and its really coming along well. I played it for my voice teacher yesterday, and she really liked it. I've finally started writing it out, which is taking FOREVER. It took me an hour to write the first verse. Stupid finale. I wish I had something where it wrote it out as I played it. You know, like in the movie Drumline? That would be so cool. Oh well.
