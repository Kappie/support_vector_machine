I don't really feel like going into it but things weren't so great at my house and my dad was in the worse mood ever [[i was awakened by yelling and screaming @ 7]] then he slept the rest of the day and everyone was just..bad.  Thankfully got outta the house and went to the swim meet with laney, sarah, and jana tho! That was fun! Uhm..swimmers have wonderful bodies! *haha* Then my mom came home and made me come home for dinner cuz my dad wouldnt open my gift w/o me there and i dno it was back to unpleasant land! Then back tot he pool where we watched more of the meet and stuff.  Back to laneys for bit [[our yrbk is miniscule...lol]] Then back to JanBans!! Where we watched freaky friday and talked til the middle of the night!  Today has been good too! Spent the entire day at janas! Which is always fun cuz we can talk about practically anything.  We watched tons of TLC then headed over to the park! Met these guys Lee and Chris and their older brother and his friends.  They go to apex high.  Accidently left their t shirt with us! *haha* But yeah they were nice and ..yeah.  Back to janas, watched steel magnolias, and hung out b4 heading over to the movies! I didnt go cuz i kinda felt like i should be at home plus i gotta get up early tmrw morning to work some. So im home, ate dinner, hanging out..you know me!
