We're Wine  Cheesing at Cynthia  my place for the occasionn. Bring 1 cheese  or pat√© and something to drink with it too.  Sara suggested we discuss friendship this week. What is a  friend? What happens when friends move? and also continue talking about why we're all part of this circle.  *NOTE: we need to find a cool name for our group... bring suggestions.  WHERE: 2-335 St. Patrick Street (betw. King Ed.  Cumberland)  Time: 7:30 as usual.   If it's nice out, we can do it in our backyard. see you then!  Anne-Sophie
