I've had a lot of crap from people on here before, and I hope that has all stopped, and if it hasn't...then I suppose I will have to quit with my blog all together.   A lot has been happening, a lot that mainly has to do with Aaron. He has found a girl whom he likes, and I think he can be very happy with her. From what he says, she seems like a very nice person. Hopefully things with me and him and okay now too. We had our up and downs, we both did things to deliberately hurt each other in the last week, and after talking tonight for over two hours, I hope that has come to a stop. I think we have come to an understanding as to where both of us are in our lives...and we both just have to respect the others wishes, which we haven't been doing for quite sometime.  As far as everything else, all is pretty good. I got my first paycheck, over 300 dollars!! I get paid to basically sit on my butt all day! Who wouldn't want a job like that? I can't wait, in about 2 months I should have exactly what I want. A car!! I'm so excited! The bad thing that is happening soon, is I have to go to the dentist, and I believe I will be in some serious pain Thursday...but I'll live. Thats about all for right now. I'll write more later!! Bye!
