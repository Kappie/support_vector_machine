But Gwen, lip balm isn't addictive...I'm certainly not an addict.  Oh yeah?  Why dont you take the  urlLink LBA Addiction Self Assessment Test .  I answered "yes" to over half the questions on this page.  I'm in too deep.    In my room I have a 15x7x7 drawer packed to the BRIM of the stuff.  I would say there are prolly close to 100 pots, sticks, tubes, deisgner and generic.  You name it, I have it.  Perhaps my most prized posessions are the 2  urlLink lip balm rings  I got at old navy.  They're fashionable and function...and no, they dont look like lil animals.    Some packages are glittery, some chapsticks are glittery, some a fruity, sweet, waxy, glossy...I love them all.  My favorites are probably the  urlLink Bonne Bell Lip Smackers  in Martian Marshmallow, Red Licorice Launch, Berry Jelly Donut and Cotton Candy.  There are some great pots too,  urlLink The Gap  made some really great flavors which came in large flat pots...my favorites there are pepermint stick and pink lemonade.  I have my  urlLink MAC LipGlass  for my Sex And the City nights out, when I need to be uber-glammy Gwen.  I have the holiday lip glosses from Old Navy...Easter shaped like a chick and a flower, Valentines day pots shaped like a heart, the winter pot shaped like a Christmas Tree and a snowflake...all my little precious. :::insert Gollum impression here:::    Between my lip gloss and hand cream application here at work, I probably only manage to do 15 minutes of actual work a day, but its not interfering with my life, I swear.  And I DEFINITLEY didn't pick a chapstick up off the floor of Red Rocks West and continue to use it becuase it would be a "waste" if I didn't.  What kind of freak would do that?  Not me I tell you, I don't HAVE to use it...I don't NEED it.  :::Pulls out stick and feverishly applies it:::  NO YOU CAN'T use it.  It's mine, get away!!
