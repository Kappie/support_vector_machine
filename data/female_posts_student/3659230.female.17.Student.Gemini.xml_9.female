Did you know that out of the 36 million blacks in america, 6 million are poor, 80% of us are middle class- only 16% of blacks are poor despite the images the often flood the media. and out of those 16%- 50 to 76% in certain cities are iliterate and in jails because of nonviolent drug related crimes.
