Or maybe just go to Dublin and meet some Peace and Conflict folks, then ponder the workings of the world.  Then that is it....second semester begins and my life officially ends.  However, I must say that I would rather be totally slammed for time rather than chill in my house playing mother to my 18 year old male house mates.  I guess I should take this time and savor it.  Forget the stress of the world and just enjoy the beauty that is here in this country, allow the waves of life to take me where they may.
