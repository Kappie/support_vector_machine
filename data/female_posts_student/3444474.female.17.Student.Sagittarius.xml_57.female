He even got me a little stuffed animal moose from Canada :) He knows me so well. Or atleast remembered that another nickname of mine is Moose...whichever.   He's such a sweetheart, I'm so glad he's back. I think I can last without him in college, this whole thing has told me so. I got used to it, well not used to it, but it wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be, and I had no real desire to cheat, or be with someone else, and that's kind of...a first for me. Even when Ed was here, while I didn't want him to go, I had no desire to cheat on Cameron with him.   I think I have matured.  Go me   //does the 'go me' dance  In other news:   I, Robot  was good.   Any movie with an opening scene in which Will Smith is naked in a shower is damn good for me :D
