She's so pretty, and skinny, and talented, and pretty, and smart, and she's such a good actress. Happy happy. (^_^) I like this. I think I'll go for a bike ride and spread the joy. I'm talking to amber though. That makes me happy too. September 19th is national pirate day. Don't forget that! I'm listening to Sixpense None the Richer, which also makes me happy. I like this. I'm happy. I think I'm just repeating myself right now, but I don't really care. I got my hair cut, but you can't tell the difference. I'm trying to grow it out, so this is good. I'm doing good. I like getting hugs, and happy waves, and good scores, and long walks and random talks and good times. I think this could be considered a good time right now. Yes, I like this. This is good.  ~Kristin
