You would be known by a series of names since you would go under many aliases and have a number of disguises. You are very clever and creative, and would almost always be one step ahead of the authorities. You would make sure no evidence of your horrible murders would be left behind, and if it is, no one would know it was you. You sneaky, elusive person...authorities would have hard time trying to catch you. You would definitely be the mystery criminal. People may not even know the your killings are all from you. You would really be a threat to the public.    urlLink   What Would Your Serial Killer Name Be?
