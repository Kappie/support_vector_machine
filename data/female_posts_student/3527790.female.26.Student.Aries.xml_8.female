	 
      Midnight By Chirstabel Germain  Black with snatches of white, Soft and gentle,    With concealed impotent claws.  Two yellow eyes    Peer at me, His mouth opens    And he cries  I do not speak his language,  He slinks away,    Tail down Slowly he cocks his    Head back towards me. Yellow eyes,    Sad and distant. He pleads.
