So Kevin and I watched the WHOLE coverage of Phil's First round from 1:30- 7:00... and proceeded with our night! Which included Taco Johns, Goodwill, Best Buy (wow those are like polar opposite stores), and a mummy making contest! Yeah that's right, a mummy making contest! After our trip to the stores, we headed over to Frame Park to walk around, and apparently on Thursday Nights, its "family flicks" night... where they play some movie on a huge screen in the Amplitheater. They also have little contests, like, Mummy Contests... So we completed with another couple, and two sets of kids, and we lost... (B.S.) we should have taken first! Damn older couple... I was flying around Kevin, Mummying him up so fast, it was nuts! But, i got dizzy, and we lost!  So then after our fun redezvous around the City of Waukesha... we joined Amanda and Nicole at Nicoles house to watch "The Ring," certainly a movie I hadn't seen in a while!  So that was a blast, and spending more and more time with everyone in the last few days has made me realize how much I'm gonna miss um... even after all the fights, and arguements, and such, I am geniuinely gonna miss everyone!  Can't wait till Minnesota... get to chill with my other friends, and go the the Mall of America!  Amen to that!  So, can't wait til vacations, and football games (college style!), and all of the funny ass conversations long distance on the tele!  Ahh... college is coming soon...whether we like it or not!   Goodnight All!  p.s.:  Root for Phil!  Mickelson All the way bay-beh!
