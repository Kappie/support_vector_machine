I got a CD burner today! :D Oh happy happy. n_n I also bought a tee, a bunch of CDs, a throw pillow and some Inu-Yasha manga. Greenhill is a lovely mall. Oh yeah, I also got a FF9 mini soundtrack for my friend Guia. I spent a lot of my money tho... x_x But I'll make up for it with my CD burner. Hopefully...  Oh damn. My brother is leaving in ten days. x_x It's hard to imagine what it'll be like when he's gone, even if he usually locks himself up in his room... He'll be going to Virginia... along with my parents; I'll be all alone.... even on my birthday! >
