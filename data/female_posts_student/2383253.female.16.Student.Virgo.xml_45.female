Tonight was the Awards Ceremony for the entire TP Music Department, and it was one of the most heartfelt events I've ever been to.  I played in four pieces composed by students from music theory: Karin's, Sujin's, Zach's, and Sarah's. They went more or less pretty well, and Karin's and Sarah's especially stood out. They were so beautifully written. We really have some talented musicians/composers in our program.  So the pieces went by pretty smoothly (a few screw-ups for here and there, I was a bit flustered), and Insha played  beautifully  as usual for Sarah's piece. Her piece was very special because she titled it "For Tomorrow" and dedicated it to all of the people in band. It was very appropriate and nostalgic. Then came the awards sprinkled throughout, and the awards were very fitting for people who definitely deserved them.  Then came the sentimental portion of the ceremony. Mr. Kohn delivered a wonderful speech about changes in life. As some of you might know, this is his last year at Torrey Pines after dedicating five years to rebuilding the former non-existent music program. He's been such a wonderful teacher, in fact, the best teacher I've ever had in my life. These past four years have been a blessing, and I mean that in the most genuine respect. He's always encouraged me to do my best, he's shown us what music is all about, he's extremely passionate about music, he's comforted me when I've cried over the years, he reminds me what's really important in life, and he's so talented at what he does. He's made such an incredible program, and we all have so much affection for him. There wasn't one student in that room that didn't feel incredibly grateful and affectionate for that man. Insha and I started crying. I don't know about anyone else, but I just couldn't stop sobbing because it's almost over. Four years of hard work, dedication, love, friendship, and it's all changing and going away. I'll never forget what all of this has taught me. It's definitely affected me for the rest of my life, and it's one of the things in life that I will look back on as extremely significant. I can't imagine how I'm going to be at graduation; that's the last time the entire ensemble will be playing together, and that's it. I'm going to be bawling my eyes out.  Man, what a night.
