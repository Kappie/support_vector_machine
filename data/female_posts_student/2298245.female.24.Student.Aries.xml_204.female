I've been working on my second go-through of the Harry Potter books, which makes me an official geek.  And Ken Starr was on campus today, a guest of the Federalist Society (the first campus organization that I think I might actually join semi-enthusiastically - totally unrelated to the presence of Ken Starr I can assure you), so I went to hear him speak.  It was very interesting.  He was a bit long winded in his responses to questions, so there weren't as much discourse as I would have liked.  But students were mostly respectful of his presence, which was nice.  With a different audience, it could have been a lot more hostile and confrontational, and I'm not sure I would have liked to see two such events at school in one week.  He gave a nice talk, didn't say anything too controversial, and it was not an unpleasant experience.  I guess I just expected something more from someone with so impressive a background - despite his rather infamous position as independent counsel, he served as Solicitor General and as a Federal Judge, so he's obviously a pretty bright guy, no matter what one thinks of his politics.  But he didn't seem to have anything too original to say.  But he was very articulate, so I suppose the afternoon could have been spent in a worse way.  I could have been watching the Game Show Network.
