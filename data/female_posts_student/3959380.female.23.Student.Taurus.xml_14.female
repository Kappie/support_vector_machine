He's just a moron for thinking that he's the only one in the Davies Lab who socialises outside the lab with other people in the building.  Anyway, of course it was just the frisbee people left when Ceels wanted to go to bed, so we went to Alex's place (again) for more drinking (again) and more video games (again!).  There until about 3am, but still woke up at 8, which is good because I just remembered that Brenda is down today to see Arthur and is meeting me for lunch.  Went to see  The Impressionists  yesterday and it was a little dissapointing since onyl half of the about 90 paintings were actually impressionistic, there was also pre-impressionists and post-impressionists.  The main section was great, there was loads of Monet, Renoir and Cezanne, but only a couple of van Gogh. The pre stuff was also good.  The psot stuff was symbolism and avante garde which I don't really like at all.
