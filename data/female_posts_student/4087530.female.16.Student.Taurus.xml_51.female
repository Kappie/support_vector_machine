Well, I was actually exceedingly content with what I´ve read, though it was at about 3 or 4 o´clock, due to my sleeping disorder^^". I also adepted something about Tetrotodoxin, the toxin contained in globefishs. When you orally consume a dosis of about 0,5 to 1 milligramm, the lethal effect arises just a certain time later, so that victims normally can be saved yet. But when the toxin is injected intravenously, then the nervous system is going to get paralyzed due to the fast spread in the organism, and the victim dies because of transpiration failure.
