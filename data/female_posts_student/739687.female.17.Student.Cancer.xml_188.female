Today was pretty much a typical Friday...except for the school's LACK OF CHICKEN. Lunch is the highlight of my Fridays...and they have disappointed me. Me and Manda were quite angry. Did good on my French tests from yesterday and today. Sucked up my lesson. Came home and took a long and quite lovely nap. Then watched Signs.  What a day. So much lack of excitement. Well, I'm off to...sit here.  Au revoir you crazies.
