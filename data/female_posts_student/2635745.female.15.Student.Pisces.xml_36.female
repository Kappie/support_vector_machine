Now it is Meshgurl218.  Becca will understand.  I had the greatest lunch also.  Tomorrow is bound to be better.  I have practice, which is always fun with Sarah and Elisa.  Which by they way, they definitely stole the show.  It is such an honor to be working with them.  Anywho, guess I'll see you guys tomorrow *notice how I refrain from using the term ya'll*.
