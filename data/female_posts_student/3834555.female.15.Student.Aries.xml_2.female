Kasey's lover is gone so he is talking to karsen!!!" i pretty much just ignored him but Kasey would run after him and beat him with a stick or something... which was quite amusing!   gosh, i leave to spend the night at Heathers tonight then i am going Sr. camp and yeah, i just got off the phone with Lindsey and she was like "just have a wicked time, dont worry bout anything!" how can i NOT worry!?!?!? i am going to miss my best friends birthday party, i am having difficulties with telling Kasey stuff, Lindsey is hurting and doesnt want to talk about it and yeah, i am seriously sooooooooooooo exhauseted!! and my overy pain is coming back:/ grrrrrrr! i am just going to go try to calling Kasey and then go to sleep before i leave for Heathers. bye everyone!! i will miss you!!!
