With a simple HI begins a friendship.  But sometimes, it really doesn't...  Anyways, it doesn't matter if I don't become EVERYONE's friend. As long as I've got my friends, that's fine with me.   This blog.  Do you mind if I ask you a favor? Please give me topics I could put on my blog. I can't think of any topic anymore...   About my day...   It SUCKS!  My glasses got lost!! And this is the 2nd time that I lost my glasses. I'm dead meat when I tell this to my mom.  The truth is, I'm not going to tell her, not YET. I'll be saving some money then when I reach P1000, I'll tell my mom. I just hope I'll be able to be patient until I save enough money.  It's really going to be a heck of a week or so without my glasses...
