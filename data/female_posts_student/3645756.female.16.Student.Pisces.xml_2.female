Probably not but that's too bad I'm posting it anyhow...its not like I'm makin you read it! lol  I've been on the Christian forums a lot lately, and it really irks me that no one on there can get agree on anything with a different faith.  The Baptists and Catholics are very bad to agrue among each other, and in my opinion its really stupid.  no wonder no one wants to be a christian, they're seeing how much we fight with each other...no very christian like if you ask me.  we need to learn to conduct ourselves not only as christians, but as adults...if you ever look at some of the arguements..they are very childish. I'm very disappointed guys, we need to act better...if not for eachother..then for the non-believers....because your petty disagreements and childlike behavior are hardly acceptable, and certainly not helpful.
