First off, I wanted to say that I am now the proud owner of a new Samsung Camera Phone. In one electronic purchase of technological advance I have become the very essence of all those I loathe and despise. Or simply put, I have become one of those that I make fun of.  Evidently, my hypocrisy knows no bounds.  However, it does provide me with endless fun on a huge time wasting scale. You want to know something else that is interesting?   No, let me rephrase. It's  as  interesting. Or  more  interesting. Or less. I don't know. That was simply a lazy transitional device inserted to give this ramble some sort of narrative drive, as though I'm leading up to something; I'm not.   Basically, I took some awesome pictures with my newly purchased toy on the way down to San Diego. You want to see one? I know you do. So here you go:     On the drive to San Diego we witnessed this car spontaneously combust. I shit you not. Don't worry, the owner of this car was fine. No injuries to report here.  Unless you count the injury to my hypocritical ego. But I don't. So you shouldn't either.
