I heard that a certain concert Satruday night was pretty damn awesome. I got droonk and did the lindy hop. All in all the birthday was good and presents were plentiful.   Sometimes I feel like I live a double life due to my living at "The Suites" and then going to Breezy every weekend. Totally different worlds I guess. Enough ramblings from me. The picture you see above is from    urlLink HALO 2"  which is going to kick major hiney when it circulates on November 9, 2004.   Hank would also like to take the time to thank The Diva, Reggie Roo, Pops K, Viceroy and Beekxs for their continued support through evil forest that lies ahead. Thanks guys!   Ok...now for this week's $1,000,000.00 question.   There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus goes 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do?
