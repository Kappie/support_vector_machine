Anyway, things have been looking good for the Cobblers. A strong finish to last season, coupled with some good purchases over the summer look set to lead us to a top three finish, and most bookies are tipping us for the top spot. Having followed Northampton Town FC for a good few years, it has sometimes been difficult to keep the faith. It looked good when we moved up to Division Two ( League One!!) but the success was short lived. Now we need to get promotion and stay up!! The good news is we started the season in the way we needed to. An away fixture to Swansea was never going to be the easiest of games, but we came out 2-0 winners. Lets keep it up for the rest of the season!!!!
