After interviewing all of the entries and seeing that I enough to run the tournament I’m ready go fully in depth about how it’s going to work. So let’s get jump right in.  Rules: These rules are put in for safety. Also to tell what is and what is not allowed.  1. No Kill shots(those are shots that are well meant to kill or do severe and permanent damage) 2. No body shots, that means if the persons shield is broken then the match is over 3. Once the match is over all attacks must stop 4. Pre-made attacks are allowed 5. Multiple shields are allowed 6. If you want to leave your body and go into the astral that is allowed 7. Its 1 on 1. Any outside help will be considered “cheating” and the perpetrator will be disqualified  8. Using External energy sources is allowed 9. A shield is considered broken when it: Has a hole in it, shattered, or any kind of opening for a construct to get through.   In the words of R. Dorothy Wayneright,   the things men do to amuse themselves.   -Ian
