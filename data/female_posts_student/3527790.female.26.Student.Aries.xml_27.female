Now to fully appreciate where I am coming from you have to realize that I used to be a golf scoffer. That I would poke fun at my friends who would complain about what hard work golf was. I had the audacity to poke fun of them when they would exclaim "I've golfed my hands off." Well I am here to take back every thing I ever said about golf not being hard or physically challenging! I was BEAT after life the 7th hole and I had 11 more to go. Not to mention the bruise on both of my hips from the golf bag that was over my shoulder. Man I had gained some respect for golf from hanging out and practicing at the driving range, but I was not expecting this!   Regardless of the fatigue, I have to admit that I am hooked! I love it. I mean what a great excuse to be outside for four hours without feeling guilty for just lazing under the tree. I did fairly well too. I scored 117 made par on two holes...of course it would not be fair if I also didn't mention the fact that there were about 3-4 holes where I was 7 over par (hehe). On average I was 2-3 strokes over par which for my first time I thought was pretty good.   This all happened on Monday and I have already made plans to go to the range on Thursday! Yup I'm hooked!
