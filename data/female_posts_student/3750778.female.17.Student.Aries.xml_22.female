Yesterday I went to a gathering at Pastor Danny's house, pretty much everyone from church was there. We ate and swam (in-ground pool w00t) and just had a good ole' time. Well it all started when Lee said to push him off the diving board. Me and Megan were climbing up the ladder at the same time and when I went to get off I stepped off at the side of the ladder so megan could get off through the middle. You following me? Ok so you know those plastic coverings for the filter thing, well I didn't see it and when I stepped off the ladder I stepped right on it and it broke and my foot went in the hole.   CAUTION: WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ MY CONTAIN GRAPHIC MATERIAL. IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACHE I ADVISE YOU NOT TO READ ON.  When I stepped into the hole my shin hit the corner of it and somehow it gashed my leg and pushed all the stuff under my skin up and left a big knot of tissue. It was like you see on those surgery shows, kinda cool actually. So I had to push all the stuff back down so it wouldn't look so funny, it wasn't bleeding very badly though. I swear it hurt so bad I thought I was going to throw up. But I was a big girl and didn't cry (if I would have cried I would have thrown up). It turned into a big knot on my leg, it was turnin black and swelling up pretty big, and I had to walk around all afternoon at someonelses house with tissue hanging from my gash.  When I got home my momma practically freaked out and said I had to go to the emergency room. Um I don't do emercency rooms, so here I am not knowing if I will be able to jump at church Wednesday, or if it will be well enough for me to run around at the beach (We're leaving Sunday). This morning when I woke up it wasn't swollen hardly at all and the bruising was fairly minute, which kinda scared me but oh well, I'm not going to let it bother me... If it hurts it hurts, pain isn't that much of a big deal. As long as I don't have to go to the hosipital or have some kind of cast thing... It'll be ooook...
