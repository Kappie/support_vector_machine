We walk in and by this time, both towels are soaked with blood, as well as my face, hair and shirt. We run of to the nurse, she takes one look with me, and shouts out to someone else that we have a class B trauma for room 6. No clue what that means, but it must have been serious, cause they swipe me off my feet, onto a wheelchair, and run me down the hall to room 6. I stand up, and then sit on the table. There were like 3 nurses around me, all trying to look in my mouth, but I didn't wanna open, cause I knew that they were gonna poke around or something and make it hurt even more! Finally, after about 2 min of convincing from Craig and Shelly, I opened. Even then, they still couldn't see anything because of all the blood. So they took this suction thingy off the wall, and started around the outside, trying to get rid of some of the blood. I was trying to look at it as well, because I didn't know what I had done. Their were a few "Oh my!"s and a few "Good lord!"s, but all andall, I think they've seen worse. In like another min, a doctor came in and looked at my mouth, just like the nurses had. He said that I would deffinantly need stitches, and sent off someone to page the anatheisiologist, and to get the equipment. By now, I'm done crying from the pain, but I really didn't want stitches, so I think I started crying. Random people were trying to hold my hand, and keep me away from my mouth. Finally, this guy came in with some needles. He said that he was going to numb my tongue so they could fix it. When they were all done, he told me that he would also give me a shot of painkillers in my tongue.    The shots hurt like crazy. For some fucked up reason, they had to put them right into my tongue, right were the skin was broken. I was screaming like crazy, and trying to get away, but it was no use because I had like 4 people holding me down. After the second shot though, my tongue and mouth began to feel funny, and I didn't even realize that he had given me a few more injections. Finally, he was done, and left. Now the doctor is standing over me with his nurse, still sucking out the blood. The doctor has this needle, that sort of looked like a sewing needle. He said that he would explain everything that he was doing so that I wouldn't have to be scared. He also said that I wouldn't be able to feel a thing, and he was right, cause I didn't. I could feel his hands in my mouth, and something pressing on my tongue I think, but no pain at all! It was kinda weird.    He kept changing needles, and thread. I tried to ask him why, but he told me not to talk. Shelly knew that I was being curious, so she read my mind and asked for me. He relpied that the clear thread that looked like fishing line was to go inside my tongue, to help heal the cappilaries, or little blood vessels that feed out towards the tip of my tongue. He said that these would dissolve within a week. The black thread however was permanent, and would be going on the top of my tongue. That I would have to go back and have removed. For the bottom of my tongue, simply because it always touches and would be irritating the bottom of my mouth, he just put the clear stuff on, along with a layer of this gooey stuff, that he said was like superglue for the mouth.    When he was all done with the stiching and everything, he left to go get cleaned up, and the nurse started talking about aftercare with me, while she was dressing my tongue. They put nasty tasting antibiotic stuff all over, and cleaned it again for me. Then after a few more talks, and the ever so popular calling of my parent's, I was free to go. We went to the gas station on Richmond to get some of that really small, but good airy ice that's good for chewing. And we also had to get new toothpaste, anasepthic stuff, and listerine mouthwash. Gross!    Well, anyway's that's all about me and my tongue. I do have a few more things to mention, but not now. Maybe later tonight when I'm bored!    Untill next time,    ~Ani
