So I just talked to my boss about possibly moving into the meeting planning side of things since the meeting planner for our company is leaving in two weeks to go to another job. He gave me the whole "well... it seems like a good idea... but...." speech. So basically I got my answer. He won't do it. Whenever he does that kind of thing it means he won't do it. So if my position now is where he wants to keep me it is definitely time to move onward! I thought I might be able to move more within the company to the position I have wanted since I started here but in the end it doesn't appear to be going that way at all. Too bad.
