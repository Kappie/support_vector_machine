It's always nice to be able to breathe deep. I'm still in alot of confusion, but I'm just going to stop thinking about it, and things will work out in the end. I'm sorta leaning toward a certain way I wish things would end up, but it's the most unlikely option. *Sigh*...I guess that's just life. But sometimes what you think you want isn't all you think it is. Because sometimes what you really really want hasn't been laid in front of you yet. That's not always true, but what can I say. And not everyone will always be pleased with what I want, but it's my life...so if I want something, then I'll go after it. And no one can stop me. Yea, anyways...that dream from several days ago is still stuck in my head. How odd...
