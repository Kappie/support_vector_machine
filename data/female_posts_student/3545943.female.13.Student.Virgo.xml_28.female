If anyone knows of an easier way to do it than to use five non-breaking space tags in a row or use a blank space image,  please  let me know!  Maybe I could find some way to work out a definition list-type-thing, but it would probably end up being even more complicated.  Gah!  being said, I think I'll just get all chatty for a while.  I don't really have anyone around to talk to right now, and even if I did, I don't figure I'd have much to say.  Besides, there's something comforting about the gentle clickity-clack of the keyboard.  And I don't like actually talking.  It tends to annoy me.  And I type faster then I write.  Which is perhaps why I'm quickly getting addicted to blogging.  Even though I could be doing more productive things than writing a whole bunch of nonsense for friends and random people to read.  Like working on my story.  But hey.  I know the basic plot and a bunch of minor details, but I tend to get intimidated when it comes time to actually do some writing.  I'm sure this is terribly interesting.  But it's your fault for reading this.  It's not my job to entertain you.  (Or is it?)  You can stop any time.  Unless you're addicted.  Hmm.  I was  going  to be all chatty, but certain members of my household are insisting that I do my chores before dance recital.  Oh, cruel fate!  Why do you mock me?  Current: Song lyrics running through my head: She's a cold hearted snake!
