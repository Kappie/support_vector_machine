Mom and I headed to the bank because on tuesday the atm ate my check without crediting my account. After taking care of that we drove my Wendy's to pick up something. God I hate fast food, it's so greasy, but we didn't have time to make anything, so I settled for a small burger, fries and a frosty. After wiping off the grease I finally ate my food. Stopped in at home to change then we went back to DSA (my school) for Orientation. Orientation was okay, but didn't realize until later that I didn't get Chemistry Honors like I had signed up for which makes me ANGRY!!! But I put in a drop add form and I'm a little worried might change the status of my Honors Envir. Science Class, but I was told it wouldn't. Anywho, later when I got home I talked to John on the phone for a little while. I really enjoyed it, I couldn't stop laughing, we're going to go bar hopping on Sunday! YAHOO! lol Anyways I have to go, I'm sitting on my floor in the buff, so yeah, I'm hungry... lol buh bye love,Nikki
