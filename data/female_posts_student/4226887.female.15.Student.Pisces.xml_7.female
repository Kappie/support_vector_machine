Well, I recieved a packet from school today with all the forms I'll need for registration. I'm starting 10th grade on August 30th. In no way am I happy to be going back. But it's not like I had this awesome summer. I spent it inside, up in my room because my father who works midnights insists on sleeping in the living room in front of the tv. I can't really say that I was upset about having to stay in the house all summer. By the end of 9th grade I had practically been worn thin and was becoming increasingly depressed. That was quite odd figuring I had started out that school year happier than I had been in a long time. I guess that's what happens when a rumor starts going around the school that you're a lesbian, you fall in love with the one guy (Logan) who had been chasing you for 3 months only to find out he now has a girlfriend, your ex-boyfriend winds up in jail and your best friend ditches you because "she can do so much better" all in the span of about 2 months. And I am not exaggerating any of this in the slightest. So not only can I not have the guy I want but I can't really have any guy at all thanks to the rumor.I'm not saying I'm a victim here. I take the blame for the whole Logan situation. He persued me and I led him on until I announced I liked his friend, Jim. Shortly there after I fell head over heals in love with Logan which would result in me crying about three times a week over him. I have since written him an apology letter but understandably have not recieved a reply.The whole lesbian thing was out of my control. I think an ex-friend started it and now there is no way to reverse the damage. My ex-boyfriend in jail: I'm not even going to give any details because I'm so ashamed of him and the fact that I dated him.And now for the best friend problem. I'll abmit we both took equal parts in our friendship breaking and have since admitted it and have become friends again. For further reference her name is Crystal.I am so nervous about starting school. Like I had said, last year started off great but by the end of the year I practically pulled all the way into myself. I think it's safe to say I was suffering from depression. Atypical depression to be correct. I read about it online and sure enough I had all of the symptoms. Since summer started I've began to feel a little bit better emotionally. I can't say too much physically. I used to excersize everyday and eat healthy but since June I've put on 10 pounds. I know that may not sound like a lot and it's not as though I've become morbidly obseise but for a girl, that's a lot of weight. Fortunately I still fit into size 6's. I just want to start over this year and have fun. Well, I think I'll post more later.
