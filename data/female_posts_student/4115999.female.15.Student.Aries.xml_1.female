Then around I dunno maybe 5, I met Antonia for a little "get together" cause it was her  birthday. We stayed at her house for like three hours, then we drove to Washington Courthouse to go skating, little did we know they weren't open....So we drove back to Wilmington and rented some movies but we only watched one of them, Cabin Fever, it was pretty good, I'd seen it before thou  gh. It was fun I guess. Today I have no clue what I'm doing, might hang out with some people, it all depends I guess. I'm so bummed that school is happening again this year...Woo go teen girl squad!!! lol... Yeah it starts Monday, which sucks monkey toes, but oh well nothin I can do about it. At least I get to see some people I haven't seen since school let out. Yeah, I'm going to go my fingers are getting tired...
