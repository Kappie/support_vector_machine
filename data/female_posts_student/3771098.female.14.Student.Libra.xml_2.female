Well, it looks the same to me. Oh...wait, that's cuz they haven't DONE anything yet. Apparently they're gonna' start something on the 5th which means they have like a week to get it done, so i'm guessing that nothings really going to change, and that just sucks. So it was like 20 degrees in the cafeteria. Whats up with that? Keah got her wisdom teeth out today so i got her a card (cuz i'm such a kind person). She was freaking out but then i would be too if they didn't put me all the way under. Then I got to go to tarjay after registration. Gotta' love tarjay. I could live in that store.   Then I went to Hallmark and got this cute little photo albulm for all my SD pictures. Then I came to church so that was fun. It was just a couple of us but it was cool. We just hung out and answered questions. Muy bueno. I've gotta get copies of Steven's and Allie's pictures on Saturday, and then get them to Allie's house by 5. Huhm...that should be fun cuz I gotta go to my g-parents sometime that day too, plus i babysit that night and i have to get my white jacketa from amez house. OMG, the greatest thing happened today. I owed IHS $153 for books i didn't loose, and guess what????? THEY FOUND THEM!!!! It's a miracle from God. So now all is good cuz i have enough money to go out and do stuff now. And not eat off of the Wendy's dollar menu so yay. Well for all you SD people, our get together is now officially the 9th of august around 6:00 at the church. Bring a desert and your pictures. The Shareholders dinner is on August 29 and it's $12 for anyone if you're not a Sonsray. Oh yeh, we're doing elections for fall planning council, so elect me and vote for me! Gracias. Well that's about it. Oh yeh, I got school supplies. that was fun. Who knew pens cost so much though? k gotta fly.   Liz
