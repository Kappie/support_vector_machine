I read, "Poultry" but in fact, they said, "Poivre". The other day when I was on the plane, my mom was reading a newspaper, to me it said, "Poltergeist marries again." When it actually said, "Polygamist marries again." These are just a few of my dislexic moments. I still seem to be able to write things which is good.  I made a braclet last night at like 3 am. It turned out to be pretty cool, it's just a bunch of different coloured beads in no order with a random heart bead, but it's cool. I bet you wish you had one. Maybe I'll start a business. I'll call it "Crazy BEADS" and our slogan could be like, "We'll have you eating, breathing, thinking BEADS!" Then I'll take over the word. I'll plant subliminal messages.
