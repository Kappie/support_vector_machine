Now, i was home for 5 minutes, and i put on a song by Much the Same (don't know if you've heard of them, but they're a really great band). Anyway, i get to the chorus of the song (it's called "Wish") and my dad walks in and says "Turn that off, I don't want to hear that PUNK ROCK MUSIC in my house." Well, isn't that a nice greeting! Haven't seen the guy all fucking day, and the first thing he does is yell at me about wanting to listen to some music and vent a little about my day. Maybe if he let me listen to the stereo in my basement during the week, i could go down there and listen to music and not disturb him, but nooooo. Then i go to the living room to watch the "Rock Against Bush Vol. 1" Bonus DVD, and he comes in to start yelling at my brother because apparently he's not supposed to be watching tv anymore. For one, i was watching it, not him. Second, I was home for about 15 minutes and all he's done is yell, yell, yell. Then he comes back a few minutes later, and starts lecturing us about how hard he's trying to run a household, make a living, etc. as if we don't try hard with what we have to do! When the mother of the kid i babysit for was all depressed and fucked up, i worked until 9 every night, while she was sick and right in the next room, and her 11-year-old (in my opinion, that's old enough to be home alone) and i had to make her food, keep the house clean, etc. Now, I never complained once to my dad about that, not once. He doesn't even know about it, as far as i know. But he has to lecture us every time he gets stressed, and take whatever it is thats pissing him off out on us for not doing our chores and wanting to have fun? Last time i checked, most kids ignore their chores and have fun instead, so why does dad feel obligated to make me feel like the worst person alive and like all his problems are my fault? Then he makes my dreams- everything i want to do with my life- of being a bass guitarist, singer, and lyricist in a band, seem like worthless bullshit. He tells me acedemics are my main priority now, and then puts all the chores he tells me to do ahead of that- maybe its because he knows that if i get all A's and B's this quarter he has to get me a bass guitar, which he promised to do, and he's trying to keep me from succeeding. You know, if he is doing that, then it's probably subconcious, and he doesnt even know he's doing it.   Anyway, back to that song I mentioned: "Wish" by Much the Same- it fits the theme of this entry pretty well, so here it is.    WISH Well You're in control and I know it 'cause I'm miserable again -- I don't understand how any of this makes me a better man -- You know I always run to You for some help with my life -- You know I always come to You for a little wise advice -- And all I get is pain -- Okay, so I'm exaggerating, I'm just saying that's how it seems to me -- If all good things come to an end, then what about the bad? -- Am I cursed to never see the fruits of the life I wish I had? -- And can I try, one more time, to be pleasing to You? -- My futile efforts never seem to make my wish come true -- What can I do? -- I'll follow through with all these claims I never cease to make -- A promise to myself is one I promise to break -- But when I have You by my side then I can do what's right -- I'll become the co-pilot and You control this flight -- Then everything will be alright -- This song's for me -- A reminder of how I intend my life to be -- Every word I sing -- Is an anthem against my own hypocrisy -- Let me be free     urlLink  click here   to check out Much the Same, and  urlLink  here   to check out the record company they're signed to and some of the other bands signed to the same company (A-F Records)
