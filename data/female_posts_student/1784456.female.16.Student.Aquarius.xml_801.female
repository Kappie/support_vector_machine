I'm gonna see 8 legged freaks tomorrow though (WOOHOO!) with Emma and her older sissy *shoot me, I couldn't spell her name) Then on Friday we're ...going to see Stone Henge... I guess it's best that you don't ask, my dad's really excited about it. Hey maybe we can hitch-hike back to our home planet. :P Just kidding, that's a two hour flight! Ok, officially mad! Woohoo! Mmm... chocolate... hehe uhoh... am I going to see eight legged freaks today or tomorrow? Erm! ERM! Oksie, calmum downum (this always happens when I think about some thing too much, I get all muddled) tomorrow? Yup, tomorrow! Ok, I'm gonna run downstairs and watch kiddy tv bubi!
