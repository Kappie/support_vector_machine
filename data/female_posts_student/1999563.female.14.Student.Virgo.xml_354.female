Then I went to tutoring but on the way I got another bloody nose. Grr. My third today! So I had to sit in the car for awhile till it stopped.   My family went to the mall why I was at tutoring. They never do that! They just shopped for like an hour. And for like a week I have been wanting to go to the mall, and when I told my family my dad was like "We can go soon!" then they go without  me! Gr!  I have enough money saved up for a whole new summer outfit. Yay.  The cool guy in american idol lost :(  The shark game is 0-0 Hmm..I hope the sharks win! I g2g to bed, see you all later.
