I thought it was just going to be us and a few of the other kids from the neighborhood since her sister Maggie Rose is in elementary school. It ended up being this big thing. They had a moon walk and this water slide thing that was blown up with air and it was...so cool. Cold too! Haha! It was super fun. We had water balloon fights and, ah good times. MC got hit twice in the same way both times. It was hilarious. If you ever want to get her with a water balloon, just sneak up behind her and get her. Ah, it was fantastic. So, we hung around there for a while and then decided we wanted to go see Harry Potter. So, we all went home, showered, did whatever and then...we went to see Harry Potter!!! On IMAX nonetheless. It was awesome. I really liked it a lot. However, it was much darker than the first two movies. I'll admit it. I'm not going to lie, I was scared. Those dementors...ohhh...I've got chills and my room's stifling. Anyway, after that we just went to Tom's house and hung out for a while. We didn't really do anything but, it was fun. Lots of fun. Today was definitely one of the most fun days I've had in a long time. I think what helped make it so great was knowing I can sleep in as late as I want tomorrow. :) Unfortunately though, Kels and MC are going on a church thing starting this weekend and Kath is going to a wedding in Kansas. What am I supposed to do with my life while they're gone? Haha. Oh well. I'll find something constructive. I thought this entry would be longer and I probably would have made it longer but, I'm SO super tired and all I want to do right now is sleep. Just one thing before I go to sleep though....Wizards Gone Wild. Hah. Whooo, good times. Anyway, peace out and lots of love.  Oh yes...one last thing....this lady in the movie theater in front of me was so mean. I was accidentally leaning against her chair and like, instead of being nice about it and saying, "can you please not do that?" she was like, "sweetie, sweetie, I'm not an armrest" in this realllly sarcastic tone of voice. I wanted to hit her but...I was a good Catie. *pats self on back* :) Anyway, bon soir.
