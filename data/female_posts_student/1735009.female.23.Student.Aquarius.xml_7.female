The perfect setting for a gothic movie. Old man, with only candlelight to guide him down the aisles as he searches for what he needs. Wonderful. And in a shadowed corner would be a large desk, covered in books and papers. It would be from this desk that I would do my research and shush any patron that dared enter my domain. But that's not to be. That, my dears, is a stereotype that I hope to help crush some day.   Me? I hope to be knowledgeable enough to help my patrons when they come to me. I hope to be friendly enough that they won't fear coming to my desk. I want my personality to show through, not be stifled. I am not the steel gray-haired librarian with glasses perched on her nose.   I now spend my minimal free time searching for jobs. Sent out my resume/cover letter package to two positions so far. One at Frostburg State University and the other at Daemen College. My search area encompasses the entire northeast. I would prefer to stay in the NY/PA/MD area, but if that is impossible, I'm willing to move. We shall see.   It's mind-boggling that I will complete my MSLS in July. One year. It took 4 years to get my BA in English, and only one to get my masters. Something about that seems wrong. Like I should be spending more time on my masters. Like it's not enough time to learn everything that I need. Crazy.   But tomorrow I am off to the public library in Rimersburg to meet with the librarians there about the marketing plan I'm working on for them. Then collection development tomorrow night to learn all about the acquisitions process. A process that I wrote a 17 page research paper on last semester.
