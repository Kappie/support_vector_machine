Lemme diagram:  COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  |   .   .    .  .  **BLDG D**    COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  |               COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  | COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  | . . .  .      .   . .  . . .  . . . . .  BLDG A COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  | COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  | COW BARN  SHIT FIELD  |  | = short, thin fence of perfect hieght to angle the shit-wind (term first coined at UC Davis) towards Room Ferrell of the 2nd floor . .. .= blogger doesn't lemme do multiple spaces, periods help  BTW -- If i don't have AC and have to keep my windows open, I've decided to pack a bunch of inflatable lawn chairs, so I can shack up on top of the dorm's pool.  My schedule there is such that for the first few weeks I spend a few hours in lecture and the remainder of the day in the lab (every weekday).  Saturdays I go on fun field trips to Tahoe, Monterey, SF, some other place that I can't remember, and Santa Cruz.  Sundays I don't do shit (just eat more than I need, worship, and get laid).  The last few weeks are the same, save the getting laid part, cause I don't have lectures and instead spend all daylight in the lab.  Hmm.  So yea, if you guys come up, make it a Sunday (Come early so we can go to church!!!) or between 1 and 8 PM of Saturday July 19.  That day I'm in Santa Cruz on a "mystery beach".  I don't think I"m allowed to have visitors in the cow prison, but I'll blab to my fellow inmates that you guys are avid beach goers and that I just might run into then.  Of course, I'll have to phone you guys my secret location.  I don't have a dorm phone, but I'm bringing my cell phone. I do have email there (I'll give u the address soon) and will post on blogger, but I won't have much time.
