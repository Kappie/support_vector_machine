I would like to fling a gordita at the woman behind the counter at taco bell and THEN get arrested for it. I would like to hijack a fedex plane and take it to a deserted island where I would sit. I would like to yell really loud and break something and THEN push it under the couch with my foot. I would like to write fake suicide letters on the walls with bingo dobbers. I would like to slash someone's tires for no apparent reason. I would like to do all these things in the span of a week and top it off with an acid trip and an unplanned leap off of the nearest bridge. Instead, I  blog.  I am sick of my mother. She is a lush, a drunk, a seriously aggravating piece of work. I am sick of adapting, and would like it if someone would adapt to me for once. I would like for somebody to say please. I am sick of being blown off, getting over it, and forgiving everyone. I am sick of being resented for having a password on my internet diary and constantly pestered about it, as opposed to writing in aimless journals and scribbling on wedding pictures like I used to.  today I was talking to troy on AIM. We were discussing Reagan and his pros/cons and how he could have slowed the AIDS epidemic. Mom came into the office, whiskey on her breath. She said "if he is weird, then I will find him and kill him". Troy had a lunch appointment, so he left. She freaked out. "MOM WALKS INTO THE ROOM AND SUDDENLY HE HAS TO GO???" she yelled, as I hopelessly tried to reason with her. She started clicking like crazy, blocking troy and closing AIM before I could show her our conversation. She went into a fling about how "if she couldn't have the password to my blog then she WILL BE THERE WATCHING ME ALL SUMMER". She makes me sick with her drunken swaggering slurring stupid self. It's EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. EVERY SINGLE DAY. Will we ever have a peaceful day when she's sober and we all just kind of... Coexist harmoniously?  I want to go to my dad's, I want to do something. I want to escape. I want to... Croak.
