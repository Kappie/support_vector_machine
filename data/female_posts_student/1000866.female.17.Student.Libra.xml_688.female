It was alright but, not great. I was actually expecting it to be worse than it was, but I was expecting to absolutely hate it. It was funny though. The movie theater was almost empty and we had eleven people in our group and we took up a whole row. So, here's this whole row full of people and the rest of the theater is almost empty. Heh. We were all laughing at the movie and stuff though and then after, as we were walking out, this little kid was like, "That was the coolest movie I've ever seen!!!" I felt bad. I don't think anyone else did though. Haha. It was kind of funny. Plus, I got to ride in Tom's Corvette....well, his dad's. It was cool. That's a REALLY nice car.   And, I just realized something else about my blog today. I think I'm overanalyzing my blog. But anyway, I tend to start my entries the same way quite a bit. I wonder how many times I've started an entry with, "I" or with "And." Heh. If I had any free time, I'd check. OK, maybe not. That would take a lot of time and it would be incredibly loserish. But anyway, this summer's been so much busier than I would have ever imagined. It's been nice though. I kind of like having stuff to do. Then again, there are those times when I just wish I had some down time. Oh well. I don't know. I certainly don't have any more now. i'm off to Mary Clare's house. Kathryn and I were going to be spontaneous and just show up, but that didn't work out. Haha. Oh well. So much for living on the edge.
