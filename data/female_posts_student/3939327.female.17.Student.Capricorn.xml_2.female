Site sponsors will donate money for everytime you click on the buttons. You can click on the buttons for a max of 20 times each day!!Questions? e-mail me:  urlLink contact65roses@yahoo.com  (I don't know why, but when you click on the links, a new browser does not pop up, so visit  urlLink www.xanga.com/ensconced  for ease. Thanks a bunch!)  1.  urlLink end hunger    2.  urlLink defeat cancer    3. urlLink promote education    4.  urlLink house the homeless    5.  urlLink for the children    6.  urlLink stop aids    7.  urlLink support the arts    8.  urlLink protect environment    How It Works:   FreeDonation.com is a web site with the mission of making the world a better place. At FreeDonation.com, you can make donations free of charge to important causes such as AIDS and cancer research, food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless, vaccines for children and more. All you have to do is to click on the donation button and our sponsors will pay for your donation. The entire process takes only a few seconds.   Our sponsors pay a few cents every time you donate. While this does not sound like a large amount of money, a few cents will provide a cup of food for a hungry person or vaccinate a young child against tuberculosis. With each free donation, you will be making a real difference in someone's life.
