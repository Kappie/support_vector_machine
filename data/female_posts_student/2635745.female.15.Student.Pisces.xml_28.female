I feel tied down at home, at school, and anywhere else I can think of.  I'm extremely excited to perform on Friday and Saturday, but after all my hard work this whole year I can't even go out to dinner on Saturday after the tournament.  That is partially my fault, but I really don't see what it is with my father.  I hate my family.  My mom is fully supportive of Forensics, but she hates to do anything.  She is always trying to get rides for me because she doesn't feel like it.  That is so embarrassing when I see all these other parents who don't mind to take their children places, but now it makes me feel bad when they are equally responsible for getting me places now.  And this has nothing to do with her surgery, I can understand that,  but this is all the time.  Then my dad.  He just does not understand and he won't take the time to listen.  Sometimes I just cry myself to sleep wishing he didn't pressure me so much.  I have so much to focus on at the moment and it all just adds up.  The reason I don't like to help around the house, isn't that I'm lazy, it's that I am so tired, stressed, frustated, angry, and just all around overwhelmed and all I want is some time by myself to cool off and simer before I join my corruptive family.  The reason I forget to call them is that deep down I don't want to call them.  I want to be out for as long as possible so that I can just be away from them.  And on Saturday when all my friends are out to eat, celebrating, I'll be at home with the worst people in my life right now.  I love them, but they are horrible people to be around, I guess that is why I have an "attitude" as my dad calls it.  And I guess that is "what's wrong with me" which is what both my parents question.  I wish sometimes I weren't here for them to complain about.  Maybe then Courtney wouldn't look so perfect in my dad's eyes.
