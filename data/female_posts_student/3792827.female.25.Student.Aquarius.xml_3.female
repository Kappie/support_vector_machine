Oh, and I have a new friend too. So, that makes 3. Wow, I feel SO loved. Oh, who cares anymore? How many do I need? If I've learned anything through this, it's that if you have more friends than that, more than likely most of them really aren't your friends. Damn, this sucks. Why is it that everytime things start going smooth, it all blows up in your face? I should have seen it coming. Oh well... never again.   School sucked yesterday. I wasn't in the mood to be there, let alone actually work. I'm ready for Thursday to be overwith already ... then I get a much needed 4 day weekend.  Anyway... to those that have been there for me... thanks! Love Ya
