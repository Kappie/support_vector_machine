Saw Harry Potter for the fourth time on IMAX BABY. $12 and it wasn't what I thought. I wanted like a planetarium where you could lean back and see below Harry's belt line. Didn't get that. We made wands and I wore Elizabeth's Harry glasses. Erica bought her ticket first. Then it was my turn. The boy asked me, "So are you going to the same show?" No, I'm actually going to go see Chronicles of Riddick you ass face. We begged people around us for money to buy sodas and Erica some cotton candy. Everybody was mean and gave us NOTHING! We came home and played this great game! You need an ad with different styles of checks. Then one person picks their favorite, and the other two have to guess what it was. You can also play with your least favorite. We guessed Erica's favorite, and I got her least favorite. It was good.  I watched Last Comic Standing, and like the judges, I was outraged. This one guy got a standing ovation he was so funny, but he didn't get in the house! It was terrible. I've been looking up colleges and found that I really like DePaul in Chicago. Somebody is going there from this year, who is it? If you know, hook me up. Well my mom is making me clean the litter box, I am really pissed (literally- I'm going to smell like piss).
