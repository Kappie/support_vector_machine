I was walking back to my room, and my sister oppened her door, (very early) :and VERY uncommon for my sister to be up this early:..She said that one of Christinas fish died lastnight. Amanda was..heh, not so happy. Deep down inside, blaming herself and probably thinking of ways to tell my sister. She cleaned the tank-a-ma-bobber, so Im sure that the fish was either old.....or had some kind of a disease. hehe, the iguanas are still sleeping. They look so incredibly cute when they sleep. *blah*..  Anyhow. So this morning I didnt wake up at 4:30,  as usual . I slept in until about 6:00. Still horrible, but ehh..oh well. William is probably still sound asleep. I wish I was sitting next to him watching him:(. I love watching people sleep, well..not just anyone but I know what I mean. Grr...Coffee is turning cold. I DONT LIKE COLD COFFEE. WAAA. 'Not Really' Nothing to say..Nothing to say. Im lazy. :)..very lazy. Im thinking about puting a picture gallery on here, for my own likings. heh, William tells me I'm beautiful. I very much disagree. I can't stand looking in the mirror for more than two seconds. If any more time is given, I point out all my flaws. Trust me, it doesnt take long. +But« If William thinks that I am beautiful, that's all that really matters.   I think Im going to work on that, something to keep me busy. I can't be bored..boredom does *big*  and  !AWFUL! things to me. I'll probably write later...Depends on what the day's like.      Where are my {TRUE} 'friends'? Is there even such a thing? Hmmm..Will I +ever+ know the truth? If there is..Will I ever find mine?
