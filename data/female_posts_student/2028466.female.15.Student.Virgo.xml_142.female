Forget those little wimpy sports cars, and all those other pieces of junk, TRUCKS rule!!!! hehe...But I dunno what brand yet...I jus kno I want a 4 door truck, but I dont' want it small...i like it bigger! OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH OH!!! I got to DRIVE yesterday!!! WEEEEE! My dad wanted to pick fiddle head ferns (ew...) so I got to drive him around! I drove to teh end of the road (white sands) and then back home (jus in Monashka, not too far...but i dont have my permit...) haha, but when i was turning into the neighborhood, I was goin a little too fast...dude, my dad was a lil upset, but hey, how was i supposed to know? that's like, only the 3rd time i drove! well, gotta go, bell's about to ring! mmm...lunch!
