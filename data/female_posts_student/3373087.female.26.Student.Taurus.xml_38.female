We went to the mall (I got my first bikini), saw Spiderman 2, had dinner at Elephant Bar, went to Todai with M  D, spent time with his PoPo over lunch and at the Asian market, went out to dim sum with his aunts and uncle, and took a walk together.  I felt like we were constantly eating the whole weekend!  Besides my stomach, my heart is full as well.  I had a good time with him.  I'm discovering some "boy habits" that gross me out sometimes like popping zits and blisters, and picking his teeth at the table w/o a toothpick.  That's about it.  Those things I can live with, though.  It probably grosses me out because I'm not used to these boy habits and all boys gross me out to some degree.  Mostly, though, my heart feels heavy.  I love spending time with him, but i have guilt that spoils our time together.  Brandon and I slep together for the first time during his time here.  We had said when we first started dating that we would break up if we ever slept together and now we are facing that deciison.  I brought it up last night after he got back to Tigard.  He didn't seem to be feeling the same kind of guilt as I was, but I guess he hasn't really had time to think about it yet.  I can't bear the thought of not being with him.  I can't imagine us being in Boston together and just being "friends".  I think that would break my heart. I feel pressed by guilt over what we have done and the fear of getting pregnant. I plan on calling the peer counselors tomorrow about whether I should take a "morning after pill" and about birth control options.  But would getting birth control be like giving ourselves permission to have sex?  but knowing how we are together, if I spend time with him alone in his room, history shows that we are likely to get ourselves into trouble.  But why do I fear pregnancy more than I fear God?  I guess right now pregnancy seems like more of a real threat to me. Not that God should be a threat--I should say that I fear the consequences of pregnancy more than I fear God's judgement.  If it's pregnancy that I fear, then putting myself on birth control will eliminate that fear.  But if it's God that I fear, that will eliminate the sex (spiritual birth control).  So in a way, whether or not to start the Pill is like choosing who will be my master.  Choose the pill and sex will be my motivating factor.   I guess that leaves us with the decision of "what next"? We talked last night about following through with our committment to break up if we slept together.  It seemed like B was prepared and willing to go through with it if I throught that was best.  He was concerned with my level of guilt and was very considerate of what I wanted to do.  He didn't try to convince me to think one way or another.  Neither of us had any answers, and that's where things stand now.  The only thing that both of us knows for sure is that we like eachother and want to be together.  It seems like the only thing that would keep us from having sex would be to break up--but neither of us want to do that.  I really want the decision of whether or not to be on birth control to be a decision that  both  of us make.  I wish he were here to attend the counseling class together.
