Because it's RIGHT AFTER the Fall Play, I seriously need a break, plus only the top theatre, choir and dance people will make it, so I probably wouldn't even get a part, like last year. I love being pessimistic! Anyways, cast party at Hooter's tonight, fun fun, first time I've been to that place, pretty cool.   Now, instead of reading the last 40 pgs in Huck Finn, I'm just going to look at the spark notes online! woo! thanks Ritika :0) Oh finally did I mention how much I love David?! I love David!!! Oh man I hope we can work everything out for Christmas, even though I do have to go to Tennessee, unless I can get out of it, if not, I'll just fake the flu! lol...I'm bad, but I can't help it, I don't wanna wait till Spring Break :(. Christmas Countdown: 39 days!!!!!!!   Ice everlasting A full moon casting, a purple veil enshrouding all
