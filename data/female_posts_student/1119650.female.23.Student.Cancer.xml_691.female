Disagree with me if you will, you're entitlted to your opinion, but its the absolute most BORING sport to watch on television, short of somethign like maybe curling.  The whole concept of baseball is even backwards.  Essentially when batting you wait in line to do your thing.  Upon your turn, if you do what you're SUPPOSED to do and hit the ball:  you have to run around in the hot sun, sweat, slide in the dirt, get all smelly.  That sucks.  If you don't do what you're supposed to do and miss the ball you can sit down on the bench, enjoy some gatorade, b.s. with your teammates, chew some sunflower seeds.  Its a party!  Where is the motivation to do well and get the hits?  Oh thats right, there isn't any.    Of all of the athletes in professional sports (the 4 major ones: baseball, basketball, football and hockey) baseball players are the most out of shape (do the words  urlLink Sid Fernandez  mean anything to you?)  Let's not even get me started on the "hotties" of baseball.  Derek Jeter?  Alex Rodrigurez?  Nasty.    Then we get to the fans.  Yanks fans I'm not even gonna pick on you today becuase frankly, I dont have the energy to deal with your arrogant, pigheaded, 'the yankees are the best team ever and I worship them because t.v. tells me its cool to' attitudes today.  Just feel satisfied in the fact that I still hate you just as much as I always have.  I just intensely dislike most baseball fans, mostly because I dislike baseball, so well I guess thats a moot point.  I just think its a boring awful mess and my disdain for it only grew after dating a "baseball history buff" who only ever talked about it and quoted stats about it and historical things that I could really  GIVE 2 SHITS  about so much that it came to the point when he'd open his mouth to say anything (baseball related or not), I'd cringe.  Its not a great game, there is nothing majestic, stoic or heroic about it or its players.  American's love it and it's our passtime because its the lazy mans game and we as a nation are, well, a little bit lazy.    Let the flames begin if you must, but I just hate, hate, HATE it!
