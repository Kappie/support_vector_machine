Speaking of change, my mother is trying to change up the August moving plans. Over my dead body...stay tuned for more interesting posts to follow. Huff...  There will soon be pictures from the DC trip and of my house on my website. As soon as we get paid, I'll get them developed. I have some digital camera pictures from DC, but they're at the office, so I'll wait until I get all my pictures developed and post everything at once, hopefully sometime before the weekend.  Speaking of the weekend, the new Harry Potter book is FINALLY being released. I pre-orderd it which hopefully means it will come in the mail early. The good news is that if I don't get it on time, I get it for free...and I get to use sick days to read it during the week rather than over the weekend. :)  More to come in the coming days. It would be easier if I could figure out how to post pictures on blogger...no such luck thus far.   I'm also hoping to get my website up and running after summer B starts. Lauren is finally starting as our Staff Assistant on Wednesday (THANK GOD!!) so I'll actually be able to work only 8 hours a day and not have to feel like I have 10 hours of work waiting for me when I get in the next morning.
