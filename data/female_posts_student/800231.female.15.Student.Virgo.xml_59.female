I was going to get completely stoned and then, less then an hour later, I was going to ride a fucking motorcycle over the freeway. I'm truly far stupider then I ever thought. Anyway, I had to put the whole getting high with Mia thing off until Monday. Motorcycles are better then drugs... Call me a loser, I don't care. I've been riding that bike all weekend and I really can't think of anything better to waste my time with.
