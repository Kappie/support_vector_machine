Kurtz was an excellent officer, the best of the best, and suddenly seems to have lost his mind. His words on the tape make him look completely insane. He his wanted for murder, because he executed supposed double agents,took things in his own hands, "played God".   Another example is the regular officer that shot himself not too long ago, that though they don't say why, shows that there is definitely something that makes people mad. The same happens on "Heart of Darkness", when Marlow is told of a man who hung himself, and when he asks why, the response is : "Who knows! The sun too much for him, or the country perhaps."
