I got some books at the library to keep working on my dissertation and I probably got enrolled in the Psychology course for this summer.  Probably?  I won't know for sure until I get the approval of the Grad Coordinator but I think my Silver Tongue inherited from my mother did the trick.  Can't fly, so I might as well be productive, right?  I'm going to try to get basketball tickets for my brother and I from rez tomorrow morning.  Raptors versus Pacers (his favourite team).  The tickets are $15 and $20 off the normal $45 price.  Fingers crossed.  We never do anything together anymore so I'm really hoping I get these tickets.  Should be a quiet remainder of the day.  Going to rosary tonight (third last time) and want to do enough work so I don't feel guilty for the rest of the week when I'm grading until my hands fall off/eyes fall out.  More to come...
