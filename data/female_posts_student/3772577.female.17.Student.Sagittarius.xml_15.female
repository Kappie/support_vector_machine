Sometimes I think so, other times I think that people may know what they don't want in life and everything else they just have vague ideas about. I mean sure people say they want to become a certain profession, and have 4 kids, live in a certain country or city, but that's not what I mean. Do people know if they want to live their life helping people, or making people happy, making themselves happy, making money, being honest, being smart? I know that I don't want to stay here for the rest of my life, even for the next five years. I mean I love it here, but not for what this town is, I love it because it is home. I know that I want to find lasting love, I have found true love, but not lasting. Both people need to want love to last. I know that I want to be a mother. There is doubt whether that is physically able but the hope is still there. I know that I don't want to be viewed as normal and typical. I want to travel and have people think that I am intersting. I want to know as much about everything as I can. I want to help people, make people happy, make a difference. I want to die, having said my goodbyes in whatever form they might be. I do not want to go to sleep on any night feeling disgusted with myself, knowing that I let myself down. This is what I want from my life.
