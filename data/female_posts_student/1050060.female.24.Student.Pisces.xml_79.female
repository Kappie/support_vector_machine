But the 2nd term will be hard because all of the courses i need to take on on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays. The days will be every long. But i don't have a choice i need those credits and courses for my major. Well nothing new happened lately. Amanda is coming this weekend and i can't wait. I am done classes on April 7th therefore i only have 3 days of school left. Anyways have a good day!
