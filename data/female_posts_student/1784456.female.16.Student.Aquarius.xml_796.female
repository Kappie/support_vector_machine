Even though it'll go all over the floor and probably explode! Yeay! I don't actually know how to cook and I'm supposed to be doing Food Tech for GCSE! Aargh! Sorry, can't type much, Rik's still asleep (Grr, he doesn't have to get up!) Ha, we're not back at school yet and every one else is! HAHA! Ok, better go bubi!
