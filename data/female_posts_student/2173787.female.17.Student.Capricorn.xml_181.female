Matt (Dukie) West was 17 when he died and from the little I knew him an awesome person.  The cop received his  urlLink sentence  today, a $100 fine and a citation.  He admitted to running the light, and that he was not answering a call.  $100 and a slap on the wrist, it drives me absolutely crazy.  But when I told my dad about it his response was "what would you have wanted the penalty to have been if you had killed someone in your accident?  You essentially did the same thing, would you want to go to jail?"  I really don't know the answer to that and that bothers me.  Is it ok to be hypocritical?  Dukie is gone and the penalty on the cop really won't change that, yet it still bothers me.  Teenagers aren't supposed to die, especially ones that you know and like.  Damn it...Why can't there be no heartache, no trouble?
