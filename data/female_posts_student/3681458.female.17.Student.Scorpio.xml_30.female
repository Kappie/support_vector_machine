Apparently not. I guess I forgive him for it, but right now I'm proceeding with caution. I don't know how close to him I can actually get without seriously trusting him.   Saw a guy in the Army today. Reminded me of my brother. Wonder how he's doing. Everyone asks why I never talk to him. I have nothing to talk about. I haven't seen him since he was sixteen and now he's almost twenty. Seems like yesterday. He's supposed to be coming home for a couple of weeks in Oct, so maybe I'll gain some ground then. I feel so closed off from him. Almost like I dont' trust him. And I ask myself why I should have any expectations. He was never there when I was younger. He fucked things up himself. Why does he need a second chance. I guess he deserves one.  Jason tells me that things are different with him. Not really sure about that. I guess it started out nice, but I think it's rapidly losing momentum. I think too much. How will this work? I'm very very very busy. And he's in college. I feel like he will get bored. I am looking for all the wrong things, I think.  Bah.  Well, I've gotta get up early for running/practice. TTFN
