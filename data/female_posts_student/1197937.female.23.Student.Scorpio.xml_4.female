Neil made me feel like an intellectual pauper, a true ignoramus humanus, and that's why i love him so. and i have my friend philip to thank for all this. he gave me this book for my 21st bday, and i never got around to reading it until yesterday. well, eveything runs its due course in its due time i always say. probably wouldn't have appreciated it as much back then. can't wait to read it over...if only i were actually knowledgeable and knew what the heck he's talking about.  valentine's day in america. nice concept, over-commercialized. on a tangent, my high school english teacher, mrs. shoop, once told us that the antithesis of love is not hate, but indifference. (Despite all her eccentricites, a lot of what that woman said has stuck with me through the years, i may consider her my "morrie.") I didn't agree before, but now i can see some truth to it. anyway, back to vday. for a lot of ppl, it's a really nice excuse to give something nice to their significant other; for an even greater number of ppl, it's just the flowers and chocolates and little sparkly rocks that's extended the longevity of this maudlin celebration. moi...just stick me in the movie theater with a cup of diet coke and you got yourself one happy camper. personally, from the perspective of true amore, everyday can be vday if you're with the one you truly love, and everything can cast that fluffy romantic glow if you really know how to appreciate it all. just don't make vday to be the excuse for all the rest of the days of the year to not do something nice for your special someone. having said that, happy valentines day to you and me all the same.
