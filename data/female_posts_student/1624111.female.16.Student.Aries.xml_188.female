(but that shouldn't count cause its not magical). party was okay. -then spent a while working out plans and evetually went to hawthorn with cait and emily. drove by myslef there (2nd place ever). was lonely. -mall was short and not long enough. found the bookstore. cait had fun in a chair. i bought a cookie. went back to caits. took too long to drive home cause i had to turn around at least 5 times, though only 2 not in cait/emily's neighborhood. i dont know if id call that a successful drive. the first two definitely were though.  -drove home successfully. emily laughed at me. got my journal back.  now im tired and must sleep and have to get up early to leave at 7:10 (!!!!!!!!) to drive to school which starts at 8:10. i keep telling my mom thats crazy and that ill have nothing to do tomorrow morning but sit all alone somewhere and listen to music like a loser. but shes being mean so its that or take the bus. *cringe*  well im out for now. more later. huzzah for the book and kyle.
