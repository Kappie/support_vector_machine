Throughout the past few days, the thought of enduring another karaoke family party hovered in  out of my raetared mind. Let's see why, shall we? The cleaning, the cooking, the procastination of the completion of assignments - what to do?   Oh dear.   Yet surprisingly enough. It wasn't bad after all. In fact, as suggested by the title of this blog, it was virtually perfect. The day commenced slowly, I must admit though. With the arrival of my grandmother, cousins, uncle (poor thing ran over his own foot with the forklift), I equipped myself for a really long (literally long for nobody goes home til about 3am) night. Not until my older cousins arrived, as well as the rest of the family did the gathering seem complete.  A joint celebration.  This gathering was a farewell for Tita Gigi, Tito Noel,  their two gorgeous daughters Nell  Nicole. Where are they going? Let's just say bad things happen to good pepole. It was also the girls' birthday. Not to mention Ate Marriz's 24th, my parent's 18th wedding anniversary  Lolo Pael's 80th or so birthday. And that's when it hit me. No matter what mischief the younger boys were up to, no matter what each mother was frantically attempting to cook, clean or take after their little ones, no matter what the men were roguishly doing - everyone stopped amid all the commotion  noises, to watch this fragile, old man blow out his candles. It's as if amongst the activities around me didn't bother me, nor did my current worries or doubts. It's as if a still shot was taken, encapsulating the beauty of that old man celebrating his birthday. And there was something rather exquisite of that epitome. The fact that he was blessed with 80 years of life  accomplished so many things within his lifetime. He was blessed with a life, a wife, a family - love. My only prayer is that everyone will be as blessed as he was; the divinity of 80 years of life  love.   Favourite moments.  From that moment onwards, I didn't care so much about anything else. I was utterly content to have these people around me. Throughout the night, other precious moments of still-shots were stolen. For instance, as Chen,Cha, Lester  Dean were teaching everyone else how to attempt their hands at poker, my grandma requested if she could play. And don't let her fragile, old body deceive you. As per usual, the game was won loud  proud. Not by the 'teachers' of the game, but by my grandma - pulling out her tricks of the trade! After a game of 'Lola-Charing's Poker,' a game I invented was played. The parents had to however, interrupt the game a few times, as they had their own little disco going on - with the salsa, ocho ocho, nutbush  that no-sense song 'I said a hey hah!' It was so. What's the word. Delightful. hehe! Chen being the smart little girl she is, won the game we were playing (like scattegories). The night was finished off with a little karaoke  a mini-disco in the formal lounge room for my brother, Ate Joi, Ley  Lester. My uncle (the pioneer) trying to crypt walk! hahah! interestingly peculiar..  I also had the chance to catch up with Gerry in the morning. hehehe dont worry too much darling! I'll pray for you =) And a surprise call from Ryan (best friend!)  a short but sweet conversation with Mush also contributed to the remarkable day I had! Being happy is selfishly sweet. But ensuring that everyone else is happy around you is even sweeter ;)  Isn't it funny how I influenced two friends of mine to analyze the depth of their dreams or the lack thereof. Isn't it funny how I influenced another two friends to update their blogs. Isn't it funny how I managed to manipulate another two friends to start a blog. I've got the power! hurrah! I Love all of you!  -- feeling blissfull *awwh* --
