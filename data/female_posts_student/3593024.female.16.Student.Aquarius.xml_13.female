I know they both have their reasons for being mad but I just wish they both werent so stubborn and they both think that they are right.  In a way I see both of their sides of view and in a way I dont.  Us three have been friends for along time and now I dont know if them two are friends anymore and it makes me really sad b/c I spend all my time with one of them and we have fun and stuff but I can tell she misses our little sis.   I was mad at her too but mainly only b/c we dont see her that much anymore she always made me laugh and with her there we could both talk the other one   into anything.  We had so much fun I mean I dont know any other ppl who got together and just laughed so much and just had a great time.  I have tried everything to get them to talk again and it doesnt seem to work b/c I am scared I will end up pissing one of them off and I dont want them to hate me b/c then I know there goes any chance of us ever being friends again.  I just wish that they would get over it and sit down and actually talk.  I know they both want to be friends again and I want us three to hang out again and to go to football games b/c we missed that last year and we only have two years left and I dont know what I will do if you two dont talk again, I mean actually are friends as close to how it use to be as possible.  I miss the ole days and the ole ppl in those ole days I know everyone grows up and grows apart but not us we always said we wont ever let anything come between us and I am going to still try hard and I will not let that happen even if I have to resort to my last option and I dont want to do that b/c then you two will hate me, and as much as I dont want you two to hate me I will do anything to see you two friends again b/c I miss us three and I know you two do also.   Love ya'   Jess
