I don't want to be there at that dorkfest alone. Too late I am a dork. Everyone join chorus next year. There's a trip to Prague and Salzburg for under $3000 (cheap!). I want to go, but only if fun people are going. Kelly I can see you shaking your head saying that you can't sing, but neither can I and I got an A on my final last year and I suck.
