Told my mom I was going out downtown to hang out with friends, and she jus tlooked at me with that look that said: Yeah right. What are you REALLY doing? Great. So after a good 3 hour long battle which induced muchos tears and stress and anger and other "fun" things, I finally ran out of the house, with mom shouting after me "This is a BIG DEAL you know!" Why is it big? I go downtown all the time...Just now that it's with a guy? Try and cross the highway, man that is...fun...*note sarcasm* Managed to stay alive, get down to the bus stop, met up with Tom. Talked, saw a friend, and talked with him till his bus came then got on ours. Walked around, got some tickets for Pirates of the Carribean, had dinner and walked around. I knew I wanted to go down to Beacon Hill, I love it there, why the hell not! I found out today that it was the lantern festival...Damn that would have been fun.  Walked in the mall til it closed...6pm..rather early, but whatever. Saw the movie. Oh man. Oh man. OH MAN. That movie is sooooo good. Almost as good as Finding Nemo:P Nothing will compare that this year. But very good. Good acting. Good plot. Excellent animation.  So freaking cold in the theaters. I was soooo cold, my hands were turning into icecicles slowly.  Left. Called the parents. Oh lordy. I guess they don't understand the meaning of not telling the WORLD so I spent way too long trying to convince them not to call anyone, and to stay home till I was off the bus. Ran into some people I'd rather avoid. Like my ex-best friend. Lovely. They were acting like such immature goons on the bus, one would think that they were high, or drunk, or both, if you didn't know them. Was "lucky" and got a bus driver new to the route. Even though Tom told him where to go, he STILL missed the road, then later got the bus stuck on a hill and had to let us off there...Damn good thing I had a flashlight, cause otherwise we would be going up a huge hill with out lighting. Brilliant.   Oh and for you weirdos interested, and I know there's a few of you....No. There was no kiss. I can't remember though if we hugged or not...Totally has flown from my mind. Weird, huh?  When I finally got home I talked to my parents about the need of not telling the world, because of our reasons. Then I talked to my brother, and went to bed. I was soooo tired, I was almost asleep as I hit the pillow...with the sweet sounds of Lifehouse in the background.  It was hard today, being near him and having to act cool. Sitting beside his dad and trying to contain myself. It hurts.  I kinda wanna kiss him, extremely bad. And I know he reads this, but it isn't going to stop me. I want him near me, holding me, kissing me...It hurts..  Heart heart. It aches for you. Pines for you. Would even die to see you again....
