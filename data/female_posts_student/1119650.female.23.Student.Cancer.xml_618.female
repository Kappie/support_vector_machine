What is the 3 month curse:  well you see of my last 3 boyfriends (or attempts at re-dating old boyfriends) I've had this problem where before we can make it to the 3 month mark in our relationships I just lose interest or discover my feelings were different than I'd thought or in some extreme cases I find that they make my skin crawl and stomach turn and they're just generally deadbeat dirtbags (see March to May-ish of last year's archives).  I've finally found a guy though, who is:  a) my own age  b) local (as in only 5 mins away) c) employed d) cute  e) not on drugs (illegal or prescription)      f) not from the internet g) knows me as Deja and not Gwen          h) did I mention cute?  this isn't meant as a slam to the exes...only one of you was a dirtbag/druggie/loser at life   So, Andrew, thank you for a very fun 3 months and I hope we can continue to enjoy many more 'cause you're stuck with me now :p
