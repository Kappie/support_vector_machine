My bro made me bookmark the tripod site cos he thinks they're cool and they like the stuff he likes: tron, d, being nerdy... Who is this OC person? How do you guys find so much time to watch tv? As in tv that is not wholesome and good like Dr Who and the one with Harris Pembleton thats name I don't recall. I literally failed today's maths common. I am tired, and my nose is cold. Tina, I still can't get your link to work.  Much sleepiness natbat
