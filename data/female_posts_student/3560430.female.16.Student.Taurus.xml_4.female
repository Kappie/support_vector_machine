Now I have no problem with people being gay. In fact that is one of the top things on my list of 'Things I really could care less about' you see I figure if you're into guys cool, your into girls great, I don't care what bloody gender you are. My only problem is when you have to bloody well wear a sign saying "Hey I'm homosexual!" I hate the double standards that gay people get to play with! Or the excuses they pull. I'm not speaking for all of them, I know a couple of gay ppl that could really care less if the whole world knows. They're good ppl. But this woman would not stop talking about being a lesbian. The perks the reasons why she's persecuted against, the everything. Everything she talked about had to do with her sexual orientation. Let me tell you that that gets really annoying really fast! I heard her discussing with another woman about this man who told her she was too loud or something to that effect, she said in response, and I quote, "I really don't care though 'cause he was a total homophobe.' If he was or wasn't has nothing to do with him calling her loud because let me tell you she was (and probably still is)very, very loud. I really hope I'm not coming off as a homophobe myself. I just hate it when people dwell on their sexual (or other people's sexual) orientation. I think that it is a pointless conversation, due to the fact that it is that sort of shit that brings about arguments with other people. I'm not saying to keep opinions in the closet, that's censorship, I'm just saying that for others to except you into modern society you need to be able to get along with people without calling out homophobe at every person with a divers opinion.  Sigh now that I'm done with that.   I swear I have ESP! This student volunteer who worked with me was telling me about her boy friend. The moment she started talking about her I couldn't get the thought "He's going to break up with you this week" out of my head! It just kept spinning there and every time I talked to her or she talked about her boyfriend that was all I could think! Three days later she comes in late (she had been sick the other day so I just thought that she was staying home sick), and I say "Hey Jan I thought you were staying home sick today, how are you feeling?" and she says "I feel like shit, my boyfriend broke up with me yesterday." I felt really bad about it but I couldn't help but give an inner smile because... Well wow creepy.   Lalala today has been really nice so far! I'm going to read and do all sorts of great stuff once I'm done with this. My dad and I played backgammon for like over two hours. It was really neat because there wasn't really a prevailing winner, it went both ways. And that's all I've really done today. Although I think I have daddy really liking the Bare Naked Ladies. Humm I'm going to go have dinner now   Ciao!
