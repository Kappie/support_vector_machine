And if you use your "traits" correctly, you can get away with anything. Maybe it's because I'll be 18 soon...but lately I've started to feel  sexy . Is that bad? Not sexy in a dirty way...but sexy in the way I feel. And because of that I've realized that I've been holding back a lot.  Suddenly  I have the urge to wear the lowest cut tops I can find...but not to the point where it's trashy, but so it's sexy and classy.  I mean come on..I know I'm not very gifted in the boob department...but I have a some..and hey I'm young..and now's the time I can wear those kind of things. Even though sometimes it is a bit awkward when you're trying to have a conversation with someone and they're looking at your cleavage instead of your face..."hello, I'm up here!" but I guess when you wear tops like that, you're asking for that sort of attention. I've always been the jeans and t-shirt girl. I think I'm finally growing out of that. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'm just going through a weird phase.   I'm finally comfortable with the size of my breasts! and that makes me happy! I don't want them any bigger or any smaller! I like them the way they are.   Okay enough about boobs.
