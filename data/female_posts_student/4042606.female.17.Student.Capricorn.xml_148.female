Later I went skateboarding and then returned to have a barbecue with Sarah's family, I then went skateboarding again. Now I am sitting home at eight (something I rarely do) and I am bored out of my mind. But, this boredom has given me the chance to finish up on that short story I started back when this website was first created.
