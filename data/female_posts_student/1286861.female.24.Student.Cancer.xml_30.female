Once I get into how wonderful the last month has been, I am sure I might win just a wee bit of your understanding, and maybe even (hopefully) some sympathy.  Run down�I will try and keep this to the immediately need to know information.  My living situation has been in turmoil. As most of you know, I was house sitting a huge 4-bedroom house with my good friend Josh and his fiancee Christina. The gentleman we were house sitting for was not scheduled to arrive back till sometime at the end of the year, being a Marine stationed over seas. One fine Monday afternoon I come home from work to find Josh and Christina reading over an email from the gentleman�s brother. The so called Gentleman was going to be home that Friday, and he wanted his house clear and empty by the time he got there. That left me 3 days to pack and move�to my mother�s couch. There I have been for about 4 weeks and I am praying that the applications I have put out for an apartment will go through. I am stressing at the moment over needing a co-signer. My mom has told me she will consider helping out, but on my credit alone, the app wont fly. Not that living with my mom, my brother, his wife, and their son isn�t healthy. It�s killing me! We will see what happens.  I am still working at United Rentals. I rent construction equipment. I have issues with the people I work with. They have changed my schedule�I now work Thursday through Monday and I have Tuesday and Wednesday off. Being low man on the totem sucks ass. That�s all I am going to say about that at the moment.  Speaking of things that suck ass�Traci is still single. Don�t get me wrong, I am having a ball having fun. I have been going out on dates and meeting new people, but still�I am waiting for that �click� to happen. In the beginning I was looking for it, searching for it�was doing nothing but making myself depressed. I am okay now with going with the flow and letting the �click� find me. I have had sparks�boy were there sparks. And I have also made a couple bad choices�but I think I am a better person for it, I know better now, that�s for sure�and all this within the last month. Amazing.   I have had the thought lately about going back to school. As soon as someone out there discovers how the hell I can support myself and still get a degree in Theatre will you please let me know. Dammit.  Trying to lose weight. Yeah�not working.  I turned 23. My birthday came on July 18th and left without so much as a whistle. I worked that day, 9 and � hours without a lunch, and then went straight to the theatre for opening night of �Jesus Christ Superstar�. Even though my day was sort of a tragedy, the show went off as a success. Thank you to Chad, Jason, and Robert as well as all my friends who were able to make it out to see it. I hope it was worth it, and on a personal note, I really hope my 24th birthday will be better than my 23rd.  I need a place to live!  I can�t stop saying �ten-four�. I say it constantly at work�and I can�t stop. It�s like the whole �sir� thing. It is becoming habit and I don�t think I like it. When I need to say �yes���ten-four� comes out instead. Someone help me, please!  I hope I get a chance to hang out with Chris soon. I must apologize to him�he was the one that started me on this blog thing and it is me that let it slide for over a month. Sorry Chris. BTW he is quite the published writer  urlLink check this dude out   The Metrolink is cool. A definite way to get to LA without a vehicle. Thank you to Jason for this discovery. Thank you to Jason for the wonderful weekend. That�s all I wish to say about that (hehehe).  I am getting out of debt. Oh, I am still there no doubt�but the path is a little clearer now and the light in the distance is growing brighter bi-monthly.  That�s all for now kids.
