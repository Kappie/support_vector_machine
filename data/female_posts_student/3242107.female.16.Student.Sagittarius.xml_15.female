" so i pulled over and ran over to her and wanted to cry so bad. she was standing stiff like she was frozen. omc. apparently, a car 2 cars in front of her slammed on their breaks b4 turning onto louetta, and the car infront of her slammed, and then they left her with out any time to stop. so she slammed on her breaks and it was too late.the hood is  oractically cracked in half, bent back  at the end of the engine block. the wrecker said it was probably unfixable, and then that he was pretty sure it was totaled. omc and christa was riding with mandi too. the airbags went off. thank God. mandis got a few burns from the air bag stuff and a mark from her seatbelt., and christas got more. she normally does, but she didnt wear her seatbelt. but thankfully everythings ok.  it was so scary. when i got home, i called chris, and just started crying bc i was so scared. i kept thinking... what if? what if the air bags hadnt gone off? what if she was going faster? what if she hadnt had her seatbelt on? all i could think about was how close i came to losing one of my closest friends, the one that ive known the longest, knows me so well, lives a few streets away, is my throwing partner for softball, all around. how close i was to not having her anymore.
