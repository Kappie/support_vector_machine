I have my car and my cell phone, so I can go places without my parents tagging along. Which is fun. I'm starting to REALLY miss Chelsea. I mean, I missed her before, but I really REALLY miss her now. And Chelsea, if you read this, what weekend are you coming home? Cuz I need to know ASAP. Send me an email or call me at 777-1939 to tell me, please? thanks.  Okay, you might ask "What has Shannon been doing lately?" Well, I've been loafing around doing nothing and getting fatter. Yup, that's almost all I've done lately. I went and got a physical Friday. The doctor told me that I need to lose 60 pounds! That I need to way 120 or 130! umm, news flash....I'm 5'8"!!!! I'd be sickly and dead if I weighed so little. My goodness!  I took my ACT Saturday. I don't think I did as good as I was hoping to do, but I doubt I made a 2. maybe a 21, 25 at the best. Who knows. The thing is, I couldn't concentrate because I had a few problems with my dad that morning. But, there's not a darn thing anyone who reads this can do about it, so I'm not going to share. I'll have to deal with it on my own.  Anyways, Saturday night I had a DDR Party. Though, we didn't play TOO much DDR. We hasd a fire in a barrel, and we roasted marshmallows and sparred and played in the rain. Then we played DDR and got in the pool. Ooh! and me and Nick got to kiss in the rain! I've been wanting to do that since we started going out. I dunno why, I just really wanted to. lol Well, I've gotta go. So, I'll blog at you all later. I'll TRY my best to blog at least once a week from now on.  Love, Shannon "Don't waste your time on me you're already the voice inside my head."--Blink 182
