I know that I should talk to her or say something...but shes pushing me...pushing me to do things that later she'll regret, because all I have to say is, 2 years, Im out on graduation night. She always tells me that I think the world revolves around me and shes wrong...she thinks its revolves around her and if she doesnt get what she wants shes gotta get mad and take it out on me so that Im the one that has to suffer with her. Shes just trying to make me grow up to fast, just because she had to. Just because she had to miss out on fun doesnt mean thats how I should live my life. You would think that would mean she would want me to have a great life..but no I get dragged down, yelled at, told if I can spend my money, who I can be with, If I should be on the phone. She doesnt realize how much worse this is gonna be on her in the long run. Because if things keep going how they are...Im gone...I dont wanna say it, but Jakes family already wants me to live with them anyways, they say Im forced to grow up to fast and a bright kid like me deserves to have atleast some sort of fun in my life. But nope...not me...I dont deserve anything, Im forced to go places I dont want, do things I dont want. You would think she would understand that if she just loosend up that I might actually be around more. I guess I know where I get my "the world revolves around me" from. Takes one to know one is what I like to say. Its funny to me how people say the know and understand but have no clue. Just because there life sucks they have to drag everyone else down with them. I mean Tracy feels more like the mom I should have, I also hate to say that, butI mean geez...everyone should have atleast one moment of fun in there lives. Thats okay though...2 more years....parties, no curfew, no worrying about money, no more being quite, no more...STRESS!!! IM JUST GONNA LET EVERYTING GO!!!! Im just gonna let it all go...Im gonna step outside scream as loud as I can and thats when you know...IM OUT! Im gonna live my life everyday how it should be lived...not worrying about what time it is or a schedule or being quite or having to do this before then...nope NOTHING! The people you think would most understand, dont know a thing. They're the ones that are gonna get hurt later and not even know it...so all I have to say is I hope the people this was ment for read it and understand instead of throwing things out of proportions. Those 3 words are everything to me... 2 More Years
