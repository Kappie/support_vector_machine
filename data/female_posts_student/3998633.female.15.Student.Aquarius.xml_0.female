As I was watching I love the 90's on VH1 I thought 'Who is so bored that they read blog's?' Because the only blog's I read are the one's of my friends, and I hardly even read those. Unless you crush has a blog, who would bother reading them? I would write more but I am leaving for a plane, so I will leave you with some songs I am listening to right now.  Paulina Rubio- Algo Tienes Fobia- Hoy Tengo Miedo Belinda- Angel (in Spanish, like the above two) Jc Chasez- All Day Long I Dream About Sex (gross lyrics, but kick-butt beat) Felix Da Housecat- Rocket Ride The Streets- Don't Mug Yourself Dead or Alive- You Spin Me Around (Like a Record) The Killers- Somebody Told Me
