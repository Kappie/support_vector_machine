I'm not sure how this works, this could be good karma for some drama that recently occurred at school, or this could be bad karma for wishing for too many things to change, disguised as good karma...either way here goes the story..  The Armenian pops his head in the door and says, "...hey I gotta message from Hat (that's what we'll call him), he says that you are lookin' fine and that song dip it low...well, it reminds him of you...", What??  Great, I think...I don't even know what song that is, probably some garbage about booty shaking and dirty dirty sex....but I am, however compelled to find out what is this song...and how does it remind him of me..?  An array of Kazaa searches later, in between all the new pop-ups I now have to close since installing the newer version despite being warned by a wise roommate that warned me, there it was "Dip it Low" Christina Milian, downloading in progress..  "Take your time..feel him out..when he's a good boy, a really really good boy, why not let him lay with you, that's when you give it to him good..."  Ok, for those who haven't seen this video...SHE IS SMOKIN', Definitely the next Beyonce or even better...very seductive, very mysterious, totally in control, with some very wicked dance moves.  Since the reference to Beyonce, I was unable to see the literal connection between her, the song and me, but I remember the incident that fueled Hat's interest...It was mysterious, seductive, and filled with some pretty cool dance moves...(i.e. a drunken night's make out session with plenty of dancing involved, this is where all my trouble starts under those strobe lights)...maybe this was it..  "...Dip it low, pick it up slow, roll it all around and make your back go..Pop.."  It's not so much that I want him or want anything more from that night, but it's more like there's this confident, sexy man who knew me as a little goof, but now sees me as this "sexy little minx.."  It's the fact that HE wants me that makes me hot..God that's sick right, I think he's sexy too, but noone I would sleep with or date, more like a good friend to have. He's intensely strong and un-rattleable, this is too intimidating for someone like me.  If you're too smooth, that means eventually I'm going to get duped, and if there is always an answer I'm going to run out of questions.  Maybe he would never understand the fact that sometimes these sweaty palms of mine need holding before entering a big building with many, many socialites...I already have this amazing presence in my life who sees everything and brings me this wholesome happiness...he's the man I dream about "dipping it low on.." (see previous entry)..hat seems to be drawn to "Drunk D", my alter ego, confident, sexy, hilarious, never at a loss for words and a huge flirt....I   "Late at night, he's comin' home..meet him at the door with nothin' on...."  You see, I've never really been objectified, so that's probably why this feels so invigorating, after I reread this I'm probably going to confuse myself as to whether I want to be appreciated as an intellect or a "sexy little minx", who knows, I know it's going to be short lived this novelty of feeling kinda sexy, but I guess one might see me with a little extra strut in my loafers, button down shirt and white coat today...
