We will go to London to see the 8pm performance of STOMP then afterwards go to Planet Hollywood for a final meal. Woooooo!  I am seeing James tomorrow and on Monday I will be seeing all of them as we are going to London. Yay. I know you guys may be seeing T3 but rememeber it is an 18 so dress maturely. Lol.
