Today I actually went in early to my dad's office. But now I'm sitting at home waiting for the mail to get here. We both want something in it so I decided to go home for a while and wait for the bastard...I meant postman, to get here. It's the worst feeling in the world to see him driving away without giving you anything, so bad that I called my dad to ask if he was coming back...so supposedly he is...so I'm making a little post whilst I await.  And then back to the mean city.   Tears.
