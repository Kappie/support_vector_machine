For the project, she wants to use Spitzer to look at active galactic nuclei to learn how they relate to the evolution of their galaxies. Seyfert galaxies are the nearest and brightest AGN galaxies, so those are the ones that wil be studied. My job right now is to look through the hubble space telescope archives and compile a list of images for all the seyfert galaxies that will be looked at in this project, 87 in all. Yesterday, I also went with Dr. Easton to visit the RIT observatory. They have two telescopes, 16'' and 12". He explained to me a little about how the computers and CCD cameras work and their history. I will hopefully get a chance to use them sometime.
