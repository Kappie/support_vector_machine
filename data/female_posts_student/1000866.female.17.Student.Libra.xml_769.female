I don't honestly think it's possible to achieve world peace. I think it's a great goal to aspire to if it helps, but I'd rather aspire to the goal of just trying to do something nice for someone every day. If everyone did that, yeah, maybe we wouldn't achieve world peace, but we'd be a lot closer.  And, I'm not really sure where that thought comes from. i just started typing, and that's what came out of my little fingers.  Last night was so much fun. I was absolutely taken away by the corps. I'm so glad Carson invited me. It was terrific to hang out with her and great to see all the corps. It was funny. One of them played Savannah River Holiday. I sat there for a few minutes trying to figure out why I recognized the song. It was pretty amusing. I was like...wow, I know what's coming up in this song!  As of today, no plans yet. It just feels good to sleep in on occasion now because there isn't any summer school.  The DCI show last night actually made me sort of excited for marching band. However, I know everyone wont feel as excited and pumped up so, I know not everyone will try as hard. That's the way it is every year. Especially since this year is a Disney year, there are of course people who join just for Disney. So, those people wont care about the show aspect so much, but...I'm still going to give it my all.
