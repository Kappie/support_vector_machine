I'm HER B-Day Present.  As far as being there to wish me AT 12am was my mom, wei, russ and ross ;-). 4:16 is the actual time of delivery and welll I was a month early... Did the partying and now well... More.  The princess hat will only be used for one more day sadly.  Thank you EVERYONE, much love.  It wouldn't be much of a life without my friends and family and I love you all very much for being there and helping making this world great!
