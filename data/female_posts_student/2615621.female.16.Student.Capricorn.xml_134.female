I emailed my dad a letter to give to her when she was in the hosptial, he read it to her just before she died. I'm glad i wrote that letter. I wish i would have saved a copy of it. I wrote nice stuff, nothing like "howcome you didnt call me on my bday and tell me merry christmas?" I did the right thing. These people kept asking me about my uncle and how his health is. supposedly, he's dying, or in "bad health" as most of them said. Did i know that? no. Someone asked me where i got my beautiful blonde hair. "my moms whole family is blonde" and they would say "oh but doesnt your aunt gale have blonde hair?" hell if i know. i figured she must, so i said, yeah she does, maybe i got it from my dads side also. I didnt even know what color hair she had. I'm stuck in this world i feel like im suppose to be a part of, but i feel so distant. I love my dad...and i love his family, but only in a natural, gentic kinda way. I know nothing about them. These people have neglected me for over 10 years. And now im expect to come into a strange world and act like i love them and everything is great? It's so confusing.   Anyways...kaela sent me an email today and i was sooo excited! haha shes my best friend in the whole wide world and i miss her sooo much! this is truly a test of our friendship. We've been through so much. We go to different schools, we live on different sides of town...we have different friends. I was sooo glad to hear from her.
