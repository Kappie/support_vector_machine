My frens and some classmates saw me crying..but they know  that i need some quite time ALONE. Thanks. I appreciated that. But wat i needed the most then was a shoulder for me 2 lean on. But no one was there. I was thinking...why am i alive? The world seemed so unreal to me.It seems to be jus a dream, with all hazy effects and floating feeling...I hate my life... When i came online jus now, Pins tried to console me..but to no avail.  I'm giving up. I'm trying 2 let her go the easy way. But it seems so difficult and the agony it brought me was unbearable. I felt like commiting suicide during recess, by taking excessive panadols. i haf them in my bag, i could try. It wouldn't be that painful..rite? But apparently i did not. Or else i won't be here already. I'm at a lost. With nobody to help me. I might as well just give up living. Sometimes i reali think that the only thing that keeps me alive is  HOPE . But i seem to run out of it already. I feel that the moment i stop hoping, my chest will forever stop rising.  Where is my help?  When will it arrive?  Till then will i still be able 2 carry on? I dunnoe.
