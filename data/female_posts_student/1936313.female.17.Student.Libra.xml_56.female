I quit. No two weeks notice - I'm walking away. Crawl under the bed and never get out.      I miss you, miss you so bad I don't forget you, oh it's so sad I hope you can hear me I remember it clearly  The day you slipped away Was the day I found it won't be the same      I want mommy. I want Michael back. I want the whole world to just stop and go away. Just GO AWAY! Everyone...  If I believed in hell.... I'd rather be there than here.      I didn't get around to kiss you Goodbye on the hand I wish that I could see you again I know that I can't      If anyone needs me I'll be hiding under the bed waiting for darkness to overtake...  It's worse at night.. but at night no one can see the tears.  I quit.     I had my wake up Won't you wake up I keep asking why And I can't take it It wasn't fake It happened, you passed by  Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go Somewhere I can't bring you back Now your gone, now your gone There you go, there you go, Somewhere your not coming back
