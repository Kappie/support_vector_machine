It was nice.But I was unwell with migraine-y auras... at least I was without the migraine.           And I was looking forward to being paid while sipping vodka tonics and mingling  with young, single doctors. Did I mention that a goodly number of the doctors there were old and/or married? In fact, I believe they all were. There was one really young internist (female) who was there. Totally nice! I'd like to be friends with her. Oh well, who knows if I'll even see her again   .               So I went home early (I sayearly sarcastically, I got to work at 6:30 am, andgot home at 7:15 pm, but at least I didn't have to stay for the cleanup until 8), snuggledthemuttpuppy, and watched Things IHate About You on Bravo.                         I have decidedI do NOT like that show. It could have been that I didn't like the people,or that it makes menot want to ever live with a boy because the ones they'vehad on the show have been yucky... Mind you I don't have brothers,so I've NEVER had that sort of experience. If it turns out that all boys are not yucky like that, let me know, and I'll happily believe you.
