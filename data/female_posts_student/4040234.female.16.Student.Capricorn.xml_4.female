Yeah... ITS FUCKING GREAT.... I've been working wayyyy to much.  I just wanna kill myself.  I'm scheduled for 4 hrs and endup staying 6.  I'm just way too helpful.  I 'm just gonna not do anything and hopefully get sent home early.  The money isnt even worth it, because I'm too tired to spend it.  OH well... Soccer starts tom.  fun fun fun.   10-12 in the morning 6-8 in the evening and work in between.  YES YES YES!!!   Laura works at panera now... thats fun...    Grrrr.  So i was making sandwiches on line today and I cut my finger.  Owww.  Ya it was bleeding and everything.  Then matt put a bandaid on it and made me wear a finger condom.  yes a finger condom have you ever heard of such a thing.  Well i guess u smaller guys have but still...  I get into these rages where I just get really mad at whoever is by me.  You dont ever have to kno me and I'll get really pissed at you.  Its kinda bad cuz then i just flip out.  oh well.   Talk to Nate, told him I met the man of my dreams,  just to tick him off.  He got all offensive.  Like ok well just call me now and then and tell me about the man of your dreams.  haha its funny.  Maybe he'll finally realize that he's no where near perfer, or being the man of any ones dreams.  HaHa sucks for him.   so last night I went to a fair w/ carm, erin, marisha, and mar.  That was great.  First paul calls me and tells me hes going and I'm like oh great, we can meet up, so we're talking and we're like Im at the front but i dont see you.  So after about 20 mins of this he's like... OH we're at different fairs.  Nice job.  i was like oh wow.. thats just great.  so there was this fish game and u had to a ball in the bowl and u won a fish.  so we all tried and spent like $15 as a group on winning a fish.  Finally I got a ball in the bowl and won a fish... it was hysterical.. we starting jumping and yelling when we won.  We named him Nemo.  Sadly nemo died this morning... he was only yeh big.. Oh well I'll get a new one.. lol.. Ok well Im out.. Im really tired.. ill write whenever I get a chance to breathe again! lol
