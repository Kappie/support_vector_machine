Then when I was making the new page, it crashed several times, and I totally locked up the system. Then I tried burning a cd, and toooootally messed it up, the computer freezing and junk on me. Then on Wednesday it was too hot :P And Ayla was getting difficult. She sees herself as my equal, and not me in a bigger position. Which at times can be QUITE annoying. So we went to Mattick's yesterday, to play mini golf. Nick couldn't come liked planned, couldn't get a stupid ride. Went to my house first, to get my bike. I had to walk through the cob-weby forest. I hate that. Then I went to go pump up my tires, and discovered the little bike wheel cappy thing was BROKEN. Right now it's fixed by duct tape, holdingit together. Not pleased though. Then we get to my place, after Ayla beating me at mini golf (but only by three points), and Ayla didn't want to leave, she wanted to go on the computer, so I yelled at her, and we went. Had to walk up through the forest AGAIN. Ran into a stick or something, and scratched up my foot nicely. Finally got to Ayla's house, talked to David and Caran outside, and then went inside to attempt to cool off myself and the house. Turn on the music, just sit down to relax...and my cell rings. I run to go get it..And this is where things got worse, and scarier.  I answer the phone. I can tell by the ring (custom rings rock) that it's Mom, or someone else in my family. I pick it up, and mom's hysterically crying and stuff on the other end, she's cut her foot, it's bleeding everywhere, she needs to go to the hospital, and I need to be there. I start freaking out. I must have ran outside next, and then David and Caran told me to call an ambulance for Mom. So I did, shaking very badly, Ayla comes to the house finally and is filled in, I hang up, Mom's already called the ambulance. I was all prepared to run home, but Ayla had her bike ready for me, and then David told me to get in his truck. We drive down to the house,I run inside with David trailing behind me. I walk in, and there's blood everywhere in the dining room, and up the stairs to the kitchen where Mom is. She was conscious, luckily, I don't know what I would have done if she wasn't. Got her some pillows, and some clothes and David elevated and put pressure on her foot to try and stop the bleeding. I put paper towels everywhere to stop the cat from getting in the blood (but it turns out she's afraid of it anyways) and locked up the house, grabbed Mom's shoes, purse, water and my purse. The ambulance came and we took her to Sanpen, and she ended up getting about 6 stitches. And she can't walk, cause it hurts so damn much. Plus, when she cut her foot, she managed to slice some of her nerve in there, if not all of it, so she can't feel most of her left foot (where the cut is.) She still doesn't really know what happened, and if the scissors went in about another inch or so, she would have hit an artery, and she prolly wouldn't have made it. Pretty goddamn scary.   So yesterday pretty much sucked. And today, as well as yesterday, I had to help out mom do everything, cause obviously she can't do it. And I get to do it until someone else comes home, and/or she can walk on her foot. Yay.....not. But it's a small price to pay. And I dunno. I'm home in the morning anyways. The sad thing is, is that she was cutting out fabric (hence the sharp, deadly scissors) and she bleed all over it...it's dryclean only and cost her nearly $100 for it. So it's pretty expensive stuff, and we've been doing so much to it to try to get the blood out and save it, so it won't be a complete waste. It's really pretty stuff though, blue-ish, but with a purple shine to it..it's gorgeous.  Anyways, I can't leave my mother too long, and I need to check on the fabric, lunch, and the stuff on the line. As well as the stuff that I wanted/needed to do as well. Ciao.
