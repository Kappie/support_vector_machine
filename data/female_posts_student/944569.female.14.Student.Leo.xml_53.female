Why do we all have low-esteem? I have it too but i guess we should truly be proud of ourselves for who we are! If ur ugly as me then DON'T WORRY!  It doesnt matter!  Beauty inside is numero uno!  Keep ur soul and heart pure and, if you have a crooked nose or a potbelly or wutever, you will always look beautiful!  U realize, beauty isnt silky hair fair skin and light voice ( mine is squeaky like Alvin and the chipmunks).  Beauty is the kindness in your face and laughter.  Would you not say an ugly person like me who is mostly laughing with friends and enjoying the simple pleasures of life is a lot better than a beautiful yet cold person?
