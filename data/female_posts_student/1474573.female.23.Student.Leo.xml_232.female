When my friend asked me to read I thought that it was going to be this tiny room/party or in a club/or bar. No, there were multiple stages and art shoes, a hookah bus, this weird slingshot contraption that folks were riding.....I ended up having a *special* cupcake. Never had one before and didn't really believe in it's "special"ness considering that it didn't cost very much.......I was more hungry than anything. Soon there were at least 2000 people at this thing. I ended up running into alixa and naima and Farbeon and his girlfriend...It was really great... right under the manhattan bridge, right next to the water, I haven't been near the water in a while.....  still  kinda of weird. AT least too weird to be there alone with the cupcake kicking in. I ended up leaving right around the time that the naked guy started walking around...... I don't remember much after that,  just that the line to get in was around the block....       My shadow’s Shedding skin and I’ve been picking Scabs again. I’m down Digging through My old muscles Looking for a clue.   -tool
