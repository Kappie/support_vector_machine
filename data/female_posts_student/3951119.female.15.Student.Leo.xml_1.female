That the God who created the universe and everything in it, the God of infinite power and glory and wisdom loves you. And who are you in this world? How small are you? Such a short time we spend on this earth, so few people ever knowing we even exist. You barely a blip on the radar, a vapor in the wind. Yet on a planet of 6 billion other people, the Creator of the universe loves  you . He wants you to know him and love him as he knows and loves you. He desires an intimate relationship with you.  Now this, you're going to think I've gone crazy. But just read a little more. God esteems you more important than Himself. I'm serious!  Phillipians 2:3 - Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself.  True, this is Paul speaking to the Philippians, but God never tells us to do anything He does not do.  1 Peter 2:24 - Who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness, by whose stripes you were healed.  Now why would he do such a thing? Because he loves us that much. It says that He did not even resemble a human being by the time he was finally crucified. He did that because he loves you. It you were the only person on the planet, he would have done that to save you.  Romans 12:10 - Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giging preferance to one another.   It's amazing how much God loves us. It's amazing that He loves us at all! Why do we not seek Him as he pursues us?
