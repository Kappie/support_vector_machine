If you're not already involved with someone, it's only because you want a guy/girl who's worthy of your love---you just haven't met him/her yet. That's cool. You've got plenty of other interests to keep you busy. When you do meet ''Mr. Great/Miss. Great,'' chances are you won't abandon all the other impotant stuff in your life for romance. In fact, your independance and spirit will be part of what attracts him/her---and keeps him/her. Would YOU PLEASE rate my quiz?

For the OLDER GALS/GUYS!      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    M'S: Just like the candy. you're soft on the inside, but have a protective shell so you don't melt for all things sentimental. While you're not going to forget what's important to you (like friends, school and the cool activities that make you such an interesting girl), you're also open to romance in whatever form it might take. You'll have an amazing V-Day, whether you spend it with a cute boy or have a girls night out. Would YOU PLEASE rate my quiz? Thanks a whole bunch!     urlLink How ROMANTIC are YOU? For the LADiES!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    THE FREETHINKINER: I like you, and I don't even know you. Who wouldn't? You have your own opinions---and are confident enough to voice them---but you're also willing to listen to the other side. And you're not afraid to try new stuff even when your friends aren't interested. For example, if you were dying to see Linkin Park in concert and no one else wanted to go, you'd still be there rockin' out. Basically, you rule.     urlLink How INDEPEDNDANT are YOU?
