If you are ever in the situation where you would like to say "Whatever" and "Shutup" at the same time, do what Brittnee does and combine the two to make the word "shutever".  Lol, i dunno what we were on last night....but it was funny.  We got on the subject of which guy has the sexiest/most beautiful hands EVER.  And we had a winner, but we can't tell you who he is because you probably know who he is.  sorry!  You can bet he's a hockey player though, lol.  We decided that the guys who had the most sexiest/beautiful hand on the Dallas Stars was a tie between Niko Kapanen and Jason Arnott.  It was close, very very close.  Which reminds me, Stars lost last night......argh.  I have to hand it to them that we did try, but we just couldn't get that cursed puck into the net.  The Florida Panthers Goalie needs to die.  So now right when we were just getting past our sucky start to the season and we were #3 in division....we lose and now we're #4, thank god only Anaheim had a game to play and win that night.  If we can win against Tampa Bay tonight......which is an extreme maybe....then we'll get our #3 spot back and if san jose loses their game and we win another game, we'll take the #2 spot.  So basically, our success depends on other teams that we aren't playing at the moment losing and us possibly winning.  New Jersey's doing rather well!!  If they win another game they'll be tied with Phillie, provided that Phillie loses or whatever.    Oh yeah so anyways, about me and Brittnee's sleepover thing.  Remember the guy that was 18 that she gave her phone number to that was the Verizon hick guy's brother and she hardly knew him?  Yeah well he called and was all like "Hey you wanna go to a party?".  Brittnee's like "what do i do?" and she tells him that no, she doesn't want to go because she's hanging out with me tonight.  He's all like pressuring her into going or letting him come over to my house to visit or whatever.  And she's running out of excuses to tell him why she can't go this college party thing.  Finally, she says "i can't go because i have no clothes to wear besides my pajamas" and he says to her "you can't wear none of your friend's clothes?" And i'm sitting there thinking, this guy's a bastard and he's waaaay to desperate.  So then Brittnee hands me the phone and i tell the guy straight up "No, you can't come to my house, she can't go to your stupid party, and i don't trust you because your 18, we don't know you period and you go to college with people we don't know." And i was really close to adding that he was a hick too and annoying as hell and that he needs to learn proper english, but Brittnee grabbed the phone from me before i could get that far.  But then he made her give the phone back to me and he asks "She can't wear none of your clothes?".  Oooh man i was sooo close to yelling at him about his article agreement and english pronunnciation, but i just said ;She can't because our styles are different" adn then i handed the phone back to Brittnee.  She told him period that she couldn't go and that was final but then she asked me if he could come over to my house! i was like "hell no, he can't! my parents are going to be home any minute and if your mom finds out she's going to kill you."  So Brittnee told him that he couldn't do that either and she'd talk to him later that night.  He calls TEN MINUTES LATER and asks her if she wanted to go to that party AGAIN.  She said no i can't, call me later tonight ok.  He ended up calling us SIX MORE TIMES THAT NIGHT.  3 of those at 1am, 3am and 4:30am.  WHEN NORMAL PEOPLE SLEEP even after partying.  So yeah, next time he calls, we're going to tell him to Fuck off and leave us alone.  Hope Mr. Hick Boy gets the message.  Yeah so i have to go now, lol love you Brittnee even though you call guys that are 18 and you don't know!  Go Stars!,  ~~~Taylor~~~
