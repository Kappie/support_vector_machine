Hard to believe that in 3 weeks I will be living on the other side of the country!! Jody and Tiff, let me know when to expect you. :):):):):) I finally have a place to live and it is beauuutimus! (for those of you that don't know, beauuutimus is defined as an exceptionally extreme amount of beauty) I will be about 2 blocks from the water!  Hope all is well with everyone!
