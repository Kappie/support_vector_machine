I don't want to just play around anymore. This sucks like a mother. I still don't feel like talking. Tomarrow is gonna be fun. O yeah. I get to do the 1600, 4 X 2 relay, the 200m dash, and the longjump. Great. Yeah, so I guess Im a distance runner now. That kinda sucks. But, it's okay.  Tomarrow will be fun. As long as I think that I've got nothing to loose..right? I hope so. I need to make a new mix for track. That way I've got stuff I can think of.  Saving me from all of this, would just be too much for you. Don't bother.
