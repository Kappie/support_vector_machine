When I first saw Harry Potter, I thought the others were better. But now that's I've seen it again, I really like that one better. I just don't like the changes the director has made (like calling Dumbledore 'Headmaster' all the time, changing the grounds and positions of things like the Gryffindow common room, making the students wear normal clothing most of the time). There wasn't enough Quidditch, and the lightning part was ridiculus. Also, Dementors don't fly!! >.  It didn't give justice to the book, but as a movie it's really great (the humour is greater, even though the movie is darker). ...Draco's a great bitch too...
