I went for the sole purpose of casing and listening.  2 middle aged men (ex-hippies, one of whom tried very unflatteringly to hit on me by talking about my book and telling me how he's part of the system now since he bought a house and pays property taxes.  I didn't know he was hitting on me until his inebriated friend told me.  Either my radar's off, or he's really bad at it) who played Jimmy Buffet and Led Zepplin and some very bluesy original stuff, and a younger guy who did some (very good) DAve Matthews covers.  Maybe I SHOULD show up next week to throw some folk and estrogen in the mix.
