Even though the marriage issue isn't resolved...we've decided we like being happy together way more then we'd like being lonely apart. I'm sure eventually he'll really need one, but until then, I guess he's stuck with me.     The new mission I have in life is finding my roomate (who is also Joel's brother, for those of you who don't know.) Eric is a terribly nice guy who has trouble meeting girls you would want to stick around. I've put his picture on several personals websites, and sneakily diverted those girls here to this website, so that they can learn a little more about him.     Eric is handsome and driven. He works as a claims auditor at AFLAC. He's been in college, taking his time (like me) for almost 6 years now. He's a business finance major. He's supernice, he just has issues with the wrong kind of girl being attracted to him. He's very responsible, but likes to have a good time. I have known Eric for 7 years now. I have been dating his younger brother, Joel, for 6 of those seven. Despite recent problems, Joel and I are doing well, and think Eric needs to go out on dates. He had his heart broken about 4 years ago by his first love, and has been uncapable of finding decent female friends ever since. Help a brotha out! Give Eric a Holla! You can email Eric at jledge@knology.net I hope this information is useful. ;)    I'll keep you all posted on the search!
