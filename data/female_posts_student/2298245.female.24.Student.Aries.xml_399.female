Today, the main news headline read as follows:   Breaking News:  Some Still Angry at Reagan.   There are so many things wrong with this.  First of all, duh.  Of course there are still people angry at Reagan.  I'm sure the same will be said upon the death of every ex-President, as those involved in politics are likely to draw the wrath of at least half of the country.  This is doubly true when you are the most visible politician of your nation, and the most visible representative of your nation's political character to the communities of the world.  It is even more true for someone like Reagan, who spoke what he felt to be the truth, no matter what and without much regard to how others might feel about it, for someone who felt there were more important things to a political identity than polling data.  But this headline fails to articulate with any specificity exactly why people are so angry with Reagan and his legacy.   Clicking on the headline and then the article to which it refers, one arrives  urlLink here , to an article that mainly focuses on Reagan's dealings with the AIDS crisis that unfolded during the course of his Presidency, but also talks of his many other purported sins, one of which is, oddly enough, signaling and starting the rise of conservatism in Washington:   Bruce Cain, a political analyst at the University of California, Berkeley, said Reagan singularly brought conservatism into the mainstream during his presidency, an orthodoxy that has made Democrats and liberals an enduring minority in Washington.   ``What made things worse for them is that he was an extremely influential figure, and his ideas had lasting impact,'' Cain said.    Oh, the horror.  There's nothing worse than them conservatives, is there?  And then there's this:   Reagan also dealt a blow to organized labor by firing the striking air traffic controllers, and appointed Antonin Scalia, still the Supreme Court's most conservative jurist.    Ack, how dare he appoint a brilliant conservative jurist to the Supreme Court.  What could he have been thinking?  News flash guys:  he was a conservative.  And he was also elected overwhelmingly to the Presidency...twice.  You can qualify this by saying that he just happened to be in the right place at the right time, or that his opponents were weak.  But the way some people talk, it sounds as if Reagan instigated a coup and then forced his views and his will upon an unsuspecting nation.  The debates about Reagan went on in his own time, and his detractors lost.  If you're looking for someone to blame, don't blame Reagan.  Blame the voters.  Then there's the obligatory "other side of the story" paragraph:   Critics give Reagan grudging credit for his ability to connect with working-class voters, who would come to be known as Reagan Democrats. He also galvanized conservative Christians to participate in the political process - even while putting some of their more prized goals on the back burner, like restricting abortion rights or restoring prayer in public school.    But they quickly bring it back to "reality" and finish up with a bang:   In the end, critics say Reagan's enduring legacy may be the generation of Republican leaders - including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, House Majority Leader Tom Delay, and to some extent George W. Bush - who came of age during his presidency and have pursued a conservative social agenda with even greater gusto. That, in turn, helped create the bitterly divided political environment that exists to this day.   ``The tone has gotten more venomous, largely because of the people who came after Reagan and carried the Reagan banner,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of Campaign for America's Future, a liberal advocacy group. ``I give him full credit for unleashing the vast right-wing conspiracy.''    Right.  His most enduring legacy won't be, say, winning the Cold War or anything.  It won't be defying the expectations of those very critics by not launching us into nuclear oblivion and instead resolving the situation with peace and dignity.  Instead, it'll be spawning the rise of conservatism and giving us the likes of Tom Delay.    I suspect that either way, he'd take the credit, and be proud to take it (well, perhaps all except the Tom Delay part - I cannot quite reconcile Reagan's firm but civil tone with Delay's brutal and uncivil one).  But I just as easily come to the conclusion that this analysis is wrong.  I will not debunk all of the claims made against him in the article.  There are other people with much more knowledge and much more skill to do so than me.  For one example, see  urlLink Andrew Sullivan on Reagan's response to the AIDS crisis  (and really on everything else related to Reagan - skim the whole blog for mentions), where he not so much debunks but clarifies.  I would never argue that Reagan was perfect, or that he didn't make mistakes.  Of course he made mistakes.  He was just a human being like everyone else in this world.  None of our President's have been perfect.  And none ever will be, even if the machines one day take over the job.   But my main beef with this article is that it seeks to blame, or more accurately quotes those who seek to blame, Reagan for the current brand of conservatism on display in the Republican party.   But, again, Reagan was only one man, and I'd argue that he was less the cause and more the response to it.  The 60s and 70s, and the events that transpired, with social liberalization and the constitutionalization of abortion, as well as a whole other host of political issues, is what gave rise to modern social conservatism.   If liberals want to see the true cause of the rise of conservatism as it is today in the United States, they need only look within.  And I do not say this in a bad way.  But whenever there is a popular political movement, one opposed to it quickly rises to meet it, and will often surpass it.  I think we may be on the brink of it swinging back the other way, if Republicans are not careful.  These things are cyclical, and if anything, liberals should take it as a great compliment to the power of their movement that such a strong response rose to meet it.  The problem now is that they keep looking backward, and it is this that will keep them from regaining power, if anything can.    So if you're unhappy with the state of the union today, don't look back to blame Reagan.  Look ahead and try to do something to change it.
