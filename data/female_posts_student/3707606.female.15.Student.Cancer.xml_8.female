So we finished our L.A. exam... one more to go! yay! And then I was hanging around the school and my friend didn't wanna take the bus home so she came to my house for a bit and we made fries.... they were frozen fries but they were still pretty damn good! lol and then she had to go but it was all good.  And then so yeah... I called Chad and talked to him on the phone for awhile and then when my dad got home... cause he doesn't want us here by ourselves... Chad came over and yeah we hung out in the basement for a bit (i hadn't seen him in a week! so sad lol) and then well we went further than we have b4 which was awesome lol... Further being like making out but still... thats as far as I've ever been pretty much and it was pretty nice lol... and since I'm his first girlfriend... he was kinda worried or nervous I guess and yeah he was so cute about it.. and I mean I don't have a ton of expeirience or anything close to but yeah it was sweet.  And then he tells me about this dream he had... and like he was on a ship or something and there was a bomb planted in it and it blew up and he died.. but he came back as a ghost and like I could still see him and stuff but like... we couldn't like feel each other there and stuff.. man he told it better than I can but like... It made me cry... I donno it got to me... the whole him dying and I couldn't be in his arms and stuff and like I started like crying and yeah.  Then I went to Wendy's for supper... and we were supposed to go see my mom in the hospital cause it was her birthday and we were gonna bring cake and a few of her friends were gonna come but she was feeling really crappy so only my dad went. But we picked up the vase I made for her from the art studio and I filled it with flowers from her garden and gave it to my dad to bring to her... so at least she'll have something and it'll be something new for her to look at.  And you know whats even better.... Chad got the dates changed so he's going to be her efor my birthday! yay! that makes the day even that much better.
