"man, these overseas girls just love me!" when is he gonna realize that i dont care! i dont go tellin him about my love life, first of all bcuz its not fair 2 him, and second of all bcuz its none of his business. man, im ready 4 school 2 b over! 2 more days. if these tests dont kill me first. well at least i didnt take an ECD exam cuz we already wrote a case study instead. so i was glad 4 the break b4 my gov test. but yea we just presented r case studies and had donuts and stuff. which was good, considering i woke up at 6:50 this mornin, and didnt eat breakfast. so that was cool. i just finished writin my formula sheet 4 algebra 2morrow, and im takin a break b4 studyin 4 bio. i might b goin 2 the mall in a little while. ill study when i get back. or mayb ill go 4 a run when i get back and study later. hmmm, a run sounds much more appealing. so i guess i should go now. i think i've written 2 much. lol i didnt know i had that much 2 say.
