Bungee jumping "....." maybe best not to repeat what I said when we bungee jumped...hehehe. Now today, riding the cable car up the hill....thinking the whole time "We're going to die...would I rather the call fall there, or here....we're so going to die..." Hehehe...  Willeke always makes me hyper. *grins* How could anybody be not, when they have to put up with "banana land" and god knows what else she's said to me....  hm...quick recap I think. I'll do the same thing Mal does...  Tuesday: Surfing thing. Already taked about that.  Wednesday: Didn't do much (that I can remember) until the evening, appart from Gabby (yay, Gabby! She's cool!) coming over and showing me all these different Brasilian artists. I'm going to burn a cd of music before I come home, and maybe keep practising the...my pathetic portuguese when I'm back in Canada. ;)Carlos, Maju, Matt and I went out for Mexican. Then, since the Mexican place ripped us off (hehhem, they gave us doritos. It wasn't nachos, or tacos, or what ever the hell we ordered. It was Doritos.) So, we went out for pizza. (The same place we went before with Lyndon, with the chocolate and cheese pizza...) This time we had um...Bacon and Pineapple on one, and Frango on the other. Excuse me, chicken. I wasn't that hungry, (hehehe) and I only ate about half a piece.  Thursday: Gabby came over in the afternoon and we watched Gilmore Girls on tv. ^_^I love Gilmore Girls....*shifty eyes* In the evening, We (Maju, my host mum and I) went to Beira Mar where we had fun with the ATM trying to get it to give me some DAMN MONEY!! Hehe...needed to get that off my chest.  Friday: Spoke to Willeke, e-mailed willeke while speaking to here for a second time, and went out running/walking. I haven't been running for so long! I'm so out of shape. *sigh* I can't remember how to spell either...is it spelt haven't or havn't. Ecuse, or Excuse. Ugh,I even said Tipniklicky, instead of typically....I can't spell that anymore either...Agh! Anyway. Went to a 'goodbye Bruna/hello kate' party at Bruna's and then, after leaving that, went out for camarão...as usual, Carlos spilt something on the table. Farofa...long story with the farofa...hehehe  Today: Went to Balneário Camboriú today. Rode up the hill in the cable car went shopping...a very beautiful city. Came back...very sad. It's the full moon today. It was the full moon on the day I arrived in Brasil. That was some of my first word in portuguese (besides the traditional, 'hello, good-bye, thank-you' etc) Lua cheia....Just like tonight, that night, the night I came was very beautiful.  Hehehe...getting sappy in my old age. Of 16. My god I'm pathetic. I love seeing Floripa at night. I love seeing the bridge all lit up. I could live in Floripa happily enough. ^_^ Going out tonight to Lagoa with Maju and Carlos. There's a good-bye party for Tom (Hawaii) More people leaving. It's sad. In two and a half weeks, that'll be me.  I don't want to leave!  ugh...happy thoughts, happy thoughts....hehehe I'm understanding more portuguese now. Not when it counts (like when someones talking to me) but When I listen to conversations, I can normally follow, if not understand all (depends on the topic/how fast people are talking) of what's going on. Matt's really easy to understand, I think because he makes the difference between words, and they're clear. unlike Maju...hehehe. Neh.  I want to talk to Willeke. Bored bored...not bored. Just anxious...??? BLAHH!  -Hannah
