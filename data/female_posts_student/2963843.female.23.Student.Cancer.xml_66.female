Shuffling sounds of slippers.   Maybe I will steal a sip.  just a sip.  Savoring the exhilarating moment.  Thirsty for more.   Blinded by just a taste of sin.  Heartbeat racing.  A sparkle develops into a raging blaze.  Submissive to impulse.   Hazardous yet stunning,  As flames of passion ignite.  The devil has won.   No boundaries, no rules.  Just feel.   Indulge.
