They tend to just let secrets go to other people, especially the people the secrets are about. Not even bad secrets but just the general fact that people like to fuck with my trust. I'm too much of a pussy to do it to them but lately I've been thinking that I should. I know I wont... but I should. An eye for an eye sounds good.
