He kept getting in trouble for not paying attention and was made to run laps around the baseball feild. By the time practice over he had done 6 laps and was enjoying it. He thought it was funny to have to do the laps. He has practice again tomorrow which will be fun. Well I am going to hit the sack. I have alot to do tomorrow. Bye for now.
