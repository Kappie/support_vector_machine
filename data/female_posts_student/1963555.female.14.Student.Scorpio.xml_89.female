I think I got skinnier from all the people pushing my hips it bugged me! Then this guy (I think) kept touching my ass to get me to move so that all his friends could move close (by the way dude, very good stratigy, but it takes alot more than that to get me to back away from the stage) but I just ignored him. My mom said some older guy was checking me out the whole time too, and I think it's bull shit because no one has ever looked at me that way, but if she was right then mabey I'll get lucky in Boston, I'm moving! Anyway, David look so hot, omfg! I wanted to punch him in the face!! When they played Perfect Pierre was on acoustic, and the rest came out 1/2 way into the song but David was wearing those cat ears! he was so funny! They were pink, he kept on doing like these cat claws. And pierre was talking and then they did that whole "Yeah baby yeah!, Say it baby say it!" and then he's like whoa! I just went retarded! he's like just right now, not progressing I just went retarded! and they talked about showering, Pierre said he hadn't showered in 4 days, and David's like "my kinda style" and he said "Showering is over-rated, sleep is a weapon" he's so damn hot. Pat was there! it was so cool, I've never seen him up close, he is not bad looking at all, I got his and Seb's autograph. So the count for two conserts autograph is, Pierre-1, Pat-1, Seb-3. Yeah not even Daivd's yet! I'm kinda pissed. So my mom starts talking to Seb, and she's like "How's David, is he sleeping?" and Seb was like "uh, what do you mean?" and she said "oh well he looked tired" and he goes "oh yeah, well he's just relaxing with his....... Girl Friend" yes, it has been confirmed. David Desrosiers has a girl friend. My life is over. I was a really defining moment for me, I know I sound retarded but holy shit, I felt like I was punched. I hate having crushes! ugh!, so anyway :(, okay so We are in the mosh pit wich was awesome, and my mom kicked some guy in the ass! lol she was so happy! so I'm jumping and screaming the words and my mom is to,lol, and Pierre looked at us smiled and pointed! He saw me jumping and my 34 year old mom jumping! lol I think I love pierre now.... anyway my mom was like the only "old" peron in the middle of the mosh pit it was awesome, everyone kinda smiled at her. So Sugarcult was pretty good, I would've enjoyed it more if the stupid old lady with frizzy hair didn't keep leaning over me to talk to her friend. But they talked about how Valentines Day sucked, which I agree with, and he said that was the only day of the year he didn't wear pink,lol. Shit Valentines day is coming up! That blows. any way, they all looked so hot!! Seb growing out his hair! and David! holy shit he looks hot with his hair like that, wow! So The merch list, okay I got the same MXPX track jacket Daivd wore that night on stage! yeah, and a mxpx sticker and pin set, and SP pins that it? wow that kinda blew. but I hate to say it but the first concert was better. They swore alot more, mabey it was because it was like my first real good consert? Idk, but it was still good, like you know how they all have a special Vip place? well me and my mom are'nt vip so they have one of those velvit ropes and my mom gets the bright idea that we should go there, and I'm like "mom no we arn't alowed" and she says no no let's go, and jumpes the rope, only she can't pull that off, I can't even pull that off and her foot gets caught and she falls down spilling her beer, and bringing the velit rope with her,lol! OMFG I was dying! so after that she ran over to the seats to sit and the guard is like would you like to go in,I'm like "that you!" so if you ever want consert vip, trip on your way there and they feel bad and let you go! It was awesome so we got balcony seats to see MXPX, they were really good! they Mike sounds like Pierre but a bit older, duh. But the consert was awesome, I know I havn't written everything that has happend so over the next month I'll be adding info shit, that was a really good consert and I'm glad I went. But...... David has a girlfriend........
