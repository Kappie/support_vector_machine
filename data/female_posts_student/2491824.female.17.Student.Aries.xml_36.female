They took away my personality and randomness... But they made me feel secure. I knew I wasn't but they allowed me to at least feel like it. I know I have a damn easy life compared to many people, but I can't take it.   I've come to the point where any little stress makes me freak out. ...For example, I started crying this evening after realized that the lady who made my sub at Nick's (they have the  best  subs) put mayonnaise on what could have been an amazingly awesome turkey sub. ...I  cried  over mayonnaise on a sub.  Everything makes me want to cry... I was just reading an email... It was an ad for some snowboarding website, but I didn't understand exactly what it was trying to get at... So I nearly cried...  ...I didn't cry at my grandmother's funeral last week, but I almost cried over an advertisment in an email...  I'm pathetic....  Anyway... Tonight after rehearsal (for the student directed one-acts-- I got a fairly decent part. Yay!), I had planned on getting a delicious sub at Nick's and eat it while watching  Young Frankenstein  (Dillon let me borrow the DVD today). I was so excited. The day had been going great. I aced my monologue for my Theatre3 exam, and rehearsal went dandy. Everything was just hunky-dory! Mom took me to Nick's I got a sub and couldn't wait to get home. Once I was home, I sat down with sub took a few bites, then realized there was mayo on it. ...Why can't people just learn how to make a sandwich without putting mayonnaise on it?! ...It's not that hard!  ...Even  I  can do it! RAAAGGHHH!... So...I could deal with that... I had some tortilini left over from dinner last night that I could eat. So.. I went to get the DVD player to move it from the living room into the family room, where I am whenever I am not at school... The case for  The Pianist  was laying in front of the DVD player, so I, of course I figure it was in there... I opened the DVD player and didn't see it. Pissed, I continued to unhook the cables to move it into another room. ...Later, I was asking mom where the  The Pianist  DVD was, and I opened the DVD player again to show her it wasn't in there. Not there!.... I closed it and heard what sounded like the tray that the DVD goes on hitting something as it closed...like a DVD!... Bah... Anyway... the disc is somehow now stuck in the DVD player, so they are both probably broken now... So that screwed up my other plan for the evening... Then, like icing on the cake, Bill, my mom's boyfriend and the biggest asshole in the world comes in. I am of course still having a fit over the sub, the DVD player, and all the other shit that has gone wrong, and how worthless I am in general. And he is making fucking smart-ass comments after every thing I say, which, pisses me off even more. I stand up, yell at him to shut the fuck up (to which he makes even more fucking smart-ass comments). At this point, I can't take it any longer, so I do the only thing that ever comes remotely close to making me feel better... I pick something up, throw it around hoping that I will break something. ..I didn't break anything :\  ...I just caused Bill to yell at mom because she "needs to stop giving in to me" or some bullshit like that... (did she do anything to "give into me" tonight? no! ...well, except maybe by buying me food and by not yelling at me like everyone else when I start crying.... fucking bastard... where the hell did that get that fucking idea of "giving in"?... he needs to get his fucking head out of his ass once in awhile!)... It's hard to understand someone when his speech is almost unintelligible because of the disgustingly thick hick accent and every other word is "fuck" or "fucking" or "motherfucking" or "motherfucker"... And I'm always the one who gets yelling at for cussing...  ...So many fucking double-standards...  .....How I would love to have killed him right then and there......  ...I guarantee that if I live to be 30, I'll be in jail... probably for murder or attempted murder... so maybe people piss me off and just keep pushing me and pushing me and fucking pushing me..... I fucking try to warn them to stop, but no one fucking understands... The only way I can really express my anger is phyiscally, and I only can hold it in so long....  ...God I sound like a fucking psychopath... .....At that point, I was thinking of every possible way to seriously injure/kill myself... They only good ideas I came up with were jumping through the huge window in the family room where I was (it was on the first floor, so there wouldn't be a fall, kbut I'm sure the glass would put a hell of a hurting on me) or crashing a car going really fast into a bunch of trees... The only problem with that was I didn't have a car. But, if I did, I don't honestly know if I'd be typing this now, or if I would now or one with a tree....  ...I'm sorry to everyone I know that is reading this.... I'm sorry you had to read this... Well, you didn't " have to " read this, you did it completely under your own free-will... But still, I'm sorry....  Lately nothing has seemed fun or interesting...  I went snowboarding on Friday, and anyone who knows me knows that I love snowboarding... Did I have fun? ...No, it was boring... :\ I hated it... For most of the evening, Luke and I hung out in the lodge and the store where Joanna was working...  Not even music is appealing to me... It feels pointless to me... ...bah, I don't know how I feel... The only thing that has interested me lately is reading... I guess because it allows me to escape this place and become enthralled in another world. In books, there isn't anyone telling me that I am "wasting my potential", that I am a slacker (although that is completely true), there is no one nagging me about my grades (hey, I'm making better grades than my brothers ever did...), or doing any other fucking thing to piss me off... And, what is so great about books is that, if something does piss me off in them, I can stop reading them... And, voila!, nothing pissing me off!...   I have such a strong urge to go back to using drugs, they were such a relief... such an escape... For just a couple hours I could forget about all the problems and all the bullshit... God, that was so nice.... ...I'm not talking drugs like pot, because smoking is disgusting... I've been "craving" morphine lately... I don't whether it is because of the fact that I used to be addicted to it's little brother, codiene, or because I know I could easily overdose.... either way... :shrug:   ...I'm sorry that this post is so long...
