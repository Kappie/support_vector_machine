And yes, I'm not such a big guy, but he is fat, and that's all that needs to be said there. Heheheh. And a slick "hell yah" to ridding the evyl babysitter from your household.  Well...to make a long story less long...after the pageant we had a little mini-concert in my garage with another band called Stutter. We played our set (sucked more or less) and then Stutter got on and played one song. The parentals knocked on the door to inform us that we were being shut down...simultaneously two cop cruisers pulled up. The cop got out and made some remarks on my makeup (but was being really cool about it), asked if there was any drinking (no). J.H. brought a Gene Simmons mask and the cop asked if we had all gone to the show when KISS came here, a chorus of yeses and nos. He asked who was playing Money on the bass a couple of minutes ago, and said that Pink Floyd destroys all. Keep that mask in mind, by the way.  So, here I am in a mild state of confusion, feeling pretty tired and suddenly I see Gaddis jerk around in the garage (I was a little outside) and put his finger to his lips. I listened and heard someone playing the drums. The door from inside flew open and out comes my mom hissing that the cops are right there in the front yard. I ran inside and yelled, "Moron, the cops are looking right at you!" And the IRONY: it was a  cop  playing the drums! He asked one of the guys how to do a roll, and he was really good at it. Then, part two: the first cop to come in asks if he can wear the mask. Scrambles to get a camera. My mom got a camcorder.  The drumming cop gave us a little speech about how he can only ask us to stop but he can't enforce it because Williamson has no noise ordinances. He asks, "Ready?" We shout our approval, the one cop, now fully masked, and the other cop who just gave the speech, turn to face the camera with Gene Simmons tongues a-loll and devil horns straight at the lens. Needless to say, the aftermath was armageddoneous roaring...I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life. Then they bid us a good'n and left.  The video is absolutely amazing, I'll have to show everyone.   Alright self, breathe!
