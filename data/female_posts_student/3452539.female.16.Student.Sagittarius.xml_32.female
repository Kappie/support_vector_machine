I set the alarm on my cell to wake me up, and did it correctly, however, it did not go off. This made me iffy on the status of my phone.  I can't really remember when Tycho and I went to sleep, but I know it was after 3. Ihad planned to wake up at 6:15AM to get decked out for the assembly. Well, this morning I snapped awake and without putting my glasses back on, checked the time. I saw 6:45AM, which meant that I had 10 minutes to get ready and go. Even the clock in the kitchen seemed to say so. I rush around and book out of the door. Once I got to Marie's I was confused to see her garage door shut. I then figured that it would be best if I walked back out to the bus stop. I get back there and finally pause to look around. It was dark-ish, no construction workers were out, and my neighbor was not home yet. Very odd. I look at the time on my cell phone again only to find that it read 6:03AM. Without my glasses, I thought for sure the 5 was a 6. Oh well.  The senior assembly was postponed because Mr. Czarnecki was late. Once it finally started it was awesome as usual. Rils and I even got in the show. There was a pciture of the two of us at prom in the senior slide show lol.   Shattered dreams? No? Oh well.  Our assembly started a bit late, but I was decked out in my scally cap, duct tape vest, gold medal from BAE, and button belt. Caution tape as well. I went through school like that :-D  Brian had blue hair and his lab coat.   We got to show two movies and did our speeches. The attendance was awesome.  We also recruited a lot of new members! I now have a project of setting something up for them at the Aces High summer picnic. Which reminds me, I have to see if Tycho would like to accompany me to that...  After the assembly I spent half of my next class helping to put things away. Once I got to class, I collapsed on the floor and that was it. I remained there the rest of class.  5th period I blew through a lab very quickly so that I could finish it and sleep. Which I did some more of.  6th period, we had to accompany our teacher to the sophomore class officer elections. I slept through that too.  Got on the bus...slept.  Got home, checked on my dad who is doing great, went into my room...and slept.   Went to meeting, same old same old. A member from Techno Wizards 809 may be joining us because their team may no longer exist. Emhart is pulling out of Enfield which would take away their main sponsor.  LEGO told the Lego Maniacs basically to go fuck themselves. Not in that terminology, but team 96 no longer has sponsorship either :-(  Well, I am going to go chat now and wait to hopefully talk to Tycho tonight. Later all.   J9
