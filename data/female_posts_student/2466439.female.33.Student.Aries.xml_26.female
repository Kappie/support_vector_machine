       
      So, I'm setting off for graduate school.  I'm scared to death, honestly.  Will it be too hard?  Will it be too easy?  (I am a Recreation major, after all.)  I'm scared about doing the thesis.  I'm scared about whether the professors will like me.  I'm scared about the fact that I'm 33 and I'm committing a huge part of my life to this.  I mean, I'm sort of late in the game, here, as far as getting my Ph.D. and getting a job in academia.  Mind you, it's a little easier (or so I'm gambling) to get a Rec. job.  I hope so, because the truth is that a Ph.D. in Recreation doesn't really do a hell of a lot for me career-wise outside of academia.  I read that book,  urlLink Getting What You Came For: The smart student's guide to earing a Master's or Ph.D.   Am I really going to have to suck up that much?  The thing is that I've been a big fish in a small pond.  I'm going to a real school, now.  What will it be like?
