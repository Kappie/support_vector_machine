I met Sam's Mike who is officially the best gay man I've ever met. I would sooo take him home if I could. We went to group, and played a game then we to Bickfords and had Coffee and desserts except for Kirsten who had chicken. Our deserts took forever so they took them off the bill, which was awesome because I'm cheap. Then we went to see the village at 10:30. Obviously, we have no minds. The movie would get out at about 12:30, when we have to drive home, in the dark, alone, after a scary movie. I liked it. Me and Mike were screaming like little girls grabbing each others hands while Kirsten tried to grab his shirt and he screamed "don't pull on my shirt" which lightened the moment a little, but still I was scared. So we left and I slept over Sam's and at eight thirty we had to bring me to Drivers Ed. Then I got home, and got my nails filled. They are pretty pink and I love them. Well that's all I have to say. We are having a bbq in a few minutes. Oh yeah and I think the manicurist, not the guy who does my nails but ya know the second hand man has a crush on me. He's cute enough. Love you all. My birthday is a month from today, don't forget it. Goodbye, my friends, for all is said and done, and I shall not return, for I've fully lived lifes fun.
