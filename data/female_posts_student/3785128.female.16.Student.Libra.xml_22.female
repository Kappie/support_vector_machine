Age: 16   From: Beaver Dam, Wi   Favorite Song: o i have so many   Idol: i dont really have an idol. there are many people who inspire me but an idol is someone you look up to and want to be like. i strive to be my own person.   Do you have a job?  i am currently jobless. it sucks!  Do you have any formal singing training?  unless you count choir lessons once a week in school, no  Where have you performed before?  for my very last choir concert i had a deut. i was so proud of myself. my choir teacher was getting cut, i loved her. and the other choir teacher, who taught the two "better" choirs hated me. i didnt want to sing without Mrs. Metz.  When did you first start to sing?  umm wow. i really dont remember. i would love to say all my life but that would be a lie. ive always loved music but to pinpoint the exact moment i started singing or even give an educated guess would be impossible.  What is your favorite song to sing? the beatles. i love the beatles.   What is the first concert you went to?  it was just last summer maroon 5 and john mayer, some people who truely inspire me. it was amazing. adam, the lead singer of maroon 5 (really hot, if your reading this call me when i turn 18), was sharp for half the show. that caused me to sing along sharp. it bothered me. from my seat they were only like 4inches tall but it was still so amazing.  What is the last concert you went to?  that was actually my only concert. so ill use this space to talk about it more. it was at summerfest july 2nd 2004. im still wearing the wristband. the wristband used to say july 1st, its a little hard to read now, but they must have ran out of them that day and had to use some from the day before. i refuse to take it off. i want to see how long it lasts.   What other talents do you have?  like weird talents, i have the talent of exageration. i love this talent. for other talents i write. i love to write. kara wants me to be a writer. she read my online journal and all the stuff i write and she tell me all the time how good i am.  If you don't make it on AMERICAN IDOL, what will you do?  i actually want to do so many things i wouldnt know where to begin. ive lived in the same small town my whole life only traveling to ohio and chicago twice. i want to see the world.  What are your goals in life?  now dont laugh her im being honest. i want to start a charity. it wouldnt be designed just to help a certain group of people but to help anyone that needs it. i want to have an orphange and a homeless shelter. i really want to help the homeless. i would give them a place to stay, a phone number to put on job applications. i would give the clothes, showers, haircuts. anything they needed to get themselves back on their feet. knowing there are people in the world with no place to live, thinking nobody cares about them is enough to make me cry. i would also help people get out of bad situations, abusive situations. i just really want to help people. everyone should be happy with the life they are living.   What album would your friends be surprised you own? i love music, just music in general. my friends see that in me. they would only be suprised if i through away a cd.  What is the first CD you ever bought? i wish it was some classic album but it was nsync. everyone goes through their boy band stage.  What is in your CD player right now?i really dont know. it changes with my mood. if i feel like standing infront of my mirror singing and dancing ill throw in pop, clay aiken most likely. if i feel happy and want to stay in that mood which is most of the time i pick some oldies, beatles most likely, maybe the monkees or some motown. im sometimes in a punk mood, fefe dobson, josie and the pussycats, new found glory, yellowcard, this list goes on forever. and sometimes i listen for the words, i want something deep. jason mraz, john mayer, the beatles, coldplay, john lennon, all truely great songwriters. it all depends on me.   Who is your AMERICAN IDOL? i dont really have an idol. there are tons of people who have qualities i love. my mother is the easiest person to talk to. people come to her and open up. i love that about her. clay aiken is the purest, most genuine person i know of. everything about him just screams sincerity. john mayer, he's a writer. i want to write like him. jason mraz. i could go on about him forever. i read his road journals. he is a funny guy. also a great writer. he is so real. celebrities in my eyes sometimes seem too good to be true, just like i made them up. but not him his is real to me. the beatles, john lennon especially. writers, the best writers. they are music. they dont play music, they are the music. possibly the greatest band to walk the earth, i know in my eyes they are. i remember my mom saying something would be the greatest thing in the world and i said no, the greatest thing in the world would be if john lennon was still alive. she said i bet his wife and son would agree with you. whenever im asked if you could go back in time and meet one person who would it be. i always say ghandi or john lennon. if i could change one thing i would make sure that john lennon was never shot that night on december 8th 1980. little trivia for you, that was also my mothers 16th birthday. i dont consider anyone my idol. there are qualities i love about everyone but im not going to imitate them. im going to be me.  What is your favorite type of music?i love everything. im literally obsessed with music.  What is your favorite song?i have way to many.  Favorite male pop artist?and the list goes on. the beatles, john lennon, george harrison, john mayer, jason mraz, maroon 5, coldplay, there is more but ill stop now. Favorite female pop artist?i dont really like female singers much. maybe it is just me but i havent found a female who is able to write the deep type of lyrics that i have recently grown to worship. i love fefe dobson though. the strong beats and rock like style. josie and the pussycats. i realize it was just a movie but i love the songs.  Favorite album?once again i have too many.  Who in the music world do you think your style is most like?i really dont know. i try not to compare people. everyone is there own individual. to quote elijah wood "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self." im sure i have similarities to many musicians, especailly those who inspire me, but i would appriciate it if you didnt compare me to people with so much more experience than me.   Most embarrassing moment?o goodness. there are many. i dont want to talk about it.  If you couldn't sing, which talent would you most like to have? i wish i could play the piano or drums. im learning the guitar, well trying to learn. but i love the piano. there is something just so classic and romantic about it. you dont really see girls playing the drums that often. i dont have the corrdenation for it but it would be something i am willing to work hard for.  What has been your proudest moment in life so far? well im not really sure.  What is your definition of an AMERICAN IDOL? and idol is someone you look up to. someone you strive to be like.   Why do you want to be an AMERICAN IDOL? honestly? i want to be a singer because music is my passion. the only thing ive ever done that has felt like i was doing the right thing. im not going to stand here and say i want to be a singer for the money so i can be rich. sure the money is a part of it but it has always bothered me to watch cribs or hear about these celebrities with 3 houses, 10 cars, or something like that. its outragous. there are people in this would who dont know if they will be able to eat the next day and celebrities who only seem to care about how many diamonds they are wearing. i want the money for my charity. im not going to lie and say i dont want a house. i want a huge house but im not going to have more than one. im not going to get a car. i dont even have my licence for goodness sakes. im still going to shop and kohls and head straight to the clearance rack. thats how i was raised, it instict. i could not go out and spend even $50 dollars on a pair of jeans and not feel guilty. i think celebrities miss that point. they think ive worked hard to get this far i should reward myself. sure if i get a recording contract i will have worked my butt off but the recording contract is my reward not some $500 dollar pair of shoes im only going to wear once. i dont see how people can do that. im going to work hard so i can be better off, so my mother can have a good life, and im going to work even harder so nobody has to live a life that is horrid.  Do you think the audition process was fair? well let me just say i have a few concerns about the first audition. it says in the rules producers are allowed to pick people out of line. so do you mean to tell me i may sit there for over a full 24 hour period just to get over looked because some girl is wearing a short skirt or looks more attractive than me?! now that i have a problem with.  Who is your favorite judge and why? i like simon. sure he is harsh and gets off topic. it pisses me off when he makes comments about appearance other than musical talent but in the end he is real. he tells you what you need to hear good or bad.  Who is your least favorite judge and why? honestly, randy. sometimes i dont understand i word he says.  What advice do you have for other hopefuls? just be yourself. practice and think that this is your only shot. give it your all.  What would people be surprised to learn about you? lets not get into this now. lets just say i have a past, a past i dont plan to make public anytime soon.  Who did you think was going to win last season?ok i got this one. its the curse of american idol. season 1- tamyra grey left when it came down to final 4, season 2- clay aiken was the runner up, season 3- la toya when it came down to final four she left now where have we heard that before. in my opinion american idol contiues because we have yet to crown the person with the most talent in that season american idol.  If you could be a performer from any era, which would you choose and why?the 60's minus the drugs. i would love to meet the beatles. to sing with the beatles. i would die a very happy person. also in the 60's i would have loved to do anti-war songs. i am strongly against war, vietnam being the biggest mistake america has ever made. im a very political person. im educated about what is going on. in the 60's with civil rights and the war i would have loved to be a part of it and make an impact.
