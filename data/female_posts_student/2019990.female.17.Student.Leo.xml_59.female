So the flights over were pretty boring, no good turbulance even.  Oh well, myrandma and I arrived safe and sounds here in Pittsurg.  We got to see the Heinz fatory were al teh ketchup is made.  Pretty col huh?  Ad I saw mre sky scarapers today than i have seen in years.  I saw them flying into Minneapolis, and we drove through downtown Pittsburg.  eciting stuff.  I was thinking on teh way over how wierd of a feeling it is to see the stuff come up and get closer and closer to you.  They all look like toys until you touch down. Its pretty cool.     Mahinda I decided you would make a realy fun flight attendant.  Now I'm not saying that's what you should go into or anything,I would just like to be on your flight.  I can jsut see you starting off with "Well helo everyone.  Welcome to flight [insert numer here] with non-stop serice to [insert city here]." and she would continue, and this sounded better in my head. but I still think you would be a good flight attendant.  But I have to be getting to bed.  I have to get up early tomorrow, I get to observe ovarian surgery.  Exciting and frightening at the same time.  Pry for me, and wish me luck. Mwah.  Goodnight.  Oh and ps. Mainda I finished Go ask Alice today.  good book. Ill bring it back wel, in a month.
