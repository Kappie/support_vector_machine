I mean...brown...for Abby...and the implications thereby...really frick'n off, it's like shooting yourself in the foot with a target a foot in front of you. If that makes any sense. And I got yellow, which is...god forbid...Joy. Because while eminating bitterness and resentment of self and environment from day to day, I always take a minute to smell the daisies and give off an aura of energy and happiness. Nay. If there's a brown one, let me be it.  I used to be black, anyway, and blue (I think that was melancholy, or pensive, I can't remember) at one point. They've changed the questions waaay up, tho.  Tho I did enjoy the evil quiz, because all of my little stati things were slightly over the evil side, except for the "blackhearted" one...in which, I was a crutch-kicking, baby-candy-taking, pilfering vagrant. Leave it to a bunch of second-hand psychologists to exploit the evil in man and then make him enjoy it. Or to exploit the not-true in man and make him believe it. I actually thought I was a creature of sunshine for a moment there.   Bah.
