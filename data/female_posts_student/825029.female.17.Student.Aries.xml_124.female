I like updating this more often now, because it keeps all of you off my back ; )  Well, I just got back from my church confirmation retreat.  It was, needless to say, awesome and an amazing experience.  It came at a really good time for me.  I learned so much and realized that there were some things in my life that I needed to work out and rethink- I wasn’t really putting the things that are most important in life first.  My small group rocked so much, even though our chant didn’t go over too well... “tweet tweet”.  heh  So yeah, I had a great time this weekend and as happy as I was to come home, I’m going to miss that feeling I had.  I’m pretty sure only Becca knows what I’m talking about, but oh well.  Even though all retreats seem to put me in a sort of “joyful” mood, this one was different... a really enlightening time for me.  I hope everyone’s weekend wasn’t TOO boring without me!  I’m not ready to go back to another week of school, though... didn’t exactly get much sleep this weekend so I have a feeling it’s going to be awful having to get up early tomorrow.  But hey, Race Coppell 2003 this Saturday!  That should be something to look forward to.  Today’s cool song alert!  Finger Eleven – “Suffocate” ... it’s a good one!  Well, that’s it for today’s edition of Melissa’s Blog.  Tune in next time for one heck of an update!
