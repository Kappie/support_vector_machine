I scored a 50 percent and here's what it says   urlLink http://www.lovetest.com/greatflirter2.html   Jessie, your witty comments and your seductive looks hit the bulls-eye every time. If somebody knows how to flirt then it's you. No matter if your heartthrob is shy or a go-getter, you know exactly how to bring him out of his shell and twist him around your little finger. When you're interested in somebody, you'll really get things moving. Because you are sensitive and know how to put yourself into your heartthrob's position, it's easy for you to give attention to your partner.     Oh really? I always seem to suck when it comes to the guys department.... I never approach guys now, I did that when I was young, but now I'm a sitting duck... hahaz... ~quack quack~  =p   Spent the rest of today reading my romance novel and chilling at home... A guy friend K actually asked me out  tonight but I was just too tired mentally to go out... I think it must be due to yesterday's intensive shopping... Or maybe I'm just being anti-social.. Gosh am I getting worse?  Sometimes I'll rather stay at home and chill.. Not that I don't like to hang out with K.. He is a really cool guy with alot to talk about.. But I'm just too lazy to go out and talk to guys anymore.. One way or another I just feel like hibernating myself away from guys.. Well maybe do a little flirting with guys when I go clubbing, but that's about it.. Need some girl time for myself now, after being in a stormy relationship... A break from all them guys.. I need to find myself, cliche as that may sound.. But I want to be selfish for once. Do what ever I desire, with no need for explanation. But because I darn well feel like it. Before the next gruelling semester starts..  I bought a Clinique lash curling mascara and I love it! Its smudgeproof and my lashes astonishingly curls up all by itself! Haha..... Now I have Natalie Imbruglia eyelashes as complimented by my best mate.. She always makes me feel better about myself.. These days I have been feeling fat, ugly and old.. Ok ok... I'm having my girly mood swings, I know.. But M always makes me feel good about myself.. Not even my ex could do that... I love her to bits..  anyway I'm goin back to my junk novel... Ciao
