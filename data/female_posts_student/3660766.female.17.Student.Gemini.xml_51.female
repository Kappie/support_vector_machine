Ive been thru so much stupid shit with Andrea, Deidra, Derek, Phil, Matt and the rest of those people to last me a life time. They are the only ones i know that start a fight with people over something they read in a NOTE, oh yes i said it, a NOTE! i think i went thru that shit when i was like 12 but no they are still doing it at 17 and 18, so i decided i would just seperate myself from them, bc im not gonna stress myself out over their child like behavior. Now i know what ur thinking, " Tatji is just like that!" Well alls i have to say to that is, Oh buddy ur so wrong. Im DONE with all of that. They only thing i gained from them was my stress level and my weight lol i need to put my body and MY life before their games bc im not gonna be the goofy 17 yr old any more after this school year. Im gonna be on my own, and i need to mature, i mean ya ill be the goofy 18 yr old but hopefully ill be more mature and maybe take things more seriously. i think at this point in my life, im really ready for something serious to happen. Ive always been the person to goof around and just take life as a joke and not as a gift and as corny as that sounds it is a gift and im gonna use it to my full advantage. Theres so much i could be doing and i should be doing it, rather than messing around and just being mixed up in stupid fights and seeing who said what and who fought who. Life is more than drama, its more than fights, its more than "who fucked who", its more than how much money u make, its a G-I-F-T, DONT WASTE IT!- *pillow* : )
