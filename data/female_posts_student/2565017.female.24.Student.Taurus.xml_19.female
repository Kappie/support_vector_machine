I'm 24, already swiched field of study once, not too much of government student aid left.... and searching information of other fields of study... like starting something else from scratch would make any difference in my life. As if it would somehow make me more content of my life.... and what real reason do I even have of being unhappy. My current field of study interests me tremendeously, I like studying health care. So why do I suddenly feel like I never should have left my original field of study.... or I should swich to IT... or English at Uni... or heck, medical science.... or art school...  Am I never going to know what I want to do with my life? Am I never going to know what interests me enough? Am I going to be "I wish I could..." for the rest of my life? Pathetic. I need some change in my life....  Not feeling so good now, about anything.
