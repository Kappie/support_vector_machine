(i actually dream of the time when i can afford to eat only organic foods, and will have wonderfully sharp chopping knives.  this most likely won't happen anytime in the near future.)  and here comes this person who starts chatting me up, and broke my organic thought process.  i would rate this attempt to hit on me rather low.  it was too cheesy, but not clever or funny.  (i could've fallen for a "Hey, you dropped your name tag" and then being handed a packet of sugar.)  and then the individual seemed hurt that i started walking away towards the conventional produce without offering my name, my number, or the likelyhood of sex.
