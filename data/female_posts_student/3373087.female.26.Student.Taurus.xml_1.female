But still, we've had some difficult discussions for the past two days about my high expectations and how it makes him feel inadequate.  I knew this was a problem of mine, because Jerry frequently complained about this too.  Not that I think that B's complaining because this is a valid concern.  I would feel like crap if my b/f made me feel like I wasn't good enough too.    I woke up feeling terrible and have had this awful feeling inside me for the whole day. I've just been thinking about why B likes me and why I like him.  It's pretty fundamental, really.  We do have fun together. I've just been really irritable lately and I can't figure out if it's because of B or if it's just my moodiness.  I really can't tell.  I really hope this weekend goes well.  If B and I don't work out, this summer is going to be excruciating. But to stay together just to make this ummer more bareable would be totally artificial.  I don't think we've been together long enough to give our relationship a fair chance--or have we?  Last night B pointed out that we've been talking for nearly 6 months now.  That is NOT a short amount of time when you think about it.   I just don't know what to do or why I'm even thinking this way.  I keep thinking about that list I made over the summer and if B fits that picture.  He fits it pretty well actually (or else I wouldn't be dating him), but he doesn't totally fit the idealized picture inside my head, which is different.  The list consists of my "non-negotiables"--things that the guy must have before I would even consider dating him.  My mental picture is my IDEAL b/f--of course he has all my non-negotiables, but also lots of other bonuses. I don't know if a guy like that actually exists.  I shouldn't think that there is, because if there isn't and I keep trying to find him, I'm going to be single forever. The problem is, B is upset that I keep trying to make him to look like my ideal guy and those expectations are impossibly high.  No, I should definately not try to change him because that's just not going to happen.  Since B knows that he isn't ideal for me, he thinks I'm settling.  But NO ONE IS IDEAL so I'm not really settling if the ideal man doesn't exist.  I'm just trying to be REALISTIC with what kind of choices are out there, so I'm not settling for second best.    This situation is definatly better than any I've been in previously and I feel like I'm on the verge of screwing up something great.  He's been wonderfully patient with me, although I know that this is frustrating for him too.  I need to relax about this relationship and not feel the need to figure out of B is the one for me.  We've only been together for barely 3 months now--I just need to enjoy this relationship and leave the worrying up to God.  If B is the one for me, then God will grow us together in time.
