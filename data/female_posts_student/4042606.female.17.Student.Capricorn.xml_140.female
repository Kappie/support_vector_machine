Things change though, and I remain in Vermont with Mute. I have actually no idea when I will go back home, I will probably leave tomorrow or Thursday sometime. I have to ride one of those Greyhound buses so I have to figure it out soon. Anyway, I am spending the day again with Mute, we are probably going to head downtown later if it doesn't rain again.  As for Jackie's suprise threat to me. I have decided not to post what I was going to post. Instead I printed it out and gave it to Mute when I saw him again. That is one of the main reasons I am still in Vermont. We still have a lot of things to discuss.
