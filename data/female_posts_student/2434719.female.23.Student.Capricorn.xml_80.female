(please just know what i mean.) i havn't done that since i started looking for a job last year (get it now?) and so i went and stood in line to get in.  there was a line out the building to the street, and that just told me it was gonna be good. you have to take an elevator to get upstairs.  or well, you could pretent you were at A and needed to get to the top of the O building, but i'm just not one to do that in cute shoes.   when you get upstairs, and after you pay your ten dollar cover, you walk into a crowded room bursting with music energy. you know what that feels like, right?  it grabs you and pulls you in, and tells you if you're going to have a good time or not. now this was a live band playing, and i didn't even know this at first. they were amazing.   the fist song they performed after i got there was, I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER, by prince.  i fucking kid you not.   it was destiny.   my other favorite part of this place, besides the music, was the view.  i love the city at night.   well so a few of the ladies ordered some drinks, and this is when the DRAMA began. who out there knows how i feel about the drama. say it back with me now and mary j:  NO MORE DRAMA!   a few of vanessa's friends weren't really digging the scene, felt there may have been too old of a crowd, and wanted to leave to go to another bar.  now excuse me, i just paid ten dollars to get in here and they're playing my song. back the fuck up. :)  none of this really mattered, because soon after, vanessa was in the bathroom vomiting like crazy.  drank a little, smoked a little, vomited a little. you know how it goes...  it wasn't getting any better, so we get back into the limo and headed back to home base.  vanessa's future sister in law was being so insanely mean though. apparently, she wasn't ready to stop partying, and wanted to get a taxi so she could still go out.  um no, take care of her. it's a long story, but it was a pretty bad car ride between her bitching and vanessa's vomiting.   as soon as i helped vanessa, i got the hell out of there and called the guys. i needed to have some fun, and i'm guarnateed to have it with them.  i had hoped they would be at drink houston, so i could go out and dance to some of my favorite tunes. of course, a night without the ladies around means a night at the riviera (the all-nude strip club on westheimer).  yeah, good guys. ;)  after convincing them i was NOT going to meet them there, i comprimised and said that i would go over to danny's apartment (i have a key?) and shower, eat dinner, and then hang out with them all when they got back. i wasn't sure how safe it would be to hang out with guys who have been looking at female anatomy all night, but i was pretty sure i could handle it.  so after a stop to pick up some TC, i went over there, got cleaned up, and finished my dinner just in time to hear from danny.  he came home, and we talked about our nights. i was feeling pretty bad about what had happened to vanessa. it's just hard to watch, for lots of reasons.   over an hour goes by, and the rest of the hollister crew had not arrived. so we go to sleep for a while... then hooray, i hear them!! i woke danny up and was ready for some fun. danny. bryan, freddy and i walked out to the neighboring apartment complex for a night time swim. it was just what i needed. nothing exciting happened, but i couldn't help but think of college station days when newman and i would use the pool furniture as trampolines and do balancing acts in the sundance pool.   afterwards, around 6am, we finally put our pretty little heads to sleep. i passed out on the couch and of course, woke up around 10 am.  why, why, why must i be an early riser?? oh well, danny was awake too, so we hung out and talked for a while.  then, i got a phone call from my dad saying he was ready to go buy a computer. today. now. at two. so i got dressed (i was borrowing a cute outfit from danny while mine was drying from the night before) and came home.    my dad and i ended up picking bryan and danny up to help us on our endeavors. we went to the apple store in the galleria, and i am proud to announce that i am writing this blog on my very own powerbook.  i don't know why i was so weireded out by the whole situation. it's amazing how every bit of knowledge i have drains away from my brain and into my ass when i walk into a store like that. instead of expressing my thoughts and emotions like a normal human being, i start dancing around with excitement. plus i don't know what the hell i'm talking about so i feel it's best to keep my mouth shut and smile.   so yeah, i have a powerbook!! and i hate to brag, but i must... i also now have a new ipod. there was a special rebate deal if we bought both.  i think they were just trying to get rid of them with this new special thing that's coming out, but i don't care one bit. i have an ipod!! i've been working on transfering all my mp3s through the wireless network onto my laptop. i have about 1,400. i've actually lost quite a bit over the years, and i'm desperate to start downloading again.  when the most current song you have is from fall of your junior year, and you have an ipod, you get a big ancy for these things.  i think one of my favorite parts of that shopping trip, was seeing the guys with my dad.  my dad is a really introverted guy, and having htem joke around with him was great. i think he was actually into danny's idea of building an isengard in houston... but i don't think he was as supportive when they tried to convince him i was at the strip club the previous night.   i spent the rest of sunday night playing on this wonderful new toy.   it even smells nice. i can't explain that, but you know how i am about smells.  could this be, the most thourough and longest blog in the history of "you hate me like you hate to eat your wheaties?"  i don't even eat wheaties. i don't get it. :)
