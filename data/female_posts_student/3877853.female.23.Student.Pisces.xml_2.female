You still think Giuliani is a dick even after his saintly post-9/11 behavior? Ooh, what a risky and alternative position to take.   Janeane Garofalo and David Cross suck because their comedy is infused with political commentary? Holy shit, I better move to Kansas, because if I ever run into these people in New York I might just vomit in terror!   Seriously, New York Press? I've never read anything else from your publication before, and I only read this article because   urlLink  David Cross    said he was in it. I can see that you're trying to work the alternative hipster appeal. Let me tell you something:     Everyone hates Rupert Murdoch.     Everybody thinks James Lipton is pretentious.    Everyone knows Sarah Jessica Parker has a big nose.    Janeane Garofalo, no matter what your opinion of her comedy is, can't really be described as a "second-rate comedian." She's, like, a household name, people!     This is why I could never be a journalist.
