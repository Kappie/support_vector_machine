Muhahaha lol krissy and i went over to Phils House and hes like the most dangerous guy i know lol Well first off, phil decided that it would be cool if krissy and i got in the bed of the truck and he drove like 100 thru his streets, and being the retarded we are, we decided to do it, but first we got a lil pep talk from his brother who basically said that we werent thinking bc i was drinking a beer, standing in the bed of a truck while someone without a liscense goes about 100 mph. lol he just started laughing and we went on our merry way. So here we are flying around corners and im just drinking my drink and krissys like Man were smart! lol Then after we did that, which was SO MUCH FUN! we decided to set off fireworks, and i had this bright idea to put the firecrackers in this can and i would be the one who put the lid on, so phil lit it and im just sitting there holding the lid and slowly putting it on and all of a sudden it goes off, and i ran so fast, i almost blew my hands off lol kick ass huh ? Then we watched Steve-o's dont try this at home dvd, and i have to say that steve-o is fuckin aweeeesome. Then we all went to heathers and gave her back her alien, lol lonnnng story lol then us three saw this nice car and these boys came ot of it , so when they went inside steak and shake, we threw shit on it lol and we saw them run out of the steak n shake lol it was sooo funny. We had a very destructive night lol U know what i give our night? an F PLUS ! it rawked so hard! lol now Wed night we are cutting phils hair into a mullet, cant wait for that!
