I was a little pissed off that i didn't check the stupid blackboard.com thing to see my hw for history and now i have to do double history hw.  argh.  I had fun rubbing it into Steven Danby's face today about that Calgary vs. Dallas game he went to on Friday and that Calgary lost terribly in, 5-1.  But Calgary beat Colorado yesterday, 7-1, so they can't be sucking that bad.  Colorado plays Vancouver tonight, anyone want to take bets on how bad they'll lose?  Dallas plays Pittsburgh tomorrow....ha, like they should even try to lose, it would take an effort to lose to pittsburgh.    Blonde Kid with no fashion sense update: hurrah! my column has been revived!!!  Lately, the kid has been doing well with this clothing....maybe this new broad that he's been hanging out with has changed his style.  So far everything has matched and he's even been wearing BELTS which is completely revolutionary for him, considering he did NOT wear those last tri.  The sandals with socks and even the ugly tan jacket has left his wardrobe lately.  Amazing what a girl can do to a guy in a few short weeks.  Even though i don't approve of the relationship, even if its friends, that he has with this broad......its better for him in the sense of his wardrobe, lol  yay i get to help Lindsay with her newspaper article on hockey!!!  i get to be quoted and i get to help her write it!!! And i'm not even in newspaper!!!  This is awesome.......i get quoted in the newspaper for hockey, then i get to be in the yearbook for hockey when it comes out!!!  lol, i'm sure my picture will be really stupid when its in the yearbook, i probably look like i'm going insane or something....  gotta go!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
