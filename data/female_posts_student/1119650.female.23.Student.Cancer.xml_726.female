Short sleeved, button-down work shirts that are seas too big for you and worn tucked in look atrocious.  Increase this atrocity expotentially by the number of colors in your ugly assed tie.  My office will find any excuse to party.  Today we're closing the office to have lunch at a little trattoria within walking distance called Tavola.  When we return which will proabaly be no earlier than 2:30 we'll be having cake for my bosses birthday.  By time those festivites wind down it should be well on its way to 3:30 at which point everyone starts shutting things down in order to "blow this pop stand" at 4 p.m. promptly.  It's days like today that I think I'll miss the "efficiency" of the goverment that myself and fellow absent lunch-going coworkers help to achieve every day.  I honestly think I might be partied out.  Seriously the last 2 weeks are just an absoulte blur of booze, beer, green smoke, sleepless nights and days wasted sleeping all afternoon (not that I'm complaining, mind you) I just wish I could get back on some sort of normal schedule.    Some freak in my office has decided to do away with the  urlLink WCBS 880 newscast  playing in the office on the radio and put on some "Lite FM" crap.  My ears have been assaulted afternoon by the forced strains of Michael Bolton and Michael McDonald.  Please someone tell me the quickest way to deafen myself.  (Damn me for leaving my iPod at home today!)
