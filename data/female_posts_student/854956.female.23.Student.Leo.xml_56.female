Anyhow, so, after I woke up I just kinda bummed around for a few minutes, then I hopped on the computer, and Zack signed on.  Anyhow, long story short, we talked for about 2 1/2 hours.  About miscellaneous things... his little brother's emo band, other bands around right now that are awesome, etc.  Then he said he wanted to be my LD Valentine.  I thought it was sweet... hehe  Anyhow, I got flowers from my Daddy, which was nice.  I think he talked to my Mom to ask what to get, though, because it had flowers I actually like, and he doesn't pay attention to that stuff.  :-)    So the day progressed, I ate dinner, had some strawberries and homemade whipped cream, watched that ABC Family original movie "The One."  It was decent for a made-for-tv movie.  Then I got a call on my cell phone and thought it was Joe so I didn't answer.  Then the phone at home rang, and it turns out it was Jennifer calling from London!  She was like, why didn't you answer your cell phone... are you screening your phone calls...?  I was like, "If YOUR phone rang the way it rings when your 'ex' calls, and it was Valentine's you wouldn't answer either!"  :-P  Anyhow, we had a nice long conversation and talked about many things.  She's going to Westminster today...  Hmmm.... well, she'll be happy to see I posted something about Zack on here, because she asked about it (since I haven't mentioned him in a few posts).  Okay, so what else...?  Oh, well, I was on TSO (The Sims Online), and then Zack got on later... so we chatted some more on there... it was fun... our sims got engaged on Valentine's Day... haha... it's so cheesy... but it was cute to see my little sim get engaged.  I mean, poor Mykel has been proposed to before, but has always turned them down... because they're usually much younger... so on the 4th proposal by the 4th guy, she said yes.  HAHA  Oh man... my life is sad.    Weird Dreams    Well, I had a BAD dream about that guy from politics.  Goodness, I had this dream that some other girl in the class was talking to him and flirting with him, and he was ignoring her and running his fingers through my hair for some reason.  Anyhow, then he was talking to me, and he was saying that he had a son.  It was SO WEIRD!  Then he was saying his son needed a mom... and anyway... I get up and walk off in the dream without saying anything.  I just get the HECK out of there and as far away from him as I can.  I think it would probably be similar in real life...  I also had a dream that one of my bottom teeth was falling out... and it did, and then another tooth (that was behind it... like sharks have rows of teeth) moved forward.  That one fell out, and the next tooth from the next row moved into place and stayed.  It was so weird.  Well, so I'm done talking now... I have nothing more to say at this moment... Um, yeah... I think I'll go get a shower, and make my hair smell like coconuts once again... :-)  I got new Suave shampoo that smells like coconut... yum...
