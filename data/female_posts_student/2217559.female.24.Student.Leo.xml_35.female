We took a trolley over to the port entrance and then headed to "El Cid," a major resort beach location in Mazatlan. We got to El Cid and went through entrance out the back way to find the pool and sun.   We walked down the beautiful coast to another hotel called Costa. We walked in and the pool attendant told us we had barely made happy hour. (Mind you, it was 2:00 at this time). We bought a bucket of Pacifico beer for $6.30 US. We sat by the pool laughed  gossiped about people on the ship, and entertained the thought of parasailing. I needed liquid courage and so we continued to drink our bucket of beer and soak in the sun.   After the bucket we decided to head down to go parasailing. OMG, it was incredible!!! Lisa went first because I was too chicken. I went to the little oyster stand (they were cracking them open right there on the beach!) and ordered a beer. The guy ran up to the top of the hotel and brought back a LITER of corona. It was huge. About that time, Lisa came down from parasailing and it was my turn.   WOW is all I can say. It was incredible. They strapped me in and told me that I could smoke and take my beer if I wanted. I declined, I was too scared. Lisa encouraged me to go so I strapped one leg in at a time and climbed in.  We took off. And suddenly I was about 50 hundred feet in the air. I could see the entire coastline of Mazatlan. The islands near by. I have never seen anything like it in my life. It was so quiet and calm. I stretched out my legs in the air and just marveled at the ocean far below. It was the most amazing experience. I had so much fun. It was a spiritual moment. I know it sounds corney but to be that high above ground in a foreign country when less than 2 months ago I was living on sixth working at some bullshit job, god, it was like I had arrived. Welcome to my new life of traveling and sailing. Literally.   I talked with Lisa after I landed and she felt the same way. It is also her first time away from home on her own adventures. It was just cool. So afterwards, we took our Coronas to our taxi - which by the way was an open golf cart that played disco music like YMCA, Disco Fever - we were cracking up. We arrived back at the ship and just got back into our office. It was such a kickass time. Freaking cool. It's times like these that make EVERYTHING feel right. I am where I should be.
