Shah's doing better yet again.  Time to study.    "And Nature Smiled" by Allan Koepke    On the hillside grew a lovely rose,  a beauty to behold The sun and rain did bless the rose, and nature smiled, it was told  Proud was the rose midst the widowhood, its fragrance pure as finest gold All creation understood and bowed, as its petals would unfold  Soon the weeds did gather 'round the rose "Share with us your beauty," they asked in coy repose "Give us each one petal, for then we all will be beautiful and worthy, to stand with dignity"  "Run from the beggar's ticks, run from the horsetail, run, run away, " was the cry of the loon "Stay," cried the shepherd's purse, "Stay," cried the thorn tree "Listen to your heart, " came a plea from the moon  Then a stillness settled on the land The rose, in all her widsom, stretched out a gentle hand and touched each one around her; none was to be denied She knew the secret of their beauty came from deep inside  "Each of you is part of a plan from above.  You give life to others, there is no greater love Be strong inone another, and then you all will see you won't need any petals, you have your dignity"  On the hillside great a lovely rose,  a friend amid the wild The sun and rain did bless the rose, and nature smiled  And nature smiled.
