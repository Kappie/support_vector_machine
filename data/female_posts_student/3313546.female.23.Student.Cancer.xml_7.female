I read a book for a while at Trident, today I finished Iceland's Bell, by Haldor Laxness, read a part of The Unconsoled by Ishiguro, the English writer, not Japanese, who wrote The Remains of the Day. I am still trying to finish this book. I started a Faulkner book, GO Down Moses, but I am not officially reading it, except that I am already deeply involved in it. I started a new book, to replace Iceland's Bell, called "The Cold Heaven, Seven Seasons in Greenland" by Gretel Erlich, an author I was introduced in a literature class I took this spring semester at CU, Multicultural Literature, the teacher McVey, who I have had before was teaching a class on "Literature of the West", Erlich apparently is both an expert on Greenland, an experienced documentary filmmaker, and a talented writer about Montana.   "Unforgettable" is on the radio right now, "That's why darling its' incredible, that someone so unforgettable, thinks that I am unforgettable too..." fade away.  I am trying to redeem my notebooks from my experimental "Beer Sessions", writing while under the influence. Although, realistically, any influence can be powerful, not just innebriation.   The guy who works at Trident who is in the military is going to Iraq possibly in September, he seems excited about it. Odd.    I walked around for a while after leaving Trident, at 10:00 pm. Found nothing exciting, except while waiting for the SKIP, an openly gay middle aged couple at Styr Martini Bar and Dance Club, decidedly a sleazy place, next to the Soma before it. But in the same location, who cares. This man had very thick hair, and glasses, the bouncer and another big guy had to fight with him to get him to leave, push him outside, then his friend joined him, at first I thought it was a a woman and a man, then noticing that the man that had been fighting had a beard I identified him as a man, because his hairstyle, and appearance were ambiguous somewhat. There are some very ugly women out there, no doubt. But his friend and he, were an odd pair, I watched them, because the one man who had been bounced kept trying to convince the doorman to let him back inside, his friend went back inside once or twice, but when his friend tried to go in, he was checked and rebuffed by the doorman. I am oddly puzzled. Because apparently being in Boulder, and a liberal society at that, it wasn't a problem that they were gay, acceptance is in, here, but this man kept causing trouble. Eye raising.   I guess. Like any other couple, when one individual is drunk and causing embarassment, fighting with the bouncer, yelling, acting badly, I don't think political sensibilities always take into account that men and women, whatever their gender or sexual orientation, are just as likely to act badly in any situation, especially when they are drunk, what difference does it make what orientation they are.  I'll see what I can do tomorrow to make my day better. I don't want to drink, now that I am familiar with the choices available on Pearl St. Honestly I think they aren't that nice, I wouldn't want to drink beer or anything else at these places. I've tried. I am not into dance clubs, sleazy singles, smelly college places, sports bars, oyster and seafood restaurants, pool halls, or breweries.
