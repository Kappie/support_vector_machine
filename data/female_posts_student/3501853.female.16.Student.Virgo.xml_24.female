I called Kevin before we left, it was a short conversation though because my mom needed me, I felt bad but I had to call to make sure he was okay with the whole band thing. So ya, I got the Saves the day tickets, it was 60 total so luckily we had enough. He wants to see Harry Potter with me tomorrow but I doubt I can because I'm working and I have too much homework. Let's see work was pretty good. It was so busy though, I'm so tired. My manager bitched at me because my phone kept going off some # like 312 something kept calling, whatever. Ryan Plantz came in, it was funny. I was okay for most of the night then as I was leaving, Amy a waitress said a joke 'save horses, ride a cowboy' and I was laughing really hard but it was bittersweet because it reminded me of memories. So ya that got me crying...then I started thinking again about everything lately and it seems like there's no ending to it, this is the worst thing ever and i'm so weak all I do is cry about it. Argh, i can't even describe all the feelings I'm feeling right now it's like half of me feels empty then the other half is filled with a million emotions that I can't describe or seem to let go. I can honestly say, I have never felt this particular way in my life..Well I have work tomorrow again man that's 4 days in a row of working then there's a Lakers game..hmm maybe I should just go and try to start this english crap..."i'm so tired of being here, supressed by all my childish fears"-evanescence [i'm actually starting to like them]
