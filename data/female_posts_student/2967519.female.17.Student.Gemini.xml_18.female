We are having a going-away BBQ tomorrow night and then sunday morning i fly out at like 6:15 am. Yuck, You have to get there 2 hours early so its going to be a little hectic. I never sleep before I get on a plane so by the time i reack my dads house im completly wiped out. And of course, everyone wants to stay up late and talk and eat and all i want to do is sleep for 2 weeks! I went to the doc and had that EKG done and everything is good with my heart so i dont have that to worry about. I got some really cute shorts and stuff too. Hopefully Jeanette will be here tomorrow, If she has to work i wont get to see her before i leave, Bri will be here and Christine. NO babies this time! YAY! Im not in the mood to play babysitter. Well i have to mop and put away dishes, Ill try and post as much as i can when something important happends. GoodBYe for now!!! Have an AWESOME summer everyone!!! Kayla
