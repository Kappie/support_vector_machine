Why? because one of the men in my life that I was so looking forward to seeing won't be stopping by.  It's not entirely his fault, he's been sick and whathaveyou, but that doesn't make me feel any better about being all dressed up (I even took the time to actually do my hair) and having no one to hang out with.  I gotta stop letting them get to me, and this one in particular.  I'm not heartbroken, mind you, that hasn't happened in years.  But I am tired of always feeling like I've been let down...again.  The fact that I'm leaving tomorrow doesn't make me feel any better either.  The last thing I want right now is to go home feeling like this.
