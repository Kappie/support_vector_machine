The day evened out overall though, I suppose, because I found out I've won a national scholastic award.  I'm floating on that one.  I'm not sure how my parents will take the 60, I'll deffinately tell them about the award first and then throw in the 60 on the side like.  District orchestra tonight, promises to be boring as hell.    xo
