There aren't that many things to say about a paper cut that aren't already common knowledge.  It's always the same whines, too.  Wow, it's so amazing that such a little cut can hurt so badly.  Or, omigosh, it's bleeeeeeding!  Everyone has had a damn paper cut, we don't need a narration of the trauma.  Most people have even had one that bled.  It's not worth yammering about for longer than 10 seconds.    I also don't need to know about the band-aid you put on your paper cut that miraculously heals as it covers, or the time you gave a band-aid to a man who had a paper cut.    I'm a little irritated today, in case you can't tell.  It might be because I'm tired, and just getting un-hungover, and stayed up until 2 when I have to get up at 5:30.  But if I were a betting person, I would place the blame for my churlishness on people bitching about paper cuts.
