They should be using that department to catch terrorists, not Americans who happen to think the travel ban is a piece of crap.  I'm certainly blessed that I had the opportunity to travel to Cuba legally when I did--before the new restrictions from OFAC and the Treasury department were announced.  Despite that fact that both the House and the Senate have passed ammendments to either lift the travel ban completely or ease new restrictions on travel (like for educational purposes), our jack-ass president has vowed to veto the measures.  I'm serious--if he "wins" again, I'm moving indefinately to either Brazil or Cuba.    I am simply baffled more and more every day at the lack of our intelligence in foreign policy.  As if the economic embargo over Cuba has been successful.  Come ON.  It has simply become a political issue due to a small but insane group of people in Florida who threaten to withhold electoral votes for a president or would-be president of the U.S. if he even thinks about improving relations with Cuba.  The embargo MAY have held some sort of validity in '61 when it was first put in place, (and even that is suspect--I have been reading recently declassified documents discussing how the CIA was planning a U.S. invasion of Cuba long before the missile crisis arrived) but now it's just bad foreign policy.  Not only are the Cuban people suffering, but the embargo is now just providing Fidel a scapegoat by which to rally his masses against the imperalist creeps to the north.  (Even if he does have a point)  Do you honestly believe that the socialist system would have survived in Cuba this long if we had been actively trading with Cuba this whole time?  Of course not.  Capitalism puts the socialist system at risk, along with all social welfare programs like free education and health care.  Our officials know nothing.  I'm sorry...that whole argument of "we can't trade with you because you're an authoritarian dictator"...does not hold water anymore.  Why?  Because we have monetarily, politically, and militarily SUPPORTED the most brutal, human-rights-defying, evil, cruel military dictatorships in Latin America for years, all because they claimed to be capitalist and anti-communist.  Familiar with the Argentine dirty wars?  The over-throw of the democratically elected Allende and the installation of the Pinochet regime?  U.S. government money funding the Guatemala military dictatorships that wreaked havoc for over 30 years?  I could keep the list going, but I think my point has been made.  Dammit, at least be consistent with your policy--if you're against dictators, be against ALL dictatorships, regardless of what economic and political policy they propose.    Fuckin' a.  I hate our foreign policy.
