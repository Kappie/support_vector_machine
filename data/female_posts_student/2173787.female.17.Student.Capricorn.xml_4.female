I really don't care that there are 2 forms of the future tense in Spanish, it doesn't matter.  At some point I pretended that this nonsense was important and a good thing to spend my time on, but that has changed.  I don't know when it changed or how, but school is no longer about learning to me.  I used to relish in the academics of it all, but that disappeared.  When I say I enjoy a class I am no longer talking about the subject matter but the people and the dynamic that exists.  People have become so much more important to me as of late.  I mean, friends were important before but they were never my lifeline.  As the importance goes up, lines become fuzzy.  No one is simply a cut and dry friend it seems.  There are barriers that I see that I never saw before and that seems so odd.  Labels and determining where I stand has taken utmost importance, which makes me feel shaky about the whole thing.  Why can't things go back to the simple way they were before? Do I want them to?
