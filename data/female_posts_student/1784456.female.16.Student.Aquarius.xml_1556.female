I got told off for admitting to shoving the little kids outta the way cos i was late for tutor time. *ggrrr, stupid rents, stupid little kids, stupid school, stupid town...etc* Lynne, I agree u should write on here more often. As for the swimming thing, when it comes to making excuses i am not going to emma's party, me and my family are going to my 'cousins christening' so that my bro can get out of it aswell. okeydoketey!! *oo there's a butterfly in our conservatory* Oops! sorry! got a bit distracted there, with the flapping and the colours and the flapping and the colours and o my god the flapping!!!!!!!!!
