I hate being mad at people who don't deserve it. Especially since I can't really be mad at anyone but myself for this. I'm tearing myself apart on the inside. Isn't that from a song? It sound familliar. It's just like, I check my e-mail everyday even though I know he won't e-mail me anymore. I check my buddylist everytime I hear someone log on, even though even if it is him I know he won't IM me. Or if he does, I won't respond. I just don't want to get hurt again. I don't want to hurt anyone again. I don't know what I want. I hate it when I do that. I could just say I'm sorry and go on living in some sort of blind happiness. Or I could stay quiet, and loose another one, but still loose the risk of getting hurt. I don't know. Relationships aren't really my speciality.  I'm sorry, but shut up anyway  Me
