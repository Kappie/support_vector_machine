It was ok... not bad but not exactly fun. I like Chad and Angie's kids. After that I went home. Pretty boring... but at least I made some money and helped Angie out. Wow at least I'm going shopping tomorrow and I'll actually have some money and do something fun. I forgot howunfun working actually was.   I've finally decided which senior pictures I'm getting... but I'm not telling... it's a suprise.  Today I've been wondering... who all keeps beeping when they go by my house? Ok I know Ronnie does... and once I think it was Tom, but we get like 20 beeps a day... seriously. Sometimes I see the vehicle and it's like wow I don't know anyone with a truck like that or I've never seen that car in my life. I don't understand. Is there this sign that says : Please Beep at Our House? One day my brother was like... I think people see my car here and beep and I was like don't flatter yourself, they beep just as much when you're not here. But anyway... If you have any idea who keeps beeping at our house let me know.
