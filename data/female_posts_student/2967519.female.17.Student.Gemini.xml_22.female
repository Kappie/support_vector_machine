Then the day before we leave for Colorado im throwing this huge BBQ, kinda like a end of school,beging of summmer,going away party thing. Lots of food and drinks,lots of people. Hopefully it wont be too eventful and nobody will end up in a fight or getting pissed off and leaving. Today was good. gotta go to town tomorrow, Oh im appling at WalMart when i get back to work in the infants, Jeanette got an interview there too so Good Luck to her on that. Season Finales have been horrible! I hated The O.C.'s and last thursday i watched E.R's...That was horrible,no way to leave things. I didnt like Fraisers either, It was borring. Friends was the only good one so far. Okay enough of that!I should be able to get in a few more posts before i leave, and mabey a couple this summer but its very doubtful i will be able to update that much. Last day of school for all of us in North Pole and Fairbanks! YAY! lol
