I discussed with myself into great detail how when some one gets beaten (mentally) by so many things over such a long time, the "skin of their mind"(forgive the odd metaphor) becomes so intensely bruised underneath the skin that any exertion or pressure can make it break and bleed. Even something as benign as joy or laughter can separate the weak scar-tissue. Because the blood pools underneath the skin and heals so appallingly slowly, these cuts bleed profusely. This, in turn, makes more bruises, scabs and scars, which make the healing process longer. All is never hopeless it seems, because there are some things that cause rapid healing; six steps forward, instead of three, for ever ten taken backwards. One of these things is music. A song that brings you back to another time in your head, a time where life just felt better, a time before the beating. At least, one helped me. The only other thing I know of that helps doesn’t heal, it’s a distraction. Just like when you get a cut, but your mind is busy doing something else, and you only feel the pain when you look at it, the same rule applies: if you can distract yourself from the pain, I think it gets a little more time to heal. ‘Cause it seems like when you stare at the wound, it doesn’t heal. Your attention only digs it deeper, or turns it a nice infected pink color.  Those are the only ones I know of, but I’m confident there are more…I just haven’t found them, or felt them, or cried enough to have earned them I suppose. I’m not one for crying, so if that’s the trick, I’ve got a long way to go. But all this torment is in my mind, I know that. I just haven’t found the place in my head where I can let it all go. It’s like when someone gives you this gift you know you have never liked and never will, but you just aren’t _ready_ to let it go, and after a few weeks go by, you decide to throw it out. I know that’s all it takes; I just have to find that state of mind where I can ‘throw it out’.   ~Even though the actual instigator of the hurting is gone, it will still haunt her nightmares every night. It took her power away, and the only person who can get it back for her, is her.~   Lol, so I've been enjoying myself making designs all over my body ^_^ *grin* Henna is awesome fun, and an awesome _distraction_. The rain has helped too…rain has to be one of the most fantastically wonderful sounds in the world. The thunder, the lightning, the drops falling on the tin roof over our deck…the smell…oh god and the smell….if I had to choose to be deaf or blind, I’d choose blind, I  doubt I could live my life without the sounds of rain. Of course, I’m being melodramatic….but even so, it _is_  amazing.
