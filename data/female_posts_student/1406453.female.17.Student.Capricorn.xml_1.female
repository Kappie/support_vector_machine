My parents assume sleeping from 1 a.m. to 10 a.m., eating breakfast, then going back to sleep for an hour means I have an iron deficiency or I'm depressed or something.  I'm just tired.  Period. Cleaned house, then headed over to visit with Julia and Aunt Jody.  She leaves for Israel in a couple of days, and I am really worried for her safety.  It's a dangerous place.  Then Chinese food and Pistachio yogurt. Off to see the world in my dreams.  Work tomorrow a.m., should be fun babysitting.  woopee...
