We met Donald's future roommate and I believe that he will be great for Donald. Reminds me a lot of Mere's brother in some ways. Anyways, he played Francis Flute/Thisby in A Midsummer Night's Dream. So, he's fine by me. AND he likes pirates.  Last night was less enjoyable for me. I only met a few new people. People looked at me in a strange way all night and it freaked me out. I guess if you're planning on going to Iowa City, you should plan on being hit on by a bunch of drunk college boys, but I was deathly afraid when walking to my car alone to put my guitar away. My whole body was in defense mode, my car key between my middle and index finger, just in case.  Also, Alex, JC, and Tim came up and were playing music on a street corner with some girlfriend of a guy named Mustaffa. For some reason, I became very depressed in seeing them, even physically sick. I guess I've just been really worried about Tim recently and I'm confused at what to do. I miss Tim. Tim, as in the Tim I used to know. But, you'll have that. And what can you do?  I'm very sad today. I don't know why, but something feels wrong, I feel different. No, it's not PMS either. Just my stupid mind overthinking things again. YUCK
