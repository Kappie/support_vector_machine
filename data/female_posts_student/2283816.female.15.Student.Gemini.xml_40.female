I just like this quote.  I was thinking on the way back from Borders that everything is possible when you can drive. You can move out, buy food, date people, watch movies, and do ANYTHING.  My dad doesn't trust me/think I'm ready to drive yet. Sure I'll get lost nearly everywhere I go, but that's half the fun... and I won't get into any accidents, I know that for sure. So I have to wait another YEAR for driver's ed when I could be driving around in a beat-up Oldsmobile with rust on the doors. Damn.  My parents have refused to buy me a car... they don't even want to give me my dad's current Malibu. They're afraid it'll explode or something. Well, with me driving... Anyway, before I can get a car, I have to get a job. To get to my job, I need a car. WTF.  I would be a babysitter, but unfortunately by the time I moved here the market was basically monopolized by a group of other people my age. Thanks, Hill. Kids seem to think I'm strange but funny, which does work. But little kids scare me. I'm always afraid I'll psychologically damage their little minds. I'm sure I already have. There was this game we played called Queen... *smiles* Good times.  Anyway, I'm just too lazy to find a job - I really ought to start looking, next summer at least. I just need to write a really good book and make thousands of dollars on it. But I severly am procrastinating right now. It's bad.
