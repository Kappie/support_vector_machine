Needless to say, the first thing I reclaimed from the dl world was AIM, and it's a relief to actually have a profile and to see the icons and have some sort of font. And now I'm tempted to reorganize my buddy list. Problem is, how would I do it? Like T, with "best friends" and then descending in social importance from there? (That list always bugs me every time I go to her house...I wonder if I'm on there, lol) But friends can't be categorized like that, and I'd just feel like I was offending someone if I didn't put them in that position. A separate category for YSP? Yes, perhaps. We'll see how it goes.  I wonder how one deals with truancies at school. I'm angry, though: Mom forgot to call me out of 7th period on time so I ended up helping with roses and cutting class in the process. Not too pleasant. She says she called the office after the fact and they said that I was supposed to get a slip before I left, but a) if Mom didn't call in, how was I supposed to have a list? and b) I've left my last class many a time--legally--and I haven't gone to the office to get that bothersome sheet of paper. Isn't that only for readmits? Well, I'm fervently hoping that I don't get a Saturday. Imagine how absolutely disgusting that would be. I thought about it...in retalliation, I'm going to write a column in the paper about it.  Charles, please explain the poem :)
