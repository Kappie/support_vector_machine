He is the boy of my dreams even with his bad habits and faults.    Present Time:  Boy has questioned what he really wants out of life. May never want to get married, doesn't think its fair to girl. Girl wants to make up her own mind about that, not let someone choose for her. boy wonders if he really loves girl or just doesn't want her to be with anyone else. Girl thinks he caught the "boy" virus, the one thats fatal to his feelings.(It must be going around) Girl wants to work things out slowly. Boy has her heart in his power. Girl provokes his theories and gets inside his shell every now and then. Girl remains lonely and sad.    No, I'm not sure starting all over will make it work. I don't know what I'm really expecting, all i know is that I'm not ready to lay down just yet. And somewhere inside, I don't think he is ready for me to either. I blog all this cause i used up all my whine to my friends minutes. But in the end i think I just want to be satisfied in knowing I did all I could for me to be happy with him. Even if it only makes me feel better.
