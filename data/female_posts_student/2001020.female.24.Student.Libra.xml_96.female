She started off telling me about how everyone in her class hates her and they won't talk to her and stuff.  She told me about these two boys who pick their noses and "scream around," and she also told me about how they "show each other their underwear (and I told her there's a word for that, but she'll find out about that when she's older)," but the funny part is when she went into describing her "crush."  M told me about this boy who's older ("he must be in fourth grade because he's taller than me and two of my friends"), who she thinks is so "cute" and "awesome" and she can't talk to him because she's too shy.  So I suggested just walking up to him and talking to him, and she said, "He's soooooo nice, he's just soooooo nice, I can't."  So then I suggested writing him a note, and she said, "Well, I don't write adult and he probably does, so that wouldn't work either."  As if they speak different languages or something!  Man, I thought I was going to pee my pants, but I didn't want her to think I wasn't taking her seriously.  Besides, she was talking about "love" and stuff like that, so I am sure she was serious (although she doesn't know his name, he just rides her bus).  She was talking about him like a "man" and stuff, not anything too mature for a five-year old, but I don't know where she was getting these things.  I think she watches too much adult TV!  Anyways, just thought I'd share...one day I will tell her that story and we'll all get a good laugh out of it.  Kids are funny.
