GRRR  Unit C - Business Finance - 25/35 (Merit)  So that wasnt too bad at all, considering I didnt revise for any of them. (Shhh, dont tell Dilley!)  My coursework for that is currently averaging out now to a BB grade. I could get an A*A grade if I put max effort in. I have six weeks :)    SHIT!!!!! AAAAAAAAA Just remembered, Gallaghers homework! bugger it. quarter to ten, erm, ok, plan of action.....have pot noodle, have shower, then do the work in bed. That sounds about right.
