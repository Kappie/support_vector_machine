But that's ok, cuz I'll see them tomorrow, since I know I'll be on the computer a bit more, if not a lot.  You are almost correct Linds, he is the second cousin, only  thrice  removed. Well actually...in doing the research I had to wade through a lot of debate over who started it all, Wundt or Fechner, and surprisingly, it's pretty evenly divided. I think Gustav laid the foundations, Wilhelm built the house.   Gosh, you're right, it says "preschool teacher". Maybe I'd be a craaazy one like in Billy Madison and have all the kids put on tribal beads and do Hindi dances with me, so as to exemplify my in-touchness with emotion, thus not losing the EMO kid side, and also listening to Metallica while we dance, thus, not losing the rock side. It would be fun being a preschool teacher, four year olds are pretty cool. Kids are pretty cool in general, actually, unless they're not under my remote discretion and they're, say, in a library, and I don't have the right to go up to them and play with them or do something to make them shaddup. Then they're not really that cool. But I'm totally diggin' the preschool thing. That would be solid. Jive turkey!  I've been watching "I Love the 70's", and it kix major assor. But Abby and I agree the 80's are better. Think: big hair! Poison! Ratt! Sex, Drugs, n' Rock n' Roll: The Era! And on a more serious note...Metallica! Early Alice! That's really it to the eighties, music and sex. And lots of political fiascos. And Apple IIs, those things are the SHIT.  Well...a neighbor is selling their 1999 Acura Integra for 10 gs, so I stopped over to look at it, and it kixor assor. It's got a subwoofer in the trunk, and the guy said it can lay the track flat, if needed. Heheheheh. At least it has airbags, by god. But...mild structural damage, as in bad paint scratches. Judging by the people selling it, they probably won't haggle. But I'd try for 9.5 at the least.   Hey, it smells good in there too, which is a lot better than I can say for the last couple o' used cars I've been in, ala GAM, my dad's. It smells like butt in tharr.  Whoa dudes, caffeine is awesome. I haven't had any in a long time, but we ran out of stuff to drink so I perked some coffee...well, it was perked so I put it in the nuker and it was really good. Cinnamon crumbcake with hazelnut creamer. It's all gone now tho...HAHAHAHA. I don't know how to use that pot, thank god. But I think I'm going to go try and figure it out here in a second. HAHAHAHA. Caffeine is awesome.  So's...anyway...god, I hate that. Like, I'll be talking to someone and I can't think of what to say next, or else I've forgotten. I do that a lot, and it really suxor. DAMN.  Mega recording tomorrow, that should be funfunfun til our daddy takes the T-bird away.   Well, I hope you all had a good day (mine was good, albeit lethargic and melancholy) and a good one tomorrow too. Because life is puddle wonderful. Heheh.  Salut.
