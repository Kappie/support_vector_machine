So I'm just going to bitch for a hot minute about a few things that are hard for me to get used to...  #1 - Having one car in the 'burbs isnt easy.  This is basically annoying when the man is on vacation (like this week) and sharing the car is a necessity.  If I worked some place I could walk to, or take a bus to, it'd be different but my job is just a little too far away to walk and there are no buses that get here directly.  So either he has to get up early and drive me to work, then pick me up, or I take the car in the morning and go see him at lunchtime (no biggie because I almost always go home for lunch anyway, heehee) and then he drives me to work and does his thing... But STILL, its annoying to have to go through that.  Especially when this weather doesn't tell you how the day is going to get- it's cloudy, it's sunny, it's cold, it's warm.  UGH!  #2 - We have a damn big yard.  It needs a little work.  It's not even, so the hubby is going to till the whole thing over, add some soil to level it all out and put out the grass seeds to start the yard over all nice and fresh.  It's a big ordeal.  One does not have to deal with this in the city.  #3 - I do NOT have a green thumb.  I got a book on gardening which has become a really nice coffee table book but I have yet to bring myself to actually TOUCH the dirt.  The closest I've come to gardening is trying to get the leaves out from under the bushes.  (Do NOT get me started on how many frickin' leaves there are.  THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.  I rake, it comes back, I suck them up with the thingy, they come back.  They are the bane of my existence, I swear.)  So anyway there are flowers coming up that I guess were planted years before that are looking good but I have NO IDEA how to maintain them.  I give them a week.  I'd like to plant a garden with veggies and stuff but I have no idea how.  I wish they would just appear and take care of themselves.  You know...like pigeons...or LEAVES...  #4 - There is too much to clean.  I could handle cleaning the apartment but lordy lordy!  There are rugs everywhere and then there's all the bathrooms!  SIIIGH.  I hate cleaning.  It seems the more space we have, the more space we have to throw shit that doesnt belong there.  Why is that tape recorder on the couch?  Well, gee... I dunno... because that's where it landed when I emptied out my bag.  Riiiight.  Okay, that's about it.  There really isnt that much to bitch about. I mean, basically it's that I'm lazy as all hell and I like to complain.  Yeah.  Mmmhmm.  That's basically it.  I know, I know....there are children starving in China!  There are people who dont have homes at all, let alone complain about them!  Sigh...I'm a terrible person...  On another note, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, CRISTIIIIIAAAAAANNNNNN!!!!!  He's 3 today.  Everyone wish him a happy birthday, thankeeverymoosh.  Three years ago today my best friend decided to have natural childbirth.  I left work to be there at 4pm (you know, to ask questions like, "so how does it feel?? while she gives me a look of "get the fuck out of here, you are no longer any friend of mine.") She didnt give birth until 4am.  I was very tired.  I'm sure she was too (teehee!)  Stayed up most of the night talking to her youngest (half)sister and shootin' the shit.  Getting to know her as a young woman and not the little 6 year old that punched my boyfriend at the time... but I digress... Wittle Cristian was born and he was so cute and fat!  Awww!!    An old friend may be visiting on Friday night or Saturday morning.  I havent seen her in forever.  I guess I'd better get to the cleaning, huh?
