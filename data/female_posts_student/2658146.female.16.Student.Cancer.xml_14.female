More on that later.  Yes, I realize this layout is ugly and sucks. My "friend" Drew is working on it for me. I'm lazy so I don't do my own work. We have a biology project we have to present next hour and he forgot his stuff. I'm mad, but at least it wasn't as bad as last night. No, it wasn't that you perverts. Besides, I have a boyfriend.  Dave (my boyfriend) and I got into an argument yesterday. It was about Dustin, one of his alleged friends. I told him that from what I've heard they've both treated each other like crap since they met, but he begs to differ. I talked to Adam at the bench this morning, and he told me I was right. What a liar! I really hate it when people lie to me, especially when they go without lying for so long. Now I doubt all the other things he says. Especially since a while back he sent me an email telling me to break up with him (trust me, it wasn't the first). Then he sent me two more apologizing and taking back what he said cause he didn't mean it. So what does he mean? When am I supposed to believe him? I think I'll consult Monica. She's like my Deadjournal. This is like my Deadjournal too, except I don't have a Deadjournal and I've been using Monica as a Deadjournal longer than this blog. Yarr, Sez of Hell is pestering me, I'll write more later.   Current Mood:  Annoyed
