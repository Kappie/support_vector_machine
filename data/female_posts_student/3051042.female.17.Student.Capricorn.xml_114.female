I got back on Friday. I missed everyone to death. Though there's been more controversy than I've ever desired, I'm trying to deal with things. I really hate waking up in the morning to my heart pounding, to me panicking, but then realizing it was all a dream... or so I hoped. Hopes are useless on many levels. And recently I've been going though my old journals and bloggers and poetry to not only realize how immature and petty, but that I got my hopes up too often... I trusted too many people. And I'll say this now but this may not be true by the end of the day: I don't think I trust anyone anymore. It scares me because I've never held this many secrets from anyone, not even myself. I'm sorry I feel this way. There are so many people I want to trust or put my faith into (again?) but I don't know. I'd hate to say I learn from my mistakes because that's not the truth. Past situations have changed me... and this is what happens. Like I said, I'm trying to deal with things. I hate these feelings as much as the next guy. I'm sorry if I hurt either of you...  Besides the sad stuff Michelle and I dyed my hair red yesterday. We went to Ballard. I had a whip-it but flipped out (long story) and got drunk or something close to drunk. Ned came by my house after I stormed out and said "fuck you." He called Michelle in the car... but again, this is all a really long story that, personally, I'm not willing to talk about (yeah, going back to the trust thing). But we sorted things out and I made sushi, we were going to watch Train Spotting, but something happened there. We all camped out in the study when my dad came home, both Michelle and Ned were falling asleep so I showed them to the door and went to bed myself.   I'm going to write about you all I want. Fuck you Donald. Kill me if you'd like, I know you'd have intercourse with my dead body, but it makes me want to hurl to know, to understand, to comprehend that every time you IM me it's only about sex. What the fuck is your problem?? Don't talk to me for the most selfish reasons in the world, and don't complement me ever again... because we both know their fake.   Damn that felt so good. I think I'm ready to take on the unpacking of my suitcase.
