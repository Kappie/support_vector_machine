She and I have been friends since 4th grade...But lately I have been drifting from her because we have nothing in common anymore. She kinda forced me into things I didn't want to do, like baseball stats and band. I only joined with her because she can't handle being alone. And since all of her friends are leaving for college, she's depending on me for everything. I sound so ranty right about now, but I need to get this outta my head. One of my other friends (who is leaving for college) and I were talking at one point about pet peeves we have about her, and we both agree that she needs to get her own life once in a while. It's fine that she hangs out with me, but there are times were I wish I went with the popular crowd back in fourth grade. I hate the fact that I'm ding this to her, but she has no other friends cause she chose to go with older people. Some of her friends are lower classmen, but honestly, what lower classmen would want to hang with her. She can't drive yet (well neither can I, but I only have 2 driving hours left, and she has done none) and all she cares about are hot guys (who she can never get), singing (which has gone to her head to make her believe she is the best singer there is), and theatre (which also made her believe she is the best actress). Her career choice is to become an actress or singer. She has no back up plan; that is her set goal. Even actress' and singers struggle to get where they are. And to tell you the truth, she is not skinny. And you know how people are: they have to be thin as a rail. Sure there are a few overweight people in the business, but that's a few. She doesn't want to do anything else because she made herself believe she can't do anything else. And it sickens me that she has no willpower to do anything else in life. So if she's pissed at me, then I'm pissed back. And I hope she reads this because she needs to know the truth. No one has ever told her the truth about life, because I think her family tries to protect her from that. And her family is also to blame, because they are the one's that made her believe she ca become and actress or singer and nothing else. The only good thing about her family is that they don't want to send her to the college of her choice (It's a liberal arts college, one I plan to go to). And she is trying to convince them to send her. I hope they say no...I feel like a total bitch now, but I feel a lot better...
