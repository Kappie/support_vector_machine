I think I looked like I had chicken pox.  I must have looked really  sexy  because I quit shaving because there were just too many bumps."   In other news, the cape was fun.  The baseball games were very  appealing .  California here I come to hang out w/ my baseball boys.  I actually really did like the baseball itself aussi, but what can I say?  I love those boys.  So, I just got back but now we are going to the beach in Maine tomorrow.  Then I will be back for a long while.  If anybody wants to get together this week, tell me, s.v.p.
