Becky and I have been known to wreak some havoc online since back in the good ol' days of high school.  I've never written on a blog before, but we all know I've got an opinion on everything.  So get ready to listen to all my rants and maybe even a few raves.  'Til next time, I give you something to ponder...late fees at Blockbuster - myth or reality?
