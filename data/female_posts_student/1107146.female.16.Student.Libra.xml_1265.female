I think Travis is ok, but, remember me last year?  That's who he reminds me of.  We talked about that and he agreed.  It was like talking to myself all over again.  So anyway, I resent the convo.  Oh, and people, what kind of cake do we want?  I'm thinking white w/ white frosting, cause that's what I like, but we're always open to suggestions.  What do yall think?  I need a vote here, cause Abby needs to make the cake tomorrow so she can frost it saturday.  I'm getting good at this cooking stuff.  You can thank my teacher, who wrote the post directly below this.
