You've probably made it a few times yourself. Here's 4:   *almost burnt cheese (especially on mac  cheese or leftover in a frying pan)     *saltine crackers with chocolate frosting     *liver  onions     *pickle juice straight from the jar (as kids, my sister and I would see who would get to it first.  Sometimes it took  forever  for someone to eat that last pickle)         And of course, I have to round out that with some of the worst foods I've ever had.    *okra.    When I was a kid, my family and I used to rag on my mom so bad about the food at dinner and she finally said something about it... okay a lot of something.  We were all deeply apologetic and rightly chastised and made a vow not to criticize her cooking again.  Then my mom served okra.  Like with most other vegetables she cooked, she boiled it -- and if you've ever boiled okra you know what's coming next.  She brought it to the table and we all sat politely and quietly, waiting to pray so we could eat.  We prayed and then started passing the dishes around.  I was the first one to grab the bowl of okra.  I put on a brave face (I'm not a big vegetable eater anyway) and prepared to dish myself some.  When I brought the spoon piled high with okra from the bowl to my plate it left a trail of slime, bridging the gap between the two dishes.  Everyone froze, staring in horror, not wanting to say anything but dreading having to put some on their plate.  My mom took pity on us and snorted with laughter before letting go.  Pretty soon we were all cracking up and she eventually took it off the table.  But I've never looked at okra the same again.   *squid.    My dad tried to make us kids eat squid once.  He bought some calamari patties and told us they were mock veal.  We believe him right up until we had our first bite.  We all knew veal is not rubbery.   *cow tongue.    My dad, again, got the "great" idea of making tongue for his family after having his mom serve it once when he was a kid.  My dad made one mistake... he didn't take off the skin or chop it up (guess that's 2).  So we were looking at an actual tongue with tastebuds and everything.    *drain hairs.    For those who have no idea what I'm talking about... sprouts.  My mom always called them drain hairs which is probably one of the main reasons I never liked them.  That's not an image you want in your head when you're eating a sandwich, or anything for that matter.  And what's worse is drain hairs seem to have permeated every restaurant in California.  Well, that's it for me.  What about you?  What the oddest thing you've ever eaten and loved and have never told anyone about?  Okay, maybe you told a few people, but it's not something you like to admit to.  Or, what's the worst thing?  Totally off the subject but am I the only one who's noticed J.Lo has a bubblebutt?
