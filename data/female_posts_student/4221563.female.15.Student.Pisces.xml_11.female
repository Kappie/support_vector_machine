Something idiotic on television. Arm really hurting.  Lauren says I'm a blog whore, and I'm sad to say it's true.  Impending events: -Monday's meet and greet with the Japanese people, in which I might just have to drown Cassie in Carney's soup; -Tomorrow's most probably harrowing search for a present for Wendy's sixteenth. She's sixteen- oishimoi; -A weekend of homework and long hours pondering my subject selection sheet, wondering if my future really does lie in nuclear physics.  Stay Tuned, knuckleheads, I would.
