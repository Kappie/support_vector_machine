There are students around me that all they do is stress out over a   simple   vocabulary quiz.  My God!  How EASY could the prof. make this damn test?!   I freakin procrastinate like CRAZY!  I never take notes, just doodle.  I just briefly glance at my study sheet half an hour before the exam. I listen to lecture without even TRYING to understand what the hell she is talking about. I get A's.  So now I'm thinking...I procrastinate and get A's... So I guess procrastination isn't all that bad, eh??   Then there's the feeling that I don't even LEARN anything!!  I can retain it in memory for a week or so, but ask me what a neuromuscular junction is next term and I'll just stare at you blank faced.  I feel like I'm getting softened up too much here, when I should be developing thick skin for when I start attending OSU.  I know graduation is only 6 months away, but I've been thinking about it excessively.  I'm actually kinda scared of going out into the real world.  School has been sorta like a "bubble" for me.  I'm allowed to go in there and learn.  Once in a while I am allowed to come out and make a mistake.  But I can't imagine in the real world: making the tiniest error could kill someone.  And I feel like I'm not getting enough time to perfect my technique!   I don't think I have a happy list today...  Couldn't think of anything, yes, shame on me.  I finally watched Shrek 2 though!  That's something to be happy for, right?  Here is something irregular though: A guy tying his tie...How hot is that?????  LOL. I actually saw this one guy tie his tie on ths bus this morning... and for some odd reason, that just struck me as something very intriguing.  LoL... I'll elaborate more on that later...........................................
