Seriously, like every time I use it, its like pain, so I don't.  If  you want hard, try playing the vibes with a latin beat and no thumb.  Yah...  Oh, um, the thumb, yeh, yesturday I was in the mall volunteering at the Vandy Children's Hospital display thing and it was really ugly, so I decided to make it not ugly and was re-arranging stuff when I looked down at my thumb and there was a large gash from which blood was coming out.  I was kinda like "oops." And went to my mommy, who for the first time in my life, didn't have a band-aid, so I had to go to the lady who was at the little cart rental place, like, 5 feet from the display.  She was really nice.  I've never seen a more well-stocked first aid kit.  Come to think of it, I've never seen a stocked first aid kit.  Kinda defeats the purpose,  doesn't it?
