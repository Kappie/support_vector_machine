Fortunately for me all the graduation ones came out looking really bad, or I would've had mementos of the principal talking about Brown v. the Board of Education (without which she wouldn't be here to not know that we exist).  Other than that, not much going on.  BU isn't giving me enough money, and orientation is this week.  I've got to pick classes, and take a language, and meet people.  Creepy people.  Then it's off on vacation and more pictures.  ^_^  Much love!
