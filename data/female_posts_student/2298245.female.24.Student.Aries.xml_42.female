But I have managed to keep pretty busy, what with flying and helping my mother out with her performances of The Nutcracker.  The show was very beautiful.  Well, at least what I saw of it.  It is hard for me to watch ballet, especially this particular ballet and this particular production of it, because I am so intimately familiar with the music and the choreography and everything about it.  It makes me realize that when I quit dance, I probably made the biggest mistake of my life.  It was the one thing I ever did that made me completely happy, and it was the one thing I did that I was the best at, and could have been great at, and the one thing I always and ever wanted to excel at doing.  But it was scary, the thought of failure, because it was also the hardest thing I've ever done, and the risk of failure was great.  So I gave it up for something easier.  It's one of the reasons I think I ended up going to law school.  I had to prove to myself I had the guts to do something hard.  But even this was the safer decision - for me, getting a job would have been much harder.  But here I am, probably a better person for it.    Anyway, enough moaning.  It's Christmas.  Today is a little bit of shopping.  I've pretty much finished my shopping, so it will mainly just be for fun, to get me out and about and in the Christmas spirit.  It's a balmy 65 degrees here in Mississippi this fine day.  And I'm going to enjoy all of it while I can.
