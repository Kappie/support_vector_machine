I fought back fatigue to the bitter end---actually when I'm shopping I just go into this unstoppable, energetic mode. I went to Tilly's and went a lil crazy but I found pants that fit! That's one of the greatest joys in life. It's unusual but for me, who is very petite, it's absolutely true. So, I bought 4 pairs along with two shirts (one of them is green Hurley tee, I don't usually wear that color but it was too cute to resist) and a belt. I got another pair of flip-flops too...my mom says that I must have ten pairs already...but if they weren't so comfortable...  I volunteered to help Valerie search for clothes for school (in record time might I add, the girl typically takes  forever  by herself) and found a pair of shoes that Kevin liked. Ha! I was on a roll! Such a productive day. Plus all this fun has now completely erased the depressing vibes from yesterday.  I love that good feeling and positive energy that comes with shopping. It's my remedy. There's a commercial about " the healing power of cotton ." It's true. It works. ^_^
