(i always say that) we made a few calls and found out that the weather in the city was bad anyway and the forcast for day four was bleak, but the day after would be nice. well... you wouldnt have us riding back in the rain would you?? BF got his shift covered, mine wasnt an issue since i took a few extra days off. excitement renewed, we were gonna stay another day!!!! then we went to a nice dinner because i needed an excuse to wear my red platforms  urlLink    note the shoes... urlLink    we passed on seafood becuz BF iisnt a fan, and went to this great mexican place...it was sooooo good. they had over 60 tequilas, but we were now on a "staying-an-extra-day" budget, so we didnt partake. this outing was my first attempt at riding a motorcycle with a dress and heels. easier than you might think! later we watched more cable !!!!!  i love discovery channel!  Day four we slept untill 2pm, hit the beach insearch of sand dollars, no luck, but we now have a ton of shells. (ok, maybe not a ton...) then we went on a casino cruise. (yes! another excuse to dress up!)(i'm such a dork) here is the boat:   urlLink    texas treasure urlLink    we got buffet dinner with the cruise tickets, very yummy. it was strange to see how fine dining works. i felt out of place. oh well fuck it. once we hit international waters... let the shameless gambling begin! we only had 40 bucks each to spend, but we decided to make it last on the quarter slots. we started out good. then we found out that BF is not an ocean person. poor guy, i mean he didnt get seasick, but i could tell he didnt feel good. but, trooper that he is he gambled to the end... of the money that is  we didnt win squat.  urlLink    boo hoo, we didnt win! urlLink          urlLink    what? i didnt win?? urlLink     Day five the way back was smooth sailing, hot and sunny the whole way. i hope you enjoyed the vacation account stay tuned for photos of my birthday get together! till next time
