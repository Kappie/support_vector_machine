"Staring out of my bedroom window at other people having a nice life.  Who would have thought things could be so unbelievably pooey? I'm fourteen and my life is over because of the selfishosity of --so called--grown-ups.  I said to Mum, "You re ruining my llife. Just because yours is practically over there is no reason to take it out on me." But as usual when I say something sensible and meaningful she just tutted and adjusted her bra like a Russian Roulettle player. (Or do I mean disco thrower? I don't know and, what's more, I dont care.) If I counted up the number of times I've been tutted at, I could open a tutting shop.  It's jut not fair...How can my parents take me away from my mates and make me go to New Zealand? Who goes to New Zealand? In the end, when I pointed out how utterly useless as mum she was, she lost  her rag and SHOUTED  at me. "Go to your room right now!" I said, "All right, I'll go to my ROOM!! I WILL go to my room!! And do you know what I'll be doing in my room? No you don't, so I'll tell you! I'll be just BEING in my room. That's all.  Because there is nothing else to do!!!!!!" The I just left her thre.  To think about what she has done. Unfortunately it means that I am in m bed and it is only six o'clock."   WASNT THAT THE GREATEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!! I think it's genius...Hm...What other part of the book should i write?    " The Sex God has landed at my door. I was wearing my Teletubby pajamas. He said, "Hi." I said, "Hhhnnnnnnggggghh."    That is all the funnyosity I have for today..Jenny, you still have to read the thirsd book, i'll bring it tomorrow.
