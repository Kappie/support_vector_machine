It's like 2 a.m. so I'm just going to talk about yesterday as if it were today cause I'm bored and there will be more to talk about what happens today later. Well today (yesterday) was boring.. very very boring... I stayed home, chilled and went to track. I had a really bad time at it cause my heart just wansn't in it for some reason. I hadda sick pain in my side and I just didn't wanna do it. Then I came home, and well, I don't know this whole breaking up with Greg business is becomming very.. annoying. I just want it delt with and over but I mean some people just don't wanna forget it and wanna keep bothering me about it. I just want to be me, you know? I want to be able to do my own thing with out him feeling bad cause I mean I'm not a heartless bitch like most people think I am now, I'm just pissed off. Aren't I allowed to be unhappy? Are my feelings so wrong?? Why should I have to make myself miserable, just to make someone else happy, when in the long run they would be miserable cause I was miserable?? That would just make us both miserable, wouldn't it? Of course it would. That's why I don't understand why people just won't let it be and get over it. Like, I don't like that I hurt him but I had to think of myself a little here. I mean, it was always about him, about what he wanted and what he needed. All of our relationships were about what he wanted to do and how he wanted it to go, well this time I had to do something. When he did it, when he tried to break up with me I said to him "If that's what you wanna do." and I let him go, I didn't want to, but I did because it was what he wanted, and now, because I want to do something on MY terms for once, I'm a cold hearted bitch who loves to stomp on people till the die. It just doesn't make sense. Thank God for my friends especailly Debra, Erica, Melanie, Mariana and Mick who have their own problems who took time out of their lives to delv into mine and help me, they still are. Just thank God for them, I just don't know what I'd do. The rest of the trackies too, I was so blessed to be givin such good friends that I could always turn too and that will always be there for me. Especailly now with... well.. one thing and another, they know what I'm talkin about... they are just there for me and I want them to know that I love them so0o0o0o0o0o0o0o much and I will always be there for them if they EVER need me in a heartbeat... I'd do anything for yous just always know that alright?? Alright... well that's enough for tonight (today)... I'll give you a run down of Ashley's sweet 16 which is later today (today)... peace much love XoXoXoXoXo
