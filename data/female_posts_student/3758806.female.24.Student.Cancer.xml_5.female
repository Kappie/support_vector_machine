I don’t want you to vote for me because of my platform; hell I would rather keep that platform nicely tucked away and then WHAM! Nail you with ridiculous military, a NAFTA “bend over for bush” deal and tearing Kyoto up and mailing the pieces back to whatever Jap’ made it up!!!!   Look, right now you may not understand the role of Battleships for peace keeping missions in Afghanistan or humanitarian work in Haiti, but believe me, it’s all good. Just look at my proposed mechanized land fleet as  love-mobiles  carrying extra food next to the 20 mm cannon. In the worst case, vote for me to punish Martin…yeah punish him real good…oh, yeah stick that big black sleekdom up his…ahem, ahem.   As for gay rights…hhhheeeeyyy I’m easy! I say give the free vote ‘cause after all…the “tyranny of the masses” can never be wrong, so I thought I would leave it to the parliament…composed of fifty to sixty year olds. Yep! I say let these people decide the next fifty years; thirty of which they won’t be around to see. Hell, everyone knows that humanitarian rights and the American constitution were really brought about by maw and paws! (sarcasm).   Anyhoooot! I want you to know that I won’t be tough on immigration, since my own ancestry is not from Canada. Nope, my grandfather immigrated here in ’46 from Germany where he was a lieutenant in the military.   If that isn’t reason enough, just look at my family, that blond, blue eyed vision of perfection. That’s Ary my son, and Arian my daughter. My wife Reltih and I work very hard to persuade them that they are called upon to be the best Canadians they can be. We teach them the basic values of Canada, such as the fact that poor people just don’t put the energy into getting out of poverty, and that we should strive for a trickle down economy, where the wealthy use up vast resources, so bountiful that the extra’s falling to lower spectrums should be enough to keep them happy and indented.   As for health care, I don’t want to privatize so much as set working relationships with private industry for the delivery of services for “PUBLICLY” agreed compensations! After all, are we really being fair to NAFTA, when we don’t offer up the fattest friggen piece of meat?   Okay, dokey, if you’re scared of me, vote for me to send me back to the furthest regions of your cranium. If you do like me, vote for me cause you want to be me, and if none of the above is the case…I’ll get you later."
