I thought all she had was a really bad ulcer.  My grandmother passed away.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I couldn't stop shaking, I thought I was going to faint.  I love my grandmother...she was my second-mother.  She was soooo funny !!  I loved her sarcastic sense of humor.    Anyhow..I was sitting in work when my mom called me and told me to get to my grandparents house as soon as possible and to treat this as an emergency.  I asked her if she thought my grandma was going to pass away and she didn't say anything.  So, I start closing all of my programs as I call my cousin and tell her that there is some emergency at my grandma's and that we should get over there asap.  I was about to go tell my boss that I was leaving when my sister called me.  She told me not to go to my grandma's house anymore...she told me to go to my mom's house.  At this point I was really confused.  I told her that I had just spoken to my mom and that she told me to go to my grandma's. She said I just spoke to my mom and she told me to tell you to come here (to my mom's).  Here's when I realized something very strange was going on.  I asked my sister, did she pass away already ?  and she started crying.  I knew then that my grandma was no longer with us.  I started crying and shaking.  I just wasn't expecting to lose my grandma so soon.  I went to my mom's house w/ R  waited for my brother to arrive.  Then we left together to go to my grandparent's house.  I was so sad to see my grandma like that.  They hadn't taken her body yet.  She was lying on the floor in the living room.  That is where she died.  I guess she was sitting on the couch when she asked my grandpa who was in the next room for water.  By the time, he got to the living room she was already falling over the couch and was unconcious.  When the paramedics arrived they layed her flat on the floor to try to bring her back.  After some time, they said that if my mom and grandpa would like them to continue they  may  be able to bring her back but she would be on a machine which would be breathing for her.  My grandma was a very stubborn strong woman.  She always knew exactly what she wanted.  She had already signed paper work previously to make sure that if she was already at the point where she was practically dead, she did not want to be brought back to live in a hospital or a "home for the viejitos" as she would call them.  So my mother and grandpa were faced w/a very difficult decision.  They knew my grandma's wishes but at that moment all wanted was to keep her alive so that they could still have her.  They couldn't decide so the paramedics continued to try.  Unfortunately, they were not able to bring her back.  Her heart would not beat.  She looked very calm, like she was at peace.  She looked like she was sleeping.  It's really strange...I'm really sad, that I won't get to hear all her crazy stories and watch her dance but at the same time I'm glad she is no longer in pain and she is no longer having trouble sleeping.  It's really hard to see my grandpa alone.  They were inseperable.  In love.  Even after 53 years of marriage.   I would love to remember my grandma for her great, funny personality. I wrote this post in my  urlLink live journal"  account on February 18th, 2004 with some of the great things my grandma would do.  I just hope that my grandpa will be ok, I hope I don't lose him too.  His heart is sooo broken.  I hate to see my granpa and mom in so much pain.    As far as I believe, when someone is dead...they are dead...and that's it.  There's nothing more.  I don't really believe in heaven  hell, or reincarnation, or anything else.  Maybe her soul continues to live.  I don't really know where but I feel like she can hear me.  I've been listening to Carlos Vives all weekend and it's for her.  I know she loved her vallenato, salsa, merengue, and italian music (not exactly sure what type of music that is, but that's what she would call it).  I think that she's happy when she is listening to music.  She is the reason I love the music too.  I don't know if she can hear me or hear my thoughts but if she is consious of anything I want her to know this...  Quiero que sabes que te quiero mucho y nunca te voy a olvidar.  Voy hacer todo que puedo para ayudar a mi abuelo.  Una ves a la mes voy a poner el aceite en mi pelo para que se mira bonito como tu pelo.  Voy hacer ejercisios y ya estoy comiendo comida buena.  Tu siempre vas hacer una de las mas importante personas que ha estado en mi vida.  Te quiero muchisimo !! Estoy feliz que ya no sientas dolor, y siempre vas hacer una reina de belleza de Colombia, para mi.  Voy a tratar de no pintar mi pelo y yo le corto el pelo para mi abuelo (si me deja).   Voy a quidar tus munecas y mas importante a mi abuelo.  Quiero que sabes que toda la familia te extrana mucho y que te quieren mucho.  Te voy a extranar, quisiera bailar una ves mas contigo.  Pues..a si lo dejo.  Te quiero mucho y te mando un beso.
