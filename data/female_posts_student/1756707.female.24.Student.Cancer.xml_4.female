Do not melt on stove if you can help it - microwaving seems to keep the mixture from burning.  2 C flour 2 C oatmeal 1/2 C brown sugar 1 t baking soda 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 C butter or margarine  Preheat the oven to 350F. Mix together flour, oats, sugar, soda, and butter. Divide mixture in half, then press half into a 9 by 13 pan, greased at your discretion. Bake 10 minutes. Sprinkle baked bars with 6 oz package of chocolate chips. Spread on caramel mixture, then add the remaining half of the batter. Bake 25 minutes.  *** Sarah and I embarked on the Christmas cookie madness - we have a long list, but only got a few things done.  More baking tomorrow - and consequently more recipes.  Why the heck do I need another blog?  I used to have a foodie site which I loved but never updated - and consequently no one read it.  I thought maybe the convenience of  urlLink blogger  would make popping favorite recipes online a little easier.  So watch this space for more recipe goodness as the tasty meals are prepared.  :)
