Thursday I babysat in the morning, and then I drove to Anna's, where I could not park my car properly, and had to have her do it for me. We stopped at Wal-Mart, like we always do before a trip, and when we were leaving she goes, "I think I'll take out the Starting Line CD" and then what do we hear? "THE REASON" DAMNIT I'M SO SICK OF THAT SONG. We drove up to Cleveland to see Never Heard Of It. I named all the counties along the way. We headed towards The Phantasy Nite Club, which was crappy and old. We walked around, cause nobody was there. Well, we did see this kid walking with his parents wearing pants that said "Fuck" all over them. We went into the drug store to go pee. We had to go to the courtesy counter and ask through the bullet-proof glass for the key. Anna saw a bunch of Hostess products, Ohio never fails us! We went back to wait in line/by the door. The band still hadn't arrived. But then, I saw the RV. They drove by and DJ was looking out the window and we waved. So attractive. Their RV is PIMPING! It has their name all over it and they have a trailer with good stickers. DJ walked around and gave us hugs and we talked about Anna's upcoming interview. We had to talk to their tour manager or something, Nosh (don't know how to spell, sounds like "No-shhhh"). Rick walked around, but he ignored us and looked really bad. I hate to say it, but bring back the California surfer-dude hair, and lose the nose ring. It looked like he always had a booger, but it was the ball on his nose ring. We sat with Jeff for literally two hours. He kept having Anna massage his back. She tried standing up, but he thought that was weird, so he asked to sit between her legs- WHOA! He was so needy. Every five minutes he'd be like "Higher... no lower. Now scratch it." EWW I glared at him and he goes, "You must think I'm a dick." He was really nice the first night, but more on that later. We learned that since Greg's departure, they brought on this 17-year-old named Dan. I was quite excited to see this kid. They weren't playing until 10:45, so we didn't go inside until about 9. We were actually on the list, SURPRISE! The first two bands we saw were okay. The club had all these black lights, which revealed several embarrassing stains on my jeans. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GOT THERE! We met NHOI's new merch guy, but I can't remember his name. I want to say Kevin, maybe that's right. He shook our hands and winked, it was quite cute. Anna boughtthe tequila shirt of theirs, and I read the Spanish part. Finally, they went on. Dan was really cute! He had a semi-mullet, but he had a lip ring- ON THE GOOD SIDE! Anna told me that when DJ sings he gets right in your face. I told her he better not, cause that will scare me. And scare me it did, cause he gets right up in your grill. Then he'd shake his head and his sweat would go everywhere! They were very good live. Lots of energy. But they didn't play "Veronica" like Jeff said they would. After, we went back to the merch table. DJ apologized that they didn't play "Veronica" but said that they would the next night. We met Dan, who was just as cute in person. On their message boards, people say he can guess your birthday. We tried to play the game, but he didn't do so well. The guys seemed to like my "Real Men Love Unicorns" t-shirt. Dan said he loves unicorns, the beach, marshmallows, and the color pink. Good boy. There was this girl there with these tattoos. One on her arm was of a naked woman. Dan kept going over and pinching the boobs, and Anna goes, "Look! You got some action!". Then the girl pulls down her pants and shows this weird tattoo on her thigh. I saw some stuff of hers, I don't think she wanted to share. She should probably keep her pants buckled, I mean, just a thought. When we were driving home, Anna called her friend, Karly, and told her about the massage thing and him being between her legs. Karly was on spearkerphone, and I heard her ask, "Did you get wet?" I STARTED LAUGHING SO HARD- WHO IS THIS KID?!    We went to my aunt's house, where she had labeled everything we would use, and then watched some Blind Date and went to bed. The next morning we went to my aunt Sue's to burn a copy of the Lola Ray CD for Jeff, he had asked for it. Then we got ready and drove to Toledo for the show. Anna saw a sign for "Fangboner Road". It made us remember Texas and how we giggled at "Harry Hines Boulevard" or as I called it, "Harry Hinds Boulevard!"The place was called "Missi's Blues" or something like that. But it was spelled M-I-S-S-I... that's HORRIBLE! They didn't show up for a while. Finally, the huge NHOI RV pulled up. We gave Jeff his CD and Dan some beads to put on his shoelaces, Anna's newest creation. The guys were pretty nice and everything. Nosh said we'd do the interview around 5:30. Jeff took these two girls into the RV. Finally NOSH was like, "Yeah, Jeff will come get you when he's finished getting his 'massage'!" WHAT?! Anna gives him massages, not those two ho's. What was THAT about? That began the dislike for Jeff. Around 6 or so, once it started to pour rain (of course), Nosh calls out from the RV "Allie, come on in!" Who's Allie? Well, he meant us. He got confused. Anna was like, "Her name is Allison..." and he's like "Yeah yeah." Okay, whatever. We walk in the RV and those skanks with Jeff were there. One was adjusting her boobs. Right.... a back massage? Try lower. Nosh kicked them out, thankfully. Jeff and DJ were doing the interview. I turned my head and saw Rick without his shirt on. I was very embarrassed. The interview went pretty well. Then we left and talked to Dan outside a little. He's from Mexico and speaks Spanish, very nice. We went inside and talked to him a lot more there. He is a funny kid. Let me remember some good stuff: at one point he was talking about something (I can't remember what) and then he goes, "That'll be my thing." And Anna goes "And putting beads on your shoelaces can be my thing." And I asked, "Well what can be my thing?" And Dan goes, "We can put our things together." MY EYES GOT SO BIG AND I JUST STARTED LAUGHING. He forgot our birthdays, but kept trying to guess. He was staring at me trying to remember, and I got nervous and was biting my lip and scrunching my face, and he goes, "I love that face!" I'm so scared of eye contact! Then we were talking and he's like, "You wanna go on a date?" HELL YEAH. He says "Fuck yeah, dude" all the time. He wants to tattoo it across his stomach. That's hot. He gave us guitar picks, but then borrowed mine for the show. He promised to give it back, and after the show hehe did as he said "Sorry it's so gross and wet". No problem, I don't mind. We talked a little more to some ofthe guys and these kids from Michigan. We were saying bye to Nosh, and DJ walked over and just put his arm around me. My god, that man smells like angels, it's amazing. And his back, talk about definition. SO hot. Rick was a lot nicer the second night, but Jeff became a dick. Overall, it was a pretty good time! We drove home and then I went back to mi casa to go to sleep and prepare for Saturday.      So let's begin with Saturday. It was a good day. I was going to volunteer for the Young Voters Project. I went there at 11 to have a training session with Stephen. This annoying 20-something-year-old guy, Jeremy, joined us and kept trying to be better than me. After our session, some of the workers started to come in for the day. This kid, Luke, was leaning against the wall reading the newspaper. He had a hat on and his headphones around his neck, he was kind of cute. RJ drove myself, Luke, Becca, and the funniest kid I've ever met, James, down to the Jazz and Rib Festival where we'd be trying to get people to sign our petition to vote this November. James was like "Are you excited?" and I said yes, and he goes, "You sure don't look it!" And I was like "NOO... I am just really tired, I was out of town yesterday." They were talking about going out that night and James asked me what I was doing and he goes, "You're 18 right?" And I said no, and nobody believed me that I was 17. RJ dropped us off and then we set off for the festival. James kept freaking out about jay walking (is it like that or is it just "j walking", I don't really know) and he goes, "When I was a kid, I thought it was just walking in a 'J'". Then he started doing it in the middle of the road. We got up to the festival and James was going on about how he had to pee. We stopped at a Port-a-Potty, but he goes, "I won't go in those, just find me a tree!" Then Luke goes, "Okay James and Becca you stay at this entrance. Allison and I will go down to the other." Great, I have to spend 4 hours with some relatively cute guy, I wonder how I will embarrass myself today. So we walk down and he was telling me that he's from NYC and is just here for 6 weeks to work on this project. He was like, "Yeah, I'm going to do my part to take Bush down!" So now you're 10 times cuter. Actually, he really wasn't that cute, but he does oddly resemble Jason Mraz. Something in the eyes. So I watched him talk to people in the beginning. A bunch of people were jerks and wouldn't listen, then we get one. The first guy is some hick, but he was a good guy. He was like "At first, I thought Bush wasa good idea. But now, this is horrible..." and he went on and on and he was swearing like none other! Luke was like, "Yeah man, that anger is understandable." I was biting my lip trying to not laugh. This kid is from NYC and here he is talking to this hick guy with no teeth. Welcome to Ohio. Then I went off to talk to this couple. This guy comes over and starts talking to me when they are finished:     Guy: "What are you doing?"       I explain the petition and ask if he wants to sign    Guy: "No, I don't want to sign that, I want to know what you are doing. I think you are really cute. Maybe we could hang out some time."    Me:  completely perplexed  "Uhhh... I don't think that's such a good idea."    Guy: "Why?"    Me:  so nervous I lie : "Well, I just got out of something, and I think I need some time to work on myself."    Guy: "What did this guy do to you? I mean we can be friends, you know. You can have friends. I don't even live here, but I'll drive here for you."    Me: "Yeah I just don't think it's a good idea."    Guy: "Can't I just call you?"    It kept going on and I didn't know what to do! My head was in my hands and I was like "Fine take my fucking number" and gave it to him. I was going to make one up, but I felt so bad. Then he was like "I can feed you and that dude." NO, live me alone! So I walked back over to Luke looking down, cause that guy kept staring and motioning for him to get us food or something, and Luke asked what was wrong, but I said nothing. So then we started to get people to sign the petition. Four hours later... it was so god damn hot. We started to head back to get picked up and James joined us. That kid is so funny. Luke was pissed cause he was 3 signatures less than 50. James asked me how many I got and I told him 40. He was really impressed and Luke asked how many I got and when I told him his eyes got so big. They were like, "That's really good for your first day!" I was pretty proud of myself. So as we were walking back, James kept going on about how he hates Ohio and how black people don't take care of each other here the way they do in Georgia. Then he was saying he's never lived in a more racist place, and I was like, "You're from the South!" I told him I went to CSG and he goes, "My mom tried to sign me up there. No, I'm not kidding. I don't do well around guys." Then he started freaking out about jay walking again and started to walk in the crosswalk when it said "Don't Walk". I told him, "I really don't think it's jay walking if you are in the crosswalk." Then we started talking about girls in NYC. James was like, "They have the finest lookin Dominican women there. Every girl's got a J. Lo booty!" Luke asked me if I was Dominican, no no I'm not anything but English, Czech, and Indian DAMNIT! James goes, "My baby's mama is a beautiful Dominican girl." Then he talked about how his father and brother were in the Crips and how he NEVER wears red and all that. James is a funny, funny guy. There were all these Pro-Life people, so in the car Luke goes, "There's pro-choice and pro-life, why don't they make a category where they kill all the babies?!" I thought that was funny, actually. Then we went back to the headquarters and did these timesheets thing. They were long and hard. Stephen gave me a huge hug when I got back. As I've told Anna, my three rules are: 1. Don't touch me. 2. Don't talk to me. and 3. Get the FUCK away from me. But all of these people were nice, so it was okay. Everyone was impressed with my 40 people. Stephen has the worst laugh I've ever heard, it's 350 times worse than mine. Yep, that bad. I signed up to work during the Working Title concert, since I'm going anyways, and I get in for FREE! Since Luke was my coach guy, he kept trying to give me advise: "You just gotta keep your head held high. I mean, people are jerks, but don't worry, okay?" I was like, "I'm really okay." So I finally left and I was like, "Thanks for all the help, Luke." And he starts waving and is like, "No problem, bye! Have a good day!" Dude, it's 5:30, the day is over.     I babysat this morning. I don't know if anything else is going on. Oh, Anna got an interview with Patrick from Limbeck when we go to see Maxeen in Cleveland. That's super exciting- she loves that kid. I just really love Tom Bailey- he's beautiful. That's about it. BYE!
