They say that shit happens, but that much shit!? I read the news and nothing makes me happy about it... Just the fact that I know what's going on in the world! At least I'm not like most people who choose not to know, who live in ignorance, who thrive in their mediocre ways... What a shity life to live! Reality is bad but it's all we've got, so please don't run away from it... Don't take the easy way out! I used to think little of myself, but now I know that I'm better than many people, and that is good enough for me! I have no dreams of being the best, just the best that I can be! I feel good!
