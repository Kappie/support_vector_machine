When I see you,  4 I do not even like your face;  5 the one thing that I want to do is to  6 look at other girls. I never wanted to   7 marry you. Our last conversation  8 was very boring and has not  9 made me look forward to seeing you again.  10 You think only of yourself.  11 If we were married, I know that I would find  12 life very difficult, and I would have no  13 pleasure in living with you. I have a heart  14 to give, but it is not something that   15 I want to give you. No one is more  16 foolish and selfish than you, and you are not  17 able to care for me and help me.  18 I sincerely want you to understand that  19 I speak the truth. You will do me a favor  20 if you think this is the end. Do not try   21 to answer this. Your letters are full of  22 things that do not interest me. You have no  23 true love for me. Good-bye! Believe me,  24 I do not care for you. Please do not think that  25 I will love u forever and with all my heart...
