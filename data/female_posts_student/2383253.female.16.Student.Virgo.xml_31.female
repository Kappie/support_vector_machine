On Thursday, my mom gave me this "advanced screening" movie ticket for two to see the movie "Mean Girls," which doesn't come out for a little while, I presume. It's a Lindsay Lohan movie and it's one of those teenage melodramas, so to be completely honest, I wasn't expecting too much out of it. So I invited Chelsea to come with me and see it, and we were both pleasantly surprised. The movie contains pretty original humor and we were shocked at how the high school portrayed has such an  uncanny  resemblance to Torrey Pines and the shit that takes place there. It was quite a treat, and I'd recommend the movie to any TP students. Afterward we went to a nearby sushi bar, where I had real sushi for the first time (I usually eat the pre-packaged stuff)!  On Friday, I did nothing except lounge around at Red Robin, and later came home and watched "The Exorcist" for the trillionth time with my mom. Not a very interesting day.  Today, my mom woke me up at 8:00 to go running with her like I had promised earlier in the week. We ended up running 3.3 miles near some trail by the Jewish Academy and the 56. I nearly died since I haven't exerted myself so much in about a year. But I think I'm going to start running like that more often, since I need to shave off about ten pounds (eek). My dad has been up in Oregon for my great-grandma's memorial service (I didn't know her very well), so my mom, brothers, and I went to Fashion Valley to poke around for a while on our own. Got a nice new pair of white Steve Madden sandals. When we got home, Matt came over to visit for a little while and pick up the Physics homework. We had a good chat about SATs, colleges, and school projects (as usual), and he's going to help me get into my "dream college!" Woohoo!  And now I've run out of things to discuss.
