I got up early (for me) this lovely Sunday morning, remembering to set my clock forward, to attend church with Christina and Simone.  It was a very lovely Palm Sunday experience in the beautiful Greek Orthodox Cathedral on 74th Street.  I even got a lovely palm to take home with me as a reminder of the day.  Isn't it amazing how I can't find more to say about such a pleasant experience, when I am getting ready to say so much about an unpleasant one?  So, my sister called me last night (actually early this morning) when I was in bed and left a message telling me that she had some "news" that she wanted to share with me.  Now I love my sister - she's my twin, and as we've gotten older I've come to think of her as one of my best friends - and she is so nice and sweet and kind and really lovely in so many ways, and a much better person than I am, assuming such things can be quantified.  And I knew what her news was to be - an official announcement of her engagement to her boyfriend.  I can honestly say that they seem very compatible, and that I hope with all my heart that they will be happy together.  And I also am glad that they are planning on waiting a while before actually getting married.   This, surprisingly, is not the thing that made my day turn sour.  After all, I've had a lot of time to prepare myself for it.  I've known it was coming, and while I may not think it is the best possible way things could turn out, it is the way they are going to turn out, and I think that, as a whole, it will all work out in the end, and I am at peace with that.  After all, I don't have to be happy about it so long as she is.    It is what my sister said to me when I finally got her on the phone after playing hours of phone tag that got to me.  Let me preface this by saying that she meant it as a joke, and that I should have realized it - and that somewhere in the back of my mind I did realize it, or at least saw that things weren't adding it - but it was one of those moments of sheer gullibility when no matter how fantastic the thing the other person is saying to you sounds, even while acknowledging it, you still believe them.    So what was it she said?  Nothing so dreadful; just that she wanted me to dance at her wedding.  I thought she was being serious, and it made me mad.  Why?  Partially, I suppose, because I wanted to have a bigger part in a day that is so special.  Partially because dancing is a very special and sacred thing to me, and not to be entered into in such a manner - with me out of shape and in the environment of a wedding.  But I do know one thing.  I shouldn't have gotten so upset.  But I did, and even as I did I felt bad, because my sister doesn't ever purposely set out to upset people - she is too nice.  And its not even like her to do something like this - the whole joke was my father's idea.  Perhaps I am just too sensitive.  In some ways I don't like the idea of my sister getting married because it will mean things will never go back to the way they were, even though that would hardly be the only thing preventing a return.  I guess I just don't like change so much.  Having typed all this out - well, that and consumption of more of my birthday chocolate, has made me feel a lot better.  Now, I should really try and do some work before the day is complete.
