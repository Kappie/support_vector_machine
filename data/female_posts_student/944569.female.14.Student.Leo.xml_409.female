I composed a short song a while ago when I was crazy like now ( ps the words in this song have nothing to do with you, It just happeneds that it relates to todays events by luck, i made it a year ago) :  I'm getting sick and tired of love By nature I'm quite shy Yet puppy love is something I see too much of - - 'cause My hound gets round more than I - - aaahhhhwwwoooooooo  Maybe my front teeth are too big Or my sports car is too small 'Cause they say that I'm too short, when I know I'm way too tall Maybe I need to be less of a shrew 'Cause my dog gets more dates then I do  Maybe I should eat what I feed my pet Who attracts everything but fleas I might as well live in Tibet Oh woe woe woe is me...  Either I've got too much B.O. Or too short a life time Or they just don't like the way that I always talk in rhyme Maybe I should not come unglued 'Cause my dog gets more dates than I do  My dog gets more dates My mutt has more mates My dog gets more dates than I doooooo!  Composed by Adam Davidge and Bobby Houston ( I know it sux but i'm very lunatic at this moment)
