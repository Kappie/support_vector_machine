Hah!  so on Sunday I woke up at 6 and hopped in the car. We went to Ikea and spent like two hours there which was boring because we weren't shopping for me. [so, I am a self centered freak, sue me. (wow. Stop talking Laura)]  Then I was like "can we go to Nordstorm?" and my mom was like "Okay" So I got these cool plaid pants. But I had a problem. I don't have anything that goes with them. Hahahha. I am so un-smart. So now I have a useless pair of pants in my closet. Acctually, I am planning on going to the couv mall later to get a matching shirt..but anyWHOO.   I really need  a new pair of shoes because my shoes aren't all pretty and white anymore so I tried on endless pairs of Pumas but since I have huge feet none of the ones i liked were in the proper color. At least the show fitting man was absolutely gorgeous. I felt kinda bad that I didn't buy something from him but oh well.  Then we went to queen anne and had lunch with my cool cousin Chrystal.  After that we went to CAMP.  We registered and they gave me my key and I went to my dorm...My roommate was sitting on her bed. At first I was like "Oh crap, she is like 18.." but as it turns out she was only 8 days older than me. Haha. She was quite friendly. Then we went to dinner which was tasty.  Then after some other random things we went to sleep. Amy [my roomie] and I just fell right asleep. We had to wake up at 7:00 for breakfast. It was good too. I had sausage, hash browns, water, french toast, and I think I had eggs.  Then we had our first day of classes.  They were scary.  Everyone was like little theologians. I was like I am going to die.  I am an okay christian and all but I didn't have a clue as to what the shroud of tehedron was.  so Monday I was like "I WANNNA GOOO HOMMMEE" well, not that excesive..but you get the picture.  Then I went to bed and I woke up. [are you sure about that?]  Everything was just SOOOOO much better, I started ot understand everything it was GRAND.  Then came Wednesday and we went to go practice what we learned. We went to the university of washington campus and we went and talked to all these people. It was awesome. But really sad. All the people I talked ot were so lost. I talked to this guy named Yoshi for like a half an hour and he was like "I bielve in rencarnation" it was sad. Then this other guy I talk to was like "I wanna go to hell because that's where all the drugs are" It was kind of scary.  But it was awesome becuase I felt like I could acctually do somehting. God gave me SO much strength.  [Not to mention I walked around with this awesome guy named jodie]  Well. yeah.  I learned a TON. We had like 40 hours of classes. It was crazy.  But yeah.  Fun stuff man.
