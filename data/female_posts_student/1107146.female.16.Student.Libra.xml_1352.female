Josh....it's good that we kinda talked that out and which path are you taking......the xi path or your very own path of actually continuing to be my friend.....that would be nice. Anyway save me everyone....i suffer that ailment that Abby suffers, boredom though an interesting convers which phil cured that for like 45min. It's amazing what two bored people find to talk about.......not kidding. Anyway i was trying to reach those at renfest. You know those fairy wands with glitter in them...well lets just say that rosie was a sheet of glitter at the end of renfest....but i got everyone one first and they were worse that I. Only problem with all that is I STILL have glitter on me.....great Yes Z i know my grammar in this post was awful....i don't care cuz school is out and the AP essay is being pushed back by me. ok time for bye bye all -rosie
