Cross your fingers . . . Mom's already getting on my nerves, but aren't most mothers nerve wracking?? :) Trying to get down here was a awesome task . . . alot of annoying things happened today . . . i won't bother writing them, cuz i DO NOT wanna relive this day! :)  I NEED TO FIND A JOB OR I WILL BE HOME WITH MOM ALL DAY!!!
