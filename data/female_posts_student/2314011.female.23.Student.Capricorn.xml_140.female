Between the weather in the 70s, freedom begging to be played with and taken advantage of after turning in the big brief, and cute gas station cashiers giving me more than enough to day dream about, it would be easy to think we're done, finished, ready for three months of summer's glory.  But May can be a dangerous thing.  Especially when it's not yet April.  And so, I find myself somewhere in between:  nestled in the Grind, near the door, enjoying the warmth, getting ready to dig into Civil Procedure, sipping the year's first iced mocha.
