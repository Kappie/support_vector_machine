Mrs. Mann, our drama teacher, wasn't there. So we had Mr. Farnesworth. -shudder- The Teacher Of Hell. He told us off for about 15 minutes and then told us to practise on stage. So of course the other three groups go and practise, but the 15 minutes he used to tell us off were supposed to be OUR practise time.  And then, before Art(last period) Freya told me that Siana(someone in my Drama class) had seen Mrs. Mann just then. I was like screaming out every single swear I know (and I know how to swear fully in like three languages: English, Russian and Indonesian, lol) because I PAINTED MY NAILS, MISSED MY NORMAL TRAIN NOT GETTING THE PROPS, BROUGHT THREE COSTUMES FOR SOMEONE WHO TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THERE EVEN and actually fucking MEMORISED almost everyones lines!!!  I am soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo pissed now.   If you can't figure out the title of this post, (which you probably can't) I'll probably mention it in some other one later.   MSN Problems   This girl and I have been doing this RP on MSN. So now we kinda grind to a halt in the storyline and we decide to add another character, preferably a male because we both RP as female characters. I've already mentioned my disability to RP as males. Well now I will mention my disability to RP as more than one character. There is one single exeption, and that is my wierd ice myrmidion Kerinjoren. He's just wierd. so I can do him. Anyway. So now we're stuck. If, by some amazing chance, a LITERATE, Medieval/Fantasy RPer comes along and reads this, my MSN is mystiknest@hotmail.com. Or just if you happen to know a literate Medieval/Fantasy RPer. Either way. Please? -tilts head and gives cute-pathetic-puppydog look to world of RPers-
