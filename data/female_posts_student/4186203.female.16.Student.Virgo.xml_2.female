Like one minute I say to myself back away because theres no point leading him along because you know nothing will come of it, but on the other hand, sometimes I do think I've got feelings for him, feelings that have appeared from speaking to him on the net every night for the past month or so, feelings that have never really gone away from months ago..But what do I do ?     I want to see him and Ive suggested it but even that has turned into a big issue now so Im guessing we won't..maybe tommorrow I won't come on the net, I think Im just goin to block them all for a while, theres onl James who I speak to anyway..  Dean goes on holiday tomorrow, he text me and said about speaking when he gets back, like everything that was said last night didnt happen, sometimes I just wish he could be honest..  Saw Jaimes today, read his journal, he had put about when he met everybdoy and what he thought about them for Abbi he put: Abbi (the girl dean is going to dump his girlfriend for) Pretty much sums it up though, but when I read that, it didnt make me feel anything, I didnt feel upset in the slightest, I do think I'm over him now, after everything that happened, it only took me two and a half months, lol  # But The Words Inside My Head, Are Better Left Unsaid (Nine Days - Crazy) #
