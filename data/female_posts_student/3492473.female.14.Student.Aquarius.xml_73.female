I read your website  all the time !" So thanks to all of you who always read this! Anyway, the reason I haven't posted in awhile is because I've been busy starting this buddyprofile. OMG! It's awesome! Ask Erica! It's so much better than a SubProfile. You can change everything so it's all colorful and everything! Here, check it out:  urlLink   http://www2.buddy4u.com/index.php And if you wanna look at my profile, check out my AIM profile for it!
