Your face crowds my mind and disrupts my thoughts you make it hard to think straight I wish that you never happened I wish that I weren't sitting here wondering how you taste wondering what you're thinking and then cursing you and cursing me for letting myself fall into you like I am...  And I never wanted to be trapped in silence I never wanted to come down with this Illness I never wanted to need you but what I want doesn't seem to matter anymore no what I want has never mattered I just liked to pretend that it did.  *    *    *    *    *  Rainy Days  Today I questioned reality and I stared at the fragments of blue sky that weren't covered by a blanket of Gray and I wondered if today would ever end.  I brushed out my hair and stained the carpets and the blankets with my tears who I cry for  I still don't know.  I am hopeless.  I watched as the birds flew away and I waved them a temporary goodbye they know that there's nothing left for them here but I'm still struggling to accept that thought I'm still trying to Convince myself thta this is paradise  We both know it's not  So I'll tie a string around my finger so I can remember to forget  I went outside to pick some wildflowers so I could save them form the storm that was approaching instead I drowned them in my tears.  WHO DO I CRY FOR? answer me please cuz I still don't know...  I never have time to think about it though I'm too busy tieing a string 'round my finger so I can remember to forget.
