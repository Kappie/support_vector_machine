It's like my least favorite city ever, but I kind of actually want to go cause apparently she knows this store where they sell Coach/Burberry/Louis Viotton bags for only like 25 bucks!  That's uber cheap and I must get some.  I love Coach!  At least we're not staying overnight.  We're just going to go Saturday morning, and return Saturday night.  Fun times.  ...la Gu
