I think I'll start with yesterday, seeing as it came first. I got grounded and stuff, then Noodle knocks on my door and decides that I should be kidnapped. So I get to the church and Boots decides we should bring Dave along. So we walk a mile to meet him halfway at QT, then walk a mile back. We go to church, stuff happens, Dave nearly drowns in the drinking fountain (twice, hee hee), and I go home.  Next day! It sucks! 'Cept in programming class I logged into blogger real quick to see if I could squeeze in a quick post (which I never did) and I got an offer to join Google Mail (GMail, apparently). I heart Google. Drew tried to cheat Google and sign up for an account and he failed miserably. It was funny.   Then in Spanish Mrs. Wunderlich gave me a proposal to make a HUGE hall poster, which I worked on whilst at home. I'm going to give her the rough draft tomorrow. Pa says he might get me some paints to work with on Saturday, depending on when I start working on the actual poster.  And now, I'm in "Advanced Computer Applications" class, and hating every minute of it. Yarr, boring stuff. I just can't wait till it's Friday though, but I fear it will be a short one and the weekend will be VERY long. Homework on Saturday, family on Sunday, school on Monday (ick). School is boring. Only three more weeks of college though, thank goodness. Although I've been needing to get in my registration stuffs, I've had it ready but I have to pester the guidance office at my high school still.  I think that about covers everything, I'll be playing Mortal Kind (a screwey version of a cross between modern d20 and d&d) tomorrow so no blogging until Saturday, assuming I find the time. And no blogging Sunday probably either. I'll see you all whenever. Or not.   Current Mood:  Blah.
