It's not like other people who replace a certain pain with another pain (the pain of hunger). No. I do that with other things. This is me not replacing anything, just taking away. Taking away food because when I look in the mirror, I see a gross figure. Then when I haven't eaten and I see my hip bones and that my waist is smaller, I'm happy. I'm disgusting but I can't stop. It's not that I don't eat, because I do. I just ... eat less and less often. That's not so bad right? Sigh. Why am I like this? Why can't I see me the way other people see me?
