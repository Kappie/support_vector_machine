Shouldn't we encourage the younger generation to learn these things so that they won't get scammed and instead know their full rights? And for the lady at Cassidy's: it could have been a fancy dress party, and women can wear men's t-shirts, get over yourself! I don't want to rant. It feels like a waste of space.
