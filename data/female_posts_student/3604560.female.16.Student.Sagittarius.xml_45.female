Ooh, our next door neighbours are watching Star Wars Ep VI...I'm so proud that I can recognise it from just the music! I know what you're thinking ... *freak* right? Wrong! I'm not just a freak...I'm a (semi-)obssessed freak! (Fully obssessed would be when I own a lightsabre replica, which will be when I have enough money).    Speaking of merchandice, unofficial pics of The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King Extended Edition DVD Collector's Box Set Miniature Minas Tirith Sculpture looks sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool! And I for one will happily dish out 150odd bucks for it come December...and if the release day falls on a school day, you guys might all have to put up with me staring adoringly at the box alllllllllllllllllllllll day long.    *Sigh* can't wait! I'm going on a (relatively big, for me)DVD binge. Of course, I might have to find ways toget some ofthem in the mail without my parents knowing. Anyone have any ideas?    Mel, Farscape DVD is only a few clicks away, so tell me when to click!     Well, I've gushed on for long enough...    Ciao bellas    Namárië
