Having not yet falling completely back into student mode and operating under the (mistaken) impression that yesterday's academic errands wouldn't take too many stops or too much time, I wore a pair of exceedingly impractical (but cute) shoes.  FIRST I had to go to Allen Hall, where I was told I could pick up an Enrollment Agreement (whatever that was) from Admissions.  Got there only to find out that Admissions had been moved to Montgomery Hall (which has no sign as it's only recently had renovations completed).  Hung out there for a while waiting for my Enrollment Agreement and then had to go BACK to Allen Hall to get my ID photo made (it was horrible of course, though not the worst I've ever had).  From there I had to hike across campus to the Student Health Center to show them my proof of immunization so that I could register.  From THERE I had to hike in the opposite direction toward Magruder Hall (the psych building) to meet with my advisor, which wasn't a particularly fruitful meeting other than actually getting ahold of my pin number so that I could access the online registration stuff.  I already knew what classes, what section and what times I'd be meeting and had already pre-ordered books accordingly.  I did ask Dr. Spirrison about the success rate among those completing the program getting into PhD programs and he confirmed my suspicions that many of those unsuccessful in recent years did not have nearly the undergrad GPA or GRE scores that I have.  Provided that I do well in all my classes here, I shouldn't have any problems getting in somewhere.  From his office I walked a few blocks down to the Union bookstore to pick up my books (they didn't have two of them), then back to my car.  Drove a huge loop around campus looking again for a parking space near the union because I thought I'd been mischarged for a book.  Turns out the receipt was just hard to read.  THEN I had to drive all the way to the Colliseum to get my parking decal.  But first evidently I had to register my vehicle online, which was a pain in the ass as the system wasn't set up for me yet and I had to get OUT of line to find help and then wait in line AGAIN only to have it not like the password I picked.  Since when is my last name in the dictionary?  The old white guy that was helping me asked what my first name was.  "Courtney" I replied.  (Incidentally my student ID was sitting right under his nose).  "Q?"  I gave him a look that questioned his ability to hear.  "No, it's Courtney."  "Q?"  "No, it's C."  "Q?"  "C!"  What kind of dumbass looks at a petite little white chick and thinks Courtney is spelled with a Q?  No matter that I don't actually GO by my first name.  By the time I finally got my decal and headed home I was exceedingly annoyed and excessively put out by everyone's idiocy.  I finally was able to get registered.  Geez.  Today at work has gone pretty well.  I think the ice has finally been broken with my office mate.  She was (for her) positively chatty this morning.  She actually shared some personal information.  I jumped at the opening.  Maybe the next few months won't be so bad after all.  Once she opens up she's got a wicked dry sense of humor.   Tonight is girl's night.  Marion and I are providing chick flicks and some sort of food for our friend (really Marion's friend and my acquaintance, but she seems nice) Anna, who recently wed her longtime boyfriend because he was being sent to Iraq.  They had all of two weeks together before he got shipped off to Camp Shelby for training or whatever.  I don't think he leaves the country for another few months.  But in any case, Anna is missing him like crazy and is totally disconsolate.  Marion and I both had our reservations about the wisdom of marrying before a year or more separation.  But c'est la vie.  'tis done.  Back to work...  Yours, Maggie
