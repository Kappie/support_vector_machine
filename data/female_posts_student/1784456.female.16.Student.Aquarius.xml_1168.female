It was sooooo boring.  It rained all day so I didn't feel like shopping on Park Street :( and then we go and get lost on some hill in the pouring rain.  FUN!! Then when we finally got to the city centre we had to stand in a shop doorway to eat our lunch, and then got the next bus home!  Today on the otherhand was more exciting, I met up with Anna and we did what we do best; SHOP!! I got a LUSH bag its little and black with really cute stitching on it, I really am so happy I bought it.  Well I hope that you have all had a really exciting year and heres to the next.*raises glass* to a fantastic new year; may it bring you happiness, health and a whole lotta luvin! *Puts glass down* Ok well thats my little thang over and done with.  Will someone please phone me about going out, because if you dont I will cry because I will think that no one likes me.  Also you could all probably come round to mine (HOPEFULLY) Toodles xx
