Anyways I thought I would post it.   "Remember"  I remember our first kiss And how much I miss it Remember when I first held your hand You knew I was your man (I mean boy)    Remember me in your heart And lets never fall apart Remember how much I love you And that you love me too Remember that we're not through Not now or not ever Remember me forever Remember when you sleep My love is what you keep Remember when you lay down at night That I held you tight Tightly in my arms To keep you warm Just remember I care To lie to you is a dare Will you just remember that you'll forever be my boo If not just remember I love you...
