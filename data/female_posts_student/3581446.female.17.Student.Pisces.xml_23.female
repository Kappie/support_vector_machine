The difficulties of turning them into big deeds are formidable."  -Lenin  "Pablo Picasso was Spanish; so am I. Picasso was a painter; so am I. Picasso was a communist; neither am I."  -Salvador Dali   'And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'

"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

As God gradually reveals himself and reveals man to himself, prayer appears as a reciprocal call, a covenant drama. Through words and actions, this drama engages the heart. It unfolds throughout the whole history of salvation." -Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2567  "Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."  -Napoleon   "Even monkeys fall from trees."  -Korean Expression   "Hatred never did hatred solve; this is a truth eternal."  -Buddha  "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." -Confucius  "Visits? That would indicate visitors."  - Plan 9 From Outer Space   "Happiness rests in misery. Misery hides in happiness." -Daodejing of Laozi  "Bear costumes are funny. Bears, as well."  -Christopher Walken   -Ian
