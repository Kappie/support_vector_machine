Betrayal Betrayal is hurtful and also the devil because it is always full of pure evil It lies within you...whether you want to make it happen or not it makes your stomach churn and always leaves a knot  Betrayal has no trust in it That's why couples were against it it leaves a hutful scar you'd be sitting there with your mouth ajar cuz your ties have broken with her regreting the days you spent together  Betrayal does not come like that It's you, it's YOU who make it happen.....
