The sky opened up and it seemed as if solid walls of water surounded us. Of course I started the day off right by running and dancing in it with my friends. I love the rain, espescially when it's appropriate for playing in. Really heavy rain can lighten everyone's mood, if you're out in it. Others see it as a limitation - an obstacle that leaves them trapped indoors. But what harm did a little water ever cause anyone? It's like a swimming pool in the air!   A freshman thought I was a sophomore. Some of my mother's friends thought I was 14. I don't wanna look old, I deffinately don't want to look like everyone else - I like being me usually, even if "me" appears to be 14. But I would like to feel atractive every now and then. I mean I'm not a beauty queen or love goddess, but I like to think I'm a nice girl, and that surely someone wants my company. It would be nice to be asked on a date or something - just something to make me feel not completely repulsive.   I mean, I'm happy- I played in the rain and danced around with people I've known forever and people I've known a few weeks and they love me and I adore them. I just wanna be pampered I guess, once in a while. Ya know, feel like a girl. *sigh*  Anyway so I'm in a kind of daze, a place of wonderment at my situation of happiness mixed with a false loneliness. I suck at putting this into words. Is it too cliche to say I just wanna be held?   ick. that just sounds so- girly mushy gushy. I disgust me sometimes. :/  My bed is calling however, and I cannot deny it my presence.   Dreams yo.
