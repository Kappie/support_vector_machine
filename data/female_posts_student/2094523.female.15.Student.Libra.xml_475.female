So you're leaving. I hope thats not a call out for sympathy and you really are leaving because if it is.. that is just plain pathetic. So leave. that is what i would really love to say to your face btu I can't because beneath the anger, frustration and total cussing out i don't want you to go. I'm sad because you have to go and I think i'm scared or something to feel lost when i don't have someone there who I can spill my gut out to everyday. 7 years. it has been 7 fucking years and somehow I'm expected to just drop everything and let it go? it's hard enough going to different schools but in a different province that is pretty damn hard. I just don't see how it is going to work. I mean sure i'd try id put an effort into it btu after so long of putting so much energy into trying to make something work. i think i've ran out of it. I don't see how friends can be friends when they know less than 1/9th of what is going on in their lives. I don't see how friends can be friends if they get to talk to them once every 3 months. I don't see how friends can be friends if they see each other once every 6 months. I don't see how friends and be friends if they live in basically a different world. So i don't mean to sound bitter but that is what I really think. I just don't see how anything is going to work. I'm sick and tired of this...I'm sick and tired of piecing things together and you hit me with this. I don't want to go to a goodbye party its tough enough saying goodbye in my head. its not like ill never see you again its just going to be pretty damn hard and differnet. Well.. its not like this matters anyways I'm sure it harder for you than me.. or maybe you just don't give a shit at all. but I just don't want you to go. that's all.
