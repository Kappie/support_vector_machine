Jon and Scott can play the guitar! LoL! The 5 guys that lyke me are, my b/f Coy (duh!), Jon, Scott, centure, and Brian. I am not sure if Timothy still lykes me b/c I am really mad at him b/c he asked me some... inappropriate questions. I am going to try to call Coy today, if I can find the cell phone. My mom is at her new job up at the elementary school. She is a special ed. teacher's aide. I don't get why she wants special ed, but that wuz her choice, not mine. Well... I have to go.    TTYL,    XOXOXO,    Luv Ya Bunchez,    Geneva    Coy's Girl    XOXOXO
