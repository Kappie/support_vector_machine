I get to register for my classes tomorrow so I'm pretty excited about that!! haha, I'm such a loser, but I've always loved school so what can I say?! I'm taking mainly psychology classes, with a few stats and sociology classes mixed in (crim-related of course!). I think I'm going to be quite busy since my honors thesis will take up a LOT of time. Planning to get started on that soon but it's hard to find the time, especially considering how sick I was of school at the end of last semester! I was just completely wiped, it was so hectic. I'm starting a summer class next week so hopefully that will get me motivated to start work on my honors.   Still no definite plans for what I'll be doing after I graduate, but law school at Dal is definitely looking good. It's very discouraging trying to find a Canadian grad school with a forensic program that is actually taking grad students....WTF? Why even have a program if you aren't taking people? UBC has probably the best forensic psych program in Canada and it is pretty much dying out because profs are retiring and they aren't hiring new ones. I just don't get that! Anyway, there are only 5 schools in Canada with Forensic psychology grad programs and I know for sure that 2 aren't taking students, so that option is not looking good right now, but I'm leaving the door open. I'll write both the LSAT and the GRE in the Fall and apply to a few places and probably just take the best offer! Malcolm and I would really rather stay here vs. moving to BC, so hopefully that will be what happens.   Enough of that rant! I hope everyone has an awesome Canada Day. We're going for a hike at Taylor Head with Andrew and then a BBQ at Peter's, so we're keeping it pretty low key. I'm working Friday so that kind of limits our options. :( I'd better get going, just got home from the gym and I'm sure I could use a shower. :) Robyn's wedding is 6 weeks from Saturday (eeeeeeeeee!!!! That was a squeal, haha), so I've been trying to work out a lot and tan so I can look HOT! haha. More soon!  Princess Nook Nook
