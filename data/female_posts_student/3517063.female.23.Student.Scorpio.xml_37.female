This is a particularly interesting connection, in my opinion, since the lawsuit is coming from one of the most underrepresented groups in Holocaust reparations - a group that is often denigrated for its lack of education and clan-type family groupings. Yet it is a Gypsy group who is suing IBM on very technical grounds. I'll be curious to see how this lawsuit develops, since it appears to be only a preliminary lawsuit designed to determine if a broader lawsuit claiming further damages will be feasible.
