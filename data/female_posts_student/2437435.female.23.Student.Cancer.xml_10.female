Those men and imexpressable talent and their works have withstood the test of time. Shakespeare, Milton, Homer, Lord Byron, Emily Dickenson, etc. So it begs the question to be asked. Undoubtedly, there are some people who's talent is no great that it is a tower and an immeasurable ruler to compare others by. But is there an artistic part in everyone? Somepeople (me for sure)would kill to be able to paint or draw. We love the work so much that to be able to contribute to society in that way would fill us with the most happiness... But alas, I can draw only cartoons, and I doubt the Louve will ever want a characature of my 10th grade Chemistry professor on its walls, next to greats. So I an a faithful patron at museums and try to live vicariously throuhg the works of those who suffered and gave their lives for their art. So that it wasn't in vain!  I was having a pretty yucky day a few days/weeks ago and I saw Rob, and he got me some Godiva chocolates... but of course it was 94 degrees so it melted... but the gesture was sweeter than the candy. We have been having some tough times... fighting a lot.. but we have been working through it and I think things will be ok. I know my moods can be a little annoying at times, but I think the way I make people feel when I am in a better mood more than makes up for it.. I hate to toot my own horn but BEEP BEEP! Thnaks hunny! I miss you... though I don't say it often enough for ya!
