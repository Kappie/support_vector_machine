Anyway I thought it sounded pretty so I'm keeping it from my old blog.    Velvet Red  So coveted. So Admired. Picked from a million only you, alone.  Your thorns gone away --  Only the soft red velvet to carress my lips. Only the sweet enchantment  to draw my nose to thee.  My life flows through thee; you open unto me.  How do I best enjoy thee? Your thorns gone away, I am not afraid.  Vulnerable Delicate Beauty,  Dare I reach? Velvet curls,  sooner worn and tired.  Dare I tear? The velvet spread around, to be loved, once. Never whole again.  Or do I preserve? In your entirety, your beauty and your sanctity. Your life denied, radiance stolen.  Always there are others. Always, I want you.
