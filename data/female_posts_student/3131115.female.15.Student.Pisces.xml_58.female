I was supposed to go to Bills this morning and everything was planned out, when i left my phone in my moms room and Bill called to tell me he was coming and i didnt hear it. Well...so his mom left without him and now he's pissed at me. I didnt leave the phone in there on purpose..and I'm really upset because I wanted to see him. I haven't seen him in about 4 days or more..No..it's been 5 days, almost 6. That's a long time..a Really long time! *sigh*...so he's mad at me and yelling at me, I cry and he hangs up. What a lovely morning. Now, he doesnt want to come over to my house later and shit..so pretty much that part is his fault.       I can't talk to anyone. The only person I'm really talking to besides bill is this girl Joslin I think..? hmm..I think that's how you spell it. Anyhow..the way we started talking was weird, but she's cool. She's fun to talk to, and surprisingly we do find stuff to talk about even though we're two entirely different people. Which brings me to missing Ashley. I took her off of my buddy list because I figured that it would help me to forget. I was wrong...Very wrong. Although, I dont really want to talk about it at the moment, it kind of upsets me.       I'm extremely COLD right now..I dont know why. Actually..now that I said that, I'm really hot. I dont know how Im feeling, everthing is just so messed up right now. I'm always fucking something up. ALWAYS...I swear. I'm not even exaggerating. When I say that I'm a fuck up..people are like "no you're not, everyone makes mistakes" but like..that's not how it is. I'm just a HUGE fuck up..and my mistakes are ALL THE TIME! I'm not even saying that jokingly, Im not even fucking messing around. I'm so stupid and shit. I just wish Bill would understand how much it really hurts me when he talks the way he does to me, like Im a fucking idiot. It's bad enough that I think it myself, but having him talk to me like Im one makes shit worse. It doesnt help either...He might think it will help me not to do it anymore but it doesnt at all. I hate myself, yet I'm selfish.       Life sucks and it isnt fair. I pushed myself away from everyone. I distanced myself, and now I wish that I hadnt. Thats why i HATE when people are like "I like being alone." and shit...and I think I've probably said this before but it fucking sucks. People say it all the time "I like being alone" and its soo dumb! Although, what those people dont understand...is most of the time the people that are saying it have a shit load of friends. What they dont understand is they can call someone and they'll have someone to hang out with them. If they get bored..they can pick up their phone and hang out with someone..whenever they want. But me...if I'm alone and I get bored..I have nobody to call. So it makes me mad when people say they like being lonely..because they must not really feel lonely because feeling lonely fucking sucks and I dont know how much more I can express how fucking horrible it is.       I'll stop complaining now...:'(
