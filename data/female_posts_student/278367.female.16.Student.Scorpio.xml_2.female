The Bronte sisters are known for their tragic tales as well as their tragic lives, and this book is one of those sad stories.  I must set out a warning that the ending is of little comfort, at least for me.  Again, I must say that the older language is not an obstacle in reading this book.  For those of you who did not like  urlLink Charlotte Bronte's  Jane Eyre  , this is different in style and story.  One would call it Gothic because of its motifs of ghosts and other supernatural aspects, mystery, and spooky settings.  The story is about the characters Catherine, a beautiful rich young woman, and Heathcliff, a gypsy taken in by Catherine's father.  The two fall deeply in love, but Heathcliff's brutish behavior is an obstacle.  Heathcliff runs away, and in the meantime becomes, at least on the outside, a gentleman.  Catherine has married another man during this time so when Heathcliff returns, problems occur, as one would expect.  One finds him/herself pulling for Heathcliff because of the intensity of his love for Catherine.  Their perception of their love for each other left quite an impression on me.  Rather than the usual two becoming one idea, Bronte has her characters believe that they are the same person.  It is hard to describe, one would have to read the book to understand.  More tragedies pursue, and one feels the constant pain that Heathcliff feels.  Despite all of this, I think this is a wonderful book.  I would not recommend any movie versions since they do not capture what this book is really about, nor stick to the story.
