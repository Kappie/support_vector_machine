FANCY THIS!  :)  i just got off the phone with last year's exboyfriend.  it was a bit odd, to have the "so... how are you?" conversation with him.  i kinda don't, um, care too much anymore.  i don't think he does either, but i guess every 4 months or so we feel the need to contact one another.  i'm probably never going to see him again, and i'm sure the 4 month trend will extend over time until there is nothing left.  cause really, nothing IS left.  it was like talking to a stranger almost.  only i was in love with him at one point in my life.  but it was funny, cause he talked alot about him and i listned... yeah, sounds about right.  he did remind me that i once dated "the king of bullshit."  and you know what, there is a pro and con to that one there.  i now have the ability to see through guys' bullshit.  now before you and jason moncrieff laugh and claim the exact opposite, let me explain. :) well the pro is, I see the bullshit. if some guy tells me he likes me, but has excuses as to why we can't date, HE'S JUST NOT INTO ME.  period.  you don't pass up something like that for lame reasons, and that's that. the definite con is that even when a guy DOES like me, i have a hard time beleiving him.  i'm too worried that, well, that it's bullshit.  but i guess that's life.   so now for some reason i'm in the mood to celebrate.  i know two of my ladies will be over tonight, and i have a big surprise for kentesheia. oh whoopsy there, i just gave it away:  DAWN AND THE HAUNTED HOUSE. if you know what that's from, you're cool in my book.   CHANGE OF SUBJECT: so today while hebert and i were at HEB purchasing our favorite fruits and veggies, we were eyeing some organic greens out in the aisle.  we caught a produce worker's attention somehow, and she asked if we wanted to buy some lettuce.  we said no, because we had plenty at home.    that would normally end the conversation with a produce lady at HEB, but nothing normal ever happens to me.  after a few of her pleas to buy her lettuce and no win, she asks us if we're friends or sisters. we answer, and she says, "how long you two been friends?"  we tell her about 16 years, and she tells us that her and her best friend have had a 25 year friendship. we say that's nice, and we plan on reaching that mark ourselves.  at this point, we're trying to walk away and get to the cereal aisle, cause the lady was a bit creepy. she didn't have real eyebrows and tattooed them on. you know what i mean, she was a bit "tough."  so then, she informs us that her friendship is really special becuase her best friend is behind bars.  oh don't worry, she didn't do it, she was framed by her husband.  and also don't worry, the HEB produce lady is working on getting her out.  as we're walking away, quickly, we answer her question of our age and we learn she is 30. "well goodluck with your friend!" i respond as i run to the sushi station.  i've never been so happy to see imitation crab.
