She has been such a good friend to me and I am forever grateful for having her around to talk to. I haven’t had a girl friend like that in a long time. I feel so comfortable whenever I am around her and I know even if I need to escape the world as we know it, I can always count on her to hide me.   Today I spoke to Jesse on the phone, it is always such a pleasure talking to him and I really hope that they let him come home on R real soon. I have had lots of time to consider the fact that if he does come home on R it’s not for good and he will have to go back. I just miss seeing his face and looking into his big brown eyes. I can tell by our conversations that he hasn’t changed a bit and I am thankful for that because one of my concerns was that being over there would change him, his personality. I think what keeps him close to home is being able to talk to me and what keeps me going some days is knowing I will get to talk to him.  I have noticed that there are a few benefits to this whole situation, we have become more sensitive to each other’s needs and concerns and have become more in tuned to each other. Before he left we had hit a rough patch in our relationship, we were very stressed due to work and hardly got a change to spend time together because we worked opposite schedules.  And although he was taken away from me for his noble service overseas, I have been able to see the sunny side of my gloomy days. I know that his time over there will give him the work experience he needs to excel in the Tech field, also teach him skills of responsibility and safety, among other things loyalty and commitment. I know that when he gets home we will be able to start the life we have been struggling to start before his tour of duty. We have all of these dreams and aspirations and I know when he comes home it will be my turn to take care of him and help him reach his goal of working in the computer/networking field.   Jesse hasn’t been home since late November 2003. He started his tour of duty early last March 2004 and is expected to return home sometime next March 2005.   4 months Overseas down and 8 left to go… and counting.
