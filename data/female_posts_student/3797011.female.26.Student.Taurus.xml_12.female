Do you understand what I mean I know they are there They're just not seen  No matter were I go or what I do At a fast pace or slow Only one person has my heart I only have eyes for you  Even if eye contact is made with someone on a busy avenue It doesn't matter I still only have eyes for you  When we are together, just us two It could be Forth of July Fireworks exploding in the sky I wouldn't see them And, you know why I only have eyes for you  You have heard this many times I know Look into a person's eyes They are the windows to their soul  You are the only one that can look into my eyes  and see the pathway to my heart That pathway belongs to only you whether we are together or apart  There was a moment in time when it all came together I knew this love was true There will never be anyone else  Because.... I Only Have Eyes For You  ~DreAmer NevER SLeeP~
