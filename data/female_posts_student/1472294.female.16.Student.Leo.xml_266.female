My bag cannot be a Gothic kinda bag coz it is not black or dark. But I can always buy a few metres of leather skins or something like that... Hmmm.... Interesting thought, but this is project no. 2... Project no. 1 is to finish my cross-stitch pencil case. I bought it last year and ya, have been slacking to finish it. And I am short of one of the color strings, don't know how I am able to finish the string so fast within a small pattern. And the pattern was simple and easy. Not like those big cross-stitch pattern, where you have to use different stitching patterns into so, so, small holes.... I am certainly slacking throughout the whole week. But by the way, I am nearing my target to get doll. Very possibly a MSD. Then maybe I will purchase a petite AI or infant. They look so cute! Or maybe a ''Who's that girl?'' doll, they certainly have nice anime eyes... But first, have to rush to check my savings.... *running, running....*
