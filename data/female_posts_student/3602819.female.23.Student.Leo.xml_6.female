But it seems to me that no matter how much I try to manage it, it always gets away from me. I'm starting to think that this is like a teenager... The more you try to restrain and manage it, the more it will try and run away from the constraints that are put around it... Anyone agree? Or a better comparison would be that I am Willey coyote, and time is the Road Runner... No matter how many times I use my acme company gadgets, there is always the backfire of what is a fool-proof plan. I am gradually learning that no matter what we plan for, how we plan for it, or the intensity we place on our well timed plans, God always has a different plan in mind. Eventually, I start to see a pattern. I make a plan, God changes it. So I wonder if I make a plan that I would never think would happen.... Would God change that plan? Or would He allow me to go through the stupidity of trying to "get one-up on God" and then just laugh at me later... Yup... I think He would just laugh at me later... LATER~ Mellie L~
