It’s termed ‘motor mimicry’ where people tend to stuff like accents, body language, even slanting at the mere mention of the Leaning Tower of Pisa! A psychologist realized that she was feeling down more frequently because she’d been mimicking her depressed patients’ posture! So if you want to feel happy, smile at people around you to get a return smile, smile to yourself when there’s no one nearby,   smile at the screen! Yes, SMILE! (Am I getting a hint of a smile?)    Smiles are an inexpensive way of looking good.
