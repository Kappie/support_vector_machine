So I get there and am waiting patiently. THEY FORGOT TO PUT MY APPOINTMENT INTO THE FREAKIN' COMPUTER!! So my visit became a matter of whether or not I was supposed to be there. I went to my car and brought back the appointment card (because I'm good like that). They apologized and rescheduled my appointment for next week. Good thing happened though- they gave me a doctor's excuse for the whole day. So I don't have to go back if I don't want to!! But I am gonna go for fourth.   Tomorrow--eye doctor. Woot!
