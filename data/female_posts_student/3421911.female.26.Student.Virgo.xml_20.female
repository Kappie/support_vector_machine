NAH.  i was on my best behavior last night.  and i did try to enjoy. but i was so fucking bored. he did say he was gonna set me up with his officemates.  yeah, but he was doing most of the touching.     when we got home i had this really bad headache.  i could've finished civil procedure already, or just went to Mayric's or gotten laid.  anything else but not as boring as that.  we were so tired just sitting there.     smiles don't really mean one had a good time.
