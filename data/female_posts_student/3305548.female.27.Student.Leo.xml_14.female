It really goes to show how very useless a "real" college degree can be. It apparently did not make much of a difference in the running of the government. I guess the uselessness of college degrees explains why I have such a broad collection accumulating.  Oust Rumsfeld? Hell no, take down Bush! The easiest way to resign Rumsfeld is to vote Bush out!!! The prisoner abuses are terrible, frightening, and horrendous...but not shocking. We are dealing with the military and CIA and information accumulation. How many times have you seen in the movies where information is gotten from people by extreme duress by a government agent. This concept was not invented by the movie industry - it came from somewhere.   Where's MacGyver when you need him? He could take out any terrorist organization with one Swiss Army Knife tied behind his back. Bring back Richard Dean Anderson!  More pointless musings from me will be available in the future.  Remember - dont take me too seriously, I am terribly tongue in cheek. If I have offended, then it might have been intentionally - which means that I am just pushing your buttons to see what happens. In which case, humor me.   In the mean time read Sluggy Freelance and feel niftier by the day. http://www.sluggy.com/  --Mack
