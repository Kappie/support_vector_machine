What do you call a UFO after it has landed?  2. Can a person with no eyebrows look surprised?  3. In elementary school in case of fire you have to line up quietly in a single file    line from smallest to tallest. What is the logic here? Do tall people burn slower?  4. Shouldn't the definition of "unless" be more?  5. What does a vegetarian cannibal eat?  lol, check out all the other ones, it'll keep ya goin for, like, the rest of your life -  urlLink
