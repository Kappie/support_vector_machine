If there's one movie to watch this year, it must be this.   Anyways, did you know that the music that the choir sings in the film is written for the film by John Williams and the words come from  Shakespeare's Macbeth , Act IV, Scene I. Yes, the lyrics were written by  William Shakespeare . These are the words spoken by the "weird sisters," the three witches who turn up every so often as the story of Macbeth unfolds, fortelling his fate and creating various awful spells and brewing potions in their cauldron. The phrase "By the pricking of my thumbs / Something wicked this way comes" is spoken by the Second Witch and is a reference to Macbeth himself, who knocks on the door immediately thereafter.              Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Double, double toil and trouble   Something wicked this way comes    Eye of newt, and toe of frog,   Wool of bat, and tongue of dog,   Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,   Lizard's leg, and owlet's wing,  Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Double, double toil and trouble   Something wicked this way comes    In the caldron boil and bake;   Fillet of a fenny snake,   Scale of dragon; tooth of wolf;   Witches' mummy; maw and gulf    Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Double, double toil and trouble;   Fire burn, and caldron bubble.   Something wicked this way comes!      Brilliant!
