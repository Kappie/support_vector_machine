I realized something today, something that I think I had known since the scrimmage, but I hadn't really realized it until today.  Before I get to that, I want to talk a little about my day though. I had two review sessions today, one for AP US History and one for Decathlon. History was first, and I got up at 8 for it. Went back to sleep and finally got ready at 9. I walked there and got there about five minutes before ten, when the session was supposed to start. Waited like forty minutes for my teacher to show up. He's never on time though, so it didn't really matter. We got some work done, and I got a cinnamon sugar bagel, which stuck to my hand, my teacher doesn't believe in plates or cups... It was yummy though.  At twelve my friend and I went to the Decathlon review session, and hilarity ensued as we ate sandwiches, goldfish, and Trader Joe's candy, which is so strong that it gave me a stomach ache after only four pieces. The friend, who was hosting the session, is rich. She lives in a gated community and her room is about the size of my apartment. She's so modest about it though, and she's really  really  nice. Someone I hope to become better friends with. She was the one who made me feel better after my god awful speech.  Anyway, after I was leaving, I realized that the Decathlon class had become more to me than a bunch of nerds I could talk to (band kids are  not  nerds by the way!), but they had become my family in a way. They're my closest friends and I feel most comfortable around them. I don't have to act stupidly around them or act like anything other than myself, and they accept me for it. More than I can say for some other friends of mine.  I love decathlon and at the moment it's all that's keeping me going. It takes all the energy from me, so I can't wallow in self pity, and I like that.  Anyway, I'll just keep trucking along,and I'll talk to you all later.  Faylinn
