I liked the girl's singing but the screaming didn't make much sense.  Then Appleseed Cast was good.  I wouldn't listen to them all the time but they were good.  That was worth my 8 bucks.  Kurt and Ross were there and I got to meet some ppl from Renae's work so it was fun times.    Afterwards, Renae and I went to Hy-vee cuz I was thirsty and it was on way home ;-)  But the hot hy-vee guy checked me out...oh fun times, fun times.    Tonight was defiantly a 10 on the fun scale!  ~tata
