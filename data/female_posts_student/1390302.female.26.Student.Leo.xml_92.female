Matt and I were talking about it today, and we came up with this; Marriage has no sanctity but what the two (sometimes more) people involved give to it.  In a world where pornography, swingers, cheaters, and reality TV –like “Who wants to marry a millionaire”- reign supreme, what sanctity does marriage really have, objectively?  If people will get married and divorced on Television with no regard for what a marriage is actually supposed to be who can say, with any fair amount of resolve, that marriage is a sacred thing?  If Britney Spears can get married while drunk in Las Vegas, Nevada, then wake up 55 hours later, realize it was a huge mistake, and get an annulment, what is marriage?  In today’s world, where the president is a Holy Roller who is against anything that is not white-bread down-home “American” and homosexual citizens of this “free” country are denied half of their constitutional rights based on who they would choose to love, how can we say that we live in the greatest country on the planet?  Okay, so maybe I am getting off the topic slightly.  Back to the topic at hand, what does the “sanctity of marriage” actually mean?  Take for example Matt and myself.  We are both reasonable, responsible mid-20’s who choose to be together not because we are bound by the imaginary ropes of marriage, but because we love and respect one another.  We are not together simply because we have to be, due to a little metal band and piece of paper.  If we weren’t married we would still live together and share our lives from day to day.  We would still be exactly what we are, marriage simply makes up politically correct so that the world is not aghast at our “shacking-up!”  We married one another because we honestly felt the bond that would keep us together for the rest of our lives.  Intellectually and emotionally Matt and I are a perfect match and we knew it.  So, we went to the courthouse here in town and tied the knot.  We don’t intend to break up so marriage was a reasonable step in the progression of our relationship.  For us, marriage was an objective decision that had, has, and will impact our lives, simply because we choose to respect the vows we took on February 14th, 2000.    Still there are others who marry simply for the novelty of doing so.  Others who, if it were not for the bonds of marriage, would not be together at all… like my sister Staci and her less than worthy hubby, Mark (whom I am convinced is a cheater –but no one has asked my opinion).  They are married, but would they be if not for the bonds of marriage which they took?  For them, marriage is more a matter of bondage and oppression then an objective, realistic, sharing of two lives.  They married 7 months early because she was pregnant, but I often wonder if she would have married him at all if not for the untimely arrival of Tyler Bryce.    So in short, marriage is sacred if you choose for it to be, and not otherwise.  In most cases, we came to realize, marriage is a rather subjective thing.  It is what you make it.  Matt and I have always believed that when one enters into a relationship, certain lines are drawn in the sand, either by words or actions.  Boundaries are set, and generally cannot be changed without a whole lot of work and a little luck.  Allow me to explain, if two people, Sam and Sandy lets call them, enter into a relationship and Sandy lets Sam sleep with whomever he chooses for the first 6 months.  Then when that 7th month comes and Sandy decides that Sam is a cheating dog and tries to change him, she will have no one to blame but herself.  She let him do it, knowingly, and never put a stop to it.  The boundaries were set at open, and upon trying to change them Sandy may very well drive Sam away.  Weather or not he deserves to be driven away or their relationship is even salvageable after a situation like that is debatable.  This topic inevitably drove us toward the topic of fetishes.  The question was posed, “What makes fetishes wrong or irregular?”  The answer was, society deems them so.  Still I cannot help feeling that in a world where a million people like a million different things, what the hell makes one unusual when another is deemed normal?  Why is the guy with a foot fetish a pervert when the guy who has a breast or butt fetish is a perfectly normal, health guy?  It all seems a little hypocritical to me!  Strangely, while the foot fetish guys is the weird one, the guy with a breast fetish is going to be the one in trouble when his girl friend catches him staring a Jane Doe’s chest in the mall.  The foot fetish guy can check out sandaled feet to his hearts content and no one would be the wiser.  That I find ironic.  Yet, if a man has a weird fetish, such as a foot fetish, and his girlfriend/wife catches him checking out feet, does she have the right to be jealous?  I would say she has about the same right to be jealous as the girlfriend of the “healthy guy” checking out Jane’s girlies.  Jealousy is a matter of one being hurt by their mate’s attraction to another.  So, weather a guys is turned on by a nice pair of painted toe nails or unusually perky boobs in a low cut blouse, it’s all the same, only society’s ideas of what’s different make it so.
