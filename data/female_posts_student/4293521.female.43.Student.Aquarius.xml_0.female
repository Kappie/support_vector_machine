We enjoyed the visit, and re-meeting their kids, who have practically grown up -- but I did wonder what would happen now/next.  Would we go back to not being in contact with them again?  We have often, over the past 5 years, wondered if we did or said something to upset these friends.  Oh, well.  Our life is busy (and clearly theirs is too), so we enjoyed the time we spent with them, didn't talk about much of import, but it was a nice visit nonetheless.  We also met a foreign exchange student from Germany -- he's staying with other friends of ours.  He's a really nice 17-year-old, though his English isn't that good (and our German is non-existant!).  Still, it was fun to joke with him, as well as we were able to, and watch the Olympics with him and share a snack with him.  It'll be great to watch him grow and change this year.  Today I swung by the married student housing (ironically what we call it even though my divorced friend and her 3 kids just moved in there today).  They seem pretty well set-up already, and happy with the size of their place (2nd floor apartment).  The dog is even well-adjusted, so all seems right with their world.  Custody battle is still looming for them later this month, but I'm confident (and prayerful) that nothing will change in that regard, and the kids can keep living with their new-student mom.  My oldest started pre-season field hockey today -- practices for 2 hours each a.m. and p.m., which means mom's taxi is in full swing again.  I took the little one to the pool in the afternoon, and tried to start reading The Last Amateurs by John Feinstein, but the lifeguard wanted to talk to me the whole time I was there.  That's fine -- he's off to college a week from today and is really excited about it.  He's a nice if neurotic kid -- told me about his great personality AND his fibromyalgia.  Interesting level of sharing...  Contemplated doing some Bible study this week -- have not yet gotten to it, however.  Also have been thinking about paying for counseling through Trinity in Princeton -- might be good to start now (before the academic year begins).  My dad turns 70 tomorrow and I have promised my mom a visit before school resumes...  As to my blog, I decided to take out my IM info today -- still feel the need to keep this pretty anonymous, for others' sakes if not my own.
