I tried a blogger, but that didn't really work. Owieeee.. Milo gave me this big scratch on my ring finger. What is that supposed to mean? I just found it, too. I have to type up this poopie Thanksgiving article for this poopie newsletter for my mother's work. Well, I guess it's my work too, because I'm getting paid for it. Yay. Money. I need lots of it for Christmas shopping. I'm still thinking of what to get people. I do it while I make my beautiful Christmas cards. Yes, I am making cards this year.. opposed to last year's Sanrio store bought funny-looking stationary. It's my way of getting into the holidays. If that's possible.. with all this sunny weather. But then again, my hands are pretty much frozen numb.. except for that scratch. That just hurts. There're also Christmas songs playing on the radio. Yes, I actually listen to them. I think everyone likes them deep down inside, but on the surface lies the "I hate Christmas carols! They are so annoying! I never get to listen to the music I like during the holidays!" Well. For all you Scrooges out there, I will be the first to say.. I love Christmas music. It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside (haha Ro). So yesh. That's what's going on now. Now I have to look at this thing on the actual site. Whew.
