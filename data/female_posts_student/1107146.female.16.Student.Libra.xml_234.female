And if that happens, I'm going to be really pissed off for as long as it lasts, or I'll get used to it, and I'll be a generally pissed off person. And then again, it might not happen. But I seriously doubt that shit.  I used to be really tortured by it, most of last year was pretty bad for me because of my dad...Rosie might have noticed during those little conversations during Aldridge, but I wouldn't think it likely.  I know you all would like to say that you'll stand behind me and help...but it really comes down to me and my dad alone in this house, along with her over the 'Net; when I'm all alone, there's no help to be given. So it just scared me that I might even be remotely encountered with this possibility. But I'm going to shut up now and knock on wood and pray I'll be alright, so goes one of my songs a bit edited.
