I don't know when I've done that much talking since...who am I kidding...just since yesterday I'm sure. And she loves to listen to all the boyfriend-idiocy (adorably sensitive maniac that he is) and the battles waged in my classes (particularly entertaining this week)...so I just kept going...oh so much to say.  At the end, as I told her how much better I felt about going to school and sitting in my classes with my classmates...that I had been incredibly unfair in how judgmental and self-righteous I had been about some of them (though I've never had to embellish for her anything at all some of these people have said--the horror, the horror!)...I discovered I'd given myself a full-blown headache. Good job, darling. But that's what I've done every day this week. Made myself quite sick about all the stuff going on to me and around me. And I don't like to take pain medicine for headaches...because some day I'm REALLY going to need pain medicine and I don't want it to be ineffective because I'm always popping pills...so I've been curing myself--last night as well. With my music. And it's been working, though I do believe the fact that I sing as earnestly as the vocalists sing helps to get out some of the anguish and make me tired enough to just pass out...where upon waking in the middle of the night, I discover I had finally fallen asleep and  VOILA!...la mal de tête a DISPARU!   So, I haven't been listening to single CDs over and over...though I do that as well...this week, I think because I'm almost done ripping all my CDs into my computer...I've been compulsively--with quite a lot of deliberation, you should see how seriously I take this--coming up with all these playlists that describe the current phase of my schizophrenia. I'm gonna paste some of the playlists below for your education or merriment or nose-turning-up-at, etc, whichever you like. You know not to ask me to bring the tunes for bat mitzvahs or clown parties. I warn you--the titles of these lists are REAL...and will inevitably show how ridiculously sentimental and dramatic I am...I could've doctored them for you...but why not just tell the truth...for a change.    "Girls Desperate to Understand Their Own Hearts"   (as I decided what I was going to do about my love's love for me...wait!  assuming  he is still my love, b/c of course he has yet to get over what ails him)   1.	Mystery - Indigo Girls	 2.	Good Woman - Cat Power 3.	Do What You Have To Do - Sarah McLachlan 4.	A Sorta Fairytale - Tori Amos 5.	Your Armor - Charlotte Martin 6.	My Man - Billie Holliday 7.	Winter - Tori Amos 8.	Scared of You - Nelly Furtado 9.	Strange - Tori Amos 10.	Ballerina - Leona Naess 11.	Beginning to See the Light - Liz Phair 12.	Paper Bag - Fiona Apple 13.	Maps - Yeah Yeah Yeahs 14.	Crystal - Stevie Nicks 15.	Stay - Lisa Loeb   Baby, Come Home   (as I tried to cope with thinking I'd been dumped...lots of crying here, right? well, yes, of course.)   1.	Down - blink 182 2.	Wonderwall - Ryan Adams 3.	Absolutely Zero - Jason Mraz 4.	Man on the Side - John Mayer 5.	Ballerina - Leona Naess 6.	Re-Offender - Travis 7.	Falling Away With You - Muse 8.

Pay for What You Get - Dave Matthews Band 14.	Look What You’ve Done - Jet 15.	The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot - Brand New 16.	Don’t Use My Broken Heart - Leona Naess    Gotta Sing It Out   (after having first, Thursday morning, found out that my darling boy still wanted me--though he is still "hurt" enough to not be able to talk to me himself--through his beautiful emissary...then, second, feeling like a better human being for going to and being honest at "Cum By Yah" (sp?) lunch with classmates...not to diminish its importance at all...I was relatively happy. And wanted to sing out loud...good-feeling, wanna shake my ass some, wanna rock out some, wanna smile all the way through songs)    1.	Sunday Morning - Maroon 5 2.	Dance Like This - Wyclef Jean feat. Claudette Ortiz 3.	Our Time Is Running Out - Muse 4.	Girls Dem Sugar - Beenie Man feat. Mya 5.	Crush - Gavin DeGraw 6.	Remember to Breathe - Dashboard Confessional 7.	Boys of Summer - The Ataris 8.	As Is - Ani DiFranco 9.	Kiss Me - Sixpence None the Richer 10.	Say It Ain’t So - Weezer 11.	Sweet Thing - Van Morrison 12.	Teenage Wristband - The Twilight Singers 13.	Childish - Damien Rice 14.	Last Nite - The Strokes 15.	Anywhere With You - Saves the Day 16.	California - Phantom Planet 17.	Crush - Gavin DeGraw 18.	Sand - Damien Rice  And then there was the list I came up with for my Sunshine 'round about Tuesday. Who really does not deserve a list...stubbornness like this should never be rewarded unless one is fighting for human rights or something...anyway, I made him a mixed CD. So mushy...so corny...mostly R I don't think he is ready for the diversity of my musical tastes yet.    I think I'll keep that one for us, though. Our secret. The "How You Make Fuego Feel" songs...and they've been mailed to him...and they had better fucking work, I tell you what.  And if these lists didn't make you sick...it's absolutely my new favorite thing to make these playlists...if you want...I'm willing!   P.S. Thanks to everyone who's listened this week to me moan and cry, by the way. I hate asking for help...especially where my feelings are involved...but all of your blog comments and face-to-face conversations and hugs have helped this ridiculously sentimental, dramatic, hyper-sensitive woman-child get by. People are so good to me...and I can't figure out why...but thank you just the same, ever so much.
