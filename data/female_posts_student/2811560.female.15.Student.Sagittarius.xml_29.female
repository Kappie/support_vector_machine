Well actually, I was babysitting for like 3 hours, and sleeping watching TV for the rest. But that's not the point. The point is that I made $40, which I really needed. So now officially, I have $61.38. Yay. So, back to today. Yeah, it was incredibly boring and tedious. Yuck, we even had to watch Beethoven's 4th in Spanish. Grr! What the hell?! I AM SO SICK OF BEING TREATED LIKE I'M 5!!! Sometimes I wish I could fast-forward the next 3 years of my life, and go straight to college and be treated like the adult that I am. Ugh. Spring Break is next week and I'm excited, yay!
