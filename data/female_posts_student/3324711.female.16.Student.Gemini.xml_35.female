First day of summer = BBQ, listened to records, freak rainstorm, was attacked by at least 3 junebugs, played with puppies. Behn was also over, practically for the whole day, and I got to see Joe and Matt which is always a good thing. We watched SLC Punk. I love that movie. It actually makes anarchy sound like sense.  OH BABY, Dread kit came today too.. dreads are going in wednesday for sure. I wonder how long itll take? Maybe into Thursday too.  Well, dont count on me updating a lot from now on, Im doing pretty good with the whole not-going-on-the-computer-as-much. Its good.  Hope everyones summer is going as well as mine is :)   Listening To: 3 Libra's- A Perfect Circle  Cause I threw you the obvious To see if theres more behind the eyes of a fallen angel Eyes of a tragedy.
