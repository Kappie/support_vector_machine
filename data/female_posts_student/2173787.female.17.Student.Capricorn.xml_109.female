Instead of going to visit Zayde as I should i decided that I would go to the basketball game at school and Armadillo (3rd time this week...I haven't really eaten anything else).  I know that I am being selfish, but I also doubt that my sanity can take much more sitting and watching someone waste away.  Since I can't do anything about it I decided to take a 24 hour break and not try.  The goal for tonight is to have fun and forget for a few hours the things that haunt me.
