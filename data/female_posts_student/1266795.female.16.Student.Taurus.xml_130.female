I'll do better on the  multitudes of AP tests I still have yet to take. I hope......   Yeah so otherwise, nothing really important here. I spent the night at  Sarah's last night because mom worked until 6 am this morning. I didn't  really want to be alone.  Being alone all night is a bit weird. I  tend to jump. A lot. At every noise.  So yeah.   Hey! We're getting our phone fixed! wOOt! It'll be connected tomorrow  sometime, which makes me very very happy. :-D See? 'Tis a happy Ashley!  And tomorrow is Friday! yay for Friday! :-D    "I've been rejected...twice!"
