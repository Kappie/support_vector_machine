Very easy to win prizes.. No wonder so many children want to play and play again juz to get more prizes.. (herm.. So tan xin- haa haa..)      Just now went to Diana's blog:   urlLink  www.snowycool.blogspot.com    and read her posts (August one)... But hor I got one thing I really need to comment.. She worte too many "Hee hee" and "haa haa" in her post le.. Like every sentence also have.. (Diana, if you are reading this post right now, I hope you wouln't mind my comments although it might be too straight forward) Sorry ah...      Ok.. Know that Hui Ying's & Hui Xian's Birthday coming soon... One more month.. I guess I wouldn't have time to celebrate for both of you on the actual day.. So sorry.. but I will think of really nice presents for both of you.. Maybe give you at the end of the year...      Ok.. Its time I study for my Promos... Good nite... Muack...
