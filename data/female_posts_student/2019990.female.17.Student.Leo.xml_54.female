I saw three historectomies, and one D which I didn't completely understand what is was either, and i figure you gusy don't want me to recount in detail.  We had to get up early today, the first surgery started at 7:30 this morning.  So we had to leave the house by 6:45.  Craziness.   After supper we decided to go to the mall for some last mintue shopping, and I found a cute yellow skirt.  I like it.  But it was really hard to shop with my grandma and Aunt who shop in the old ladies section.  They pick out the big flower prints with matching pants and shirt, and it hurt even me.  Man, if Wonder Woman had been there, her head probably would have exploded.  I've never seen so many fashion violations.  Sadly being as we were in a nice department store, Macy's style I found a ton of cute things, all out of my price range.  Oh well, you can't win them all.   Leila, I don't know if you read this, but I started Main Street today, so far they are still in the cities so it doesn't remind me of our hometown yet, but I'm only in chapter two.   I need you guys to pray for our trip, my aunt's Nurse practitioner was sick today, and if she's sick tomorrow we won't be able to get everyone done very quickly, and the girl my age going has a knee injury and is on crutches right now, but we have alot of stuff we need.  We jus need our health more, I'm not feeling to hot tonight either, granted I'm exahusted, but I think I have hives, either that or lots of bug bites.  But hives are very possible, seeing as I forgot to take my Zyrtec this morning.   Otherwise things are going well.  We leave Sunday,  I'm getting really excited.  But i have to get to bed.  Love you all.
