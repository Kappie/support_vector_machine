And I am sorry if I made anyone upset the night before, but I thought we were going to watch a movie, and then we didn't......so I got bored! I did come back though! Anywho...tonight was, shall I say, VERY interesting! Ben makes me soooo mad,   * takes a deep breath, and then counts to ten *  , but I am used to that by now...haha! I am soo tired, but I can't get to sleep.... I am excited though because my cousins and aunt from New Hampshire are coming up tomorrow for a whole week. Yay! To bad we have to go back to school though...I won't see them as much now. Ya, Patrick..he is my age and he is usually the nice one....Aaron, he is in 10th grade, he can have a temper...and he looks just like Justin I think.....and then there is Brian. I am not sure exactly what grade he is in...but he is soo cute....and very hyper. My Aunt is really nice too...my mom loves it when she comes to visit because I think growing up they were really close. And the best part about them coming to visit is that they always stay at my grandparents house...which is right across from ours...Who knew. Anyway, that is all I have to say, so goodnight all....and remember...those bed bugs hurt when they bite...so it is probably a good idea not to let them! As you can see, I get really stupid when I am tired......  k-
