I wont go back to them. I can’t anyway. Now my objective is to warn my friends it ain’t good either.  I’m sorry though, I held back at first, hesitating a lot, but I finally got the guts to do it and its done! Sorry I even kept some of it first, not wanting to get rid of sin. They say sin is pleasurable. In an earthly kinda pleasure I would guess, yeah I do agree. But Dearenst, I do not want anymore of these pleasures. I want the true thing. Like you once said, if I cant be trusted with unreal stuff, what more real stuff rite?  Dearest, help me become a better person. I have one more week to rally. I know you can work miracles.  I feel I’m not humble enough. How do I humble down my heart? Its too arrogant and cocky now. Lord, help me. Ok, maybe for starters, I shall call you Lord instead of Dearest, but then, its different aspects of you anyway, not disrespecting or anything.  Lord, thank you for making me the person I am today. I’m not sure that what you wanted to become of me has become, cos of me myself mainly, but Lord please try. Spank me, whip me, lecture me when I’m naughty. Whisper Your sweet words so that I’ll have to quieten down and listen. I wanna hear You everyday. Haven’t been hearing lately. They say You’re not silent, just we’re not listening. Help me to listen.  Do nudge me more often, when You know I need it. Thanks for everything though, Resurrection Sunday just a week ago, I seem to have forgotten it already.  Well Father, today I wanna ask You that You’ll one day save my friends Fiona, Esther and Trishal. Lord, Freedom Rally is this Saturday and today is Sunday and they all 3 don’t want to come. Lord, change their hearts Lord, put something in their hearts, help em realize that coming for this Rally could change their lives. Lord, I would not know their motives in their hearts if they agree to come, but I trust You’ll do the work in their hearts. Work their hearts. Lord, these 3 people are people I have come to know very well this past few years and I love them very much Lord. I want them to go where they’re MEANT to go Lord.  I remember gorgor once said that if we prayed the same thing too much, being chiong hey and all, You might get irritated. He said we gotta have some extend of faith where we can leave the matter and trust You’ll grant us our prayer. But remember the parable in Luke, you spoke of this widow who kept pestering this judge for justice everyday that he got so fed up of her he granted her justice just because she kept pestering him? Well, I wouldn’t want you to answer my prayer because I’m irritating but because I know You love them just as much as You love me and everyone else. Well, I’ll pray fervently, not pesteringly. Thank you Lord.  Love, M-R 18Apr2004 2207 hours
