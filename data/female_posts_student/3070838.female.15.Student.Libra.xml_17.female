How thrilling? lol.   "My Random Poem By Phileda" by Phileda There was a girl. Her name was Earl. She had a bad day. Because someone said she was gay. Why is this bad? Because it makes her hate her dad. And now you ask why? Because her name should belong to a guy.  Kiss my ass all you writers and literature people.
