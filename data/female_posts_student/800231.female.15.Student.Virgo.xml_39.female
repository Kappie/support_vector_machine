As I've said before, I'm pretty good at pulling "A" papers out of my butt at the last moment.   I spent most of my day wandering around a Japanese garden. It was VERY lovely. I was taking pictures of Koi and stuff for class. Of course, being me I managed to fall off a rock and into a stream but it was still very nice.  School bad. Don't wanna go, but must. Bugger.  Woke up this morning only to find my backyard full of really hairy people. REALLY hairy people. Turns out my dad has started a bit of a motorcycle gang. A motorcycle gang that only rides classic British bikes. Like Triumphs and Nortons and things like that. Not that we didn't see this one coming but it's quite a shock to walk up on in the morning. Well, at least they have taste.  I'm soo very tired. What else is new?
