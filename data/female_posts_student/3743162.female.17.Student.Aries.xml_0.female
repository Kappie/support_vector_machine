As a favor I'm babysitting my best friends siblings ( 10 boy 7 girl) while she works and her parents are outta town. I don't really like babysitting, but I love these kids and my friend needs to work to save money to go to school next year since she graduated. Anyways I'm bored while waiting for Sex and the City repeats to come on BRAVO so...  Whats new with anyone? Anyone out there? Guess not... thats like life too, sometimes its just nice to hear yourself talking. (or writing but whatever its the same thing!!!) TV and napping awaits me on the couch....
