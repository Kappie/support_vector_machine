I think I posted it once....yes, I  urlLink did , it's a beautiful song just for the lyrics, if you haven't heard it yet, although almost everyone has, and it's even better to music. Ok, done, I'm sort of on a Dolls kick right now so it was pretty cool to read Johnny Rzeznik in thine place du postage.
