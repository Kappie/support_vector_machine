We were actually pretty good. Chrissy and Jessica have such pretty voices. They sounded very nice.  Let's see, "I didn't do much this weekend... dunno if that's good or bad." Haha Matt. The words seem right. Um, I babysat on Friday and Saturday night for the O'Brien's. They are the EASIEST and sweetest kids ever. Friday I just had to babysit Annie Georgia and got $25 for that. Saturday it was Annie Georgia and Gavin, and they gave me a Christmas present! It was so sweet. Then Mr. O'Brien brought me home and gave me the money in the car. I didn't look at it until I got inside, and it was $40! I was only there for 5 hours, so I called them and told them that I thought they overpaid me, and maybe they meant to give me a $25 and $5 instead of two $20s. Mrs. O'Brien said no, that they were grateful that I could babysit and that they gave me some extra money for Christmas. Such sweet people!  I haven't done much on my Theology project. I have to do Geometry too. And Tuesday I have an English test, Civics Test, Physics quiz, and Theology project due. I want to bring all of my grades up, so when I don't do so well on my Geometry final and my grade is, ahem, awful, my parents won't be too terribly angry.  Mandy and I have decided that we want boyfriends by next July so we can call them from Nationals and tell them how we did. Haha. We're losers.   I tried on my Christmas dance dress today. It fits. The top it tighter than it was in May. But hey, people grow. But I'm kind of pissed anyway. So this week, no junk food for Madeline. Nope. No snacks either. Just meals. And really, that's only 1 meal a day, because ND food is nasty and I hardly even eat the salads anymore. If we're having chicken nuggets or crispitos, I'll eat it. Otherwise, it'll just be dinner lol.  I *might* go down to Pt. Clear for New Year's. But I don't really want to. But I do. If my Aunt Daly and her kids are going to be there, then I'll go. Because my cousin Scears is awesome, and my Aunt Daly for that matter. If they aren't going to be there, then I'll just stay here and hang out with everyone. Maybe I'll have a party of some sort. I hate living in Sikeston though, because all my friends would have to haul-ass down here.   More Randomness:  *I keep biting my nails, and now I have sores on my fingers. So I've doused them in Polysporin, and right now I have Band-Aids on 6 of my fingers.  *My grandmother went to by me the OAR CD, but she asked for OAK. Haha.  *Uncle Matt and Aunt Amy's babies from Russia won't be here till January.  *I'm as pale as a ghost.  *My little sister saw a picture of Jack's back in the ND newspaper and said he looked hot from the back and she really wants to see his little brothers.  *My little brother is weird.  *"Scent of a Woman" is an awesome movie.  *My cell phone is being stupid. 258-0934 in case you wanted to know.  *Matt and I don't have social lives. So call me sometime and we can do something. And call him too. Because he's a nice guy.  *LSU IS GOING TO THE SUGAR BOWL, BABY! GEAUX TIGERS! My dad was telling me and he got all choked up with tears in his eyes. It was touching and funny at the same time.  *I had two big chunks of bourbon fudge today. My mom said it was way too strong for her, but I love it. :-)
