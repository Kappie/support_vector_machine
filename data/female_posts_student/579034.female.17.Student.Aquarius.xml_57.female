We made baked stuffed apples (green apples, baked in apple cider, with dried fruit filling inside), an onion dip, and I made stuffed mushrooms all by my self. I musta chopped up like 50 stems to stuff the mushrooms with. So, then I had told Jake I'd chill with him today since we didn't get to the other night and we went to see "Haunted Mansion"... it was very Disney but kinda cute. Then, Debra and Erica came to my house and we went to Dom's party. It was fun... we hung out and then summa the boys started to go into the pool (it was indoors) and then me and Deb started to push Erica in but we weren't gonna but then then boys stepped in and threw her in. Then Deb got thrown in and I begged for mercy since I hadda white shirt on but yea... I got thrown in any ways. Then we went into the sauna and we looked at "Where's Waldo" books. Then we made Dom give us clothes cause we were wet and then we had some pizza and then I came home and Greg called. I wasn't even gonna answer the phone. But I did and now hes ready to be my fiend again but he still wants to hook up and I told him I don't want to so yea... I'm not gonna, sorry.  Yea, thats about it. Tomorrow my family is commin over here so I'm gonna get to bed. Much Love x0x0x0x0x0x0xx0x0
