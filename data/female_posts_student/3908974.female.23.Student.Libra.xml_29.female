I dreamed about my good friend who recently eloped with her boyfriend.  I've always had a weird thing for her boyfriend, which I think could be mutual?  It's very bad, but it's only physical, so we avoid each other like the plague.  When we have to talk we are so polite it hurts.     Anyway, they owned this head shop in a little dustblown town.  They sold things like bundles of sage and beads made out of glass and t shirts that looked like burlap bags.  I was supposed to do some work for them, designing a logo and whatnot.  My friend said her special symbol was a four leaf clover.  Then I was in the mountains with a bunch of children that were supposed to be my brothers and sisters.  We camped in a caravan next to a river with white rapids and deep red banks.  I had to bicycle from our camp into the tourist town nearby to work as a waitress for a guy who looked like Adolf Hitler in a restaurant with a 50's theme.  I actually went home last night, for the first time in several days.  Almost without realizing it, I have pretty much been spending all my time at my man's house.  So I made a point of going home last night.  I slept like the dead.  This morning was good, even though I'm still feeling like hell.  I went for a walk in the rain and got a newspaper, ate breakfast, drank coffee.    Everything's going great with him.  These past few months have been dandelion wine.  I just need to remember to keep up my writing and stay in touch with my friends.  It never seems important to do that stuff, but then it is.
