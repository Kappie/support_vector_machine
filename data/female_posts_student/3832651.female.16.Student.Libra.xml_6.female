God is soo awesome, i mean just spending time with Him put me in such a better outlook, and He does little things all the time just to remind me that He's there and He really does care...and today my dad was so open to talking about how i could go to camp which just shocked me and i was just like "thank you God sooo much!", ahhh its just so awesome to be able to go to Him with everything and be able to just trust that His will will be done and even if its not what i may have wanted, its for the best in the long run and ill see that later on....so yeah, ive just slowly been learning to give God all my burdens and worries and to pray that what i want for me would be changed to what HE wants for me...well, i must be off to continue my laundry and room cleaning, exciting stuff i know! lol i hope that you have an awesome day!! :-D
