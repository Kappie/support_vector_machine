This year, for my family, was the first that the daughters...me and my two sisters...were apart. Me and Kim spent sunday with my mom at Raley Field in Sacramento and my sister, Becca, spent it with my dad here at home. They went to a company party and then bailed to see the fireworks in our own town. The fireworks we saw were mediocre at best, but it was by far the closest I've been to the actual launch site. We left the stadium right when they started and ended up across the street from where they were being lit when the end came. God, it was loud!  It was nice though, at Raley field the philharmonic played all the different military songs, and whoever belonged to the air force or army had to stand up when they heard the song being played and everyone shouted and clapped and patted complete strangers on the back or shook their hand...it was amazing...I'm proud for those people, I definatly think they deserved it.  Here at home, it's a little dull. We've been trying to finish the mosaic and painting and getting all the branches off the hill. It's coming along, but it's just coming along to slow. My dad and his girlfriend got in this huge argument and she took all her stuff and left. She took her tile cutters for the mosaic, so that only makes things harder. Off the subject, I really hate to see her go...I know my dad can be an ass sometimes, but I really liked her.  My dad's been in a little bit of a slump lately. I dont know how bad it is really, because he never flat out says anything until he simply can't take it anymore. But he's not sleeping well, and he's going into work late...I'm not sure what this is about. He's mad at us because we have all this time to finish these projects and their just not getting done and then the house is getting a little dirty again. I dont blame him, though. After all, he has to go to work and deal with all these problems and people and then he comes home, tired and unnerved to this house thats not filthy but getting there and to these three girls who've been sitting on the couch watching TV all day.  For the record, that's not  completely true, but I can see how he draws that conclusion. Now that I've made myself feel bad, and becca's here vacuuming...I'm going to go do some laundry and then maybe work on the mosaic a little.
