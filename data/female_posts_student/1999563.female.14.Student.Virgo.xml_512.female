I was just going to say that it is amazing how you all care so much [at least I tink to do *smile*] about me that you want to read alllll these words about what I do everyday, it means a lot..it really does.  just because I am in this bible mode, I thought I would post a verse that I liked...  Mathew 11:11 I tell you the truth: Among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.  Isn't that simply amazing????  See, John the Baptist is one of the most famous disiples in the Bible. yet, I who am practicaly nothing can still do more amazing things that John. He who is least can be greater than him!  Even though you may seem like a small person who can't do anything special, you are greater than John!!  You can do amazing things.  I love jesus...that may seem like an odd thing to say but I truley do.  He rocks my world!  :)
