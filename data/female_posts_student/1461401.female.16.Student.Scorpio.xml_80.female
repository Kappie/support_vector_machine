Sometimes life just isn't fair. God damnit, I'll show you not fair. Sometimes things don't go your way? Yes, but things might just get a little more difficult from now on, so watch your ass. And while we're at it, watch your damn mouth.  Grrr. Now I'm mad too. This has been a fun week...........grrrrrrrr.........
