Like i'm talkin to him now on IM and I am just smiling from ear to ear. *twitch, chelsea* Even tho he is like, 2 years younger than me, he makes me feel like he is all I need. This is like the first time in a loooong time I have felt this way. I dont like to use the word perfect, but he is seriously perfect for me. When we were together at Stone Mountain all I could do was smile. When I hug him, its like themost comfortable feeling in the whole world. He makes me feel safe and secure. And thats a really big thing for me. I love to look into his eyes, they are so sincere and caring. Like I'm the only one he's looking at. Oh man.... I like him sooo much!   And Mark, if you're reading this... you mean so much to me. *if you couldnt tell from above. lol*
