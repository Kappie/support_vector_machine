It was still super fun.  For some odd reason josh was there but he was fun to hang out with and marlin and robin! It was a good time! Tonight I watched the Hockey game and clearly Calgary should have won.  That goal people said was in I think that he kicked it in sorry guys but that's what it looked like and it wasn't touching the ground so it wasn't a goal.  Tonight I made a bracelet that Ashley taught me to make on our trip to Calgary and Bambi it was fun!!! It took me forever to make that bracelet but it was tons and tons of fun!   I think you guys might think I am crazy wrighting a Blog every single chance i get but the thing is I am not going to be here all summer and it will be really hard to write when I am not here:( don't worry though I will try as hard as possible to write one every chance to let my friends know how I am doing and that I am going to miss them very very very much! I love you guys a lot and there are only so many days till I am gone! Promise me one thing guys you will have so much fun!!! You will party hard and have an amazing time! I love you all!!! *MUAH*  Later Gator
