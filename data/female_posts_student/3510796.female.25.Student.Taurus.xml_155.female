Got into work bright and early, and found out that our bitch of an assistant manager tendered her resignation via e-mail over the weekend, effective immediately. I could go on and on about how she brought down all the employees she'd come in contact with, how many customers complained about her, how she had a personnel file about as thick as the OED, but really, she and all she stands for can be summarized in one word: misanthrope. She was on her "final warning" (which I believe is corporate-speak for "Double Secret Probation",) making her getting shitcanned at this point was pretty much just a formality, so she decided to get out on her own terms. Ever since the word came down, morale at the store has been through the roof. Employees have been bouncy, happy, smiling for no reason. It's like 200+ pounds of dead weight has been lifted off all of our shoulders.  The big plan on Tuesday was to go and catch the Sox-Twins game in the evening. It was going to be Rachel, Dan, Britt, and myself, along with whoever else we could scrounge up. If you read my Friday night post, you read about the strange dichotomy that is Britt. Well, Tuesday, the other Britt showed up to work. She has been fired up for going to a Tuesday night game at The Cell for months now, had her schedule changed so she could go, and now that it's gameday, what is she saying, in a meek and quiet voice? "Um, I don't know that I can afford it..." Well, that's not gonna stand, not after all this anticipation. So I go to my locker and grab one of the $1.00 ticket vouchers I bought a while back. I give it to her, along with a dollar, and tell her I'm driving. Money problem solved. And yet, when 4:00 comes, we're all standing up by the exit, and Rachel is asking if she's going, she's saying "I don't know, don't really have the money..." and all the time seems intently interested in staring at her shoes. She was so non-commital and insecure that we couldn't even get a solid "no" out of her. Oh well. Wasn't going to stop the three of us from having a good time at the ol' ballpark. On to 35th and Shields!  We make it to The Cell around 5:30, a full 90 minutes before game time. We pay to park, head to the ticket windows, and just as we make it up to the window to buy our tickets, the guy slaps a sign on the glass: "Tonight's Game Is SOLD OUT." Honestly, that doesn't actually happen to people, does it? That's the stuff bad sitcoms are made of. I half expected a guy with a horn standing next to the window, just so he could go "waa-waaaaaah!" for the full effect. So we pull out of the lot and get our $16 refunded (we almost didn't from the burly South Side jerk-off working the gate, until he realized we weren't going to roll over and didn't mind talking to someone above him to get our money back,) and decided to head a bit north.  We make our way into Lincoln Park, home to DePaul University, oodles of trendy twentysomethings, and rents I will never, ever be able to afford. Now, it's time for a bit of a shameful confession on my part: I am completely incapable of parallel parking. I know what it is, I know the steps involved, it's just that something gets lost in the execution of it all. Driving down in this built-up area, though, you're as likely to find a public parking lot as you are to find a herd of moose crossing Clark at Fullerton. And so, Dan and Rachel, being more seasoned city-types, direct me and support me as I slowly and deliberately attempt to make my way into this bastard of a space. I end up perfectly centered in the space and parallel to the curb. And no one else's car had to die for it. Those two - where would I be without them?  We stuff the meter with quarters and head into Papa Luigi's, a place promising authentic New York style pizza. And yes, there is a difference between Chicago and New York as far as pizza goes. Saying that pizza is pizza is like saying that the cask of Anejo tequila is pretty much the same thing as that plastic jug of "Senor Queasy's Value Tequila" on the bottom shelf. There is a distinct difference here. I tried the NYC version of stuffed pizza, which is basically a giant 16" round calzone, but crispy. And good lord, was it ever stuffed. My gigantic wedge of pizza was filled with cheese, Italian sausage (not pieces of it, but ground sausage filling the whole damn thing,) pepperoni, and ham. I got a breadstick to go with it, and hey - there's pepperoni stuffed in the breadstick, too! Filled with more greasy pork products than a person should probably have at one sitting, we headed up the street to the theater to see  Napoleon Dynamite . This movie didn't interest me at all andI had no intent of seeing it, but Rachel and Dan sold me on it. Once again, where would I be without those two? The movie was fecking hysterical. I'm not going to describe it or sum it up, because with a film like this, I feel like describing and summarizing can ruin the experience of some scenes. It's funny, silly, stupid, and downright uncomfortable at points, but the whole time it never loses its heart. Go see it now if you can find it at a theater. And thanks to this film, I now have a Halloween costume planned out.  After the show got out, we were going to head down to Millenium Park and check out all of the fuss. Unfortunately, there wasn't a spot to be found within 6 blocks of the park on this beautiful night, because apparently a lot of people had the same idea we did. We vowed to visit sometime soon, though - and take the train downtown when we do. And so, with the likes of Franz Ferdinand and Cheap Trick pumping out of the radio as we drove down Lake Shore Drive and the Stevenson with our windows open and the warm summer breeze blowing, we headed back to from whence we came.  We were meeting up with a bunch of peeps from work back in Orland afterward, and along with all of them was my friend Brian, in town for two weeks from San Diego. Brian and I lived in the same dorm down at U of I and became fast friends - and one of the days in the near future, he'll be getting a Ph.D. in astrophysics. He's simply the most brilliant mind I've ever met, while somehow managing to be completely down to earth and socially functional, which, if you've ever been in a college physics department, is quite the rare commodity. So we sat around, drank, and caught up on things, having ourselves a damn fine time. With closing time approaching, and me having to be at work at 8 am, Brian informs me that it's a moral imperative that we go to White Castle. Living out on the coast, far away from any outlet of those unique little greaseballs, the crave has hit my dear friend in a truly wicked fashion. And hey, what's a little more meat after the suckling pig in a crust I'd consumed earlier in the evening? We head to Whitey's, down some sliders (and man, does a a jalapeno cheeseburger ever hit the spot after a few adult beverages,) and call it an evening, with me finally dragging myself into bed around 2:30, my body mass comprised of approximately 12% foreign meats. Not every night can be like that, but when you get one, the good times kinda stick with you for a while afterward. Kinda like the smell that results from those sliders going through your digestive tract. Er, that's probably toomuch information.
