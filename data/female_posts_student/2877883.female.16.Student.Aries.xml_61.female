And because I've gotten really fat lately.  Woot, go me.  I want to go shopping so badly, but i don't have anytime.   I guess it'll have to wait awhile, until like June, sadly.      I want to see Hello Dolly, but I can't.  Stupid busy-ness.  I got a C- on my critique, go me.  Rewrite=tomorrow.    I need to write a poem for English, I have no idea what it'll be about, though.  Actually wait, I lied, it has to be about dreams.  Ugh.   Plus a huge English quiz/test tomorrow that i will probably do so bad on.  I hate English, it is far too hard.  I just don't get it at all.    Projects suck.  And I never use the word suck.
