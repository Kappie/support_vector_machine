Map Quest gave out the wrong directions and both Shawn and I got lost on the way to the hotel! It is so frustrating to be lost, tired, very hot and hungry! Nick slept the  whole  way down there including getting lost and stopping for directions. Megan came to the hotel and she  Dave watched Nick for the entire evening so Shawn and I could go out to dinner and have alone time. Yea Megan! Super Aunt! Thank you so much!!! Shawn and I had a blast. Nick slept thru the night! I finally picked up that when Shawn is home, Nick sleeps all night long. During the week, Nick gets up around 2-3ish and again at 4-6ish.  Nick  I left the cities area at 5:30am. After I fed him at 5, I knew he wasen't going to be going back to sleep any time soon and I didn't want to be stuck in the room waiting until the next feeding so we could leave.  The drive was long. I was so tired. But Nick  I took a nap once we got home and Nick  Shawn took a nap when Shawn got home =) Sleepy boy. He's wide awake and happy now. Tomorrow, back to work.
