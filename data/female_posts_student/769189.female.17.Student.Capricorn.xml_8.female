I've played almost all the way through Tenchu 2.There's about four weeks till my birthday and it's a great time to be alive. Yes theres more to it then that but its been awhile! I went to a birthday party today had toms of fun, "Big Trouble" Is the best movie ever! Working on getting more manga...and finishing Thanksgiving leftovers. And many thanks to Cosmos Sama who made me update.
