(hope i'm not infringing on any copyright laws by posting this...how terribly unlady-like.)  My favorites: A lady is always on her toes, realizing that every encounter makes a lasting impression. A lady thinks before she speaks and knows that false congeniality is as obvious as fake eyelashes. Trends come and go, but true style is timeless.  Etiquette: A lady uses a coaster. A lady does not crush her ice. A lady never curses in front of others. A lady knows how to give a compliment. A lady knows how to accept a compliment by saying "thank you." A lady does not wear anything so revealing that it embarrasses others.  Hygiene: If a lady expects her legs to be seen, she either shaves her legs or wears hose. A lady is not afraid to carry breath mints. Neither is she reluctant to offer them to other people.  For the guys: A lady is always on time. A lady does not whine. A lady does not nag. A lady does not brag. A lady knows that it is possible to offer assistance to a gentleman without threatening his masculinity.  Relationships: A lady never makes a date out of desperation. A lady breaks a date only for reasons of science, death, or natural disaster. A lady knows how to break up from relationships, jobs, and confront friends without losing friendships. A lady celebrates friends and lets them know their importance in her life.  that's it. one of these days, i'm gonna start taking my own advice. says the wise wise woman.  g'nite all.
