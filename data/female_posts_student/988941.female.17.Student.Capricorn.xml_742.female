I think I will go up before 11 and be ready to get my results the moment they open up. I will then jump on my envelope, run home, open it, and cry. Yup. That's my plan. Nice pic of Nic Max. I don't think she'd be too impressed. Yesterday I had one of my group meetings, it was great. Lovely to see everyone again. Today is our last meeting so I am not too pleased but I am happy because Ema has invited me to a party and James and I have spoken on the phone for nearly 2 hours every night so far since we have been back. They love me! LOL.  I am in a bit of dilemma but that is something to be spoken about quietly.    HAPPY 16TH BIRTHDAY JENNY
