I know there's a honeymoon phase, but when someone says, "oh, I'm trying to stop completely ditching you guys when a boy comes in the picture" and then they turn right around and do it again, well it makes me think that they're just a lying asshole.  I know I'm being just a tit harsh, but it happens every fucking time.  And I'm sick of saying -- oh that's just how she is.  Cause people shouldn't ditch people when new people come in their lives unless the old people are bad people and the new people are...unbad people.  There, I think I've said it all.  ERIKA!!!!  Well, maybe I'm just being an asshole.  But what's new.
