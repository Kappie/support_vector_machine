On the bright side there is three more classes and one more test and then I am going home. Of course it wont be the fun spring break that I planned when I thought I was going back to VT, but you guys have snow and that isn't cool so I am going someplace warmer (strangely enough Montana.) Its going to take me two days to get there but I really don't know that I want to stop so I may just drive right through and sleep on the side of the road a couple times. Just don't tell my dad. He would freak out!   Anyways, we are hosting a couple new recruits for the department. They are having dinner with us on Thursday night and then we are going to take them out and show them what West Lafayette has to offer. Not much really but there is free hotdogs and peanuts. I just hope that they will be fun.
