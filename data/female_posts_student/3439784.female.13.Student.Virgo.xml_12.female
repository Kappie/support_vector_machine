"a walk to remember" and..we fell asleep. this is the second time this has happened to us without us remembering what happened.   saturday- em stayed till around 2 or so, then sarah and i went to value village lol to get costumes for our romeo and juliet play. then later that night we went to the movies and saw "raising helen" it was a really good movie  sunday- i had soccer pictures, and the rest of the day i lazed around and did virtually nothing. fun fun!  sunday night- i slept for an hour, then i woke up to rather loud rain and i shut my window...and it was disgustingly HUMID in my room! so i couldnt sleep for another 3 hours...then i fell asleep   today- we did our romeo and juliet play, and i must say i think sarah and i did rather well. hm..the rest of the day was basically a waste of time...i had baseball practise after school, but i really sucked because..i was not in the mood, i just wanted to get home and shower!  this week im in ottawa. whoopee! we leave tomorrow at approx. 6:30 a.m. or so. i hope its fun! tomorrow night we have a dance on a cruise ship w/ other schools, so hopefully that goes good. honestly nothing else exciting is happening. boring life i have. anywho, i'll be writing in you after my holiday!   ciiaoo!  .chels.
