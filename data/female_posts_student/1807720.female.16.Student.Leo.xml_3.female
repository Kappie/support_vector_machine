Today, first I went to the mall and got some lunch at that new little place to eat in Sears.  Later I bought myself some socks - need those for sure!  And I also got myself a new bag for school.  Then I bought a pair of jeans for myself and that was basically my day.  Nothing too exciting because well I am trying to get in as much rest as possible before school starts.
