The longest day of the year, where its tradition to go down to the beaches and light huge bonfires and (in the olden days only) burn witches!... but only one problem, there was a thunder storm. All through the day it rained and rained and rained and rained... and even at one point hailed... and just as it was hitting the bonfire lighting time, the rain all of a sudden stopped! And not a moment too soon! So we got our bonfire in the end, although it had to be started with petrol because the wood was wet and then the petrol made this really gross brown smoke stuff... but the point is, we had our bonfire, and we burnt some witches! (fake stuffed witches, but witches none the less) And then just as it was getting dark (around 11.30 pm) everyone was setting off fireworks, very pretty!     So we (me and Marianne and Niels, me hosties) came back to the house and ate freshly picked danish strawberries with vanilla ice cream and watched more fireworks on the tv from Ã…rhus... and at exactltly midnight the rain started again and then the power went out which was kinda cool... so that was my danish mid-summer   Toodles  Kaz
