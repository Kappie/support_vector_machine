It was pretty fun! Tomorrow is my last day and i'm sad.. yesterday I got my nails filled and one of them broke. I think I'm going to get it done tomorrow. Well.. yay! this weekend is 4th of july! I'm happy!  then on wednesday we're going to austin! fun fun! well.. I don't really have anything else to say. latas.
