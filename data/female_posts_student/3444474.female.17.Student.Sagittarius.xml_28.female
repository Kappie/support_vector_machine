Not with the movie, but just everything going on around me in the world. I know it's totally overexaggerated and somewhat inaccurate, but I mean really, the basic premise is:    THE WORLD IS TOTALLY FUCKED.    In other news, I am teh tired, I think I will go to bed before two AM tonight, go me lol.  I'm really glad I joined a Social Justice/Social Change learning community. I fucking hate the state of the nation right now, I fucking hate the state of most things right now, personal or otherwise, but we won't go there in this post. :)  Anyways, I'm gonna make my way to my bed eventually.   Night all, maybe.
