Well my birthday is in a few days and I can't bring myself to be excited.  I think maybe because I am having a very hard time affording school and I am torn between staying in school or probably taking the semester off...but I can't do that, we are so depending on this financial aid...that mind you isn't that great...thanks to all those bastards that cheat the frickin' system and take all the frickin' money for students like me, who can't afford to go to college because we have KIDS!  UGH  Do NOT get me started on all of that.  I am so tired of all that BS.  That is what it is.  Money should be given to does who deserve it and will use the money towards funding their education...not for gambling...buying frivolous things...let me tell ya...  Anyway, life is okay...well that is about it...
