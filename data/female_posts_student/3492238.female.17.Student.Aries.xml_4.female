Holly hates her current job at Maxtech, and so far NO POOLS have called me yet, so you get the picture.  No? Do I have to say more? Alright.  So Holly wants us to work there.. Apparantly she's phoning tomorrow to see what exactly we have to do at the WELLINGTON MUSHROOM FARM. I wonder what the pay is at a mushroom farm. It's hard to take a job seriously when it's called a mushroom farm.. She better not ditch me... working at a MUSHROOM FARM is bad enough.. WORKING ALONE at a MUSHROOM FARM.. well that could be an experience..    (How much does Holly hate her job? lol they gave her a raise today ... now she makes minimum wage. You do the math).  WELLINGTON MUSHROOM FARM!!!! (fresh mushrooms daily)
