It affords one a good opportunity for people watching, or surveillance, or spying, or whatever you want to call it, that one doesn't get when sitting in a smaller space, such as a classroom or a subway car.  This, as I'm thinking about it, probably sounds pretty creepy, but people really are fascinating to watch, and there are times when you want to just stare at a person, but don't want the uncomfortable feeling of having their eyes meet yours and for them to know, by the quick way you shift your attention to the floor, or to someone else, anything else, that you were staring at them.  Across a crowded room, this type of scenario is highly unlikely.  Of course, it also has the effect of making one feel very detached and alone at the same time as it affords interesting observation opportunities.
