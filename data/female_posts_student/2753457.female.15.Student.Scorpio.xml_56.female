On Thursday Mary and I made the drive to Arlington.  Unfortunately once we reached the city itself, the Mapquest directions sucked horribly.  I have no idea how we reached the right neighborhood.  I had to call the hotel and ask the guy at the desk to walk us through it.  Then as we pulled up to the curb, Ellen jumped out of nowhere.  I hadn't seen her since January or February.  She had arrived earlier that day from Argentina.  And so Team Medlin was reunited.  I spent the next couple of days basically just screwing around with the two of them and some of my mom's family.  I got to go shopping in Georgetown on Saturday across the bridge, which was fun.  I found the skirt that was out of stock on urbanoutfitters.com in the actual store when I was there.  And a shirt with a dinosaur. The wedding was beautiful.  It was outside in the garden of this little Unitarian church.  I have never seen Cynthia so happy.  I think this was the first wedding I've been to where I was old enough to appreciate the significance and where I really cared about the person.  It made me want the kind of settlement that comes with marriage, especially in this case.  I wonder what that feels like. And then there was the reception.  Oooooh, man.  I have never seen my mother's family dance in my life.  It was really pretty hilarious.  Like three generations of people were out there busting out every move they knew.  It was like they had been waiting years to get a chance to do it.  There was a man video-taping the whole thing.  I hope I never EVER see that tape with me dancing around on it.  But the best part was that I caught the bouquet when it was thrown!!  It was so exciting, although I know for a fact that I will not be next to get married in our family.  Hahaha.  So that was really fun. Today has not been eventful.  My piano lesson got cancelled.  It was nice not to have to go out there, but at the same I was kind of disappointed.  I might not've been quite so bored.  Oh well.  Oh, my God, that storm this evening was wonderful.  I got really excited when the computer flickered on and off a couple times and I realized it was brewing outside.  So I stood in the front yard and watched the leaves blow and the trees sway and the sky darken.  It was beautiful.  I retreated to the screen porch after it had rained for a minute or so because I was really cold.  I was quickly joined by every other member of the house including the dogs.  Storms like that really make me happy for some reason. Hmm, I'm a little weirded right now because I just watched Donnie Darko.  Really good movie though.  But there was a lot of stuff going on in the house at the time and I got a little distracted so I think I missed a few things.  I might have to watch it again.  There will be time for that, no doubt.  I've watched a bunch of rented movies lately.  I think the best one was Lost in Translation, or maybe Mystic River.  Monster was good too.  Those are all Academy movies.  But, hey, at least Lost in Translation's indie.  I watched that one twice, and I liked it even more the second time, which is pretty rare.  Sophia Coppola is my friend. Alright, I think I'm gonna head to bed.  I might post a picture from the wedding in a few minutes though.
