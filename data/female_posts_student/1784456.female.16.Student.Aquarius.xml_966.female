(Yeah... to piss people off yeay!) Hmm... err... good point. Any hoo I'm gonna moan now! (Not really!) Hmm... I need to go out or some thing! Should we start that whole 'I actually have a social life' thing of meeting after school or some time or not bother? Hmm... Nah...! Maybe, we should or some thing... I'm getting damn bored over here! Eh, some one work some thing out... (some one? Me?) Aaargh! Why does it always have to be me? Oh, you know that thing about the boys vandalising the graves? It's like national news! Wow! Bristol was in the news! ...For all the wrong reasons! Any way... hmm... national snogging day. Damn that doesn't mean that we actually have to snog some one does it? GET DAVE AWAY FROM ME!!!! And no one tell Dave otherwise we'll all be doomed to jibbery!
