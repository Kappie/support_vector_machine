Tomorrow I start Dan's workshops so I'll have to see him all the time.  Have I mentioned any of this? I probably have but don't remember because it's late.  My mom was going to take me and Emily to see Saved in Greenville, but we didn't make it in time.  We went to see The Stepford Wives instead.  It's so good.  I laughed, I cried, and I laughed some more.  Actually I didn't cry, but I did laugh a lot.  I'd see it again.
