I think the first thought is the person is a freak, a biker, a biker chick, drug addict, devil worshipper, and I could really go on forever.  I am addicted to tattoos and body piercing. I love the thought of putting art on the body and have done so many times. I have a tiger cub on my left leg and a cat face on my right. Both my upper arms are tattooed also. On my left arm I have a wolf man and I LOVE this one best. On my right arm I have a dream catcher with bear tracks around it. Shirts with sleeves usually cover these up. On my right forearm I have a unicorn that is 9 years old and it looks great.  At this time I do have some piercing but I don't count my ear lobes. I had my nose done first about 4 years ago. I am a ring wearer because the swirls usually fall out because my nose is so small. A month ago I got my navel pierced. I was surprised at how little pain there was. I would have to compare it to a pinch. Nobody ever sees it but I do and I love it.  Last night I got my brow pierced. I noticed that most people do their brows vertical and have a ring. The ring hangs out and I think it is ugly. Mine is horizontal and with a barbell. I was expecting pain and bleeding but again it was a pinch and I did now bleed. My piercings were done by professional piercers. AVOID THE GUN because it was made only for ear lobes. If a place does body piercing with a gun run the other way  When I do wear sleevless shirts I get looked at and I have seen people walk away from me. I think those who judge others are really trying to make themselves feel better. I am not a bad person. I am 41 years old, have two children, Am a full time university Student with a B honor roll getting a BA in criminal justice and I want to be a probation officer working with teens. What people think of my tattoos and piercing bothered me at one time but not anymore. I feel good about my body and this is how I decorate it for myself. My kids love it and their friends love to come over and I have heard them ask how my son got such a cool Mom.
