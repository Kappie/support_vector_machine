Also good to see Liz, and attempt to comfort her in the face of her burglary. That's so scary that it makes me paranoid. I checked all the windows before I went to bed. Also, in other scary news, there was a spider on the dashboard of my car and I almost had a panic attack. It was so big and white and I just could feel it crawling on me. That spider heeby-jeeby thing has been getting worse lately. Or maybe it's just the whole driving/trapped thing that terrified me about this spider. Thanks to Lisa for calming me down. Man, I was freaked out. Okay, I'm sleepy now, so off to bed. Have a good dead day to all of you approaching finals!
