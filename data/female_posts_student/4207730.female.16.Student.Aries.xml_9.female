I haven't talked to any of you in like a month because I've been away on vacation. China was  a lot of fun, I climbed my ass up the Great Wall...according to our tour guide you can see that wall all the way from Mars. I believe it! The thing is massive. I got a good work out in China because all we pretty much did was walk and go SHOPPING! I got some spiffy stuff from Abercrombie and Hollister while I was there and it was like half the price, since all the clothes are made in China. While I was there I got 2 massages and a facial. I met up with a cool chick named Candy! OMG she was soo unbelievably SWEET! The only problem was that she didn't know any English, which made it hard to communicate. But OMG she was soo nice, she drove me around town(wow what a crazy driver) and she also have me this pretty necklace, it has aromatherepy oils in there, the smell made me naucious, so I poured it out. Now I'm just airing it out, maybe I'll put my favorite perfume in there.   K well our plane ride home pretty much sucked ass. It was long and I had to sit behind this annoying Indian kid that kept opening and closing the shade, so I finally like slammed it on his finger. His mom got up and stared at me...I didn't really understand the point in doing that. Seriously, what was she trying to accomplish? Is she tryin to scare me or something..ha yeah right. My grandma had to sit next to her, poor grandma. :-( The lady kept flipping her turban in my grandmas face,lol.  k i'm soo jet lag, I've been waking up at 2 PM everyday. I have no work this week! But I will next week, having a week off is great.  School starts in 20 days...blah.  Teens choice awards are on tonight...Paris and Nicole are hosting! WOOO!!!  k im gonna blog later
