I’ve never been on a blog that wasn’t just another tech support forum. I’m not sure if this means I’m busy, studious or just boring. The safe guess is boring so I’m going with that. I have to admit that I haven’t read any of the post on here. I do a lot of reading online and I try to avoid any extra when I can but I promise to read all this useful and pertinent information soon. The only reason I’m posting anything is because I got the invite from shadow. I rarely get invited to anything (especially by the cool kids) so I just couldn’t resist.   Now that we’re done with the touchy-feely crap, let’s blog!  2004-07-03: Currently hanging with my extended family waiting for tonight. I’m in Chicago and on the drive over from Michigan I filled the car with class C explosives (fireworks to you lay people out there :). So tonight I will make every effort to put my eye out, set my clothes on fire or cause property damage. If it’s a good night I might do all three. I can only hope and try my best.  I’ve been traveling for a week and a half at this point and the work is piling up. A few 80-hour weeks after I get back should catch me up just fine. In fact I just finished working this morning and decided to use the remaining battery time on the laptop to make a post. Anyone who knows me knows I enjoy my work and spend most of my free time working. I work for myself, btw, so the extra billing hours are mine, not some fool I work for. As Dogbert once said “The American dream is to work hard and make your boss rich”. So work for yourself, be your own boss and take lots of vacations. Like this one.  You’ve been blogged. I’ll be back.
