Today's creation consisted of USA waffle, ice cream, hershey's choc syrup, QOO Lemon, ice kachang, maple syrup, chilli sauce, butter, tomato ketchup. So interesting. We did something worse after that. Theo poured the solution into Roy's drink can. Crap.   During lesson, we were still crapping. Making fun of HoFM. Theo imitated her la..trying to be funny. TBCM was worse. Only the other half of the class (the rest of the girls) were paying attention and doing their work seriously. The rest of us were gave stupid answers all the time. Theo was drawing throughout. The thing is, we were seated right in front of the teacher's table. First row somemore. hahaha...   After sch, Lim,Wilson,Theo and I went to IKEA. Lim wanted to go there to buy toys, for dunno what reason. We went there for hot dog first. Cheap and nice. Theo and I shared one cos both of us scared fat. Then we played with all the sauce. Custard,chilli and tomato. This time the mixture was nice..so smooth..hahaha...went to walk after that. hee..Then after that Wilson suddenly appeared behind us. But nvm...   Went to TM with Theo and Wilsonafter that. Kept laughing on the mrt. Theo kept imitaing and making fun of HoFM n GeokEng..wahaha..Wilson went to arcade to play while waiting for his friend. Theo and I went to walk. Then we went NTUC. After that I went home and he went to Orchard.   Tml still can play with food. cos we got one and half hr break. so good!
