Yet I've become so accustomed to listening to inane, cookie-cutter pop radio in my desperate attempt to conform to the world around me. No more. I'm over it. I'm over not being able to think for myself. I'm tired of pretending. I have my own ideas, opinions, and beliefs, and Irefuse to let others dictate what those ought to be. I'm tired ofnot thinking for myself. Yes, I still shop at American Eagle. But you know what? I  like AE. Their clothes fit well. I'll wear my AE clothes and sit in a coffeeshop and drink tea while reading novels by Chaim Potok and Madeline L'Engle because that's what  I  like. If you want to wear AE and drink coffee in a coffeshop (even though you don't like coffee)and discussthe latest gossipwith friends (even though it isn't true), fine. But I'mready to think for myself.
