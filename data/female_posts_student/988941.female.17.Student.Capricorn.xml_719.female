She is even paying for food and stuff as well! He is sooo lucky in that respect. I think we may be going to see T3 on Friday but i'm not sure, i will have to ask Max when i next speak to him. I hope we do, but if we don't i will ak Darren to go with me instead just the 2 of us, cause we have wanted to see it for ages! Tsk Tsk, you computer could be seriously ill Nicki! Make sure you take it to the Healthcheck at PC World or you could be in serious trouble! lol I am so glad that the heat is finally leaving us, its an acceptable heat now, i can sleep at night now without sweating the bed down! Lol, Has anyone got ne thing planned for the rest of the week? And Tom heres a virtual hug from me also! :D  Make sure you get another one from me off MSN.
