(oh well) I've been hanging out with Alex a lot which has been fun because... well... it's Alex. What else is there to say. Late night phone calls are very fun, I must admit. Today, Lilly asked me who I was going to marry. She's such a cute little five year old. She told me if I married Alex I could stay with him forever. Kids say the funniest things. I don't really have much else to say. School's starting again in 5 days, which is rather depressing. Oh well, it happens. Tomorrow is Kevin's birthday, and the 4th is Alex's. Yay. More shopping. XD  I think I've done enough damage here for one day.
