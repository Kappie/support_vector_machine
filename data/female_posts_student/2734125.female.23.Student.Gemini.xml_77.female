Its still there, crouching for night and alone. It felt very alone today, like no touching could ever happen, never had, never would. Then I sat in the sliver of sun on the edge of the porch and watched an oil on water on air thread dance.  Silk untouched by rain or people, playing in the light, and something settled then.  Like a rock shifting into the space it will be for the next few millennia, and time is bending in a way that I know that rest is moments, that the winds of the world will shift things again before I can blink.  It is my new test, and I am resigned to the knowing of it.  For weeks I have been feeling the delicate balance I lived, for weeks I was holding my breath more then breathing, waiting for the straw that broke me, and it came in an omen of sorts.  Came or didn't, came or was constructed to look like a coming- only the passage of my life will tell.  At any rate, early on Sunday morning, as the earth moved just enough to create a fog hallucination of light, I was being driven home.  Out of the dark side of the car, almost home, then I can sleep and find some quiet, came a tiny dog running.  The brakes were hit, but not so hard as to throw me truly forward, and there was a bumping and yowling.  The howling of pain and shock and fear lasted for eternity and nothing.  "What do we do?" I turned and asked my companion, "do we get out of the car?" and then it was quiet.  Quiet filled the morning, and then turned to fear of death, death hiding under the safe undercarriage, death lingering in the dawn.  We drove slowly away, and saw nothing.  The road was still.  Did it exist?  Was it real?  That tiny wire haired thing, trotting along in the morning with no sense at all, walking into the sound and light of a car.  What was it a figment of reality?  There was so much quiet, no sound of claws dragging frightened across the street, nothing.  Odd.  And I cant quit stop thinking about it, but it doesn't seem to weigh quite so heavy with the sun out... is that another cloud?  Damn it all.  Where has my lover sun gone?  What sinking metaphor is this?  I best prepare myself now; I doubt my lessons are over.
