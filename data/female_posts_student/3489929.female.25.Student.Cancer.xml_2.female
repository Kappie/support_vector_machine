I cannot wait to leave this all behind. Seriously. I want to start school so bad, I can taste it. Less than 2 more months, and then I am home free. I will never darken their doors again. I am serious this time. I refuse to get sucked in again. I just don't understand why everything has to be so damn miserable there. It's like no one really cares about trying to make it better. Everyone is stuck in the same rut as me. Everyone has these issues. Believe me. I know I'm not the only one.  And Lisa: I hope you feel better soon. :(
