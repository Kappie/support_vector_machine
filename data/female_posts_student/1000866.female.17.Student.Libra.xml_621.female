I'm really nervous and I'm not as prepared as I would have liked to be. Not at all. :( Gah. Oh well. We'll see. I might get to do the musical though!!! Since Matt can't do it and Greg can't...Whoooo!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope I get to do it.   Anyway, I need to go. I'm driving my mom to her outpatient surgery. Not a big deal but she'll be on drugs so she needs someone to drive. Lucky me. :)
