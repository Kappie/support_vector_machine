Angela....... sorry I cant come over tomorrow and torture you. I want to but I have to babysit. Its this new couple that I don't know but Staci knows them. I'll tell you about it later. My mom told me a little bit about the Texas chainsaw massacre thing. It dosn't sound to good. And she also told me about this one house of her friends, ( moms friends old house.) Mom says that some old lady got murdered in her kitchen! She got murdered by some sychoo guy that escaped from a nut house a few streets down. That's scary. Almost 10 years ago. Angela, Scary Dairy could be our next Fear Factor thing, you know. No more haunted hospitals. Were going to a Slater house. K, well I'll talk to you tonight. Don't forget to get the Ding ding out of Jr.'s bum. hahahahahahahahahahahahaha. k, see ya. bye bye.
