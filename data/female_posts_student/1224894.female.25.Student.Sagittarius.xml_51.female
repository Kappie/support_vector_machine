And now i'm all alone again, nowhere to turn, no one to go to Without a home, without a friend, without a face to say hello to And now the night is near and I can make believe he's here  Sometimes I walk alone at nightwhen eveybody else is sleeping I think of him and then I'm happy with the company I'm keeping The city goes to bed, and I can live inside my head.   On my own, pretending he's beside me All alone, i've walked with him till morning Without him, I feel his arms around me And when I lose  my way, I close my eyes And he has found me.  In the rain the pavement shines like silver,  All the lights are misty in the river In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight And all I see is him and me forever and forever.  And I know it's only in my mind That i'm talking to myself and not to him And although I know that he is blind Still I say, there's a way for us.  I love him, but when the night is over He is gone, a river's just a river Without him, the world around me changes The trees are bare and everywhere The streets are full of strangers.  I love him, but everyday I'm learning All my life I've only been pretending Without me, his world would go on turning A world that's full of happiness that I have never known.  I love him I love him I love him But only on my own.  Performed by: Kuh Ledesma on Duets with Kuh
