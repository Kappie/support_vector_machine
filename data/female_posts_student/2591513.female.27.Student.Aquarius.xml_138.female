Seeing the images of Nancy Reagan and her children saddens me.  I guess you can say I can feel their pain because I have lost a loved one to Alzheimer's and it isn't a pleasant journey.  I also think of how I would handle being left behind by Ed.  I don't know if I could stand it.  The time he is away is already difficult, but if he were to be permanently gone, I don't know how I would go on.  I know I would because of the children, but I don't think it will go as smoothly.  I love him with all my heart and with all I am, it took a lot of battles and lot of tears, a lot of hurt feelings, a lot of joys, a lot of happiness and a lot of love and patience to get us here, but we are here.  I am so glad we never gave up.  There were many times I wante dot take the cowards way out and walk away, but Ed reminded me that we had so much to fight for and he was so very right.  Okay enough of my rambling...
