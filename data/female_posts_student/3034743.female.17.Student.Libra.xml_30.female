I don't know what prompted her to say that, but she did and it was really funny. Today was a pretty good day. I talked to Martin online for about 4 hours. I am going to go to his house tomorrow to hang out. That should be fun, well I hope at least. I'll have something to do then anyways.  Hmm....what else? Oh, today it was somewhat odd in physics. I don't know, maybe because of what happened yesterday with me and Matt. haha. Sometimes I just do not think! Oh well, it wasn't that weird. It was kind of funny...until Ryan, Theran, and Luther were making some comments. And then I think they told Griffin. Oh well...nothing I can do about it. That's what I get for not thinking things through all the way.  Hmm....there is really nothing else to blog about...so I'm done for tonight.
