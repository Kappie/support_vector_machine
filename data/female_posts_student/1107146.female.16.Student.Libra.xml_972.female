He thinks he Gods gift to the world.  * Oh, snap! *  ;)  Anyway, I spent today watching movies: What Women Want, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Gone With the Wind, Dirty Dancing, and a couple of episodes of Trading Spaces. ( Z, you should have seen Genevieve - she started crying because this couple didn't do their homework!)  THis is getting old fast.  Call me, people!
