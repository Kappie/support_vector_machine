As nice as it is to be done with exams, there is that little creeping feeling that will be with me until I receive my grades.  But as there is absolutely nothing to be done about that now...  So congrats to all my law school friends who are done.  Congrats also to all those 3Ls I know who are graduating - I am so jealous.  Oh, and a special congrats to Christina, Simone upon their graduation from NYU, which should be going on, wrapping up as I type this.  Woo hoo!  You guys made it and you are free!  Okay, I'm off to do nothing for now.  I'll be back later for more substantive posting.
