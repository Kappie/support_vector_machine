I have to do it again; but next year it'll be even heavier :) Not too sure of the songs yet, but you can bet we'll probably die of cardiac arrest onstage next year. As for shock value, ask Z...I heard they tried to get Keidel in the mosh pit, and one guy said it was the first time he'd ever seen Keidel frown. I was stunned. It was kinda depressing seeing the pit going really strong for a few minutes, and looking up two minutes later to find it gone. But the ending was great, even I thought it was pretty damned good.  And more details today in fifth period, of course :)
