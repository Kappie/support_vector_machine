MM paper was okie but i cock up...did 3qns out of 5...maybe can scrape thru' if lucky. forget how to do part (a) of a qn so can't do the WHOLE qn...20marks gone. rather didn't practice enough to make sure it drills in...too late.  Macro paper was okie but complete 2.5 qns out of 4. maybe can pass...maybe  maybe can grad...maybe =(
