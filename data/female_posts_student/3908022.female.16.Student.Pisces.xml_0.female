I think I've been so depressed that the only feelings I can express are the negative ones. But, I'm going to try to write a positive post today.   Maroon 5 are eating their way into my heart and mouth(Which means that I love them and I sing their songs all the time... ). The lyrics are, as most, not very deep in most cases. But a few songs really have the depth that I look for in a song. I don't find that very often. I'm also thinking about making a Gavin DeGraw CD.   Yes, I burn most of my CD's, not all of us are able to spend a fortune on CD's every month. I have clothes to buy.   Gavin DeGraw is a very good artist and I believe his songs to be positively amazing. His voice is not beautiful but he sounds secure of himself and relaxed. That is always a plus... Relaxation, and not just in music.   Another positive thing is that working really makes me feel good about myself... (partly, partly not.)  I feel that I  am  doing  something worth while . When I feed those people, make them laugh and make them food,I just feel that it means something. That I, for once, is doung something for someone else. But the fact that I'm making money of this, of course, takes away part of that pride.   The weekend's coming up and I can't wait to kick back and relax.
