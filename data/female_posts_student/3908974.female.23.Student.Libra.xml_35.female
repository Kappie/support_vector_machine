I just get so busy, so sleep-deprived, so involved with my limited social circle...It's taken a conscious effort to make new friends.  I have a real bond with this lady.  She's nearly ten years my senior, and she has an eleven year old daughter, and she doesn't look like someone you'd think I'd be friends with.  But she's positively awesome.  She doesn't care about things that don't matter.  I mean, she honestly doesn't.  She cares so little for fashion--I have never once seen her in something without elastic, something that didn't get haphazardly pulled out of a laundry basket and yanked over her body for the sole utilitarian purpose of covering herself.  Lots of people, myself included "don't care," but we all pore over the mirror and putz around wondering if our pants reveal how overweight we really are.  Her attitude on these matters has earned my complete respect.  She seems very interested in exploring creative avenues, and although I haven't read anything she's written that's been really great, I like engaging with someone who renews my interest in something that has become almost a chore for me.  She told me she had a daughter who died of SIDS.  I told her about the divorce.  Forging friendships is always like that, building trust on those hidden things.  I hope I am not so stupid as to put her to the side just because she's older and cannot stay out late drinking.  That would be my loss.  So let me risk dooming myself by writing here that I will not be such a crappy friend, and that I will try not to be so lazy about my social life.  (written Sunday afternoon)  I am really wanting to become a cop today.  Maybe Monday I will find out how.  Surprise everyone.  I need to do something different.  I love the shelter of academia, but I don't care enough right now, and I think I'd be wasting everyone's time.  It'd be easy enough to come back to KU or the like when I am ready, maybe?  Research is in order.  And cleaning out so I can pass the U/A.  (Not the best way to get the job, peeing green!)  My dad will not speak to me for quite some time.  He will secretly suspect that this decision has some oblique connection to dating a Republican.  Why do I want to be a cop?  I know well that I will be very bored most of the time.  But I feel like I am good in danger, and I am kind of a soft and nice person, and I want to do some public service with my life.  Not to mention that I will make much much much more money than I would ever make as a teacher.  Then again, teaching is pretty much a labor of love as well.  I will sleep on it, but I think, like the Underground Man, I will do what I least expect to do, driven by desires I cannot even name.  My baby and I have reached a new level of intimacy.  Last night, my new nose piercing came out and we had to spend an hour in the bathroom with a pair of pliers and a sewing needle.  That was pretty sobering, to be honest.  I wonder if he will be so good in a few months, if he will soon be tired enough of my ways and become laissez faire.  I am constantly amazed at the lengths that man will go to just to make my life more pleasant.  One of the first things I ever told him at the onset of our relationship was, I only hope you are always happy to see me.  And to this day, that's the only criteria I have for Us, that it never seem like a chore, that it's always sincere, even when we calm down a bit.  One more thing:  For christssake, I need to give drinking a rest!  All weekend I sat on my stoop with a beer in my hand and a cigarette dangling from my mouth.  The only homework I did was reading the wrong book.  Why am I so All or Nothing?
