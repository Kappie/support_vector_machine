We can’t live, without…  Despite, our moments of weakness, I’m a part of you, and you a part of me.    Have you ever imagine, if I wasn’t here? If tomorrow, I may not be around?   What would happen, to you? Who would take care, of you?   Who would be always, there, for you?   Could you Love, again?      The future is uncertain… And the past is gone, just blurry memories.    Live, the present moments, with the spirit, of an entire Life. Be grateful, for what you’ve achieved,   And Love, what you are now…  With those, you Love back.  If you smile, life will smile with you, and so will I.       ]-[ellMistress * Angel Who Can’t Fly
