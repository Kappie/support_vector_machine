For some reason I think I was more fun two years ago. Back then my roommates were protecting me from "the celery stalker". lol.  	 	I think I was a lot more entertaining when I was dating different people. There was one semester where I rebelled from a relationship by dating and "hanging out" with like 5 different people..not counting ones at home. I was so thrilling then. I was soo entertaining. Now I hang out with my textbooks and my computer.  Neither gives me the satisfaction I so deserve.
