I joined the wellness center a little over 2 weeks ago. I go 4 times a week, if I can, and I work out for an hour at least. I don't know if I've lost any weight yet, but I have toned up a bit. Not many people have noticed it yet, but they will. Someday, I'll be really hot, and get all the guys. OR at least, they'll all WANT to get me, but I won't let em have me. lol jk yall. I'm not going to fool myself into believing any of that.  Me and Coulter went to Charlie's house 2 Wednesdays ago and watched 50 first Dates. Thus we went to Barry's house the next Wednesday and hung out there. lol. I think we might be going to my house this week.  Me and Chelsea and Charlie and Lacie went to go see Spiderman 2. It was SO good. Chelsea told me that me and Charlie were acting like a couple when we were at her house. This worries me a little, because I don't mean to be so flirtatious. Chelsea spent the night at my house that night.  Friday, I didn't do a whole lot.  Saturday, I was somewhat frustrated. I had some friends over to swim, and Nick was going to come, but he got into another arguement with his parents, which didn't do a thing for him but get him grounded. This in turn made me REALLY mad. I was so mad that I cried. and not just a little crying, but full on violent sobbing. I was just so mad, because it was the second time that had happened. I mean, the first time, I didn't care TOO much. But this time, it just made me think that maybe he didn't want to spend time with me anyways. I guess I should just believe him when he says that he wants to spend time with me. eh, I should just stop being so paranoid. Love, Shannon
