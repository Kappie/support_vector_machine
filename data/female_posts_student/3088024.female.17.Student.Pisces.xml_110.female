Everyone thinks I am wierd, but I love just going outside when it is raining and just sitting and let it pour down on me.  Or to go for a walk and jump in all the puddles and just enjoy God's creation.  well anyways...one of my teachers stopped over.  she is nice.  so anyways...i am making a technology proposal for an organization...I wonder if a minor can be a technology officer in an organization.  well anyways...
