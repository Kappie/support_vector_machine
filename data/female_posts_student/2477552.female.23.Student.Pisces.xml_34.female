I wore my frog shirt for good luck today and like billions of people saw me wearing my stellar frog tshirt. I mean, after all, who could pull of wearing such an exotic number besides me? No one, I tell you. And I've just realized how ultra-cool I really am. I've got multi-colored frogs all over my boobies.   It's official, the rainforest frogs are now the amphibian protectors of my boobies.  Ha! lol.  Oh yeah! And I almost forgot to mention that I aced my physical geography exam! Whuhoo! Go lucky frog shirt. I'm really gonna be reeling in the cute smart boys now.  And Eric,  I saw an Alaskan, an Eskimoan, or possibly a Pacific Islander today who, dare I say it, rivals your cuteness.  He had an accent too. Oooh.  Now only if Sean Connery/James Bond would be a Pacific Islander.... Ooh then my fantasies really would come true. I'm coming Mr. Bond. Ha! I'm such a major dork. :)
