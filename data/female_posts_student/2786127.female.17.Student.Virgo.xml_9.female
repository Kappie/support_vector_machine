I'm covering up my embarrasment when im playing with my team with unbridled rage. I get soo disgustingly pissed now when im playing. I need school varsity to start up again so i can play some REAL volleyball.  I need to go shave my legs.  Am I dateing Nate? I'm scared to ask him if we are. He was gone in Disneyland for a week and i haven't talked to him like...at all...since he got back. Is it wrong that i want to play it like a "whore" right now? I'm not going to dance around and sleep with everyone persay...I just want to date a bunch of guys at the same time. Why? because I can...and I've always been tied down. Its time for somthing new, and my dad won't give me money for a new bathing suit so this will just have to do.  My bed looks inviting. sleep.
