Listen to people more   3. Chage alot (I'm still a bitch)   4. Live life to the fullest   5. Don't care so much   6. Give some people their space   7. Keep in touch with friends. Don't drift so far apart.   8. Look up to my role model more   9. Be myself !   10. Stay close with my close friends.      Yep. That's the list. Pretty lame huh? Yeah, you know I rock. * giggle*
