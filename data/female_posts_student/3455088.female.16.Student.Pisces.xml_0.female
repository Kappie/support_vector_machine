This will be a story written by a fifteen year old sophmore about her life in general. It's like this entire blog was written by her, except for this - and this is me. The real me. My main character, Ginny, is only a snipet of me, who I'm going to agonize and dote over in this story. Called Orion. You'll see why.  Do read. I'll post soon.~
