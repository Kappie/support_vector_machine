So today after school I went and visited my grandmother and then I went to Safeway to buy Tori's birthday present (mini-pop) and then I went to her party until mid-night. Then came home and now I'm online. Tomorrow I wake up and then have to go work on sets for the play Little Shop Of Horrors until 5:00 then Felicia is (most likely) comming over, and then later around 9:00 other people are comming over and we are going to watch some movies, and hang out a bit and then go to sleep and on Sunday, I'll be at Woahink all day. Woahink is the best thing ever. :) I like it. :D:D:D We played monopoly tonight, it was the first time I ever ACTUALLY played by the rules, I always used to hand out the houses and motels seperately, it was amusing. I was winning too. It started as Jen and I, Brittney and Richard, Tori and Tommy, in partners and Daril and Chad by themselves then people left and dropped out and then it was Me, Brittney, Daril, and Chad. It was so fun. Today was a good day. Apparently Felicia's bf thinks I'm cool now. So that's exciting. FELICIAS JEALOUS OF ME ;) for unnamed reasons of course! :P Today was a great day! I liked it alot. 1st Period I got kicked off of my computer in the library by ANTHONY and RICHARD so I didn't get to start on my three essays that were due later in the day, 2nd I got to make a round type thing out of clay, it was exciting, 3rd we read and free-wrote and discussed poetry, 4th we made a petigree and took a quiz (an easy quiz) then lunch rolled around and I did the usual thing, hang out with Suzy and Daril and Codi and Katrina and Mya, and Kyle, and yaya, then 5th HOCKEY!!! YAYAYAYA!!! 6th I wrote my three essays that were due that period... wow they were amazing! One was on The benefits of being physically fit, one was The effects of a sedentary lifestyle, and the third was the importance of a balanced diet, all had to be at least 200 words. They were amazing. I wrote a poem third period.
