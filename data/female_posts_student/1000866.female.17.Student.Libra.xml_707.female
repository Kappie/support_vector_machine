Then, I went for my first day of work at Marianjoy and it was really...truly exciting. I've never felt more...right doing something than I did there. I got a chance to work with a bunch of kids today. Three with austism and actually, not a kid, a woman, with cerebral palsy. It was just amazing because the first boy I got to work with was five years old and he has a less severe form of autism and so it was almost like being with a regular five year old, but when we went into group time with this one other kid, the first boy had a lot of trouble communicating. He didn't like the other little boy who was about two. He wouldn't play with him or anything. It was a huge breakthrough supposedly that we got him to play cars with the younger boy. And, the older boy was helping the younger boy with speech, because that's what the younger boy's autism did to him. It affected his speech. It was just great to see him communicating. Then, the cerebral palsy patient, I didn't get to help much with, just observe. They put a new cast on her arm so she could start to move it better after the cast was off. Then, the last kidhad a pretty severe form of autism. We just had fun with him and played with him.   It was funny though. I don't think I've ever seen people look so happy as the kids in that room do. I was amazed that kids battling autism and severe dysfunctions could remain happy through the therapy and through their difficult life. It made me realize how much I should appreciate the little things. I walked out of there just being thankful I could actually walk out of there. I really felt like I was helping them too. I think I've at least found what I want to do sort of. My feeling that I want to do something that helps people has definitely been solidified. I mean, even if they weren't having breakthroughs like the first  and second boy...it was just nice to see them having fun away from their normally stress filled days. These kids have more stressful days than I've probably ever had in my entire life and it's like that every day. Every single day. And yet...they still remain happy. I'm just absolutely amazed.   The rest of my day was very nice too. I went to Tom's and watched possibly the worst movie EVER. But, I had fun watching it because it was so bad. :) Well, I'm awfully exhausted and I have a big day ahead of me tomorrow.   hugs + kisses
