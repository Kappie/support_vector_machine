Didn't  know that I was or have been at any time a Women's Center Ambassador. 2. Decided that I liked it. 3. Hoped I get to be an "Ambassador" again. hahaha. I'm ever so charming.  Now I'm just sitting back.  Two of my classes got cancelled today! Whuhooo! And now I have nothing to do until my psy class at 6. I could however get to work on these two massive projects that are due next monday, tuesday, and thursday. But I say I'll just wait and find out where the day takes me.
