Everything else is just a ceremony announcing the return of the gooey sugar-coated goodness that is the Ishtar PEEP. Since it's the day after Ishtar the PEEPS were on sale for .50 cents so I bought 4 boxes((2 for me and 2 for Devon)) and began eating them all in rapid succession. However towards the end of my PEEP frenzy I stopped and decided to save a few of each color for microwaving later. Pretty soon I got sick of looking at them and Devon was playing PEEP soap operas so I grabbed a yellow bunny PEEP and a blue chick PEEP and rubbed them together and made green bunick((bunny+chick=bunick)) PEEPS. As Devon saw me doing this she started yelling PEEP PORN PEEP PORN. And I was laughing like crazy and when I finished making the PEEPS screw I popped one of them in my mouth. As soon as I did so Devon exclaimed "you just ate a horny PEEP!". I burst out laughing and could've died! We then continued discussing the idea of making PEEP movies, music((the Sex Peepstols!)), and other merchandise.   The only bad thing is... I laughed so hard this little piece of PEEP got stuck in my nose and well, let's just say they call me blue booger these days.  I meant to also save a few so I could have a peeper-nutter. What is a peeper-nutter you may ask? Well I'm sure most of us have heard of the fluffer-nutter, the oh-so-kitsch peanut butter and marshmallow fluff sandwitch. Well I decided I will be replacing the marshmallow cream with PEEPS and will have peeper-nutter sandwitches for lunch. ((other suggestions for names: fluffy-peeper, peepy-fluffer, nutty-peep, nothing we found was without SOME sexual undertone))
