My old friend Spinner, her real name is Abby Emmons, and she is Jackie's half sister. Spinner as we used to call her used to be extremely good friends when we were younger. Until I had to move to Burlington, that is when Michelle and I broke up. Abby and I were both pretty down, so instead of sitting in Williston without me, she told her mom she wanted to live with her dad. Did I mention he lives in Pennsylvannia? Well he does, so I went to Burlington and Abby went to Pennsylvannia, all in the same month. Before this time I had started to become friends with Abby's older sister Jackie, who's dad lived in Burlington. Jackie would switch every week, from her father's to her mother's house. So when Spinner went to Pennsylvannia, Jackie became my new Spinner. Anyway, I was forced to Burlington, and I lost contact with Michelle and Spinner. But, Michelle and I started talking again, after certain events occured. Spinner on the other hand seemed as to disappear completely.  Now that you know the background story, here is the deal now. Spinner, is coming up to visit her mom, and to help her sister, Jackie pack. I got word that Spinner was asking about me and Michelle. This is where we are now, so when I go down there to visit Jackie one last time (if she lets me). Spinner and I will be united once again, and we will be back to our old games in no time. That's my plan anyway. I hope Spinner's has the same idea.  Anyway, I need to let Michelle know about this little blast from our past. I am not sure if Spinner is the same as she used to be since we haven't talked for about 4 years. Also if you want to know how Abby, came to be called "Spinner" you should ask Michelle, because, I don't feel like typing anymore.  Just another thing on my mind...
