I guess I've died on you. I must delay the next chapters for a few more days, at least. I am contemplating where the story is going down the road, and trying to get some kind of foresight. But I will finish. I promise.   *Give a sweet smile*  Not much is going on now. I'm kind of in a rut, actually. My writing has been bad lately. Mostly because I have been thinking too much. About trivial... and important things. I promised myself I would not think about it... or write it here... However, it is not like anyone actually read this! It is about a guy.  *Blushes and giggled uncontrollably*   I very nice person. He is attractive, funny, and very caring. Thing is, he is so far from my reach that it is not worth even thinking about him. Yet, still, I do. It is odd.  I never really thought of myself as one to just have a crush on a guy. In the past, I have always been very open about it, and we end up being together. Nevertheless, with this boy, who we will call *Bobby* for some amount of secrecy, is much different. "Bobby" is far to close to me to talk to him. It also seems that whenever we get the chance to talk... It just does not happen. It is strange.  I am not saying he is avoiding me. He could be, but with him, it is hard to tell. He is just distancing himself from me, which I would not blame him for doing. I have no idea if he feels the same way, but I am sure he does not. Almost 100% sure actually...   *Tear runs down her cheek*  Which kind of makes me sad. This isn't the first time I've felt this way about *Bobby*. As a matter of fact, it was only a few months ago when I decided my crush on him was futile. Now that the summer is closing and my friends and I are spliting up to go on to different paths, I look to him again, and wish I had a chance to tell him how I feel.    I have contempating talking to my family at the father's house about it, but they will probably think it's a bad idea. One, *Bobby* is older than I am. Second, most of them think dating when you aren't seriously looking for someone to marry is a bad idea. Third, our relationship would be long distance... which I've done before.   I need to sleep on this...  ambler
