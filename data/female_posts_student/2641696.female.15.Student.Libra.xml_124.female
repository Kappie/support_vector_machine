The Minshall family is a bunch of quitters. Deal with it :D   Mostly I bought jewellery.. *shifty eyes* I'm trying to find the PERFECT RING to replace the one I lost. I haven't actually succeeded yet... but I have found lots of  other  rings that are nice and pretty ^^;; I also have billions of bracelets, too. Cool, ne? I am pleased, to say the least. And a nice cross necklace, too. I haven't turned manic-Christian, don't worry :P The cross has been around a long time before Jesus. Everyone seems to forget that. You know Odin was hanged and nailed upon the Yggdrasil and speared in the side, too? Way before Jesus ever came along? And he was  sacrificing himself , no less! Now does that sound uncannily like plagiarism, or what? He has the coolest nickname ever: Lord of the Gallows. Neat, huh?   YAY LIBERALS WON!!! And I'm not sure -- but didn't the Green Party get a seat? HOLY SHITE was it not just absolutely hilarious / terrifying when the Marxist-Lennonist party was AHEAD in that Mississauga riding?!?!?! My cousins live there... *cries* *falls off chair laughing* *is confused* That was just... strange. In your face, Harper. That's for believing your own press!! He thought he'd get a  majority , the eedjeet. I have no patience for imbeciles.   This election also brings to light why proportional representation would so totally work better than first-past-the-post. Bloc Quebecois had 12% of Canada's vote. They got 54 seats. The NDP had 14% of Canada's vote. They got 19 seats. How is that fair?? grr. Of course the Liberals don't want pro. rep., because then they'd be even worse off than they are now... lol. Least they won, that's all I can say. lol, I saw this sign advertising Harper in Quebec City, and there was some pretty crazy (funny) grafitti: a Hitler moustache, and the words FASCIST scrolled across it. The Frenchies might be voting for an idiot, but at least they know Harper's worse. *big grin*   Among other things... I can't actually see my blog. IE is screwed, and Mozilla, for some odd reason, isn't showing my blog past the song lyrics. Blah. So, if anyone is writing anything on my chatterbox for whatever reason, that's why. And yes, ei is Caleigh. I think I'm worse than A on all counts, BTW ^^;;; Mwahaha! Go screw yourselves if you don't like it! All my friends love me, and people who aren't my friends I really don't care about, to tell ya the truth... hee, and if it wasn't Peter and Timur, I'm sorry =D Although knowing what I know about the two of you, you can hardly blame me for assuming, ne? (even if assumptions are bad) (so I'll apologize for assuming) (but not for assuming it was YOU TWO) (if that makes sense)   Did you know Chateau Frontenac was like its own city?? We stayed at the Auberge St. Pierre, but jeeeez. It was huge. And there were these two cute juggler guys on the first or second night there, too. Which was cool. I think they were students. I still think Montreal is way prettier though; Quebec has a great old town, but outside of that it's pretty normal. Long live Montreal!!   And then we went to... Chevralier or something? Anyway, we stayed at the Richelieu hotel. It was an hour away from an awesome whale-watching cruise, and that was just unbelievable. We saw an insanely huge amount of whales; a blue whale, too, the largest whale in the world and the first sighting of one this season. Woo! Out at sea for 4 hours though... it was damn cold. And the fjord (forget its name) was just beautiful, too. I don't think my da took enough pictures *pouts* He keeps insisting on  people  being in the picture, and I think that's just ridiculous...   We also went to see the St. Anne Gorge (or canyon)? I had no idea my dad was afraid of heights!!! It was hilarious. 3 suspension bridges over some of the worst white water in Canada, in this huge canyon... it was beautiful, and terrifying, at the same time. *shudders* I think we got some good pictures though. And I walked 400+ steps to be I think 9m over the river... *whew* but I beat my dad! Who works out like every weekend! *cheers*   My mum and my sister are doing an exercise and diet regime. I'm in shock. I feel very left out. But also proud, because I will never ever be caught dead eating a grape fruit, you freaks.   Other than that... I love my dog, she's wonderful and the best. I can't speak French for beans but I'm getting better. And I hate sitting in the car. :P A la prochaine!
