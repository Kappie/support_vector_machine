Serves me right - i didn't actually respond to anybody's emails, just tucking the info in the back of my mind. I'm sad, however, that I've missed Eleanor's last evening in town before going back to Colorado on holiday. Hope you have a great one, Eleanor, and I'll see you in November!   The Zizanie people took great care of very lost-looking me. Their regular musician, a kind of one man cover band/entertainer hauled me in from outside, sat me at the table onstage, and got me some drinks. It was great just sitting back listening to the music and chatting with him and his friends during the set breaks. Thanks, Sylvain, you're the best!!!
