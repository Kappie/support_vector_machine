We didn't have school on Wednesday! so Tuesday night, me, Julie, and Logan went out to eat! then Jarrod called me and wanted us to come to Brenton's house! so me and Julie went, but that didn't go over to well AT ALL!!, but to say the LEAST I'm severely pissed off at a CeRtAiN person, but they don't care, so why should I... but its kinda cool how they talk to someone they don't know yet say two words to me!.. I was being mean to Jarrod (unintentionally) while we were there cause I was so pissed off, and He thinks I like hate him!(SoRrY JaRrOd! I LoVe YoU!~) but moving on...  so Wednesday, nothing good happened really!, went out for Lunch, went to Wal-Mart, thats about it!!... We got report Cards Thursday! mine was actually pretty good for ONCE!!! all A's and 1 B, but the B was in Honors English and its a weighted class so, its really an A! I have an A in Algebra 2! YAY!! =), but anyways... I talked to Josh last night! We got into a *VeRy* deep conversation! I'm Still very confused about it all, but anyways... I have to go! i'll holla at yall! *bRiT*
