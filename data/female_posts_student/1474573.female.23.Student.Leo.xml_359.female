Oay so this guy keeps hitting the balls outta the park and people are going WILD!  But then you've got all this commentary from Reggie Jackson that has like, absolutely nothing to do with what's going on at home plate.  So I'm watching this guy go on and on and saying shit like, 'Ay, conyo!' when he gets an out.  All the while, he's never giving up...  15 Home Runs later and Miguel Tejada has set a new record... and I have to say, I was like, PROUD.  It was funny!  I NEVER watch baseball and I'm actually watching this little Dominican guy (actually, I don't know... IS  he Dominican?) hit these balls like theres no tomorrow.  That was kinda cool.  Yeah, I'm totally corrupted.  I watch football, golf, and now, Home Run Derbys.  Shut up, Q.  Stop laughing at me.  I know you're secretly giggling.
