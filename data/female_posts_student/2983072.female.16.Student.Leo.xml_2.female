Then when it moves  she she's all like "oh crap it's alive..and it's connected to that loud annoying creature that feeds me." Then runs and hides. She's probably part dog too. We don't waste money on expensive toys and stuff.. Oh no just crumple up a piece of paper and play fetch with her. I think I could probably make her roll over and play dead too. Though I highly doubt that she'll be playing dead after she runs into the wall...again..she suffers from chronic stupidity syndrome. I wonder if it's contagious...        I stink..*sniffs armpit*   This is what massive amounts of homework do to me. I refuse to take a shower till I have finish it all. All about 15 pages of math problems. I haven't even changed out of my pjs. It's times like this I wish I had a loving caring better half that would tell me I look great even in fuzzy pants and a sweat shirt. Sadly all I have is my weird cat and a 6 yr old brutally honest smart mouthed sister.  I also have a brutally honest mother. Acocurding to her I smell like onions. I beg to differ.. I prefer garlic. Think of it, my own artificial vampire repellent.   Hoo-yeah!! No vampire getting close to my neck... unless ofcourse it's spike...hehehe yummah...Speaking of yummah, just finished watching pixel perfect last night *coughforthethirdtimecough* and have once again agreed that the guy that plays Rosco is the entire reason to watch that movie. So excuse me while i take a shower, plan ways to stalk and kidnap him.    Muahahahahaha   fear your short rabid fan girl as she is now sitting on two text books to reach the key board comfortably.
