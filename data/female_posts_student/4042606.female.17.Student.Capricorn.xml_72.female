I have decided I will let everyone know why he is called "Mute". When I first met Ian, we were with five other people, only one, Ian knew. His name was Rich, and he introduced Ian to everybody. We went out and walked around an talked all night, yet, Ian would walk beside us and remain silent, but, It would seem as if he was in the whole conversation. My friend made a comment about something, and I looked in at Ian, and he gave a brief reply about the subject. When Ian spoke everyone remained silent to listen. Ian has always been like this, when he first meets people or is around people he is unsure of, he will remain silent or mute, and take in all the information that he can get about people. Then always at the needed time, he will speak, only for a short time. And when he does, everyone listens. That is where Ian's nickname "Mute" comes from. After that night everyone called him Mute.
