Have you ever noticed that the more you want something, the more unavailable it becomes?  And that what you don't want is so tangible you just want to strangle it and make it go away...  Okay, so that was (a little) over the top.  But I feel so...  so... I can't explain.   Surrounded, confounded, emotionally dumbfounded...   Right now I want so many things at once and I can't identify anything.  Everything is bleeding together.   undefined   kind of like me.  I don't even know who I am anymore.  I never would have imagined myself this way...  And yet somehow I'm strangely comfortable in this skin.    *Ranting...*  I don't know what else to say.  I feel like I could write for hours on empty words and meaningless cliches.  But once I start I know I won't be able to stop.  to the one i'm singing for: "you drained my heart...and made a spade."
