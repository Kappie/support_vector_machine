I went and sat in the senate yesterday, watched an actual Q.P in the HoC....and yes, Day, Harper and all the crowd was there. So damn interesting. I thought of you Dana!!!   But it was the coolest thing...centre block is the coolest. Dana..can you teach me some more french??  Anyways...this is awesome. I can't believe this.
