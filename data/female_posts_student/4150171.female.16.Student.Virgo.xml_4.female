Well not a real vacation but it sounded good. I don't really know what this vacation is going to consist of, but hopefully...     - No Work     - No Driving      - SOME SLEEP!          Today is the first day, my mom woke me up at 7 to take her to the train because she was running late ( every morning she is running late)!! I can't say I was surprised even though she told me last night she wouldn't..... Today I planed on laying around, and Watching some TV, which I did. Some people don't really care that your on Vacation, especially when they want there computer fixed......      I don't think this Vacation will last another day, Ive realized I like being tired and getting up early. I love the mornings. I was kinda weird not to work today, Its been a day and I think I miss it.       Some good things did happen, I saw TopGun, which is one of my favorite movies. My brother Jay called, we talked awhile. I never really get to talk to my older brothers, its almost like they don't exist.        Happy August 9th, and HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY Erin Kalisz. I love August birthdays!
