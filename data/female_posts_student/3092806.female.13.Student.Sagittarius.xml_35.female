Not because of any physical exhaustion placed on my shoulders because of a long days work. Nope, I barely move from my computer screen all day long... No, it's this entire situation with my EBGF that is really driving into my skull, it is emotional and mental exhaustion in which I am suffering from. Ah, I promised that I would not write about it in this blog... I will not break my promise... No more shall I write about this dreary subject. I shall switch onto my other blog, 'The Conceited One' and write about my horrible, haunting thoughts on him. That is if I have enough energy to type anything down... Ah, I am so tired... I just wish that my eyes would close. Hopefully, whenever I fall asleep I will dream.     Usually my dreams are ones that concern great horror and/or mystery... Only once in a while will I get a dream that is completely pointless in meaning. Personally, I hate meaningless, pathetic dreams... My most remembered, pointless dream is one that concerns a boy from school, a glass of water, and some ketchup. It was completely ridiculous... Yes, I prefer different dreams... Of course I don't enjoy dreams that are filled with terrible events occurring or weird things happening. But hey, they're better than nothing.     The only dream of mine that I have ever truly liked was the one where this clown came to my neighborhood and taught all of the kids on my street different circus tricks... It sounds pretty lame but it was awesome... We did this enormous human pyramid where the person at the top was twice as tall as a two story house. I actually saw myself in that pyramid. I know it sounds pathetically stupid but seriously, it was fantastic. Yet, that dream, too, ended up in a mystery. Yet, it sort of ended in a good way. It was like the ending of a dramatic movie.     Oh, I've wandered off into my silly ramblings about my dreams and such. It may sound that my "dreams" sound more like "nightmares", and it's true, they are much more like nightmares than dreams. However, I rarely have any dreams, much less any good ones. I'll call them what I want to call them and you call them what you want to call them... Ah, I have been deprived of sleep too long... My eyes are slowly beginning to shut... I'm off to bed... Mayhap this time I'll actually get to sleep.
