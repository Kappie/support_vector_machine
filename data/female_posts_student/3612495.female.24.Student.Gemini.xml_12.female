So, no more mood to study. But the last one on 2 July, bad, it is Management, very difficult, as before, I like this subject very much, but now I hate that one.  I really want the examination pass quickly, I want to play!  今日我什麼都没有做過，我真的好想努力讀書，但總提不起勁。因為下一個考試會在6月29日，而那一科係測量，仲要可以睇筆記及書呢，更加無心機溫。但係最後一科會好驚，係7月2日考，考管理，好難的，我本來好鍾意這科的，但現在好憎它呢。  好想好想快點過曬考試，那麼我可以去玩啦﹗
