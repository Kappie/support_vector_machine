What are you supposed to think of people when they obviously lie to your face? Are you supposed to believe everything that you hear? Who invented popcorn? Mmm... there's a lot of psychological stuff that people don't pick up on, gets a bit annoying though. When some one asks to borrow a pen, are they actually asking for a pencil? Well not... but inuendo in a way I guess. Hmm... And what are you supposed to think of people who obviously lie to you? Do they not respect you or some crap like that? Aargh school's too hard, it's too hard to try to understand people. (How the hell do you do that?) *...guess?*
