Isnt that like entirely possible? On another note Easter we have to go to my step dads aunt and uncles place...that should be interesting,and loud, and full of insults! No lie! And I just got my new bed/futon,very pretty and soft. Now im all moved into my new bedroom with my sister instead of my aunt. Jody just sent me pictures of her prom! She looked so gorgous! Well g'night everyone!
