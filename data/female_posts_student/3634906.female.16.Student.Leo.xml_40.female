AHHH but also its going to kick ass because its going to be, myself, my daddy, kevin, jamie, travis, amanda, chadd, his friend, ellen, and maybe mariah. (chadd and ellen are veronicas children) im excited to meet chadd and excited to get to know ellen better because when we were camping i was rather shy and didnt really talk to her much. so i really hope tomorrow is successful and if its not i'll be sure to give y'all the LD (haha) on it and dish up all the dirt.  today/tonight has.... guess.... SUCKED!!!! i have been so bored. i actually watched some old movie on the oxygen channel because im so bored. oh well i guess everyone has a day that sucks ass and today takes the cake from all the rest. but you know what i forgot to put on here... its rather exciting... i finally talked to boz!!! i havent talked to him in forever so it was nice to talk to him. and hes ungrounded!! YAY!! but im bummed because hes been for like 2 weeks now and i never even knew... WAHHH he said that he has tried to call me but we discovered that hes been calling my moms... opps... that tends to happen often. so im hoping to hear from him soon because i miss him a bunch. hes my buddy, well one of the many, but still hes fun. better than most the people i have been associating myself with lately (i.e. chris, josh, and pat) they all hate me now. oh well. im sure they will get over it. i attempted to fill out some of my applications today! but i didnt really get anywhere. as much as i really want/need a job i really dont want to have one, at least not until my birthday. so im kind of pushing it all off. and yet im like basically everyone works, why am i being so stupid? i always complain about having nothing to do so why dont i get a job and make some money and not be bored. why not kill to birds with one stone? because im freakin' LAZY!! surprise!! i bet you didnt know that. haha oh well. my mom isnt really on my case yet so once she is then i will break down and finish all these applications. but i need to go now... -gabby
