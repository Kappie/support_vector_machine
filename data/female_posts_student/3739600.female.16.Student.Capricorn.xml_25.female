In a few more days Gary will be going to Missouri, this is Clayton and Mikes last year of high school, in a year and 5 months I will be joining the army, and so much more is to come very quickly. I am so excited yet I am kind of scared. Excited because I will be able to meet new people and see new places but scared because old friendships will fade! It's amusing how others say, "no, we will be friends forever," and then time takes it toll  we don't even realize the other one exist! I know for a fact that the career I am getting into is going to pull me away from everyone here, even away from my mom....It's life but even if I never speak to them again, I will always love them(including Gary!). Friends are going to leave and sadly so will I. It is going to be very hard to grasp that concept when the time comes but I know that the memories when have made together are always going to be stuck in the back of my noggin'! I wanted to go back to one thing though(and I know Clayton is going to get mad at me for this but oh well), Gary. I when I included Gary, I meant to say that, yes, I still do love him with all my heart. The thing is that, we broke up because of my father, not because he was a bad person nor was I (at least I hope not). We were in high school ( I still am) and we are still growing up. No one knows exactly what they want until they mature and widen their horizons a little. So yes, I can honestly say I still love him and I always will. Even if I find someone new he'll always have a place in my heart with his name on it! Just like Gaby, Mike and Clayton!           Much Lov, Brandi*
