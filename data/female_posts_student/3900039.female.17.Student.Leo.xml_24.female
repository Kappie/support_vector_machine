My good friend Justine also just made a blog... I'm beginning to think Jacob is a trendsetter... before you know it, everyone will be blogging like crazy, but I hope not. I wouldn't be able to keep up. So tonight I'm going to go play bunko with my friends at St. Joe's. Should be fun, I love that game. I might stay the night at Heather's, but plans for that have not been finalized. Gabe, my new friend from Washington, is supposed to be emailing pictures today of us up there at Forth of July. They are supposed to be super good...we will see. I hope I get to see him soon.
