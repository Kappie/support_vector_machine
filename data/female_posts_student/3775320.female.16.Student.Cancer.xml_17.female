       
       The past clings onto me, unwilling to leave me be.  I don't want it.  I just want  tabula rasa .  Just go away!  It follows me everywhere.  Like a David.  Don't want to meet it.  Unpleasant does not begin to describe it - it terrifies me but I'm stuck in my mind with it.  I'm stuck in reality with it.      Which is why I'm forced to stay anon-.
