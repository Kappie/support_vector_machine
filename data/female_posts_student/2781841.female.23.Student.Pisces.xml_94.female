I cheated a little bit, I took out "Coffee Sandwich" by Bob and Doug McKenzie because it's not really a song.  Anyways, here's my list:  1. Beastie Boys - Intergalactic Planetary 2. Andy Kaufman - One More Song for You 3. Lorne Elliot - Gonna Get Granny Plastered 4. Kevin Ramessar - Giuliani 3 5. Tegan  Sara - Time Running 6. Cake - The Roof is on Fire 7. Pedro the Lion - Bad Diary Days 8. Me First And The Gimme Gimmes - I Would Walk 500 Miles 9. Caedmon's Call - The Only One (this song will be deleted soon, anyone want to buy some CDs?) 10. Steve Taylor - The Moshing Floor  That was not very representative of what I usually listen to, but that is probably because it was a 10 song sample of a collection that is over 2000 songs...  The stuff I've been playing most lately has been more like this:  1. Damien Rice - Cannonball 2. Ben Harper - She's Only Happy In The Sun 3. Polyphonic Spree - It's the Sun 4. Badly Drawn Boy - A Minor Incident 5. Sarah Slean - My Invitation 6. The Beta Band - She's The One 7. Lou Reed - Heroin 8. Carla Bruni - La Derni√®re Minute 9. The White Stripes - There's No Room For You Here 10. Bright Eyes - Bowl of Oranges
