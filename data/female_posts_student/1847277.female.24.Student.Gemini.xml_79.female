I'm using the time to study for my Ancient India final, which isn't until next Wednesday, but I have my Ling take home final before that, which will no doubt eat up the entire weekend.  So I found out yesterday that you have to provide your own blue books for final exams here at Michigan.  How cheap can a University be?  Not to mention that the policy totally invites cheating, especially when the prof. provides study guides with possible essay questions.  Ah well.  Not my problem, I suppose, although I do have to get to one of the bookstores and buy some.    I passed prelims.  I realized I didn't post that yesterday.  And yes, I'm glad, but I'm not surprised.  After I saw the exam, I figured they had two options- fail us all or pass us all.  And obviously they weren't going to fail all of us.  But, as I have been lamenting to anyone who will listen, the fact that the faculty was just like 'Hey, you passed, no strings attached, good job,' with no other comments, well, that sucks.  Did I do particularly well?  Or poorly?  The way it stands now, I feel like most of the faculty probably didn't even really read them.  Maybe that's how it always is.  But if so, damn, we were less stressed than the previous cohorts, and we still put way too much effort into it.  Anyhow, I suppose I ought to get back to the studying.  Maybe I'll add more later.  Oh!  And last ling class today.  Yippee!!
