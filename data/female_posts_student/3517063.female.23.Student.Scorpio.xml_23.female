She pushes the blinds back from the window so that the sun shines on her, and on my bed.  And like my cat, I suddenly become sleepy again, since there is nothing more stupefying and relaxing than the feeling of sun on my face. Unlike most people, who jump out of bed when the first light hits their eyes, I curl up into a ball, and go back to sleep. Sometimes, Kissy leaves her spot by the window and curls up next to me, and we sleep until the sun goes behind a cloud.
