I'm in school, inside the computer lab and was thinking of using the computer to upload the last samurai images into the imagestation album and guess what? The screen says,  IMPORTANT NOTICE FROM IMAGESTATIONSony ImageStation is currently unavailable for use. The site downtime is only temporary and is part of our ongoing efforts to improve the ImageStation service for your better enjoyment. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. Thank you for your continued support, The ImageStation Team.   Gosh!  to think of what i intended to do...  so i've decided. since i am here now, i could just add a new post here.  well, there's no much to say, though. yesterday i was so damn angry in school. for reasons i cannot disclose becos i do not want to de zui anyone. But one of the reasons was Mrs Lim. Okie, I spent one whole afternoon, arranging my chemistry file and was very satisfied with it. and then she comes along and tell me that i have to arrange them according to Cheng Rong's content page. HEy! I hate to do things other pple's way and i esp. like to arrange my files in my own way! so i asked, can i just add in the content pg, confirm that everything is inside and then instead of arranging the file according to date, arrange it according to chapters. She says no! Until then, i was really unhappy, and then there were other people who gladly want to piss me off! By the way, fel sent me a message showing me the way to imagestation where she has all the shatec and class picts there in her album, wun to see. go check your mail. (hahax..toking to myself) This morning saw the lists outside general office, one abt 'o' level english oral, the other one abt prizes. me am going to have the oral nxt friday, which is, 13 august, (hope its my lucky day), very scared ah! the other list is abt pple who get the best cca performer and top results. of course, various cca chairmen got the prizes, cheng rong clinched abt 4-5 top prizes, veron got higher chinese, zixian got eng, michelle cheong got eng literature. still got hu? cant remember lah. but there were a lot from we 4/3. Oh yah, this coming friday-6 August, will be our school's National Day Celebration, until now i dunno wats going to happen. But i noe that after that 32 out of 40 of our class are going to Bugis Seoul Garden and then to watch the scary movie, The Village, while i will be at the National Dental Centre, pulling out my two wisdom teeth....argh terrible. Going to the dentist is inevitable, becos there is already infection going on at the back of my mouth. good tt i cant go to seoul garden and so on, cos tt would be $10 for food and $8/7 for movie. But then, going there means you will be going to a class outing...(well, it seems more like a class spending/eating than outing..hahaz but hu cares?) wateva. but i couldn't change my appointment. there were too many pple doing dental surgeries, and it was very hard for me to get one in the first place. furthermore, i could have needed to wait until after 'o' levels, but that would be risky. who knows what would happen in between?  okie, i guess i hav to go off now, time-4p.m, (i was visiting my books and reading msn grp, and sending things at beatgreets...throughout the typing)  Dunno when i will have the time to update again..maybe after i've plucked my teeth. but i usually update once a week. no broadband and have time limit larh...  okie realy got to go. bye bye. before i go, let me add some picts... stupid. got problem posting picts.  really gtg. time 4.30p.m liao!
