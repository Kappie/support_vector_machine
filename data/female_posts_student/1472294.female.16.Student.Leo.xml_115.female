With stings too. *scary* (*_*) One was drowned in the toilet bowl, two are making lovey- dovey around the lamp RIGHT above me!!! The other is circuling inside the lamp in the living room, going to be burnt to death.... I am so scared, I was interrupted when I was so- called studying and now, so- called typing.........
