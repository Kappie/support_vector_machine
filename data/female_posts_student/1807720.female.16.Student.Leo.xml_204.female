Only one teacher nominated me last semester, and to get the award you need three nominations, and I got the award and this year they gave out pins too so now I have one of those.  I worked so hard for that.  All the years effort, hard work, and frustrations paid off for what I wanted really bad.  Chels wouldn't talk to me again this morning.  I didn't do anything wrong though and I never did anything that would make her mad. I am so confused.  I don't know what I did wrong, and well if she keeps this I'm not-talking-to-you-thing up then I have a feeling we might go the entire summer without talking to each other.  I don't want that to happen.  We promised we would be best friends forever, and always lifelong friends.  We don't even talk anymore.  I am busy with things and other people.  She has to realize that I can't spend 24/7 talking to just her.  My world doesn't revolve around her and she needs to understand that.  Bio was really bad today.  I studied a lot for that test.  I study a lot for all the tests.  It was confusing, hard, difficult, and frustrating.  Not to mention it felt like I was in the middle of Hawaii cause the heat was like blasting from the vent near me.  There wasn't enough time for the test, and well I tried to finish it but she had to start class and well I didn't want to keep writing it.  I got confused on the long answer too.  I blanked out or something, it just didn't make any sense.  I know the stuff though, I just don't know how to explain it.  The chart thing we had to interpret made no sense to me.  That was the most frustrating part of all.  It's very very very frustrating knowing that you studied, put in effort, and tried really hard and then you feel like you bombed the test.  It makes you ask: What was my effort for?  Why is it I work so hard and doesn't pay off half of the time?  Why is it that people who study less then me, sometimes get way better marks then me?  I wonder, I wonder, and I wonder.  I will forever wonder I guess.  Why this and why that.  I think I actually got like 0 on that longer answer, seriously I think I got a zero.  I am so scared to see what my mark is.  The last thing I needed was to bomb and test to like totally bring down my mark before finals.  That is the last friggin thing I needed.  Sometimes I just wish things made a little more sense, and weren't so frustrating.
