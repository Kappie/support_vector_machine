Only now do I see his reasoning and only now do I appreciate that I only stayed until 12am, since what fun is it when you're half dead from fatigue? It was a gem. I enjoyed it, to say the very least.  So I'm going to squander away another afternoon for the choir concert. We're supposed to check in with "Moriah or Mari," and I automatically know who I'm going to report to, hah. I'll bring hw and Rain of Gold, which is actually pretty good. Typical Latin American kind of literature, in the storytelling style, full of strong emotion.  Road test tomorrow, yay.
