It was one FRICKIN MINUTE until we won and got a shutout......ONE MINUTE.  And that goal was a terrible goal, it was so easy for Marty to block.   AAAAAAAGGGGHHHH!!!!!!  Oh well, yet another TIE for us.  At least we didn't lose.  So the game ended 1-1.  After that, me and Brittany watched the MTV New Years Eve Party which was kinda boring for a little while....until they had this free style battle of champions thing.  One guy was named "Reign Man" and the other guy was named "Wreckonize", and they were all battling for the world title or something.  Anyways, "Reign Man" was kinda funny but a little mean and so was "Wreckonize" but then in the end, "Reign Man" was really mean because he started rapping about how W's father left.  It was awful!  So me and Britt went to MTV.com and voted for "Wreckonize" 20 times.  And he ended up winning so we were happy.  Then we watched the ball drop and we toasted with Coca-Cola.  We then decided to tape ourselves getting ready for 12 o' clock.  We were REALLY dumb.  We weren't even drinking alcohol and we were acting like we were drunk.  So when the clock stroke 12, i broke out the sparkling grape juice.....oh man don't drink too much of that stuff, it wires you.  We were spilling it everywhere and i was chugging the last bit of the bottle.  And we have this all on tape.  AND we were dancing.  Then we went outside and popped poppers and mini firework things.  And then we toasted to the Pacific coast.  Then we drank some more sparkling stuff and we went upstairs to watch my favorite british comedy that i now have on DVD, Coupling.  If you have never seen Coupling....omg you need to see it.  It enlightens you on the differences between boys and girls.  Its hilarious.  Yeah so anyways, today, i'm probably going to do nothing and then eat black eyed peas for good luck.  Love you all, hope you had a great 2003 and an even better 2004!  Happy New Year,  ~~~Taylor~~~
