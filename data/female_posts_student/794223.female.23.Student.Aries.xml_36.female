My grandparents and I drove down to see my aunt and two cousins in East Bernard (about 60 miles west of Houston), only to find out that my younger cousin Brandi (22, about to turn 23 on the 30th) was in the hospital.  She has had numerous migraine headaches since August, and I had assumed they were due to the enormous stress she's been under with her job; she teaches 21 4th graders in a very low-income area outside of College Station, and she had no break between graduating and the start of her new job.  To our horror, they acutally weren't migraines at all, and they were not due to stress; the CAT scan she had showed an "abnormality" of somesort, along with possible fluid around the brain.  Her MRI clearly showed the reason--some sort of mass or tumor at least the size of a walnut on the left side of her head.  What makes this entire situation inexcusable is that her father, my uncle, died two years ago of a massive heart attack.  It is far too much for our family to be handling right now.  What scares me most is not so much the idea of her having brain surgery, which is already terrifying, but the inconclusiveness regarding the actual tumor.  She is a 22 year old girl--people that age never have random brain tumors!  We can only hope and pray to God that it's not canerous, which would more or less be a death sentence.   So this year Christmas sucks.  Christmas was a miracle day...so I'm praying for another miracle; we need it.
