P.E was okaayy.. did conditioning once again cos' our physical fitness test is just around the corner! *eeks. 5 rounds.. and total 25 push ups and sit ups. then hadta' run another 7 rounds.. but penny ang said 2 can le. =) *hug hug* so nice. discount until so much. =P later.. english lessons.. quite boring =\\ physics was quite fun.  mr chin  likes to play with us. chinese was monsterous, since  liu jian  is always here to condemn and lecture us.   Bio was damn slack. we have a new teacher.  mrs chen . it was like a TPI lesson. she intro herself. made us intro ourselves. do some worksheet about ourselves. then write a list of friends + a word to describe them. asked her quesn. took up 2 periods.  viola , skl ended at 3pm. yay =)  Went home with  kalyn ,  ruth  and  yulun . he wanted me to go to westmall with him to buy puter parts. said tt if he didn't have enough $$, i can be his ATM machine. * tsk . couldn't find his stuff. boo. hmm. forced me to wait for the 173 bus with him. wait for sooo effin long. that yulun ah... he knows me too well. he knows tt i won't get angry with him, will always forgive him and can put up with his nonsense. he's like.. the one who can really make my day.. even when i'm damn depressed.. his  clone  conversation (inside joke) really cracks me up. oh wells, enough about the maniac. very tired.. gonna eat dinner (: tc guys!
