She may not be acting like it right now, but in all honesty, that's her deal.  Right now she's way too caught up in her own life to be able to see past it and into yours (or mine, but once again, not quite the point.)  Truthfully, I really haven't talked to her enough in the past month to really know what's going on, but I do know that yall are in love and that's just not something that fades away that quickly.    I do know that making a big deal out of Abby's lack of insight is not going to make the situation any better.  Just don't obsess about things that don't matter in the long run.  I promise you, girls think about things a lot differently than guys do.  With us, we can do anything as friends that guys would perceive as a "date" or whatever.  I promise you, Abby would never in a million years do anything she thought would hurt you in any way.  Is she in an incessantly bad mood right now?  Yes.  Is she able to see past her own problems right now?  No.  I've pretty much faded into the background the past month.  Remember her calling you and telling you that I was completely ignoring her, blah blah blah?  Yeah, right here, right now.  I haven't really talked to her in forever it seems like.  But she's still my best friend and I still love her.  I do understand the whole feeling of despair, though...quite unfortunately.  And I'm really sorry you're back feeling that way again.  That's sucks infinitely.  But listen to me: you aren't doing anything wrong.  If anything, you're doing stuff that is very right.  You've been there for me when even Abby couldn't be.  You've loved me when I couldn't love myself, and forced me to look at things from your persective.  You are the perfect boyfriend, the perfect son, and the perfect friend, even if most of us can't see it all the time.  You are my brother, Josh.  I look up to you and respect you more than any one else I can think of.  Your advice and compassion and support has gotten me farther in this world than I ever dreamed possible.  I don't know what I would have done these past couple of years without you.    But please, Josh, don't let this get you down into another Leigh Anne situation.  It really shouldn't- there's no Leigh Anne situation to pull you down, only your perception of one.  Every couple goes through rough times; this is just one of the rockier ones that yall will eventually either through and be closer than ever before.  Don't be ashamed that you're feeling the way you do- just know that not everything is exactly the way you think it is.  You are so awesome, Josh.  Thank you so much for coming tonight- that really meant a lot, especially since my family couldn't be there.  You have been so wonderful to me over the past couple of years- I'm not sure I'll ever be able to thank you enough or repay the debt.  Knowing you has changed my life, and I'm so grateful it has.    If you ever need to talk, you know I'm always here.  My door's always open, my phone is always on, and you are always welcome.
