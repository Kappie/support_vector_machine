This is not what I needed.This is not the way I wanted to see  Felicity: stuck in a bus with a bunch of girl-next-door and boy-next-door  American's whose rude obnoxious feelings bubble at the surface, reinforcing the  stereotype of rude obnoxious American.     I say please and thank  you,I follow the tourist guide, I put tokens inthe oxygen boxes at  the memorials. I..I don't want to be here. The first vacation I'm taking alone  in 6 years. The opportunity of a lifetime. But. It's. not. There is no  opportunity. It's preplanned, prepackaged, sanitized, homogenized. It's empty  and meaningless and I'm surrounded by the kind of people I was trying to leave  behind.        The tourist  trade hasn't opened up on Felicity yet. The immigrant logs areclosed  andprospective visitors are still going through background screenings  prior toreceiving a visa. The only transportation to the planet are  military ships. Our days are planned and measured, recorded and examined. I had  not met a Felicitarian that didn't work for Travelers Aid until I snuckout  of the hostel and bought a ticket for the Rail.         Felicitarians...is that even what thesepeople  call themselves when they are at  home?
