I miss the sweets, especially twizzlers, samoas and  urlLink Dunkin' Donuts , in particular my medium french vanilla with milk  4 sugars! )c:  I'm making it through though because although he doesn't agree with it, my boyfriend was sweet enough to stock me up on my clear american black cherry seltzer.  Although it has no nutritional value whatsoever (0 cals, 0 carbs, 0 sodium and 0 sugar) its soooo good!  It helps with my sweet needs.    Anyhow, I've been on the diet since monday and by tuesday I was ready to quit, but I tested myself last nite and I'm in "moderate ketosis" (where your body starts burning its own fat for energy) and I should be full on into it tonight.  This morning however, I was feeling particularly down and since I'm a glutton for punishment I weighed myself.  I was so nervous getting on the scale, but there it was in crisp black numbers:  I LOST 4 POUNDS! .  Needless to say thats helped get my spirits up.  I just want to take off about 15 lbs and then I'll be happy.  Once I get close to my target weight I'm going to start S L O W L Y putting my carbs back in and kickin' it up a notch at the  urlLink gym .  No one really cares about this stuff, but its my blog and I can write what I want.  :p
