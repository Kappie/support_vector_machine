Since last week's entry I have contacted the University of Central Florida's Human Resources Department and the Equal Employment Opportunity office on campus as well in  regards to the discrimination issue I am currently facing at work. When I paid a visit to the Equal Opportunity Office the person I needed to speak to was out of the office therefore I was instructed to email her.  Unfortunately, I emailed her an hour after leaving the office which was on Tuesday June 8, 2004.  It seems apparently awkward that she did not respond back to me by email after I contacted her by phone the next day which was Wednesday June 9, 2004.  Should I take this situation to another individual whom has an authority position within the University or should I seek Legal Services.  I personally feel that it is purposely being overlooked by the individuals whom are aware of the situation because no one has made any responses to my contacts nor my fellow co-workers who are following the same procedures as oppose to getting advice.   I am terribly moved by this situation and feel that it is going to be pushed under the rug because our voices are purposely being ignored.  I think if someone from outside of the University were to take a stance and mention this situation to the director of the facility there maybe a chance to resolve this issue or maybe even get a record going on the supervisor.
