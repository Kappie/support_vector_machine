I spent my morning fishing out clothes and wringing them out, and taking them up to the bathroom, rinseing and wringing, rinsing and wringing, and finally hanging them outside to hopefully dry. I hated that. My hands were all dried out, so now I've gone through almost a container of hand lotion to make them smooth again. Finally. Until then, like, no clean clothes, unless Mom feels like using the Laundromat again (yeah right). The fixer dude is coming on Wednesday. A week. Damn.  I took the kittie out for another walk today. She likes me moer, we don't fight as much now. We've grown up so fast :)
