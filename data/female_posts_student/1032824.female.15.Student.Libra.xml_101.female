Anyways, have you guys seen ' The making of the Lord of the rings ' on Channel news asia just a while ago? It was incredibly nifty! I absolutely cannot wait to see it in the theatres. *Girly screams* I'm glad my parents are returning home from their business trip tonight because i need some cash urgently. They didn't leave us with any money when they left for China. *Sniffles* But i survived. Ooh yes i did. Mwaha. Then maybe i could catch the movie with Val and all.
