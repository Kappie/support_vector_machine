It's pretty stupid of me, but on Wednesday I went downtown with Ashley Aikens and met Adam. Jason has been trying to hook us up, but I finally met him that night. He's extremely attractive. On Thursday I met up with him and wing night and stupid Mitch wanted to leave, so I ended up going home, but yesterday we went downtown and I hung out with him all afternoon & saw "The Village". That movie was terrible, but seeing Adam was lovely, we talked till somewhere around 3 in the morning. My mom got pissed that I was still up and made me go to bed. My dad's tiny fuse was lit this morning and I'm grounded for a week, but I wanna sneak out. Because last night Adam said I was amazing, and that he wasn't sure, but he's definitely interested in something with me. I was so happy, so if I want to see him at all this week, I'll have to sneak out. It's kinda weird liking Adam, because I worked so hard to free myself for Wes. Josh even knows about my crush on Wes, and he's like "Leela, you'll so have a chance with him, be upfront about it and just tell him. I know Wes, trust me, He'll go out with you". So I dunno, now there are two boys in my life...this is nuts  beyond  nuts. I'm going to have to wait this one out and see what happens. Adam's going to teach me how to drive and when his friend gets to town he said they'll come and pick me up, I hope I don't get caught, hehe! I just woke up now, and it's 4:30, haha nice, I'll go eat breakfast.
