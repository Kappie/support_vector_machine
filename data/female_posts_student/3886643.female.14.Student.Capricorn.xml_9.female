Then i had to get my lazy butt to the Kernersville YMCA...i mean, how much better is it to start ur day off @ the Y?...Well I worked out n that crap there after gettin a memebership...That place is crazy kool....Im sorry to say, but it was better that RCC.  After that i just went to my mom's b/f's house n played Grand Theft Auto 3, and chattered away to people on the internet....Thats about it, Nothin Excitin'..SoRrY!
