Let me share with you how i think of my birthday before i forget anything. i tend to foget things, always. Duh ! Early morning, since 12.01am.. i started to receive sms from friends like eric fong, li chun, tai min, connie, roderick,and a net fren nicknamed "shemtam^leikei" ( don simply think ar..he's a apek in his thirties.. not the one whom i wan to make a birthday card )   I was touched ..even though those sms doesnt really cost much, but they bring the best wishes. I do feel good, it's just that "feeling" which i always believed in. U'll definitely feel soooooo gam dong when ppl get up or stay awake at 12am and have that idea of sms-ing ...even though that sms costs only the most 20cents..argh.. donno how to express better in words ( i owes forget words i want to use -_- call me "chi dun" ) haiya, u know what i mean la.. hehe .. we so fren already, no need to explain too much, right?  I dont get much sleep this few days. I wonder why. When it's about time, i always get into the bed and start to dream.. but cant get into sleep ler, i always think up and down.. till i really cant tahan in bed, i'll just walk downstairs and watch tv or online.. writing my own diary. I've this own habit of writing a online diary since.. donno when. Just found out that i've got alot of things to express but lack of listeners lor. So , you are proven true. Very true. Keep things in heart. But dont worry.. i'll sure kacau and "fan" u with all my problems till u cannot tahan.. About your charges.. forget about it la.. we sooooooo fren already, no need talk about cash one..hehehehe. Hmm, perhaps one day, i'll let u see the diary of mine.. only if u are interested. It's okay for me.. i guess. Cause i know u "watch mouth like bottle" .. ï¹•P  About the pizzahut part, it was fun. I never talked so fast and crap so much..The jokes might be dirty, but as long as everyone is happy..i'm happy :D But i think my wallet is going to cry cause i seldom use my own money ..today didnt get money from my dad cause i know they had already spend alot on the food.. so i better shut up and curi curi take my own money from my angpao >.  Well, late afternoon, my heart was filled with disappointment. I felt as if they all pakat to fool me cause everyone sms-ed me telling they are not going to turn up. The worst part would be they are not turning up and yet they didnt give me any further notice. That's bad, isnt it? I dont mind if they're not coming, but at least they hafta tell me earlier.. so that i can save more money from the food.. the food sucked my blood..But since everything passed, so let it be lor.  One surprise thing, Amie Pang. hahahaha.. she's really a funny girl.. also kiasu type..likes to bug the teacher for marks.. but very funny. Very "real" person.. not a hipocrit, unlike some others lor. I'm not really close with her.. But i'm surprised tat she phoned and drop by to give me that present. Feel like "dui bu qi" her.. shouldnt had tel her it's my birthday.. so that she can save more money.  At night, i can feel as if i'm crazy. I told my ah ma that all 6 boys are my boyfren ! ahah ! stupid act !  One more thing, thanks for sharing everything with me.. I'll strive hard for Spm this time. i'll try.  good night and enjoy your holiday in kuching ! dont be haunted by the memories, okay?   i'm not good in words, but i supposed u can understand me la. haiya ! reply your letter liao.. this time i crap too much la.. hahahhaa. i'm going to keep this email as part of my diary, so that i wouldnt need to re-write my diary lor. lazy hor?  Smile always. AhBit.  p/s : wei loong dint come ! actually i expected him to come .. cause my birthday is only the best excuse to meet him up.. i haven met him since year 2003 ! sigh. Take care.
