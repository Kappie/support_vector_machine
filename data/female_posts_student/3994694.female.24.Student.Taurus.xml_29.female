And now it's 18,000.  And I appear on google if I search for my blog title, but not if I search for the contents in my blogs.  Do you think people would really be searching for something that had both 'thoughts' and 'kaili' as key words?  Seems odd.  Anyway, if you are all real people, welcome to this blog... please comment (but don't spam!) on anything, old or new.
