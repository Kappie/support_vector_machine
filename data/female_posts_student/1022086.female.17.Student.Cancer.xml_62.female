How the crap did All State get here so quickly? Moo. Uhhh.... yeah....    Okay, I think I need to pack now.   *waves and runs out*  This song makes me happy... Not sure why...  "Life's Gonna Suck"  by Denis Leary  This is a special moment right now We'd like to tell all the kids at home To send their parents out of their room This is the kids' song  Life's gonna suck when you grow up, When you grow up  When you grow up  It sucks pretty bad right now  If you know the words, sing along!   You're gonna have to mow the lawn,  Do the dishes Make your bed You're gonna have to go to school until you're 17  It's gonna seem about three times as long as that!  You might have to go to war Shoot a gun Kill a nun You might have to go to war when you get out of school   Hey, cheer up, kid, it gets a lot worse!  You're gonna have to deal with stress Deal with stress Deal with stress You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war    Santa Claus does not esits,  And there's not Easter Bunny You'll find out when you grow up  That Big Bird isn't funny Funny  Funny Funny!  Life's gonna suck when you grow up,  When you grow up  When you grow up Life's gonna suck when you grow up It sucks pretty bad right now  You're gonna end up smoking crack On your back Face the fact You're gonna end up hooked on smack  And then you're gonna die!  And then you're gonna Di-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ieeeeeee!  HEHE!
