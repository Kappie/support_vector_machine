Also, I went out with a kid and dumped him. Yeah, that's it. Tonight I'm heading over to Kassidy's. Lloyd is @ her dad's. I don't like blogger.com. In fact, it's just as bad as AOL. Whatever. Anyway. "Dog" business. That's over. School has pretty much been the same. I can't stand math class. I have softball everyday from 2-5. I hate the phrase: "Woo..hoo!" I have been listening to STROKE 9 over and over again the past week. I stare at the ceiling and listen. It's a crazy world. Radiohead is fucking awesome. I like "High and Dry". In fact, that was my favortie song a few summers ago. Yeah, so tomorrow I have to wake up bright and early to go work at a crab frestival or something. This is the annual fund raiser for school sports. The freshman sball team has to go. Rick(coach) is bringing doughnuts. Yum. I hate corn. I like Doritos though. That's mighty good corn. I don't understand how someone can know someone so well yet at the same time be so confused and feel separated from them. I guess that makes sense if you know what I mean. What the hell is wrong with me anyway? I hate it when people act shallow but I do it myself b/c I'm afraid of getting fat. The end.
