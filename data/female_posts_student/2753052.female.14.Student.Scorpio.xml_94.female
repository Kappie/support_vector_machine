So yeah, Molly Ringwald is hot, or rather used to be, and I'm going to Detroit on Friday and will be back Sunday afternoon, with lots of clothes that (woot!) actually fit. And no, I haven't outgrown my old ones, they are too big, thank you very much. P.S. My boobs grew! P.P.S. Laura's taking out all the fun...and if chu get upset and say I'm mean I'll beat you with a salmon! XD
