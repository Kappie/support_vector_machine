Perhaps I’m a romantic, or maybe I’m trying to protect my fragile heart. I want to believe that people have a foundation of good, but just make bad decisions sometimes. Is that being naïve? Is this why my expectations of men seem to be so out of reach? Does the “Prince Charming” actually exist? Can a man fall to his knees; profess undying love without losing his masculinity, without classifying him as weak or too emotional? I wonder if we’ve bred a group of emotionless men. Teaching them eagerly not to cry or express their feelings openly, for what? Perhaps, to make the perfect alpha-male? And, what’s that anyway? Why are we encouraging men to become more aloof and women to become more independent? Perhaps in the end everyone finds what they’ve been looking for; but what if the person they are looking for doesn’t think they are the “one”? Is this possible? Is there a flip side to the soul mate theory? Could I possibly be everything a particular man wants, but he isn’t quite what I am looking for? What a miserable thought. And all I can keep thinking about is that my confusion will only tangle a deeper web as I get older…
