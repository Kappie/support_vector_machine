I keep thinking about chem.  cause well I want to good on the unit test but I can't just snap my fingers and all my balancing will be amazing and everything will go well.  I can't just make that happen.  I think Ashley knows I am not doing well in chem and on msn she was like well couldn't you be a Social teacher or and English teacher instead of teaching Science.  Yeah k like NO.  I felt kind of bad after she said that though even though I know it wasn't meant to be offending in any way.  I have to follow my heart.  I can't just give up my dream.  I thought about giving it up this morning, but God that would hurt me way to much to give it up.  I when onto the U of C website and looked at all the diff. courses I could do and the things that I could study.  Everything turned me off and just totally disinterested me.  And well I know I am pretty good at Drama and like being on stage and acting but I don't want to do that for the rest of my life.  I want to teach Bio.  Of course now that Chem and Physics are ruled out...yeah I will make sure it is BIO.  But I have to pass chem and I am worried right now.  Then quizzes are only worth about one mark but the unit test is worth about ten.  Either my mark is gonna go up or it is gonna go down.  And I mean I can't get it out of my head now...I mean I FAILED.....FAILED DAMN IT.  I didn't try to fail, that was never my intention.  See that is why I am sooooo confused right now.  How could I want to be a teacher and stuff and love science and stuff but not be good at it?????????....  I would give anything in the world the understand and just get an amazing mark on that next test.
