BULLSHIT! plus he didn't tip and it was like a $60 order and he stood over me the whole time telling me that his steak better be cooked med. rare and i better check it before i box it up (he told me that at LEAST 5 x's!) so ya i'm sure the managers are pissed at me and i'm probably gonna get in trouble just because this guy was a dickhead...yay a lovely day in the neighborhood...n e wayz, nothing else really went on, tomorrow i'm visiting my grandpa, then babysitting my cousins until 3:30 when i have to head out to go to work, sunday i have to work 9 hrs...i'm a little worried about safety day since no one will call me back but ya know, i guess i'll keep trying...n e wayz i'm tired so later...Randi
