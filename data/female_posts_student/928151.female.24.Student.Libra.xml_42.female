It's not that the Scales enjoy being late, it's just that they take their time to decide anything in enough time to make it anywhere. They may make you wait, but Libra is a great friend to have. They can charm the socks off even the stodgiest of people, and, as their friend, you'll never be able to stay mad at them for very long. Libra hates being alone, so expect your friend to be a bit demanding of your time and attention. They'll make up for it, though. Libra will be able to talk their way into the swankiest restaurants and hottest clubs. If you ever need anything, they know exactly who to call, and the person on the other end will feel honored to help them out. Even if they do need to stand in front of their closet for hours, whatever they wear will be in perfect taste, and you can count on them to help you look just as chic. Don't worry if your Libra buddy seems a little down at times. They'll leap out of that soon enough, ready to take on another fun adventure. Best Friend Bets: Leo, Sagittarius "
