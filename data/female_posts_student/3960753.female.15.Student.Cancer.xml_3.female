Won’t you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well I’ve been thinking about you day and night and I don’t know if it will work out right, but somehow I think that it just might, if we try.  Faces come and faces go in circular rotation. Something yearns within to grow beyond infatuation. Won’t you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well you’ve got me standing deaf and blind, cause I see love as just a state of mind, and who knows what it is that we might find, if we try, and who knows what it is that we might find, if we try.  Were walking different directions from most people I’ve met. You’ve given me signs of affection I don’t usually get. I don’t want you to pledge your future, the future is not yours to give. Just stand there a little longer and let me watch while you leave.  ‘Cause when I see you on the street I loose my concentration. And just the thought that we might meet creates anticipation. Won’t you look my way once before you go and my eyes will say what you wanna know. Well I’ve been thinking about you day and night and I don’t know if it will work out right, but somehow I think that it just might, if we try. Somehow I think that it just might, if we try. Yes somehow I think that it just might, if we try.
