See, it doesn't take a lot of effort to get me back on track! Care more people! Love, freedom! (Oh dear she's gone hippy like!) Whoops, sorry! Heheeee any way! Now that I'm happy, I'm happy! Like hypeeeeeeeeeeeer happy! Yeay let's go take over the world! Hehe... heh... maybe not! Aaargh, having a war with this advert that keeps popping up and I keep getting rid of it! Ha! I won! Uhuh... quite scared. Time for bastard music therapy! Go download it if you haven't. (What you haven't? I've talked about it about a million zillion times!!!) Don't let the bastards grind you down - The toasters, you might have to just search for 'toasters' on Kazaa cause that's what I had to do. Now I have it on disc and on the computer! Yeay! Funny, we're only 14 and every one takes every thing really seriously. Aaargh advert wars again! Hehe, I have a Halifax pin number now! But no dudy card! :'(
