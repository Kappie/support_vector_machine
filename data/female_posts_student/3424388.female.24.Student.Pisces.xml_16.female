My grandmother lamented that the photos she was taking would not accurately depict the waterfalls that we were slowing drinking up with our eyes (we were deliberately loafing, considering the steepness and length of the stairway we had to climb to get out of the valley and back to our cars).  My grandfather agreed, but said that sometimes photos can make places appear more grand than they truly are.  It was a delicious moment; and me, the uber dork, took advantage of it and started explaining virtual reality to my grandparents.  I mused that soon we'd be able to (almost) fully experience the sights, sounds, smells and feels of far off places.  I think they got it, but I don't think they much cared.    Of course, I guess I don't much care about my grandparents' work (other than it's relevant to their lives).  And it makes me sad, as sometimes I wish I was interested in something that they could teach me.  It would no doubt mean a great deal to them - to pass some skill or knowledge on to me, but I have no interest in becoming a homemaker like gran nor becoming a math teacher like my grandfather.  And I think they feel useless, knowing that I'm interested in this "new-fangled and mighty expensive" pursuit of technology.    Of course, this little vignette is representative of a larger societal change.  As the old are not as useful to us as they used to be (I know that sounds harsh, but isn't it true?).  It makes me think of the Chinese and how they so revere their elders, presumably, in part, because they believe that they can learn so much from them.  As the Chinese modernize at a dizzying pace, will their traditions stick?       There is a reverse (in regard to age, and thus experience) of the traditional teacher-student (mentor-apprentice or boss/peon) relationship in our society.  What will this mean for our corporate compensation system (in part it means that unqualified but entrenched workers get jobs they have no business getting)?  Certainly we've seen a bzillion start-ups created by young workers.  I think of my own discontent with 9-5 life, and the bureaucratic stupidity that often accompanied it, and I wonder if the traditional Dilbert office worker will soon be an forgotten icon of this generation (we can only hope).   Or perhaps Dilbert will be shipped off to Mauritius?   Here's a dismal related thought - as medicine improves, what happens as our bodies hold out longer?  Will our brains be able to keep pace, or will we walk around like fit and trim, though mindless, vegetables?     P.S.  When I misspell bureaucratic, as I inevitably do, the suggested spelling I'm presented with is "backwards."
