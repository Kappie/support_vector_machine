And Kate Winslet is great in it.. and so, so attractive. Although she quite aptly illustrates the kind of girl I'fe really been trying to get away from... Childish, demanding, fluctuating kind of fucked up character. Hmmm.   Oh Jesus, I have an exam tomorrow and it's making me feel sick. The only exam I'll pass in my current state is one on procrastination. I've spent the entire day chatting to lovely girls on gaydar that I'll probably never meet or fall in love with and suffer embarssing humiliation and sitting in the garden reading crap magazines. How constructive. Oh, now I've made myself feel guilty I'll go and get on with it and return later to ramble some more... :)
