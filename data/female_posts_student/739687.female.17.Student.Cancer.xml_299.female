But I should bite my tongue and knock on wood before saying that, because every time I think nothing's going wrong, something always does.  It's kind of my luck. My life makes me faithless rather often. And then when I go to hang my head, something good eventually comes about. But as soon as I get optimistic, something comes and knocks me down. A vicious cycle.  Now you see why I'm a pessimist. Because optimism will only kick you in the ass.  I've learned that the hard way a thousand times. Never be sure of the good things in life, because they'll come and go before you get a chance to truly take hold of them. It's the bad things in life that are certain to hang around.  See you later, crazies.
