He's in my head 24/7 literally. I wish I could climb up ontop a building on a busy street and scream like a corny idiot "I love..So and so:P" Names need not be mentioned of course. I want to marry this guy and love him for the rest of my life. He makes me feel so beautiful..Not just on the outside but on the inside. He makes me feel as if what I feel and what I think truly matter. He helped me find my voice! God I love you!
If I could stare into his eyes right now Id whisper I cherish you! Id hug him till he could not breath! He'd have to pound me on the shoulders as if to say I Cant F*****ing Breathe!!!! Our relationship thus far is only described in one word...Magnificent! We clicked so quick on all the right levels..Its always been so exciting and wonderful. I love the sound of his voice..OMG its the sexiest most mature beautifully toned sweetness of any man I've ever met..His thoughts and simple phrases ring and echo all day and night. I think he is gorgeous..Funny thing is we share features..But to me that's like finding a diamond in the rough..A soulmate for life. We are too good to pass up..If I had to Id track him down 30 yrs from now just to  say I never stopped loving you..I would! I just love this man so much. I had to come in here and vent it out! God I love him!
