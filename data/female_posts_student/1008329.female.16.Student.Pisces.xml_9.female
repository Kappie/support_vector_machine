Laura Ramos is "absent". :-P PoOP! I feel really sick right now. My eyes are all watery and I look high. My nose is all sniffly. I've been sneezing and coughing. It's a wonderful life. I need vitamins...  Yah know what's really cool? Old music. Alternative, some pop. Stuff from the mid-to-early nineties and before. Like..Blind Melon, Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins..all those old favorites.   Ahh "Cat" is very annoying. I think he thinks I like him just because of one time I took advantage of a situatioN(no not what you're thinking, sicko). So..I hope not. Let me clear this up. If you're reading this...I don't like you. HAHAHAHA.   Uhoh. I have nothing really to say and the teacher said we need to finish these by the end of the period. So LAtEr 4 NoW..... x0x0x0x0
