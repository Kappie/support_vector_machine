All I did was tickle his arm a little, and he pulls away from me and just sits by himself on the other side of the couch. So I pulled away from him too and sat on the other side in a ball of Nina, watching  The Matrix: Reloaded , and being annoyed.   He gets like that, and I can't touch him, and he just walks away from me and won't talk to me. It pisses me off, I hate it.   Grrrr  //fumes  In other news, I'm dead fucking tired. I need to sleep tonight, I can't get three hours again, I'll die. Ugh.   Bed time soon...  //wants to sleep so bad but can't.
