Allen, his cousins, and I went out for a beer run. We came back to the house and got drrrrrunk. Seth and I had a nice little conversation out on the back deck while smoking out. He's a great guy. Came back in, Henk, Seth, and Nick decided to head out; as with Allen and his cousins. Mike and I chilled out in the basement for a few. I passed out. But woke up to most beautiful sight in the world. Baise. And the rest is a drunken interpretation of love and history.  I picked Josh up from his place and we went over to Mike's this morning after breakfast at Denny's. Mike's dad is such a dork.  Michelle and I went to Tim's open house. We bought him Position of the Day postcards and a little mini book on sex (which makes a distinct moaning noise when you grab it the wrong way, which Michelle and I found out quickly at the register) The open house was pretty fun. Random ass kareoke machine blasting the Beach Boys. Yeah, it was cheesey. But David, Pete, Elizabeth, Ayana (sp?) and Gale hung out with Michelle and I. It was grand. I had to head out and get gas and drop Michelle off before going to work.   Work was a blast. Riiight. I was busy the entire time. It was ridiculous. Then the tech meeting was an ongoing travesty in itself. I don't really know why I was even there. We filled out these little worksheets about how we want things to be, and how things are. It really pissed me off because there was a question that asked something like, "My boss gives me extra training when I request it." Or something like that. I was so pissed off! I wrote 'no.' I'm not scared to get fired, and it's not like I wasn't going to be honest. I was just ticked that she would ask such a question, knowing that I requested to be trained for tech support. So what did I do once I got out of the meeting? Dropped off my application at Starbucks. Go me.  I have more room cleaning to do. I have more waiting to do.
