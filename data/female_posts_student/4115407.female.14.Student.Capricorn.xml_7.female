I mean that is too much, i want well i think i wanna have kids, im not sure about that, but if i do i want to have them in my early 20's, and i cant do that if im always in school, but i am not having kids after 30, 30 is the limit. But i think i wanna be open to other things, i wanna find sumthing that i wanna be happy doin. I wanna love to go to work every moring i dont know im just confused.
