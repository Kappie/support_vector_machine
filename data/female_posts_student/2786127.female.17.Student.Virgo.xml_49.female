I feel like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulder. Its strange but when things are okay with Lindsay and I, it just feels like...the world is okay...but if things are bad, when it rains it pours.   Today was okay. I can't believe its the end of the year already. Can't say I'll miss it though, this year sucked ass in a major way. I'm hopeing more then anything that next year all my girls and I can just have a fun year where all of us are single and hang out together all the time. No boys=no drama. Simple as that.  Maha! I have to go get my hair cut.
