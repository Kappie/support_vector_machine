He can make me laugh like no one else.  He is completely independent and doesn't care what the rest of the world thinks about him.  Everyone laughs at his hair, which is always going everywhere and he has so much of it that it turns out fro-like.  Alex is also pale.  A tan for him is considered a slightly darker shade than pale.  He is honest and completely reliable.  He can be very sarcastic, and alot of people take him way to seriously.  Alex can't dance either, and prom was the first time that he's ever been to a dance of any sort.    Spencer  is the one that everyone thinks he likes me or I like him.  I walk him to just about every class (since we have everyone together) and we just fuck around with people's minds.  It's fun.  I believe Emi has a serious crush on Spencer, and right now she is mad at him because he switched from her A.P. Pych, to my A.P. Gov.  Spencer used to have a crush on me.  I'm not sure if he still does.  But his laugh is contagious.  He's very cute.  He's a hard worker and he's sensitive, and on top of that he's really smart.  He's always someone I can talk to.  Spencer has a couple of talents, and they would be running (he's very driven) and math.  For some reason math comes to him like nothing else.  I hate him for it. =P   Nathan  is a guy that I have a hard time counting on.  I really really want to, but things aren't working out.  He has recently had his heart broken, and he's usually the brunt of all our jokes but everyoen has taken it easy on him lately.  He is like the "sensitive jock" of our group.  He plays football, and he informed us today at lunch that our team is ranked fifty- fourth out of fifty five.  I congratulated him on being on the second place losing team.  He grins.  Nathan is a ladies man for sure.  Everyone wants him, and it's understandable.  He is very hot.  He likes to skate by in school by copying off of al, spence, and I, but lately everyone keeps reminding him that he's going to college.  I really think he is smart.  He is very deep and interesting to actually get to talk to.  Sometimes I take that for granted.   Jason  doesn't drive yet.  He's still either riding the cheese-wagon or he's a car rider.  I pointed out that he was a senior, and he's gonna have a hard time keeping up with us if he doesn't have a a car.  He still doesn't care.  Alot of his time is spent playing video games.  One thing I've learned about him, is he will be there for you no matter what.  I can always ask him for help on homework and he's willing to help me.   Whenever we're at lunch, Jason gets two bags of two cookies.  I am special and I always get one.  =). I always feel special.  He is very shy and introverted, but we have managed to get him to come out a bit more.   Travis  is very quiet, but loves to laugh.  He's a prankster.  He will do just about anything you ask him to, if it includes throwing Emi's pea's at Nathan while he's pretending to be doing his prose passage in A.P. Eng 4.  He has really grown on me, as has his sense of humor.   David  only has two classes with us this year.  We always laugh at him becuase his favorite word is "fuck".  Everyone plays jokes on him just to get him riled up.  He talks smack and it's so funny.  We all know he won't mess with us, and he's just angry and wants what he wants.  David will get what he wants, no matter what.  He's got the girl, the car.  He would be someone that I would have thought was "unreachable" when I was a freshman.  He is super friendly and funny.  He is always lightening the mood.   Foster  has a blonde curly afro.   Everyone says he was born with a six-pack.  I don't doubt it.  He does 1000 sit ups a day.  He works for what he has, but he's got a nice body.  And on top of that a very nice brain.  He's as smart as Spencer.  He and I talk about Ben alot especially since he was in my chem 2 class where he was the topic of alot of conversations.  He and I have connected lately, and I'm hoping we can be better friends.  He's really nice, sweet, sensitive, loves God, reliable.  He's just all around a good guy.   Megan  gets made fun of by Alex alot, only because she's trapped in a dumb blonde's body.  She can act really dumb.  She seems lost in what she wants out of life.  She's lost in her search for God.  I have offered everything to her.  She knows that whatever I have is hers.  I have been there for her through thick and thin, as she has been there for me.      Emi  is my sister, and she has recently kind of become apart of our group.  It's fun, I guess.  Sometimes it's hard to handle, becuase of Spencer.  But life goes on.  Well that's all.  These are the people my whole day is spent with.  There are a few others, but I don't know enough about them to post...
