And that is mainly because I finally got to see Corey and wow he is about ten times more amazing when he's comfortably at home.  Home field advantage, I like to call it.  He had me all fidgety and nervous while he was completely at ease ... role reversal from TSA, people.  His friends were all nice, and apparently I had met them all at TSA, but I could only remember Trevor (who's being an anti-social bastard at the moment, not talking and all), so I felt sort of bad.  Sort of ... but not quite.  Anyway, we all went to this huge drive-in movie place and Corey and I were in a car by ourselves, and I bastardized his pure little self in a fun, fun way.  That I do not feel bad about.  Because it was  awesome !  Andy always tells me that when we kiss, he gets that tingly feeling, and I've never gotten that with him, but last night with Corey, BAM! it was there.  And I liked it.  A lot.  Didn't really watch either of the movies, but it was so worth it.      Other than that, this weekend had its highs and lows.  My sister, moody as ever, was a royal bitch all of yesterday and today.  I swear, I can only take like 5 hours of her at a time, before I feel the need to kill rise.  And her boyfriend is not the most entertaining of them all - Indian my ass.  He looks like a damn potatoe.  Highs of the weekend include Teresa letting me play with all of her Origins stuff (and she has lots, people, but I managed to use it all in about 50 hours of being there) and my mommy buying me stuff at the gigantic mall.  I felt bad about spending my mom's money, once again, but she kept offering and I fell in love with this black off the shoulder shirt ... so I took her up on her offer.  It's a hot shirt people, although I'm starting to think that maybe I should have gotten it in cream or pink, since I own so much black already.  Oh well, my bad.      I's luvs you's all'n,   Your Sweetest b.
