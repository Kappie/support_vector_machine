I said in the first class that I have crashed some computers and while that was in jest, I do seem to have a knack for getting the screens to do wild and crazy things.  Yesterday, I got my project's font to grow like Jack's beanstalk.  I havent' been able to get into my project at home and wouldn't you know it, I'm having another bad hair day!
