I hope it doesn't flood again... :-\  Other than that I'm happy, because Dell fixed my drive problem today.  The CD Burner wasn't reading or writing.  So, a computer guy came out and he swapped my drive for a brand new one.  :-)  It works again... probably better than the other one.  :-)  Anyhow, Melissa and Jennifer should be here in a bit, and we're going to do something... I dunno what... but something.  Jennifer wants to go over to Geoffrey's Toys R Us.  Dunno if I wanna go... what with the rainy roads and all... and I'm not exactly feeling up to visiting with a bunch of strangers.  I wouldn't mind seeing Druck and Ricky, though.  Anyhow... more later...  ;)
