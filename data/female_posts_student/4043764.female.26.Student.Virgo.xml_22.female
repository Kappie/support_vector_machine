She has three kids, a husband and is in graduate school. She is supermom. She was like, "I read your blog. Is this the same guy who put you through the wringer before?" Yes, I hang my head in shame for doing what I accuse him of doing: bringing drama to my life. I'm sure I'll be set straight the next time I talk to her. We've known each other since we were wee ones, and even though she's three days older than I, she seems to be infinitely wiser about how to release aforementioned drama.  Speaking of Mr Drama, boy called me this morning, says he got a message from me that was jumbled (I can't remember what I was saying honestly, I think it was something about the vacuum and some books). He would have called last night but it was too late - he went to the Prince concert with "co-workers". Second Prince concert this year. Bah, I do not like him when he tells me this. "Didn't you just see Prince in April?" "Well, yeah. You know I like live shows..." Whatever. But do you like Prince?  Oh, yes, I forgot to acknowledge the other person who made my day yesterday - shall I call her Aegyptress (this name might stick)? - when she gave me that bottle of Barbancourt (the one I probably should've gotten in place of that ridiculous boubou). It will be greatly appreciated in my new home.
