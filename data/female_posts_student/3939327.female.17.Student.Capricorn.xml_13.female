Thank you for visiting  urlLink www.freedonation.com  and  urlLink www.thehungersite.com  and many others. I am very blessed to have such great friends. Thanks for all your encouragements. You all have a place in my heart, and whenever you need me --holler @ me (you know my digits) :-P Thanks for everything.  "I miss the good memories and even the embarassing moments. Whenever I look back, my heart smiles, and as I reminisce, tears of joy fall from these eyes of mine. I feel truly blessed to have met you" -anonymous  My priority is always my family and true friends. My next priority is school. I'm crazy. I'm taking too many credits, so I won't be online as much, but don't ever hesitate to call me whenever you need me alright? Forgive if I miss your call. I'm still going to visit  urlLink www.freedonation.com  and every other sites linked to  urlLink www.thehungersite.com  daily, so I definitely have time for you. If you consider me a friend, then let me be a friend to you. Don't be stubborn, and you know you are.  Go Peace Corps!! Whoo-hoo!!
