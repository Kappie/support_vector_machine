I hate her for the simple reason that she’s so darn nice and intelligent and pampered that my father keeps on comparing me to her. Kinda mean of me, I know, to blame her considering it isn’t her fault if she’s nice and intelligent and pampered. But I have a basis for all this because we never really know if they genuinely agree to make friends with me or they’re just as Tupperware as I am. I mean, I don’t resent them per se. It’s just that we have this thing called id (individual differences, silly) and what is generally normal for most people doesn’t have to be normal to others. And that is basically my point, since they’re sooo goody-two-shoes and they’re sooo brought up very well given their guidance, their access to the wonders of technology not to mention that they’re SHELTERED AND PAMPERED, there is absolutely no fucking reason why I should be compared to them, particularly to her. I mean, she’s so fuckingly perfect compared to me who’s not even close. I mean, does she do the chores, does she get out of the house, does she even get out of her own room, and was she introduced to life’s cruelty at a young age, TELL ME. She gets a general average of 98 because she hardly leaves her room (only to have her nails done), no contact with society, hello?! Why should I be compared to her? Moreso, after you so step on my feelings by embarrassing me, humiliating me and ultimately crushing my self-respect, you expect me to be chummy-chummy with her. Come on, you’ve gotta be kidding.   This girl, I pay for her fare when we see each other by chance. Never once did she mention that I’m invited to her debut (although it’s a given) and that I’m supposed to play this so-so part on it. This is the girl you’re comparing me to?   This girl, whose motives are supposed to be nice and intelligent, asks me to pre-empt my excitement by opening the gift THEY gave ME for Christmas in front of her. Why didn’t she just frigging wrap it herself? She’s intelligent, huh?   I obviously want to go to this party. I’m like, ohmigod, I’m sooo excited. Yeah right.     nuninu     When I was in high school, I’ve had the privilege of being in the star section (you know, where the smart people are) for four straight years. But that never stopped me from mingling with the “little people”: these individuals who went to parties left and right, smoked as early as they knew how to french kiss and everything else. I mean, how else would I get the reputation of being “overly-friendly” now? These people who were supposed to have brains only they didn’t want to use them (because I believe that no one is born slow), looked at us as outcasts. They treated us like we had a world of our own. Well, what can I say, they were (okay, okay, WE were) a bunch of conceited brats, but we were self-reliant. We didn’t need them. We were multi-talented: we could sing, act, dance, play instruments, lead in the field of politics and military training (you name it, we had it), not to mention, some of my classmates were darn pretty, plus we excelled in our academics. There was competition, intrigues; everything of just about everything was there. It wasn’t really our fault we get placed in classrooms away from people. No wonder these narrow-minded bigots never liked us. They could, individually, but as a whole, they hated us. And I could understand that. They never thought of us as people who had fun. We were brains. I just didn’t expect that up to now, six years later, SIX WONDERFUL YEARS LATER, they’re still thinking that way.   Some of us got pregnant out of wedlock, tried jutes, got into bands but they still look at us as if we’re not human, as if we’re not capable of being cool, in their standards. Now that I look at it, since said standards are so fuckingly low and shallow, I never want to meet it.   I mean, think that way all you want, all your life. Get shocked when one of us falters, ignore us like a disease, ostracize us. It doesn’t change the fact that we’re humans, humans that ticked you off because we reminded you of how not-smart you were.    I thank you.     N.B. i learned to french kiss at age 14, smoke and drink at age 15. i learned to be really vocal about my angst long before i could write a whole paragraph. it's been 10 years since i graduated from high school and until now, some of the people i referred to in this journal entry still think of us that way. it pisses me off because they don't get it. they just don't get it.
