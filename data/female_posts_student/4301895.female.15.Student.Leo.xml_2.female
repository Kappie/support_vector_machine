It's our time To do what we want, now, when we want it They don't expect too much from us anyway Tomorrow will tomorrow Be today, today Anything that people way don't mean a thing 'Cause it's time for livin' Life is a canvas And the paint is hope and promise The world is ours No one could ever take it from us The sky is blue The day is new The sun is shinin' down You know life is good We got each other And that's all we need Hey! It's okay We can paint the world bright, any colour Yeah, coming back from nowhere or on the way Don't be afraid Just be happy that we're not our mothers Slavin' over papa all night and day The future is the future Que sera sera We can make some sense of it all When we get old Let's do something stupid Life is a real gas If you take the time to notice Let's live it right now 'Cause no one can live it for us We got the time The weather's fine The world is spinnin' round You know life is good In it together always You and me Life is a canvas And the paint is hope and promise The world is ours No one could ever take it from us The sky is blue The day is new The sun is shinin' down You know life is good We got each other And that's all we need Life is about us Just in case you didn't notice We're on our way now And nothing is gonna stop us We got the time It's yours and mine We'll take it on the run You know life is good In it forever, yeah just you and me.   ~A memorial to Danielle~
