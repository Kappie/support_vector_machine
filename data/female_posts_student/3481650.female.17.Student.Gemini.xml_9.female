That was really fun, but I'm pretty sure my hearing wasn't as good for a few months afterwards.   Right now I'm chatting to a few people and updating my July calendar. I made it because there are so many birthdays and I want to visit Alabama, so I need things to be clear.  Last night I spent at Megan and Kelsie's house with Stephanie too, and it was so fun. We watched Monster, which was surprisingly disgusting, but holy crap Charlize Theron is the greatest actress ever. Never be fooled by the ugliness she is able to portray in the movie, she is the most beautiful actress in Hollywood. Megan and I tried to watch The Majestic, but we got sleepy. Today we ate Chick-fil-A, bought Megan a strobe light, watched the "Outback Jack" episode Kelsie taped from the night before, got drinks from Sonic, and went to church. Oh yeah, we also shot off a few fireworks. I'm glad they had a lot of bottle rockets, because I didn't get to do any of those on the 4th. My 4th of July was pretty fun. I wanted to have a lot of people over for a huge water balloon war, but due to short notice a lot of people already had plans, or they had to spend it with their family. We still had a lot of fun. Afterwards we went to Whataburger. Later that evening, I went with Jessica, Tyson, Mallory, and Aaron to Shanna's house to watch the firework show. We were so close to the show, it was awesome. Then we hung out with the people who were there for a little while; I can only think of a couple who weren't from our church. They all left to go to someone's house, but Tyson was talking on his cellphone with Kelsie. So I, naturally, told him I needed something from his car, and Jess and I took the car on a short joyride around the neighborhood to relieve ourselves from the small party left on Shanna's street that was lacking in the enjoyment department. (Sorry, but that party is Mallory and Aaron.) After we got him going, we made Tyson buy us drinks from Sonic, and then headed for his house to hang out for an hour. I played DDR for the first time, it was a pretty fun game. It wasn't as hard once I really acted like I was dancing, rather than trying to step on the buttons when the flashing arrow hit the other arrow. I plan to get better at it. The day before, on Saturday, I applied for employment at JCPenney's and Target. I also got applications from Hobby Lobby and Chick-fil-A. I really want to be a hostess at Red Lobster or somewhere, though. I think hostessing (wc?) would be a much better starter job for me.  Right now I'm really hoping that I can get to Alabama before the end of July.  I'm going to bed now. Goodnight!
