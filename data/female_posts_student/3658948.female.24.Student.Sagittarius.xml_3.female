There's nothing in this for me. I'm a white male, I'm a white, male, married heterosexual -- I don't want the Democrats. Everywhere I turn, there's another hot coal in my eye. For example, today's DNC calendar of public events included lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender meeting, the disability meeting, the ethnic meeting, the American Indian meeting, the Asian/Pacific Islander meeting, the Hispanic meeting, and the African American meeting -- God bless 'em, they're entitled to their meeting, I'm entitled to my vote, they're not my party, end of story. And that's it. I'm not voting for a party of ethnic minorities and women and immigrants. I will not do it. And if I thought for a moment that they had changed their direction, if I thought for a moment there was a new Democrat Party that was more centrist and more focused on the real issues of today, I would have considered, well, maybe sitting the election out, or voting for Kerry -- no, I'm not.  ME: Obviously, not all Republicans are this fucking creepy. But why haven't any prominent Republicans made media statements disavowing Savage's blatant Nazi views? "I'm not voting for a party of ethnic minorities and women and immigrants." Who does this freakshow think he is? He's descended from immigrants. I guess you can't really expect any actual logic from pundits and radio personalities, but dammit, he went too far. What is even more frightening is that this guy has thousands of fans who are overwhelmingly young, white, and male. Thousands of 'em.
