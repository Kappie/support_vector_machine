My grandma made me shop for clothes (which wasn't so bad) but  I couldn't go in the bookstore . *ah!* And they wouldn't take me to Books-a-Million either. I "have too many books anyways." At least I did get a cool pair of tennis shoes although it hardly makes up for the possibility of another good book to read. To add to the "good expierence," I saw Josh's dad who speaks to me as if I don't know that his wife hates me (and all young girls) with a passion. Then I also ran into (not literally) Andy Hall and Chris. They were meeting some people to go to the movies with. I'm no longer invited to attend these "outings" (because they hate me).  And people wonder why I say I need new friends.  I need something to do. I can't stay in this house all night. Especially since Dad isn't working. *ah!* Well this is a sufficent amount of complaining. I guess I can go for now.
