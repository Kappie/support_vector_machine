That was SO stinking funny. Oh my goodness.  I was like HI mandy!! How are you? then everyone at my table talked way to loud..then just as a joke I was like "Emily, go give the phone to Aaron." Hahhahahahahhahahahahah  Oh, BTW, Mandy, Marc wants to know if your hot and Evan wanst to meet you ;)  Oh, and Lauren wants to know if your rich but why would that matter?!   Then tennis was pretty fun.  Until I started playing. I had to play like the top JV player and they were SO good. but the problem was, I knew I oculd beat them. Its just I would just not pay attention and the ball would zoom by my face.  So it was i think 7-6 (us winning) an di like started to have like an emotional breakdown right on the court. It wasn't like I was crying or anything, but inside I was totally bursting into tears.  It didn't make sense. I am positive God wants me to be on this team. But, its seems that if he wanted me to do this I would acctually WIN some and do good (its for him, isn't it?)  So I was immensly fruesterated.  Maybe being at the bottom of the ladder was getting to me.  Never winning a game was getting to me?  Maybe it was a person at school who would always rub my faults on the court in my face?  Maybe it was me?  So, back to my story.  So I just cryed out to him,  "god, if your here, which I know you are, hep me...HELP  ME"  And he did :)  We ended up winning by one point (which I made)  Which was a huge burden off my chest. But still...  "Why am I on this team, papa? I thought I was going to help spread your word around? But I haven't foudn the right person.."  Papa God just simple responded,  "Wait."  On the way home in the bus I overheard a conversation beetween a few girls. This one girl was saying how she was an atheist because she hated religion and she wanted proof god exist.  God was like shouting at me "Here she is, Laura!!!!!! I placed her in your life at THIS moment, do something!"  See, all day I had been thinking about what she had been thinking about...it was kinda eeire.   So I just sat by her an di was like "why do you beileve what you beileve?" And she was like "I need proof! I need solid evidence. Also, my friends have been shoving religion in m y face and I don't want to just go to some rreligion, I want a realtionship!"  I was liek YES! So I said..  "I absolutely beileve God is NOT a God of religion he is a God of realtionship, He wanst to have a realtionship. He wants to be your buddy. But, they rest, the proof is the hardest part. For that you just gotta have faith."  By then we were at the locker room so I siad "Bye, talk to you later!"  2 points for the tall one.
