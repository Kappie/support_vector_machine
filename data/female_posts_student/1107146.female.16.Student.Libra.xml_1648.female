That's subject matter for my own BLog, sorry all.   But yes, Coke just reminded me.  ABBY WAS THERE, YAY! It made my day. We talked to Loukimmel and that was rather interesting. But it was a good lunch, or in my case, fifty minutes of boredom. Until David Stanley asked if I could father Alex's children, to which I just sat there and thought, "that is the most random thing I've ever heard in my life". O well, kids will be kids.  Gonna go record afore ze sun, she sets. Tata buddies.
