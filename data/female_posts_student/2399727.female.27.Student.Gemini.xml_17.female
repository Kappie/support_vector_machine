Many of the other priests who I know and who cared for Fr. Pat were there.  Many more lay people, mostly older, but also some of the students, and a few families who Fr. Pat used to be friends with were there also.  The homilist talked about Fr. Pat's extreme holiness.  He didn't mention Fr. Pat's prayer and that surprised me - he always said goodbye by saying "May Our Lady cover you with the blue mantle of her love."  Despite my inability to understand him hardly at all on Dec. 4, I sure understood that when he blessed me as I was leaving him for the last time.  He extended his hand just a little and mumbled "blue mantle of love".   This homilist joked that he once said to a fellow priest, "I hope that I'm just a tenth as holy as Fr. Pat is."  His friend reassured him, "You are." (lol)   It was really nice but I'm not very good at funerals. :-(  More to come...
