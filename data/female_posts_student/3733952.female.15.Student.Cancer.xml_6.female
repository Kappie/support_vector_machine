Yesterday I had some people up to my lake. It was Jack, Mit, Chantal, and me. We had a great time. We went tubing and swimming and eating. We belched a lot and had fun talks. The tubing was the best part. We all fell off a lot. One time specifically... Chantal and I were on the lay-down tube, and Jack and Mit were on the sit-in tube. We hit this big wave and at the same time hit Jack and Mit's tube. As Mit put it: 'It was like Jack was the driver and I was the passenger. Suddenly Livi and Chantal came flying. It was like Livi hit the windshield and bounced off, and Chantal went under the tires....' Oh, it was great fun. When Chantal and I were on the tube alone, she asked the most hilarious random question. I was laughing so hard that I fell off the tube. I won't repeat what she said, but it was HILARIOUS.   Ok, enough with the happy.. onto the sad.   I was in marching band. But I can't be anymore. I have dance the same night as band practice. It may not seem to mean a lot to you, but it's really gonna kill me. I want to be out there performing with everyone else. I love performing. And I love being in band. All the people are really cool and the songs are cool too. They may be hard, but I need a good challenge. I'll just be sitting who knows where watching the band perform without me. Watch them move around the field playing Machine and the other songs. Watch them go to competition without me. Watch them win without me. *sigh* Oh, when the Saints go marching, I'll have to watch.   And in better news, I still get to march in a parade Saturday. That should be fun. Jack and Mit will both be there. We'll havea grand old time.   Sorry about my mood. It'll all be better next time.   Bye!
