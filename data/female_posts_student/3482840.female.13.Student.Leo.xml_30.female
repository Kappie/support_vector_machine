I've already seen the first 5 minutes of the movie on a Disney 411 Exclusive.  Andrew was at church again. He still ignores me completely and runs out of the building as soon as it's over. So I NEVER get a chance to say hi... :( It's not cool...  Julia also said that we can't bring back Knightettes unless we have a band, and she said we have to raise $1,500 before school starts. No offense, but she's crazy! At clinic we used CD's and tapes and played them over the PA. O_o? Oh well. If she doesn't even wanna TRY, more power to ya Jules. Still luv ya.  Well I'm chatting w/ some ppl so, I g2g! L8tr!
