Today Olivia and I went to McDonalds, then afterwards we went to Western Pet Supply, and there I got 8 golfish for a dollar. And also an underwater snail, which was free with the fish. I just got back from Dairy Queen. YAY! Two fast food places in one day, I'm healthy! :) I have to go and do stuff now, shee ya.  -Sierra
