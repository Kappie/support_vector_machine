All that matters is that one little moment in time when you are enjoying yourself. No one can bother you...... then reality hits you like a slap in the face.. yah well i hate that.. i was just begining to think about why im still likin erik and then all of a sudden 'kate, dinner'... im like damn it i lost my train of thought... o well.. just thought id share....                ~kc
