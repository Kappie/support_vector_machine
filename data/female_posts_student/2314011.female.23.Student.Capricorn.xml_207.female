Going to see "Laws of Attraction" in a few minutes with the gals; it will probably end up being a guilty pleasure, but seeing Julie be a silly lawyer is just what I need right now.    Speaking of Julie-s, I got my hair cut this morning.  Decided this winter that I would cut my hair way short for the summer.  Not too dykey, but shorter than usual.  And I decided my day off in between stressful finals and a week before the big three-day celebration in Bozeman would be the perfect time.  So, I put myself into the hands of my 50+ fag hairdresser and said: "Short and cute for summer"  and let him go.  An hour later, it was the scene out of Steel Magnolias when Julia gets her locks lopped off and makes Dolly Parton cry.  I think it will be fine, once it grows in a bit.  It fucking better.  It's not super short, but it's much shorter than I anticipated.  The back and sides are hot, I must admit, but from the front, I look like a 12 year-old boy.  Sigh.  Maybe the gals will know what to do.  And this is just a random update from  urlLink Neil's site  on the new book:   My gut suspicion at this point -- half way through it, I hope -- is that people who liked American Gods, but didn't like Stardust or Neverwhere probably won't like it, while people who liked Neverwhere but didn't care for American Gods will like it a great deal. (People who liked  Neverwhere  and  American Gods  are on their own.) I don't think it will be one of the books that wins awards, but it may be one of those things that some people love more than anything. I could be wrong about all of this, mind you. I set out to write a Thorne Smith novel, and I have no idea how close I'll actually come. My editor, Jennifer, laughed at the funny bits, and that felt good.   I loved both  American Gods  and  Neverwhere , so I guess I'm hosed.
