It's "When the big One finds you, may this song remind you that they don't serve breakfast in hell!"   *grins facetiously before breaking out into song*  "Hold the milk, put back the sugar; they are powerless to console! We're gathered here to sprinkle ashes  from our late friend's cereal bowl!  Breakfast clubbers say the motto that he taught us to repeat: "You will lose it in your gym class if you wait 'til noon to eat."  Back when the chess club said our eggs were soft,  every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft. Oh, none of us knew his check-out time would come so soon, but before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune:  When the toast is burned and all the milk has turned and Captain Crunch is waving farewell, when the Big One finds you, may this song remind you that they don't serve breakfast in hell!"  *whips out shiney/fingerprinted guitar (and green pick) and starts playing the guitar solo, ending the whole facade in a four-string G chord*
