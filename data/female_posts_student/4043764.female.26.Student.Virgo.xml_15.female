Because we all really talked but I, typical wild honey, sat limp, a Virgo slacker, waiting to jump in and clarify issues or divert topics altogether. During this conversation, though, we two new roommates discovered that our house is haunted - or used to be - by a woman named Louise. Her nickname: "The Duck."  Apparently, M, the roommate who's lived here the longest was the one who got everyone on the haunted house kick:  "Hey, there's something a little creepy about this place. I wonder if it's haunted." "Oh, come on, you guys, there's no such thing as a ghost." "Are you sure?" "Oh, shut up." "Come on, you guys, this is so not funny... what if this place  is  haunted?"  Blah blah blah. You've seen the movie...  Soon after, M takes a cab back to the house from the grocery store. Her driver says: "Hey, this here is Louise's house...You ever hear about Louise? Louise Acquaviva?"  So, that night, she heard a chair being dragged down the hallway. She whispers to Louise, "Please, just go away. We're living here now. We're not going to do anything to the house." Her roommate, "Are you serious? Are you talking to a ghost?"  Ever since, every cab driver in the area pulls the "Hey, this is Louise's old house. You know... it was ten years ago, the worst storm I ever did see..." Or whatever Large Marge said to PeeWee.  Every Sunday, the Duck - so named because of her quacking voice - called a cab to take her to the church two blocks from her house. The cab drivers hated her for it, but in typical Masshole way, kinda respected the duck for her quirkiness. And, I think, they still feel her presence.
