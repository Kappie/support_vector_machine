We were gonna see Master and Commander - ya know, the Russel Crowe one? Yeah, sold out. Of course. A Friday afternoon and it's SOLD OUT. :P   Which was :P but Debrands is always cool. One of those places where they fill up your water glass every five seconds.   I'm reading  The Book of Spies , an anthology of spy stories. It actually looks to be pretty good, and I hope it fills my Alias void. At least for a little while. Because two weeks is a very very long time.  I'm going to miss Elliot and Kelsey in art!! It's over and now I can't eagerly discuss Alias every other day. I have to remember to watch 24 again, that was pretty cool. The OC is horrifically bad. Really. That Ryan guy is actually pretty cute, but otherwise the show is ew. DAVID ANDERS ROCKS!!!!!!!! MWAH!!!!!!!!!!!!   And we must do Fiddler on the Roof for play! Because Victor Garber's gonna be in the TV version and he ROCKS. And DA tried out too, don't know yet if he made it. Must Google some more.  I'm off to see if Regina's recapped yet - cya later, all!
