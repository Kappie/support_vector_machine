Do I point at my punanny when I ask where the bathroom is?   - When people say, while watching a movie "Did you see that?" No *bleep*, I paid $8.50 to come to the theatre and stare at the *bleep* in ceiling up there.   - When people say, "Oh you just want to have your cake and eat it too." *bleep* off. What good is a goddamn cake you can`t eat?   - When people say "It`s always in the last place you look". Of course it is. Why the *bleep* would you keep looking after you`ve found it? Do people do this? Who and where are they?
