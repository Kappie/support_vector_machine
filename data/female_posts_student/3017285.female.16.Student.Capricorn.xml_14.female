She and Chel and carry where talking about something completely uninteresting, so I get my book out and read. And then when I went to get a donut she  hid  it! You DO NOT hide my books from me!! I WORSHIP my books. I pay money for my books. Someone spent months, if not years writing those words. You dop not simply TAKE them from me just because I am not interested in your conversation. But NOOOOO, according to leah, you either converse or just sit there and be bored.   For a while she pretended she'd thrown it away, because she "doesn't  like  books" WTF??!! doesn't like books? these words are incomprehensible to me. She also once said that she doesn't like reading because books are so inconvenient to hold, that she doesn't mind reading on the internet. we all read  Fahrenheit 451  in 8th grade, we're reading  Brave new World  now..can these people not SEE what they're turning society into??  riight..over-reacting now.....*deep breaths*   ok, I'm a bit calmer now. I'm still pissed at leah, though. *sigh* If only I had more friends.... ................ ANYway, go join  urlLink this  forum. It's run by Nicole, an online friend of mine, and it currently only has two members, her and me. ^_^
