Between Mozart, Sync Competition, Float design, Parade, Marching band etc etc etc every person I know is swamped with all sorts of stuff, alot of it useless (not Mozart - thats cool). This would not be a problem if it wasn't for this thing called MIDTERM. Now why on this green earth did the school overlap homecoming and midterm? I love being busy, but that is just nuts!   Why do we do this to ourselves? And by that I mean to do so much and to wear ourselves out? I feel that sometimes we should sit in the shade on a beautiful day like today (clear skies 70F) and have a picnic with our friends, and just enjoy life in general. We don't do enough of that. (Don't get me wrong, busy is good, but so is HAVING a life). Consider this a shout-out to all my buddies, and I'll give you a call in a month when I have a break longer than 30 minutes! No kidding, I have class, advising, work, class, band, parade, and then a gig tomorrow. Thats 9am to 10:30pm. I  guess I'll get some lunch and dinner... I guess. I look forward to the 8 to 9 hour work day WITH a lunch break. Wow, a whole hour for lunch? What is one to do?  "Live all you can; it's a mistake not to. It doesn't so much matter what you do in particular, so long as you ahve your life. If you haven't had that what have you had?... What one loses one loses; make no mistake about that....The right time is any time that one is still so lucky as to have....LIVE!" ~Henry James (1843-1919) The Ambassadors [1903]  That is an interesting thought... I sorta agree with it. I want to live and do good. I'm sorry, but to live and do bad just doesn't "float my boat", but its a free country, think what you will.   "Live and let live" ~Scottish Proverb  Okay... lets think about this proverb huh? Live. Okay, I take that as Live my life as I shall. "and let live". I'll take that as let everyone else live as they wish to live. WOW!What a concept... worry only about yourself. You know... that sure would solve a whole lot of problems in the college scene about "drama" and gossip. LIVE AND LET LIVE!  One more on life....  "Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact." ~William James (1842-1910)  I think that last one is great. Until later.... LIVE
