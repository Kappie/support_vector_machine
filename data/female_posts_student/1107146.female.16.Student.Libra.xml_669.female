I won't be able to tell the difference between all of them, tho, those silly, bleeding together EMO bands (disincluding me, of course).  Speaking of bands, read this, c/o Musician's Friend...the coolest thing I've ever heard:     "1973, apparently fried by a generous dose of angel dust, Keith Moon is unable to finish the opening show of the Who's "Quadrophenia" tour in front of 13,500 people at the Cow Palace in San Francisco ... all warmed up and ready to play, and wanting to make a good impression the first night of the tour, Townshend calls out to the audience, "Hey, can anybody out there play drums? I mean good. Any takers come up here on stage" ... 19-year-old Thomas Scot Halpin from Muscatine, Iowa, currently living in Santa Cruz, is in the audience at stageside with his hometown buddy, Mike Danese, who starts yelling to the security guard that his friend is a great drummer ... actually Halpin hasn't played in a year, but after promoter Bill Graham asks him if he can do it, he finds himself on the throne of his idol manning the sticks ... he holds his own for the final three songs, gets to party down with the band afterward, and eventually is named "Pickup Player of the Year" by Rolling Stone... "  How crunk is that?
