It was a good day.  A little hectic because last night I fell asleep, and obviously, did not do my AP Chemistry assignment.  Therefore, I had to fit it in during other classes (namely, history with the Kuehn Man) over the course of the day.  If I got you curious, I did get it done on time, but alas, she never checked it.  Darn my luck.  Oddly enough, luck is exactly what everyone seemed to be lacking at play today.  Betsy passed out and Joe S. got beaned in the head with a sword, all in the same day.  Add that to yesterday's trauma of Jeff bopping his head on the door frame, and one might come to the conclusion that this show is cursed!  Another bit of supporting evidence is that today, while backstage, I was talking to Aaron and he said the one thing you are never supposed to say!  I shall give you a hint...It is a famous Shakespeare play that rhymes with "Lick Seth."  Yeah, that one.  Well, I hope that the huge crosses hanging from my neck (remember, I am an evil nun) give me some protection because, from what I have seen lately, I am going to need it.  But then again, maybe I'm just paranoid.  *shrug*  At about this point, you're probably wondering about my odd-tasting burger comment up there.  (Not that the comment tasted like an odd-burger, but...well...nevermind.)  Yes, that plus the cold fries are what I had for dinner at play.  Mystery solved.  Read on, friend.  Well, it is currently quite late, and just getting home from school, I am naturally quite hungry.  Mommy left me some shrimp lo mein from Szechwan (my absolute favorite!) in the fridge and I almost cried I was so happy.  *yay*  So, I'm sure you can guess what I'm eating.  Also, there was a nice fortune cookie sitting there, and I took that too.  Hey, it called to me.  Anyway, it reads:  "Alas!  You are the apple of my eye."  In bed?  Nah, that one doesn't work.  Boooooring.  I leave you with Smock comic #2, since yesterday's was such a hit.  W00t.  A trendsetter I am.  Anyway, here you go,  mis mapaches .
