Tho she can be a lil hard headed and stubborn sometimes but she’s still my little girl. ALYSSIA!!! A very bright little three year old who’s smart and vulnerable. She’s cute and lovely and brilliant and very active. She’s into learning new things, books, making friends, boys, etc.    My three year old loves to get on the computer just to play with Elmo on sesame streets. She could sing her ABC’s, count from 1-15 and also count 1-9 in Chinese. Wow, my little girl knows all that huh. What can I say, she’s a natural, and she’s good like that.    She has just recently started preschool. Not just a regular ordinary day care but a real school. She gets breakfast and lunch, (and you sure know how good cafeteria food was, yum yum I could smell it already). She also gets computer game lessons and act in plays. That’s great huh?    On her first day of school, she was scared of the new environment just like anybody would. She was shy and did not want to see me leave, it was sad to see her in tears and it surely broke my heart. Hey. A mom gotta do what she got to do rite.    At the end of the day when it was time to pick her up from school, the teachers told me that Alyssia got into a fight with a little boy. They fought over toys. I slowly picture the scene in my mind and the first thing that I so wanted to ask was “WHO WON?” Silly of me huh? Its so irritating that she got into a fight on her first day of school. Bad Alyssia bad bad bad. The other kid wasn’t hurt or anything but his mom came and apologized for the inconvenience.     To make my story short, she’s a strong little girl and I love her more than anything in the world. I’m proud of her for being her because it slows me that she knows what she wan and will be very independent in life. Just like mommy yep yep yep.
