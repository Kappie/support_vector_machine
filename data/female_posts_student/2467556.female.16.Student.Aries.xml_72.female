Now i have to work on World History hw....oh joy.  in case some of you lovely people don't know, i'm taking the AP World History exam on May 5th.  Why? Because i signed up for it and my mom and mr. Dixon were like "Take it or die".  Oh but here's the fun part.  I haven't actually taken the AP World History class so i honestly have no idea what i'm doing.  Sarah said she'll help me and my mom is going to buy me this CD rom so i know what i'm doing.  Will i pass? i doubt it, but i might as well try.    This Friday, the movie that i've been waiting 3 weeks to see, "The Prince and Me" with Julia Stiles and this other guy comes out!!!!  I can't wait to see it! Because a) the Prince guy is hot, b) the Prince guy looks like Prince William, c) the Prince guy is hot.  Oh yeah, and its a chick flick where the girl becomes a princess (or has the option to become a princess) with the Prince of Denmark!  Which we all know could never reeeeally happen, but thats cool whatever.  What i find amusing about this movie though is that the Prince guy is the Prince of Denmark, but has a British accent when he is in fact.....danish.  Interesting.  Sarah says maybe he learned how to speak English in England.  I think there was a secret war where England took over Denmark kinda like the Secret War in Canada and i call this war....the Anglo-Danish War (lol Sarah).  Or maybe mr. dixon's "Britain rules the world by proxy" speech is true.  I dunno, the Prince guy is still hot and i'm still going to see it despite its....ahem...lingual/nationalistic/socio-geographic flaws.    alright i need to do hw now.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
