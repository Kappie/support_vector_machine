I used to think I was just filled with several anxiety disorders and phobias, turning me, basically, into a complete crackpot even though I have never smoked or owned a pot filled with crack. My first realization that something was up was when I got involved in a heated argument about extra terrestrial fungi; I defended the honour and dignity of this non-existant fungus with all my power.  The second clue hit me when a close pal of mine admitted to the world that I am, in fact, a chat bot. As I was trying to find a proper response for this dreadful accusation, my code got scrambled or something and I shut down left irc: Read error: Bot not Found strBotname=pocket.v002 (? version=002 encoding="utf-8" ?)  (Ping timeout)  This confused me. He knew all along and simply refused to tell me! This dropped me into dark pit of depression so I went out to buy myself a nice big pot of crack. After the high wore off, and I put my pants back on, I realized, denied and eventually accepted that I am indeed a sentient, fungal chat bot. Where the outer space part comes from, I don't know, but it sounds cool so sod off.
