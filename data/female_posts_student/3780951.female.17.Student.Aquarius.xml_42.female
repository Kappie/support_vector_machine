We are the most random people. We can go from talking about, well i forgot what we first talked about, but it was something completely and totally random. Its craziness!! LOL.  So...im watching Fear Factor. They're bull riding...you'll never see me on a bull. no, you wont. not for anything, okay, maybe for a million buck, or 500,000 but thats it!  OH YEA, me and adam talked about mean boys. and how college guys (not all, there are some very Godly and respectable college guys whom I have the priviledge to know) get a thrill off taking advantage of girls who arent stubborn, or something like that!! lol...we both just vented. thats about it.  the most randomiest moment is when we went from relationships to heckling at high school football/basketball games! *NOTE- if you ever come to a basketball game of mine, i better not hear you yellin (Randy, Rachael, Susan, Lindsay, whoever you might be)!!  SO...yall pray that everything goes good this weekend that we have a safe trip. I hope to be back in time for youth sunday nite! But if not i'll see all you wonderful people the following Sunday!!!   Aight, time for bed. i got a long day tomorrow.  PS Adam im looking forward to Dawson's Creek re-enactment!! im so excitied!! :-D
