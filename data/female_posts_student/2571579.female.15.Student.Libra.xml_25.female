Matt was saying that he said I was prude because they were talking about how far me and him got when we were all sittin at the park. I thought maybe he actually cared enough to being up a conversation about me. After the park we barely said goodbye. Tonight i asked matt about that .. and he said they didn't even talk about me "soo relax" That hurt. He knows I liked him and when i said "sorry i thought maybe he cared.. nvm tho" he was like haha... I kinda need to cry tonight. It's mainly pms and i'm just not sure. Simko's trying to help me out cause i told him i was in a weird mood which makes me feel terrible. I love him so much. He's one of the greatest people alive. Like right now carissa is all about "I love MacArt" .. which was the last thing she said to me but he actually cares. Even after i told him i didn't like it and that probally hurt him and i just dont know what to do and i'm leaving tomorrow for two weeks and i have to pack now so i'm probally gonna go soon. That's enough for today tho.. hopefully I'll meet some kids at the beach to get my mind off everything. xoxo - casey       Goo Goo Dolls- Iris  "...When everything feels like the movies, yeah you bleed just to know your alive.
