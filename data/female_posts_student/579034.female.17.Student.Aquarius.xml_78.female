I don't know if im gonna pass my Chem midterm tomrrow.. its like... looming before me like a big gigantic evil thing thats out for my blood or something. It's like... this episode of Sister Sister when like, she opens the test and it screams or something. But, on a lighter note... me and Micks "anniversery" was yesterday. It started six months ago yesterday that we said we liked each other. We've come along way. I really hope he can come, it's like... I hate sayin goodbye but, sayin hello makes it all worth while. Today I was kinda boring. My tests were supposed to be today but like everyone got all worried about the snow so they were pushed back till tomorrow. They got all worried for like nothing cause there was only about 5 inches on the ground. I went for a good run today too. I had my MP3 player and I put good running songs on it and I was like going at an awesome pace and I don't know I felt awesome. Then, when I got home I did some strides down my block. I feel so ready for Saturday guys. I really think we have a chance, we just gotta show them that we want it and what we are willing to do to get it. I'm just really sick of people who say they want things and they don't put in the work to get it, especially when they have a chance. And we HAVE a chance. We aren't out of the running yet. We just gotta get focused. I hope you all been running while we haven't had practice. But... tomorrow should be okay. The test'll suck, but then theres practice and that should be good. Then a little later Erica and I and I think Deb are gonna go to Mrs. Volpe's house for rosery then we are gonna go to Debs cause the team is meeting there for a pasta party.Well, I was just takin a break so I gotta go back to studying. Peace x0x
