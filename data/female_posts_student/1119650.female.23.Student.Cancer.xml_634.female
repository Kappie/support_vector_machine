An evil spirit; a demon. 2. The Devil; Satan. 3.  A diabolically evil or wicked person.  4. Informal. One who is  addicted to something : a dope fiend.   friend      ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (frnd)   n.   A person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.  A person whom one knows; an acquaintance. A person with whom one is allied in a struggle or cause; a comrade.  One of the key differences is the letter "r".  "R" can be found in such other words like retarded, really (as in really stupid) and ridiculous.  We'll delve into words like that another day though, students.    It seems to me nothign is any different today than any other day of the last 3 months except that everyone now knows I can't keep a secret and thinks that  I  am lying, ha!  My last bit of advice to you all is this:  if you get shown the light but are too blinded by it to move out of it, don't cry to me when you get burned by it.  Also get a fucking STD test if you're not using condoms you're just asking for a super stinging new strain of the clap.
