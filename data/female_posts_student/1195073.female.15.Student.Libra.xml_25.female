But I made a new one anyways, so now I have three.  My only problem is that if Friday is the last day he will kiln or kilm or fire the pots, I probably won't be able to glaze my second one.  Oh well, you get a C- if it's not glazed.  Anyway, our homebase is bad, so a cop came in and talked to us, just us, no other homebases, just ours.  I feel like a rebel now, even though I didn't have anything to do with what they were scolding us about.  That's about it.  We get out early tomorrow (unless we have a delay, which we might because there is talk of it getting foggy tomorrow) and we have advisory, so we will have short classes.  It will be like that on Thursday and on Firday about 3/4 of the honors classes will be gone because of the band/orchestra/choir city tour, so it should be a fairly easy day, I don't think they'll give us a lot to do if most of the class is gone.  Aside from a (group) science test and a MAP test (which I really need to do well on) on Thursday, nothing too big this week.  I'll try to update tomorrow, if my oh-so-busy schedule allows it.  CHECK OUT 24Dotz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am their legal consultant/ PR representative, so don't f**k with them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
