Now somebody steals from you or something I could see forgiving and forgetting... Or at lease forgiving. But I mean bigger stuff. Like my father. I can't forgive him or forget what he's done. Somebody told me I should but I want them to have thier father beat them as bad as he did then tell me to forgive him and forget it. [I don't really want it to happen, I'm just implying who they should speak unless some big trama happened to theirselves.] Oh well.
