The dummy who was throwing the party gave really lame directions and we got lost and so turned around that by the time we got to the shower we were an hour late. The trip was worth it just to see the face of the expectant mother when we walked in. After that we drove back home and relaxed for all but a few moments. Then off we went to my niece Elizabeth “Bits” birthday party. It was so great to be surrounded my sister’s kids, they have such an awesome energy about them and you can’t help but be in good spirits around them.   Although the day was tiresome it was well worth it because I got a chance to spend it with my family and if you know me at all, family is the most important thing to me.    Sunday:  Today stared out pretty relaxed, this is a great way to start any day. I got to sleep in and finally do one of my favorite Sunday activities, eat a nice bowl of cereal and read the Sunday funnies. Today we are going to go over to my Nanu’s house and visit with an old family friend of my mom’s. She hasn’t seen this person in over 40+ years. I can’t wait to get a chance to meet her because I know that this will be a great opportunity to hear stories about my mom’s childhood.   In other news, I got my birthday present from Jesse yesterday, he bought me a dainty  ruby ring. It is very beautiful and just the way I like my jewelry, elegantly simple.   I have also had one of the most relaxing weeks ever, at least since I haven’t been taking too many calls on my cell phone. I have GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and my big heart has endured too much stress for me to handle these last few days. So I have made the decision to keep all phone calls to a minimum, unless it’s someone from the FRG because chances are it’s the people who are brining me the most anxiety. I tried to tell them that I can’t handle this and would prefer to be left out of it all together but I can’t get a word in edgewise. It isn’t that I choose not to listen to their problems it that I really cant listen because the stress and anxiety is making me so sick and for health reasons I find it best not to subject myself to the unwanted stress.   Don’t get me wrong I do love my friends but I just can’t handle this, It’s not my problem so why involve me?  Today I talked to my friend Dale and told him how I felt. I said to him that it’s not that I don’t care for him as a friend but I have to distance myself from the stress because it’s effecting me and my health. He said he understood and apologized, saying that he never meant to involve me like he has. This is a good step for him.
