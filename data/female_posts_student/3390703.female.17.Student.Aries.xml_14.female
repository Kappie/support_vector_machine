He was telling me about how much he loves Sally and how he wants to make things official with her!  I really want that to happen because I think that they will really make each other happy, they make each other better people!  But Sally is scared, and she wants to be with someone that she is allowed to go out with!  And I don't blame her because it would make things a lot easier!  Meh, we'll see how it goes! Friday is Sally's birthday and Christian is coming to our school and then we are all going out to eat!  Yay, it is going to be so much fun!  School is ... depressing!  There is no point for me to be there anymore!  I'm not learning anything, and there is nothing to look forward to anymore!  I go to school for the excitement (Homecoming, Football games, Prom, Basketball games, Chorus concerts, Musicals ...), and there is none of that left, so I don't want to be there! Hmmm ... I blame my depression and laziness on the weather!  If it was sunny I would have more motivation, but right now its gloomy and I don't feel like caring about anything!
