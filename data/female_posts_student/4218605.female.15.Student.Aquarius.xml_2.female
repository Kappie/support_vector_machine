So Bob was standing in line for lunch and he opened something up, where they keep food, and Lawson was all "I've gotten onto you a lot last year. Don't make me do it this year." He's such a fucking cunt on quite a powertrip. He yelled at me because my shirt was too short, swearing up and down he's told me more than 20 times. He told me once. Maybe his stupid wooden leg clogs his memory.  Stupid asshole. I swear.  Anyway, Liz Fuller and Rachel whatsherface are going to go down. I hate them both. Rachel more than Liz, because Rachel tried to destroy Bob and I. But Liz also tried to destroy Shelby and Ira. Which is -not- cool. Damn. Figures. Fucking homewreckers.  Anyway .. I'm still pretty excited about my schedule. I mean, Spanish is a little too .. YAY .. for it to be 8:15 AM. When 2nd period starts. All day we did "This is my name. This is what I like/this is what I'm like." In English, we had to do name activites. Getting to know each other. I was Zany Zoe. Haha. And I told Nick to be Nifty Nick and Jaymes to be Jolly Jaymes. And there's this kid, Jared, who was "Junky Jared," but I do believe that shall be later. Okay, well, in geometry (last period, as opposed to English third), we had to say our name and a fact about ourselves. When she got to me, I said "I'm Zoe, and Jaymes is one of my best buddies in the world." Rofl. I'm so cute. ^^; And so about Junky Jared .. we're in the same Wellness class. And he wanted to sit  talk with me, since y'know. We have Snodgrass together. We got switched to Herzog, by the way. >  ..Freak.  Yeah, so. I hate the principal, who's really a one-leg whore who needs to back off. And I need to clean my room if Alex and Tristan are planning on coming over frequently. And I still need to do my Geomtetry homework. Shit.
