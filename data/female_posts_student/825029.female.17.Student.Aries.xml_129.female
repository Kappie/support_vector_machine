A bunch of tipsy women that seem to think Bunco means gossiping instead of actually playing the game.  Sheesh!  And they’re so loud!  So to pass the time, I decided to update my blog, because it’s not like I have anything better to do.  Today was fairly good... band was okay... guess we’re going to play Jupiter, which is alright.  It’s a cool song and all, just not very much fun to play- at least my part.  Then there was the pep rally... a complete waste of time for us pit kids.  I got some study time for Spanish, though, so that was good.  Then went to Spanish... Martin wasn’t at school today so it was really boring : \  but the quiz was fairly easy.  Then went to World History.  Dixon was super cool and moved our test to tomorrow so we just reviewed and messed around for half the time today.  Always a fun class!  Chemistry was alright... took a test that I felt really confident about- just naming compounds, nomenclature stuff.  Tomorrow, we take another test, but it shouldn’t be too hard, either.  BCIS was.... well, it was BCIS.  We took a test (*spazzes*) over MS Access.  Pretty much another waste of time.  The stuff is so easy and pointless it makes me sick.  hehe  Only homework I have is to study for Wd. Hist. and Chemistry.    Drum line competition tomorrow night at the high school!  Coppell at 10:20, Metro Alliance at 11!  If you’d be able to help with Coppell props, let me know.  You wouldn’t have to be there until like 9:30-9:45, and you can leave as soon as Coppell has performed.  Any help is appreciated...  Movies I Want To See: *Jungle Book 2 *How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days Anybody want to see them with me???  Apparently my friends don’t care to see children’s movies or chick flicks.... little do they know, these movies are going to be really good.  Cool song alert!  “It Began in Afrika” – Chemical Brothers  (reminds me of the Afrika Corpse.. right Collin? hehe)  Well, I guess that’s all for now!    Oh yeah,  I love rain.
