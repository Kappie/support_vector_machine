But the worst part is that I can't miss school tomorrow, I have that big Language Arts presentation. And a Chem test. Monkeybutt. I'm trying to figure out where this came from. I guess it coulda been this weekend... I sing too loud in my car. Good times though. No regrets, dammit. **All American Giiirrrl.. Do dobedo dooo, do dobedo** Josh knows. I saw School of Rock yesterday. It's pretty damn rockin'. Predictable... but rockin'. Lol. No I liked it. I saw Hot Russian Boy (aka Danny) there too. And I just ran into him at Red Robin last weekend. Great, now I'm talking to him and he DOESN'T live up the street anymore. Dammit. He's so perfect. DAMMIT. There are no good guys in our school. Wellll, Time to start pedalling the Bellevue schools. "Hello little boy, get in... I've got candy..." no wait, even better: "I've got nudey magazines and I'm not wearing a braaa...." Hahahaha.... okay I'm kidding in case anyone's wondering... mostly. Hehe.  I got 2 hours of sleep last night. I don't know why. I just couldn't sleep. It was too hot. It was too cold. The music was too loud. It was too silent. It's too dark. It's too light. What the hell was that noise. It's 3 in the morning??? The sun's coming up. Shit. Yeah that was my night. Maybe that's why I'm sick. Could be stress too. Everything's stressing me out lately. Well, there's a lot to stress me out I should say. God.. I gotta sleep. Crap I have a fever!!! Bogus. Heinous. Most non-triumphant. Metakasmaklismic. (Those are all synonyms for SHIT.)
