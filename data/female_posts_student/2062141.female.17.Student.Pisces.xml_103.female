They say that day will come but will it? Why not now? I'm so tired of waiting, so sick of hoping. They tell you to have high standards but those who do are alone. Like me. Is it voluntary? Or if not voluntary, self-induced? It drives me crazy to think that it is. Even if I know that I'm doing the right thing. ...Especially so. I'd be so depressed right now if I was one of those girls who have to be defined by their boyfriend. I'm proud to be a self-sufficient, independent, and in all truth happy person; I know who I am, and I like who I am. But that doesn't mean I don't need somebody, need somebody to feel that wholeness that I've built up in my mind.
