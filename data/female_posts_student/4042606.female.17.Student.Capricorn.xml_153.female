Then I had to listen to Mute and Jackie taunt me for 2 hours, before I even left for the dinner.  As I sat in the car, I couldn't breath because the dress was to tight around my chest region. I didn't care for that at all. My stepmother also made the comment that I could use to show off myself a little, she also said that I am to pretty to hide it under all that clothing. Well, she is wrong and I don't need to dress up fancy for people.  Getting back to the story, we got there at around eight. To see a whole shit load of people already inside. All I wanted to do was sit down somewhere, where no one could find me. That didn't work out to well, because my dad and stepmom wanted to introduce me to every single person in the building. Guess what, There was no eye contact the entire night, unless you consider my chest eyes. It was ridiculous, and people wonder why I dress modestly. I cannot stand this shit.  Well, as I went from meeting each person, I continued to look for a way to get the hell out of there. I found my exit, it was the bathroom. I said that I had a stomach ache and then went to the bathroom. I stayed in there for about 15 minutes, but when I came out my dad had more people for me to meet.  When I finally sat down to eat, I was luckily sat against the wall, so I was no longer in the center of attention. I thought the hell that was the night was finally going to calm down. Not exactly; When dinner was served I caught this one old guy starring at me the entire time I was eating. If that doesn't make someone uncomfortable, I don't know what does.  We left that hell hole at midnight. I got home at about 12:10 and I am finally out of that tight dress I had been wearing since seven. I am still trying to get my normal breathing patterns back. I am completely exhausted from this night, and hopefully I don't half to go through it again.
