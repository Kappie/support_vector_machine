Its gone back to talking and just joking about life. which is fine! I never tire of talking w. alanah. i never could. but when it pops into my head, b.c of  habit , i have to beat it down, and ignore it. i'll have to get used to that, and slowly it will all fade, and slowly it will not be a habit. and i thought about my day at school....i get to school look up and see jessica sitting in the commons. i pass her going to 1st, 3rd, 5th, 6th. that is one annoying reminder. and i half the jokes we crack, are about our fantacies with him. i feel i'm on dangerous ground, and if i step in the wrong hole, i'll fall completely off the face of the earth. dont ask me why, i just have this hole, and emptiness. I know it seems completely backwards, but- i'm supposed to be ignored. i'm supposed to be the one spying from the background. thats the way its always been. and i'm used to it. thats just the way i am. so this is rocking my pattern. i dont deal w. this stuff. i dont want to. i know its easier to ignore the problem and run away from it. and also thats the Worst possible thing to do in Every situation. But i'm not accepting it. I dont live in reality very well, its just not my place. i dont want to take things seriously and literally. and to be told This is THIS. and it means that and nothing else. it just closed me off even more from the idea. this may sound hypocritical, but i'm not thinking that ignoring the problem will go away. i'm saying in a situation like this. it doesn't matter. when something never was reality.
