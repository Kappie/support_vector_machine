The master instructor (ruler of smaller instructors who actually teach) is friends with my mom and i used to swim with him as a teacher.   He thought i was swimming pretty good today and handed my mother a sign up sheet for competitive swimming.  Never, Never, NEVER will i swim again.  I've had my fill of chlorine water going up my nose as i do front crawl (hate it , hate it, hate it!)......Now i have to do two hours of nonstop training every Friday for the year!  :'( Kill me......please.......
