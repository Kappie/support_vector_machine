Don't worry too much about making the right decision -- you don't have to make up your mind right away.   Well, yes, I do get my own personal horoscope every day in my email. (Which is, by the way, horselover@karnesec.net should you want to email me) You can get one too, at  urlLink Astrology.com . It's free and I think they're really accurate.   "Accurate?", you say. "A horoscope?" Well, yes. I actually am facing an extremely difficult conflict right now so today's was accurate! You know you wanna know so let me tell you all about it.  I could take a chance right now, I could choose to leap off on a limb and just do what I want and live my life on the sweet but wild side, or I could wait. I could wait until I'm just a little older (like 6 months from now :P) and then fling myself over the edge. But I decided today, I'm not going to make up my mind. I'm just gonna let my life take it's course- I'm not going to plan for anything- Or make a decision- Or do anything. I'm just gonna let my life go with the flow and be determined by other people's actions. What do you guys think?        "These chics don't even know the name of my band. But they're all on me like they like they wanna hold hands, cuz once I flow they know that I'll be the man, All because I'm the lead singer of my band."  Fun, huh? I keep waiting for CHRIS TO BURN ME THAT CD! COME ON CRISPY!     OK, I wanna tell you guys the story of 4 girls "going out on the town".   Picture  urlLink four teenage girls with beautiful tans .  Jillian: Beautiful long brown hair. Multi-colored eyes. Wearing a turquoise lace-up shirt from GAP and her favorite jeans. Natalie: Beautiful long honey-caramel blonde hair. A striped one shoulder top and bright blue jeans. Virginia: Gorgeous medium length brown hair. "The Yellow Sweater" and a white halter top with, yet again, more blue jeans. Phileda: Lovely (if I do say so myself lol) multi-toned blonde hair. White peasant top and, ah ha, you guessed it, jeans.  Well, one beautiful summer night at  urlLink Seaside, Florida  us four went "out on the town". It was warm, but ever "fashion conscious" we decided to wear blue jeans and a nice shirt. OK, I'm lying, we didn't decide to wear blue jeans, it just happened that way. :)  Seeing as it was pretty hot, we decided to get  urlLink Pina Coladas from a sort of, roadside vendor? I swear all of them were spiked. Especially Virginia's! We were so spazzed out it was weird. They were really good though.... lol. Anyway, we got our PCs and just walked aimlessly around town.   We passed the "ice cream guy" that we would always see hanging around outside this shaved ice place. At point i would spill shaved ice on myself in order to be able to ask him to hand me some napkins. Good times... lol. I never really saw his face, he always had these huge glasses on lol. SUNglasses. I think he was slightly gothic- he was sitting on this stage with these gothic looking people (or at least punk.... at the very least) and playing the guitar. Hotness, people. lol. What is it with me and nearly gothic people?! I have a weakness I guess.  Anyway, then we went and sat on a bench. Yes, sad, we know. But anywayz. And these guys with really big bikes were sort of following us around. Their bikes had at least.... 4 foot span handlebars. Anyhow, we sat down and these guys were driving past and asked me/us "Do you like my bike?" Talk about dorks. Oh well.  So anyway, we got bored then, so we went back to Mellow Yellow and we were out on Jillian's porch singing "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" (you know you can all see me doing that) when these guys in the next door house yelled at us to "Shut Up! Yal are awful!"  Don't you guys think that was harsh?  Love you all 2 Bitz N Piecez,                                         Toxic :P
