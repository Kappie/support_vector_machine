I pretended I'm glad you went away These four walls closin' more every day And I'm dying inside And nobody knows it but me  Like a clown I put on a show The pain is real even if nobody knows Now I'm cryin' inside And nobody knows it but me  I carry a smile when I'm broken in two Now I'm nobody without someone like you I'm tremblin' inside, and nobody knows it but me I lie awake, its a quarter past three I'm screamin' at night As if I thought you'd hear me Yeah my heart is callin' you And nobody knows it but me
