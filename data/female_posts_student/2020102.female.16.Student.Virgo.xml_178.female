White  "I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies." - Pietro Aretino  "One of the hardest things in life is having words in your heart that you can't utter." - James Earl Jones  "The pleasure of all reading is doubled when one lives with another who shares the same books." - Katharine Mansfield  "I hate fashion... They have these runway shows and they have a commentator saying, 'A pretty face is your best asset this season.' As opposed to last season, when ugly girls had a free ride all the way through, when back-fat was all the rage." - Janeane Garofalo  "Try to understand that there is more thought-lessness than malice in the world. People are not out to offend you deliberately and maliciously. But all of us are thoughtless at times and do not readily realize that our words and actions are going to hurt people." - Lawrence G. Lovasik,  The Hidden Power of Kindness   "Drop the idea that you are Atlas carrying the world on your shoulders. The world would go on even without you.

Cows have been in films, but they haven't starred. I'm still willing to eat a species that is only a supporting player." - Paula Poundstone  "What we see depends mainly on what we look for." - John Lubbock  "Books won't stay banned. They won't burn. Ideas won't go to jail. In the long run of history, the censor and the inquisitor have always lost. The only sure weapon against bad ideas is better ideas." - A. Whitney Griswold  "Only boring people play boring music." -Mr. Snell
