That was after my mom called a few times asking me to stop by and pick up this Little Tykes house that the neighbor around the corner was throwing away.  She wanted me to carry/drag it around the corner to her house.  Why is it that my mom has surgery and becomes unable to do anything yet she starts making all kinds of plans for anyone in the direct path of her eyesight!  She cracks me up! So anyway, after class I went to see Spiderman 2.  I had previously attempted to see it with the donor, Damien, and Shane but as usual, Shane's attention span of 45 minutes was eaten up pretty quickly.  Why do they put 20 minutes of commercials in front of movies?  And I honestly do mean commercials!  Car ads and internet ads and such.  So I was in the theater watching the movie nad doesn't some ignorant ass bitch take 4 frigging cell phone calls during the movie.  She didn't just hit silent or send the calls to voicemail, she answered them and talked for a few seconds to a few minutes.  GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRR.  Then on the way home, I stopped at the Village for some back to school shopping for Lex.  Five out of the six times I have been there this asshole has been out front begging for change to "go get a burger for him and his son".  If he went and found a job and worked at it as hard as he works at begging for change everyday, he'd have money for whatever he needs.  I have officially declared to anyone who will listen that I am trading in my Saturn for a Sea-Doo.  (Jet ski!)  Just about everyday for the past week when I go to pick up the kids from school it is pouring rain outside.   I am going to start wearing my bathing suit to go get them.  Well, my eyes are once again cloudy fomr allergies, so I am goign to go for now.   TTFN B
