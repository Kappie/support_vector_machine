It sucks, Kay is at Derick's, Mom and Dad went to a movie and I'm sitting at home, specifically in a room I'm sick of.  I want new everything.   It doesn't help that the Pottery Barn Teen catalog arrived today.  My dream room would cost... $2554 and thats not including anything on the wall or floors or curtain rods.   My furniture is beautiful but too formal large and dark for my small room. I really like sunny things and there is no way that cherry wood and brass can be sunny.  My room is also way way too cluttered and driving me insane.  Anyway, I'll stop complaining and start clearing stuff out, maybe if I cut out the amount of crap in here I can get some inspiration and start doing something to fix this thing.  ...maybe some spray paint will help....
