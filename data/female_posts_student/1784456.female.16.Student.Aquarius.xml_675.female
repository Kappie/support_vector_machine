Hey Izzy, you better finish Mr Fopple! Oh and happy holidays every one! What are you all doing? I'm doing nothing! But seriously, any one wanna go shopping in Bristol on Tuesday? Phone me! Some one... geez where is every one any way? Probably gone to the moon or some thing... without me!!! So any way... what was this about the present that you haven't got me? Oh god, I'll have to practise my "Oh my god why the hell did you get me that?" face then won't I?! Hehe, I'm soooo nice! Well any way, I have to go watch Auf Wiedersen, Pet (hey I'm not German and I don't do German so shhhh!) So gotta go! Have a nice holiday and keep on treking... geez I'm getting freaked out at the moment, maybe it is time to run away! Bisi!
