I don't know why I always end up playing games when I know I could be doing something much more productive.   My latest addiction is a free online game called Runescape. (www.runescape.com) It's the worst game I've ever played. But I can't stop going back to it. I dunno why. I mean, it seems to collect the stupidest people I've ever seen on one game. The n00bs are incredibly irritating...the elite assholes are a pain..and..I really have no idea why I play that game. Oh well.   Anyway. My name on there is The_Thiefess, if you ever want to find me. I normally play on World 20 because that's where the people I know are at.  So. Let's see. Something to write about...  Ooh.  Every summer, I always go through a I-want-to-start-a-garden phase. My Mom normally goes out and gets lots of flowers and stuff like that, and then I decide that I want my own little garden. And we go get some flowers and herbs that I like..such as basil, greek oregano, snapdragons, and..all sorts of things. It's fun. But, after about a week, I get bored of that lil' project and move onto something else. It's aggravating. I can never stay with one "project" for any long period of time. I just seem to lose focus and start thinking up ideas for something else to do. And even if I test myself, by doing some activity just to see how long I can do it for...well, I always end up forgetting about it or being distracted. Sometimes I really feel like I have some weird form of ADD =p Well, most of the time I just feel like I'm paranoid. But every now and then I feel like I have ADD. So. enh.  An example of my problem with projects...well, there's always my procrastination with projects that are forced on me. But I'm talking about projects that I start and never finish. Oh! I used to be on a chat-program called Furcadia all the time. The site is www.furcadia.com if you're interested. You're basically an animal that can chat with other people-animal things and there's absolutely no point. But it's a lot of fun.  Anyway. You can make your own dream in furcadia. A dream is a map of your own little world, in simple terms. You can make patches to make pretty, extra graphics and use DragonSpeak to do HTML-ish stuff. It's difficult to explain. In any case, I used to have all these wonderful ideas for dreams. I would start planning how they would look..and what patches I would use..and what bots to make...and I would get started and work on my dream for hours on end. However...eventually, normally when I got half-way finished..I would start thinking up ideas for another dream and just completely forget about my current dream. And...that would go on for a long time. It was frustrating, to say the least.   I loved Furc, though. It just seems that Furcadia attracted a certain type of person that...if you get along with one person there, you get along with nearly all of them. Nearly everyone is intelligent in their own way...and everyone's funny and...oh, I suppose I was just spoiled by that chat program. Because..comparing the type of people on Furc..to Runescape..agh. It makes me want to go back to Furcadia..which is really bad. heh. I can't even begin to count how many hours of my life I wasted to that pointless game XD Well, it's not even a game. There is no point. At all. Whoo! Rock on.  Oooookay. Where was I? Oh. Gardening. That's kind of sad, how far off topic I got. heheh. Anyway. So my Mom had to go get some plants and I was slowly but steadily getting back into my I-wanna-start-a-garden mood and I kept asking her about all these different plants and..well..when I decided on what I wanted, she wouldn't give in. enh. I mean, come on..it'd be a lot of fun to have a Weeping Willow. Or a rose bush. Those are just cool plants. Weeping Willows are just...well..really cool. And the rose bush I wanted was a "Yellow Tea Hybrid" or something and it was neat. But nooooo. We couldn't get either of those. bleh. And when I just said I wanted a little basil plant or a greek oregano..noooo...  It's probably for the best, though. ^^; I don't have a green thumb. Well, rather, I've never stuck with gardening long enough to know if I have a green thumb. At least, it's very pink right now. Pink-ish. Kind of tan. Stupid summer. I always get a horrible farmer's tan due to tennis.  I think I'll just flood this little journal with lots of quizilla stuff later. I love quizilla ^_^  Oh, and every time I post I'll try to put at the bottom the song that's been stuck in my head all day. I always have a song stuck in my head for at least one day at a time..sooo.  Song stuck in my head today: Holding Out for a Hero (Shrek 2 Soundtrack) by - Frou Frou, Jennifer Saunders, and the original (that I dislike) is by Bonnie Tyler, I think. I get my music from Limewire so the names aren't always...ehm..accurate.
