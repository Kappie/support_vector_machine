That one isn't half as good as this one, but for some reason writing in this Blog now seems pointless. Although, this morning..I woke up with a feeling of guilt. I thought about writing in my other Journal, but I miss this one. So for some odd reason, I feel that if I dont update here too then I am a very bad person. Anyhow, Ashley, Amber, and Sam are over at my house. They stayed the night lastnight. Who knows if they had fun or not or anything, but I hope that they did. We watched Fight Club..part of THE WALL, we ..or I played True Crime Streets of LA. hehe...Life right now is going pretty damn good. I guess I never really expressed how much I liked Ashley in here before, afraid of  someone  reading it..but eh, everyone knows now. So, Ashley and William and I are all together again. This makes me so happy..the two most important people in my life right now. I can't wait to go to Williams...hehe, Im sooo excited to see him. Icky..I have bad breath. I ALWAYS have bad breath when I brush my teeth at night. If I dont brush them at night, everything is fine in the morning. No lie...I thought it was quite weird myself, but it's the truth. Err...I have so much more to say, so I think that I will either save some for my LiveJournal one...or just post later when I'm alone. heh...    Why wont you answer me? Why are you acting as if I did something wrong?
