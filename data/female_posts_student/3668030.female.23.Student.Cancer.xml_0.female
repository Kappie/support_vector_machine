(oh incase you were curious im interviewing lynn because its a community psych class and i wrote a paper earlier on homeless women and the second paper is to either summarize 4 more papers on homeless women or interview someone who works with homeless women and lynn does.. yeah)  muffy is in town and that is super exciting. she is coming to chicago tonight so if you wre not doing anything you should come  i would like to note that when i say "you" i am referring to any of my friends that read this.  well im gonna go email some TA's sorry this is so boring
