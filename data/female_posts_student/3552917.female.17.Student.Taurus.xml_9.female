I guess I could start with umm........Ok..I started off my summer with workin bout 5 days a week and when I was off jsut going to hang with Amber or just ride around and hang out.. I really didnt see my friends that much this summer..I dont get it really I mean I had time but I guess I just dont spend my time wisely?!!? Ok...well then like when I was workin Amber was here..and well here is an interesting lil story.. I was talkin to an old friend name Phillip on the computer and well he got my cell phone number one night and called and I didnt answer but Amber did and she started talkin to him....and I was like ok whatever..and they really started talkin and talked for like...5 hours that night..and then the next night he called and they talked and we had a crazy idea for Phillip to come meet Amber and visit me b/c I havent seen him in like 1 or 2 years...So he is like ok ill come but imma bring some friends along with me and I was like ok thats cool...So we like put on some clothes and got ready***its like 2 in the mornin*** and so they call and are like we are here..so we go right down the road from my house and there are 4 guys there... it wassss.....phillip...harold....daniel...and Cory.....well as soon as we got there Amber was like omg they are losers lets go..and I was like nooo..lets wait...that Cory guy is cute I want to talk to him...so she is like...ok....so we sit there a lil while and its starts to rain...so Amber and I were like we are going in..So we start goin in and Phillip pulls in my driveway and was like we cant go right now...there is 4 ppl in this truck and one is in the back adn its rainin..so the nice person I am I let them come on my porch...and I go out there for a while...and from the time I went in and came back out Cory had told Phillip he thought I was cute...and well so happens that I told Phillip the same thing...Sooo we are all just sittin there and they are like this is boring..and I bring up the stupid Idea to go to the damn motorhome**which I am not even allowed in** so they are like lets go...and i said it was locked so they go get in somehow.. and we all go out there except this one dude...he was drawing graphette...the dude that didnt come in there got on my nerves anyways...lol....so we all go hang out in the motorhome..and its call cool and stuff.....we had lots of fun... then it was startin to be daylight and I didnt want to get in trouble for having people over so we were sayin bye and all and Cory and Phillip decide to ask us to go out on a picnic the day after that..so we were all excited and I got Cory's # and we talked and well we started really liking each other and then we did that whole picnic thing.. Amber and I went to huntsville probably 20 times throughout the next month or so... I mean I thought I was really fallin for him...I got to go stay the night with him and everything!! Well then Amber and I went to Panama City for a week...It was fun and I didnt cheat on him....believe it or not!! It was hard but I didnt!! We did all kinda of things in Florida.. we ate at Dirty Dick's and everything :P So when we came back I missed Cory sooo much so I called and was like....hey and the first thing he said was "I miss you!!" and I was like I miss you too....can I come see u now...and he was like yea so Amber and I went up there the first night we were back home...I got to spend like 4 hours with him!! And it was sooooo great the whole time I was in his arms and he was tellin me how much he missed me!! Then we went home at like 2 in the mornin!! Then the next day I didnt get to see him I think I had to work or something I dont really remember that... Then the next day I got to see him again but it was only for like 2 hours but I guess those 2 hours are gonna have to last for a long time :'(( ....not going into detail there....long story... But I miss him and I know he knows it :( But anyways...before I get all sad.... More about the whole Florida thing... the first day we were there we got there at like probably 5....I unpacked all my bags and put all my clothes in drawers and everything..in like 15 minutes!! Then I think I went out to the beach...It was soooo pretty....We went to the beach alot... We went out to fancy resterants like 3 nights... we went to Dirty Dick's .....Capt. Anderson's and...black angus....They were alll really exspensive!! We went to The Strip Amusement Park...It is the last summer it will be there too!! that sucks it was fun!! We spent alot of the nights sittin on the beach til like 3 in the mornin. It was really nice.. our hotel was extremely nice...its one of those resorts where they do everything for you...like house keeping and take ur bags up and u get ur food brought up and everything...lol...but yea..the last night we were there was cool...we met alotta people and we hung out.....we didnt go to sleep that last night we were there..we jsut decided to sleep the whole way home!! It was allllll great!! On the way home it kinda sucked...we got stuck in traffic for I think it was 3 or 4 hours!! As soon as we got home I went ahead and unpacked all my shit and washed every thing!!I was soo tired and just ready to drop dead...but as soon as I knew I could go see Cory I just some how regained all that...lol!! But yea that was pretty much my whole summer tonight is my last night of summer and actually it is over now....its after 12...so its officially a school night once again~~ Well imma go...talk to you later!
