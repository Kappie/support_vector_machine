Sit in my nice comfy now and only think on the past. I spent a whole day off thinking about things that really don't matter, like hmm I wonder where that ex boyfriend is and oh that time, it was fun. I have a stack of homework that sits over my laptop and is looking down on me, taunting me, shunning me for neglecting to touch it, and reminding me of the fact that I still have books to buy for AP classes.     Not  that I'm going to go out there and buy them, or even order a used copy on amazon... No, instead I'll continue putting it off, waking up at eleven, swimming and them changing into my work clothes until one o'clock comes around, then I'll just get home from work, and continue to lounge or maybe go to sleep or I could read Anna Karenina. And who on earth reads eighteent century literature by the man that wrote War and Peace...that'd be me, I have no life.  I'm not even going to fireworks on fourth of July, not that I'm complaining, because I really, truly hate fireworks. I don't see the fascination with them. People often look at me with that "what, what was that ohhh pretty colors what?" No, no I do not take joy in balls of colored fire flying down aided by beach wind. I'd rather do what I am best at and sit on my ass, order some chinese or something and watch the pretty New York ones on T.V.  T.V. isn't very interesting either, except for Will and Grace, ooohhh I love Will and Grace. Who wouldn't enjoy gay men who frolic about the set with rich bitches and wonderfully skinny fashion designers!? It is entertaining. Ohh and HSN, the Home Shopping Network. It's as if they took every piece of useless and overpriced junk and put it on T.V. with a bunch of women who look like giraffes with sparkly hands and long manicured fingers.  Well, you've just read possibly the most unproductive, horrid, boring and pointless Blog EVER. But, I promise I'll have one that has some meaning next time. Really, I promise.  Write soon...
