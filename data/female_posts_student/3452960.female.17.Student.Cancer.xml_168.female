I love them to death.)  Save Ferris  ... ... (Dermot O' Leary was wearing a t-shirt this morning. Hmm)  The Toasters  ... (Yum. Talk Is Cheap makes me leap. Heh. Rhyme.)  Ska-P  ... ... ... ... ... (for Cannibis mostly.. crazy Spaniards)  The Hippos  ... ... (Though they seem really "skatey", they're quite catchy.)  Sublime  ... ... ... ... (Oooh. Versatility! Though most of it's ska, they have other stuff too. Sexy, no?)   Other stuff that's fun:   The Donnas  ... ... (E2: "They're called a metal-inspired punk band and a classic rock and roll band." All women? Yes. Live with it. They're hot and good.)  Elastica  ... ... ... ... (Anybody here who says Connection is rubbish can burn in a fucking hole.)  Yellowcard  ... ... ... (Not a lot of bands have violinists. Yellowcard do. I like them. Powder. Mmm.)  [spunge]  ... ... ... ... (There are a lot of square brackets on this forum, so embrace [spunge]. Where the hell did you think I got my name from anyway?)  Monster Magnet  ... (Maybe they aren't everybody's cup of tea, but Heads Explode makes me laugh. Powertrip just makes me go "woooh".)  Good song:  urlLink Let's Go Bowling - Spy Market
