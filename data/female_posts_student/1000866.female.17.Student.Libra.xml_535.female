I think I want to do something with people but I don't know what. My first thought was to call Chris and see what's up with him but then I realized...oh yeah, even before we stopped talking for a bit, we hadn't hung out in about a month anyway. And, if he hadn't definitely for lack of a better term, discarded me before, he certainly has now. I'm not sure what to do.   Ah well, I'm sure I'll find something to do today.
