On my way to school I stopped really suddenly, cause I was driving too fast, and all of a sudden I feel something slam against my back. Okay, I was driving so fast and had to stop so suddenly, that my bookbag with EVERY BOOK AND BINDER rolled and slammed against my seat! Yeah, that's some bad driving.  The Chemistry exam?! Excuse my language, but WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?! Shitter... Doc I really think you gave us all the wrong test. At the end I started to whimper, Trisha saw it, ask her. We were all completely SHOCKED it was so bad. Hardest exam I have ever taken! Math was okay but still bad. I studied for English with Chelsea, Kristen, and Olivia after school. Good times were had. We were talking about  Beloved , and Kristen says, "Yeah, well all black people look the same" DIRECTLY TO OLIVIA! Oh we laughed! Olivia kept pretending her pen was a cigarette, and she kept puffing on it, literally for 10 minutes. I called Jessica Edison to see if Language was the first exam tomorrow, being that she's a genius, and she didn't know, and then Olivia called her after me, and Jessica said, "That's funny, Allison JUST called me!" Studying is so crazy when you do it in groups! Remember, Chels, "I'm looking for a guy with a two-syllable name!"  OOOH crazy. I saw a guy get handcuffed in the middle of the road today, it was sweet. But I also ran over something, I think I popped my tire, damnit, that's the last thing I need right now. I came home, and I was stepping up, but I only did it with my toes and then I fell. I'm in a lot of pain. Well I'm out, I leave you with this:  ValkyrieKaelia13: i was like "whatchoo smokin foo??"  browntrash182: browntrash, browntrash182: see i think that's funny browntrash182: i also wish my blog was famous e c 2 4 4 2: It totally is browntrash182: no like worldwide e c 2 4 4 2: Someone was talking about how much they liked it...
