Instead of sitting around and waiting for Paul to call (like I usually do), Tori and I took matters into our own hands and decided to go out on a date. Ruby Tuesday's here we come! Sitting there, we begin to talk about whatever happens to come to mind. There was lots of laughing. Then our waitress comes to get our drink order...2 suicide lemonades. Not 2 minutes later, she returns..."Can I see your i.d.'s?" What?! We just wanted a mixture of kiwi, blackberry, and strawberry lemonades. *insert mad laughing* Then comes our dessert...Chocolate Tallcake. *yum* Throughout the rest of the night many jokes were made. "That guy's tall and lanky...Oh D*mn!" "STAND UP and PLEASE tell me there's a truck there!" (Tori thought she was hallucinating...there was a pillar blocking my line of vision to where the truck actually was...turned out to be quite humorous) "Look at me Weena!""I thought he was just a retarded kid." (The family next to us had a baby...the elder kid was trying to get the baby's attention for a picture. The baby's name was Hannah or Anna...but we heard "Weena")...Many great memories came from Ruby Tuesdays...Stuff that, at least for now, Tori and I can keep laughing about. And you may not think it's funny...but I guess you had to be there. Or maybe it was just the fact that we were spending that time together that made it better.   Either way, I'm glad that I got to spend that time with Tori last night. It was definately better than sitting at home. And in a way I feel as if it has drawn us both together...more so then we were prior to that experiance. I'm glad that I have a friend like Tori that I can open up to about whatever is troubling me..or whatever is on my mind...or even for the times that I am *truly* happy and need to tell *someone* about my experiance...someone that won't hold it against me. Thank you Tori for being there for me. I appreciate it more than you will ever know.
