I've been reading a lot about this little seen phenomenon lately. Everyone's heard of Roswell, you have your ritualistic alien sightings, you have Sasquatch; basically, your big myths. Well I was reading about one in this very informative BLog, click  urlLink HERE  to read it, about this seldom-seen natural phenomena as of a few months ago.  It's apparently a unit of the  Homo sapiens . It's a female, sub-phyla LINDSEY sub-genus REID. They say once in a blue moon you can see her waltzing into a fifth period European History lunch, but you have to look  REALLY HARD . And you guys won't believe this but... I SAW ONE TODAY . Didn't the rest of you? O saints, I flipped out! I saw it! Actually, you all did too, because this entire post is just a wheelbarrow of horsepuckey trailing back to the main point:    ~*H~*E*~*Y*~*A*~  ~*L*~*I*~*N*~*D*~*S*~*E*~*Y*~  ~*W*~*E*~*L*~*C*~*O*~*M*~*E*~  ~*B*~*A*~*C*~*K*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~*!*~    It was just like, "Whoa," when she walk'd in,  that  was unexpected. Well, I knew she'd be in at sixth, but JEEZ. Scaring us like that, what a welcome surprise. Welcome back to the grind Linds, at least a bit of it at a time, and good to seeith ye again.
