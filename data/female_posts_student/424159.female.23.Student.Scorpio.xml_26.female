You never really know your co-workers untill alcohol is involved.  Laughs, jokes, crude comments, and general rediculous behaviour is observed.  Eddie and Dave were in charge of "Fear Factor".  AKA, we ate raw eggs and assorted goodies ranging from goldfish to earthworms for a grand prize of $105.  I made it to the last round (all 4 of us did), but some chick was just chugging down the God Awful blended creation that was chicken gizzards and hearts, the left over goldfish, the left over earthworms, the left over raw eggs, and god only knows what else Eddie and Darlene put in it.  The shit smelled like fish and tasted like ass.  God it was nasty.  I almost puked it up twice.  Afterwards, we went back to Dodge's and chilled.  They ate pizza and chatted while I passed out on the couch.  I barely got any sleep and I STILL feel like shit....  What a delightfully successful party.
