You do have the ability to stay under water for extremely long time periods, but you do not breath the water, nor have gills or fins (just some slight webbing). You always live near water, and often keep safe holds for your goods in hidden underwater caves. Some of your kind actually spend more time in the water than out, and thus how your kind developed the strange marine coloration of blues, greens and yellows.    urlLink Which'>http://quizilla.com/users/Lorac/quizzes/Which%20Elven%20Race%20are%20you%3F/">Which  Elven Race are you?    brought to you by
