I'm a stubborn person, and I agree that you must be versatile in order to make progress, but what happens when you stubbornly know the right answer and no one will accept that fact :P? But, nevertheless, a change of mind is good for everyone once in a while. It helps us open up our minds and, indeed, make progress. But often when you've been holding a certain opinion about something and you change that opinion, people will look upon you as a sort of hypocrite or traitor of sorts. But who cares? Their opinions never matter anyways.
