Not that we could normally afford a car that new, but it was a really insanely good deal.  There was another car, a 2004 Hyundai Elantra (what we had before, only uglier) that was even cheaper, but it was...not so cool.  And my dad liked this one better.  And we bought it.  There's a new car in our garage.  And I think that's cool.  I think this is the first time we've bought a new car.  No, the van was new.  But it was older.  And it's a van.  I mean, come on.  Anyway.
