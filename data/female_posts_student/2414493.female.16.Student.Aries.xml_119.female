I know how things go. I hope Pegleg saw him there and gave him a hard time. Knowing Pegleg, I'm sure he did something to that extent. I can just imagine. I am, by no means, jealous. Just insanely amused. "Guess who I talk to more?" Nights on the balcony.   I'm tired.  We saw this "cute" waiter at Macaroni Grill, too. When we walked in, he stared at me and for a second, I was just about to laugh and think that Scott had somehow transplanted himself down to TO and cut his hair. That's just not right. That's the second imaginary Scott sighting, hah. But it's funny enough, I see bits and pieces of YSP people wherever I go.  We're angry people around these parts.
