I was in the journalism room after school, and Mallory came in, and the Gill told her that I had a papercut on my tongue, and that I'm tryin not to talk.  So she starts laughing, and asks if thats why I didn't ask ne questions in Boswell's class.  So I nodded; "So why aren't u talking then," she asked.  "Cuh I talh lie thith [Cause I talk like this]."  EVERYONE started CRACKING UP.  BTW, in case ur wondering why there's a papercut on my tongue, heres the story.  I volunteered to head up the Quill and Scroll mailer, which basically tells evry1 that they got in (to the juniors, congrats Mallory, Yasmin, Zach, Brittany B. AKA BRITTNAY, Greg G., Katie J., and that other junior who got in).  What that involves - a whole lot of licking envelopes and folding paper into thirds.  So I was almost finished when SOMEONE's letter edge cut my tongue.  Stupid Alex. I believe that everyone has definite strengths and weaknesses.  Cause my strengths r too numerous to mention (jk), I'll keep it to two things I'm really bad at - swimming fast, and doin any math problems related to geometry.  First the swimming thing - if you ever see me at the Y swimming rele slow, don't make fun, cause I'm prolly doin laps lol.  It's a bit embarrassing, but my eleven year old sister beats me almost every time, unless I cheat.  Second, I'm terrible w/ geometry, as I said before.  Why do u think my PSAT score is kinda low (1220)?  I'm probably gonna spend most of tonite reviewing geometry for the SAT tomorrow.  I'm not all that nervous but I want to make at least a 1250, which means I need to seriously raise my math score.  I had a 560 on my PSAT, and I want at least a 600 (assuming my English is relatively close to my PSAT score, I'll have a 1260).  If I study a lil bit tonite, eat a good breakfast and sniff sum special aroma to relax me (no u stupid potheads not that kind of aroma...lavender), I should get at least 10 points higher.  As long as I'm above 1200, I'll be somewhat happy. Speaking of happy, I was sooooo happy in Math Analysis (I was actually sayin to myself I'm happy, I'm happy, which must have pissed off Shaheen, Monique, Michael, and all the other ppl that sit next to me).  I can't say why tho, cuz it will REALLY piss off someone who told me this with the hope that I won't pass it on.  But still, I'm happy, I'm happy... Well since I can talk again, and my tongue has cooled off, I'm gonna leave it at here.  I'll end this one with an extremely funny quote from the Gill - "She was licking his..." - she meant to say envelope, but couldn't remember what, so it sounded dirty.  lol.  One more thing...I was previewing the entry for typos, and I clicked on my friend's name Yasmin...yeah Yasmin is a form of birth control.  Later.
