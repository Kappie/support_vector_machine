A box is useful for lots of things like keep old magazines and old stuff we don't use anymore but we don't want 2 throw out...    we can also use a box to make something like a television...yeah, a television, not like real televisions but a cool television that doesn't transmits any program...ok, it's useless...  ***take care***
