Well, there were only two other people that I hadn't met...but anyway, yeah. There's Brandon, the bassist, and Eric, the other guitarist, other than Sherika. They're pretty cool, and apparently Brandon likes me. But he's 18 and...disgusting. I mean, aside from what Sherika's told me (he's a perve, he's immature, he thinks the world revolves around him, he's rude and disrespectful, etc.), I've formed my own opinion about him. He's a total perve who tries too hard. Eric's cool though. He's very funny and, according to Sherika, very patient. But, he does have to put up with Brandon, so it's understandable. He's also, like, a freakin' genius. He's skipped two grade levels in the past, and so he's already graduated. He just turned 16 this year. I was like, "Alright! Someone to help me with my Algebra 2 homework!" And my other adoring fan Xavier didn't show up to practice today. Aw...too bad! I was really looking forward to him sitting there making gaga faces at me for two hours again. Hm...now all I have to do is get Eric to like me and I'll have the whole band in the palm of my hand, Mwahahahaha!!!!!! Okay, so, this day turned out well after all, I guess. But I'm gonna go to bed now. I have an eye exam at 11:20 tomorrow, and I'm hoping I'll wake up in time. Summer vaction is making me lazy...          Song of the Moment-"Forever We Will Last"- Illegal Operation (Our Band!)     Why?- Because it's just such a beautiful song. I'll type up the lyrics one day maybe. I have to learn it for my "audition" in which I'm competing with...no one else. I hope I make it!
