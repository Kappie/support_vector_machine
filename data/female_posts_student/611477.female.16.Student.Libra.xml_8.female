(Just as a reminder for when the Acrylics Anonymous folks come by to approve me. ;) )     urlLink And the rest   I was up all night finishing that... really.  Bound off at 2:45 or so... considered running it through the wash then, but figured that may wake the natives.  Instead I tossed it aside and tried double knitting.  In theory I understood it... and coincidentally enough, I was actually able to do it.  For now I'm trying to make *one* fingerless glove - not one of those wimpy things which goes to the knuckles, but rather a glove which has half-fingers or some such.  Just one.  Not writing down the pattern.  Was I really up all night?  Yeah... I did get a bit of sleep from about 8:45 - 9:30 this morning... summer.  But the FMB...  you'd think I could listen by now, but no.  Ran it through the wash inside a sewn-up towel used for bathing the cats.  Really, I don't mind the white flecks.  I think it could be shrunk a little more than those pictures show....  Unfelted, the base was (about) 18" x 16".  Now it's about 12" by 14".  Before a trip through the Washing Machine of Doom, the height was about 12" - can't be more than 8" now.  (Note to self: Next time, smaller base and taller sides)  Yeah, I didn't do anything like blocking or shaping yet.  If/when I run it through the wash one more time I'll try something more involved than hanging the bag from two chairs and putting a massive dictionary wrapped in Wal-Mart bags inside.  (Ayup.)
