He's been acting werid, rude, mean, greedy, and just an ass for the last 3 weeks but yet we all thought it was because mom took him off some pills!! Boy, were we SO wrong!! Brian, Amanda, John, and Sarah have even noticed the change in his attitude -- They don't like it! Heck, they don't even stay at the house that long due to his bull shit.  However, Seems like everything that happened 2 years ago -- is about to happen all over again.  It was the reason I moved out, it was the reason mom had a heart attack, it was the reason for a lot of things that happened and yet I can't do anything to stop it nor can anyone else. I just feel bad for mom because she doesn't deserve this sort of treatment especially with all the shit she puts up with and does for him/us/everyone.  I need out...  I need out soon...  Why is it every time you think everything is going to be okay... It never turns out that way?! No matter how hard you try to see the good... the bad creeps back up and breaks your heart!! Maybe someday all this will change but I highly doubt it.
