YES! thanks ry, you are the  best . i can't  breathe  very well right now, its wierd. im like hypervenilating ha. we named ryan's  fisheys , but one is dying as we speak. we are watching him carefully. :( its sad,  spazy mcgee  was/is my favorite! at least we still have  jonah  and um  blow (aka leonard). We will get new ones for ryan's birthday. fish are easily replaceable. but  spazy just came back from the dead!  he is freaking out, its like every ten minutes he  dies  and then ten minutes later he's  alive ! i went  swimming  today with justin and his friend marco, it was fun. i threw a  rock  at justin cause he pushed me in. it was the same spot that i went with lance, but this time i wasnt attacked by any  snakes ! (phew) but some fish tried to bite me. my  birthday  is so soon. for anyone who reads this, my house  friday,august 20th, around 8pm , we're having a little get together with  ice cream  and  brownies  and  homemade coldstone  and all that good stuff. so  you are invited ! but call me first, so i dont have a million unexpected friends... just got word from ryan: Spazy McGee has officially finally passed away. :'(
