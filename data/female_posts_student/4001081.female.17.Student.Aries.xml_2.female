But does maturity matter? That is the deep question I would like to answer today.  To be mature. Defined by Websters as "the state or quality of being fully grown and developed." Well, I am fully grown and developed. You are fully developed, but not too grown. Also, "a stage in the development of streams or landscapes at which maximum development has been reached or at which the process of erosion is going on with maximum vigor." Well,  are you being eroded with maximum vigor? I certainly am. That is why I feel I am Mature. Mature like a stock. Mature like a mutual fund. Mature like your mom last night.  But is it really fun to be mature? In the words of the great poet, "why not take a crazy chance? Why not do a crazy dance?" And that is what I ask you, Grace Leigh Young. That is what I ask you.  Ponder. Ponder.  Love always, your Katherine
