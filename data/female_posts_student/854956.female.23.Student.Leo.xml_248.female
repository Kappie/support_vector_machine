I'm also waiting on a returned call to the office about a meeting we're supposed to have before Tuesday.  I need to call Naomi, because she called whilst I was on vacay... and Druck... he called too... and Jennifer called yesterday, apparently, but I still had my ringer off... so I didn't see that she had called til later on.  So much to do... SO MUCH.  But, next weekend should be great because I'm going to @-Town to visit Mel-dawg (and others, if they're available to hang out).  :-)  YAY!  Okay, back to cleaning... and listening to Pink Floyd.  ;)
