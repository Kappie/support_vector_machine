Anyways life sucks right now cuz I keep thinking about my boyfriend who is actually a man prude. I mean im kinda hurt about the way he has been after he asked me out. He never made any effort to be with me and its almost like he didn't think he had to make any effort cuz he just wanted a girlfriend. I don't want him to do things cuz he feel like he has to do them i want him to do stuff on his own but i dont think that will happen very soon. And i kinda miss him and it hurts knowing that he didnt wanna see me that badly cuz he didnt say o lets hangm out before i go away for a month. He hasnt even asked me for my number yet.
