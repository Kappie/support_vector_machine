All that matters is that I got to hang out with uber-hot guys with nothing but a banana sling on.  The way they stuffed those things, they must be keeping the tube sock industry alive.    Had fun at the club afterwards, too- but why is it that only the guys who can't dance try feeling you up in the club??? Only the freaks and weirdos who look like they're doing some bizarre activity from gym class who come up behind you like they're Tony Manero or something.    Anywho, today is just for chilling and drooling over my pics of the guys.  *SIGH*  Later.  ttfn,  *me*
