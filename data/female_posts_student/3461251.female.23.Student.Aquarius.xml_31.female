She didn't say Hello, nor did I.  Which is probably for the best seeing I completely don't agree with anything she's done in the last few months.  I know I have no right to judge anyone for their actions!  But I don't think you should walk away from your own child, so you can go off fucking some guy.  But anyways, after this happened I realized how lucky I am.  I have some of the most amazing friends.    Tonya - She's been there for me through my ups and downs with everything, whether its with my surgery, friends, life, or even that one special guy that makes me smile!  Josh - There's not a day that goes by that I don't think of him.  He's made me realize what a beautiful person I am, inside and out.  He's made me learn to trust again, even when I didn't want to.  And I honestly think he's the only person I know that can get me to smile or giggle, even on my worst days.  I just hope that I make him as happy has he's made me over the last year of knowing each other.  With all these things and so many more, is the reason I adore him, cherish our friendship so much, and love him so dearly.  Tracy - My online dad!  He's stood by me, believed in me, supported me, and so many more things that I couldn't even begin to list.  I love him with all my heart!   Heather, Billy, Jill, Darren - There all amazing people in different ways and no matter what I know they'd be there for me - Just as I would for them! :-)  Friends like this are so hard to come by and the fact there in my life, is what makes me so darn lucky!
