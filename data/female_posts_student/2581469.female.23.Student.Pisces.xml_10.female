(which i've always been extremely lucky to have lived with loads of great people.) i wanted do Go Solo, as they say. but financially it's better to do it this way.. i'll be saving somewhere around two hundred buckaroos per month by having a roommate. most studio apartments i looked at were somewhere between four and five hundred dollars per month. which i understand is cheap compared to, say, brooklyn where my sister lives. she pays three times as much as what i'm going to pay. but. that's the price you pay for living in b-ville.   anyway. i'm sure this is about as exciting as it was for me to experience.. but finding places to live is something most of us folks go through.. i guess.. right?   but. that's where you'll find me now.
