He loves Armani, is seen just as often near a catwalk as competing in sport, confesses an adulation for Kylie Minogue, even designs his own jewellery. But he's not gay.   So Ian Thorpe told Australia in a radio interview last November. With interests outside the domain of the traditional, Aussie, macho male, Thorpe talked about his sexuality for the first time. He was flattered that the gay community identified with him, he said, but he was, in fact, heterosexual. "You know, I'm a little bit different to what most people would consider being an Australian male," Thorpe told ABC Radio.   But he's not that different, at all. Men of all sexualities are taking a greater interest in their appearance. They go to hairdressers rather than barbers; avoid using soap because it's too harsh on their skin; visit the gym instead of playing sport and even have difficulty deciding what to wear.   They're occupying their time differently - not only spending more of it in front of the mirror, but also at boutiques, in bars rather than pubs, enjoying a dance at a nightclub and going to beauty salons. Cosmetics brands such as Ella Bache say men make up as much as 40 per cent of their salon customers in some areas.   Marketers are spurring on the change, dropping the macho element from products that target men. Gone are the tough male images, even from beer and car ads.   Men's fashion chains are growing, with women's stores such as Esprit launching men's ranges, and department stores offering boutique-style experiences. Men's magazines are increasing their coverage of fashion - not just for editorial reasons, but because they're getting more ads. The men's title FHM says its fashion and grooming advertising has increased 35 per cent over the past three years.   Twenty years ago, male fashion, skin care and vanity in general were identified with gay men. Now sexuality, it seems, is irrelevant. In fact, British newspapers have even found a new word for the softer man: the "metrosexual".  ... As the presence of women increased in men's social and working lives - as their rights were belatedly recognised - men have changed the way they act. Straight men, some marketers believe, are changing because women demand their partners take greater effort with their appearance.  "The feminist movement has been the biggest contributor to the men's market since it has developed," says Jean-Marc Carriol, director of the fashion company Trimex, which represents Clarins in Australia.   As women have pushed for equal rights, Carriol says, "the success of that push has fundamentally altered the way men and women interact within the workplace. Appearance and grooming are really important."   The workplace itself has changed for many men, too. As the proportion of white-collar workers grows, so does the need to look good. To compete in today's work environment, you must dress well, have your hair cut neatly and take care of your body.  "There's a lot of categories that are purchased by males, but using what we would conventionally regard as female cues," says Treadgold. "Traditionally, when purchasing home entertainment systems, we would expect guys to be motivated by gadgetry and technical features. But, increasingly, there's a certain type of male choosing it from what might be seen as female attributes, such as the environment of the store, level of service and other intangible things."  Global research by the advertising agency Euro RSCG last year showed that men were more secure in their masculinity, with those aged 40 and above displaying greater sensitivity, particularly through family values.  "The definition of what it means to be male is changing," says Euro RSCG's strategy planning director, Matt Donovan.
