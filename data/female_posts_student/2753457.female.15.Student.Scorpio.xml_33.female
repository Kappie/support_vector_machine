Not only was the room messy and cluttered and could've done with a good sweeping, but it just was not me.  Over the last three and a half years, I kept adding to it but I never took away.  It was awful.  It brought back memories of times when I was even more insecure than I am now.  So I decided to change all of that, and give my room the best cleaning it has ever had.  You would not believe how much crap I threw away.  I was in a ruthless mood; nothing that should've been thrown away was saved this time.  I filled up at least three garbage bags.  And there was also stuff that I'm going to put in the attic, so that it will no longer be clutter!  I swept the floor and beat the African rug.  I took down my old posters, and my bookshelves.  ("Where are the going to put all this, may I ask?" asks my father.")  The only books I need are lined up on my desk now--the rest will go into hiding or be given away.  I lined all my shoes up in the closet.  Even the huge white ape that Hanna gave me for my thirteenth birthday has been rearranged.   Oh oh!  And I found my watch!  That sucker has been missing forever.  I would not have found it under my bed otherwise.  The room actually looks a lot bigger.  And the best part is that now that it's not cluttered, I'm going to focus on moving more stuff in.  I've been meaning to get the Union Jack up there.  Maybe some song lyrics.  I'm so excited.  And tomorrow I've already decided that I'm doing my bathroom.  Wow, I am such a loser.  Getting all excited like this because I cleaned my room up.  But this was not just any cleaning--this was scraping the scum of eighth grade Annie from every inch of the space.  I have the worst habits as it is.  My parents are not exactly clean freaks.  They don't make me clean up my rooms.  Anyway, it made me happy.  It just looks nice; I think it's forgiven me for letting it go rather sour.  It was like getting a really bad taste out of my mouth. I do not understand my father.  Could there be some kind of midlife crisis going on I wonder?  I caught him watching "Made" on MTV today.  What the hell?!  He likes to watch whatever I'm watching I guess.  We watched "The O.C." together the other night, which was kind of funny really.  And he watched "Jerry Maguire" on TNT with me tonight.  That is a good movie.  There is something comforting about a nice 90s dramedy, especially with a supporting role by Bonnie Hunt.  You gotta have Bonnie to be the sister or the best friend, or even the mother. All I know is that I must never never never ever let my room get like that again.  Yay for my new spring break project!
