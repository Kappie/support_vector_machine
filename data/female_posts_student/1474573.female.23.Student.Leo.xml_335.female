First and foremost I'd like to thank my mother for her unwaivering belief in me.  Yes, she drives me crazy, but that woman would not pay the rent for 2 months just to be able to send me to a progressive private school and get the best possible education.  She used to annoy me by not asking how school was going until I found out it was because she never doubted my ability.  This past semester she helped me more than ever, translating the Spanish-class-from-hell's lessons and helping me write sentences and such.  Secondly, my husband, Steve.  Not only is he adorable, but he is the one who convinced me to go back to school after quitting for 5 years.  He's great at pointing out the obvious to me and sticking by my side, from studying musical pieces to explaining Midnight Judges to me and my Political Science 101 classmates at 8am through a speakerphone.  I never would have gone back to school and did so well if it wasn't for him.  You kick ass, honey.  Betsey was always in and out of school too and although we didn't help each other with our respective classes, we were there to give emotional support when things were shitty and we had a test the next day or we had a paper due in 3 hours and we hadn't actually started it yet.  These are the times for people who understand you and your neuroses and she was with me all the way.  Thanks, B.  An honerable mention goes out to Salome for editing my Spanish  composiciones  and even commending me on my improvement over the past couple of years.  Through all the crap, we remain 'there' for each other.   Gracias por todo.     Thank you Marilyn for sitting with me at Graduation.  Us finding each other was like a godsend and having someone to talk to was great!  And lastly, I'd like to thank Bill, Cat, Hope, Akosia, Dwarym, Yvette, Tamara, Melissa, Paul, Ana, Anthony, and Patricia (and some others I'm sure I've forgotten) for hanging out with me in the classes through the years, passing notes with me, and for being generally fun people who made the classes that much more interesting.
