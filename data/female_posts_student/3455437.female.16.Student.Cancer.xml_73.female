I was in getting a hot chocolate, as you do in this freezing weather (not looking forward to mountain weather....brrrr) anyway I decided that i wanted the 3 last marshmellows that were temptingly sitting on the bench. I put one in my hot chocolate and cooked number 2 on the gas stove...waiting about 10 mins "just to make sure" it wasn't too hot, before eating. All good so far. Then I go to cook #3, and getting a bit lazy I only wait about 4 mins for "cooling time" before shoveling in my mouth.....now little did I realise the "stick" the marshmallow was impaled with was actually a metal prong, having an entire absense of an actual stickish make up... i.e wood. Now it is apparently a well advertised fact that metal has a tendency to, actually, heat up when kept in hot flame for a prolonged period of time (ie the the time it takes for my marshmallow to become appealingly black and charcoal-ish). Unbeknown to me at that current time, the "metal prong" happened to be quite challenged in regard to an acceptable temperature for my mouth. So, in keeping with the laws of reason, I received a rather large whitish burn on the left side of my bottom lip, which complements the now peeling, series of other whitish burns on the bottom of my bottom lip (which I can know endeavour to chew off), left from my last rather eventful episode, involving a marshmallow, gas stove, fork and a small explosion.    Common sense must now beg the question..........How *did* Benji pass primary school?
