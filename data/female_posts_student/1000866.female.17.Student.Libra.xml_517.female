Then, we drove around....sort of..umm, "drove by" the houses of the people we like...not that we're stalkers or anything. err...so yeah. That was pretty funny. Unfortunately, he wasn't home. Kelly's was home and Kathryn's wasn't, and MC just doesn't like anyone right now so yeah...no "driving by" anyone's house for her. We sort of almost got into an accident though. It was kind of scary. I just...am so reluctant to drive with teenagers. Oh well. We're all ok, so I'm just thankful for that.  Then we went back to Kel's house and opened presents and stuff. Kelly got me this awesome amazing bracelet with my intials on it. MC got us all these really neat socks. Mine have these ducks on them. They're seriously AWESOME. And Kathryn got me this hat that makes me feel ghetto. Oh yeah! Word. She also got me this hair clip that's really pretty. Soo, fun stuff really. Good times. Then we sat around and talked for a long time.   It always feels so reassuring to have them. I'm not sure why, but whenever I go out with them, I feel so reassured like...they'll always be there for me. They never let me down. There are tensions between people and arguments sometimes but in the end...we know we can go to each other if something's really wrong.   Tomorrow, I guess I'm going to go to Justin's church for rehearsal for Sunday. I'm playing at one of their services. It should be a rockin' good time....  I think I'm actually going to go to sleep. I'm so tired I can't think straight right now. I definitely just went downstairs to get the scissors out of the drawer down there and I definitely tried to put them away in the refrigerator...whoops.
