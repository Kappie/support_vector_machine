But damn it, we've got Art homework. :( Hehe, I've got this inbuilt thingy where I can totally ignore people and I'm trying it out on Rosie, not that she'll notice, and not that I care. Any way, on the point of two mile radiuses (who mentioned that?) as I was saying, no one gets our humour! Seriously! They either go uhuh, or run away scared! Ooooh, fun! Or pretend to which is even funner! So ok, I have to plan my party! Yeah... we could kill Izzy! Uhuh... or we could just go and see a movie. SPIDERMAN?! Yeah! Or just have another water party! Yeay! But the thing is, only rooom for 7 in a car... and 5 people including you lot so who else? I wanna have three heads the day after I give out the invitations you know! Oh and MR FOPPLE! Hurrrrrrrrrrrry up!
