AND she said i can come home for the summer if i wanted to, and work in houston.  that would make me so happy... i could save money, and i'd be able to afford a 1 bedroom place in the fall! that's the plan as of today, i'll let you all know more later..   but yay i'm so happy to be happy again. those 15 hours really got to me :).  OH, so i have this beautiful plan for tonight.  in about 30 minutes i will be heading to the rec to watch law and order. (while i run). OH BUT LISTEN TO THIS PEOPLE. THE REC AT UNT IS AWESOME...  every treadmill and alot of the eliptical machines each have thier own flat screen tv on the front of it so you can watch tv on wahtever channel you want, right in front of you, while you work out..... just stick your headphones in and go to town. is that not the most awesome thing you've ever heard???  then, i'm going to come home and do some spring cleaning in here.... yay! then some international relations, yep yep. (si si).  okay time to go! bye!
