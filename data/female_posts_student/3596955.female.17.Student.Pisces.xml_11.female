After all, with the HSC being the prevalent hindrance behind my social life, I have the tendancy to forget it is merely a blessing in disguise. If employed well, my current goals  aspirations will be accomplished!  Ever think about the blessings God showers us? That we happen to overlook nor barely acknowledge it as we, ourselves are dwelling in the past, remorse or emotion. I myself am reduced to such prolonging. But Saturday Night impelled me to look around  count my blessings. And let me tell you - I am blessed. It never occured to me that a living in Australia was a blessing. Being the radiant country she is, Australia is considered one of the finest, amongst the OECD countries. Its GDP is increasing, imrpoving the economic forecasts of prosperity  welfare of the nation. Its home to so many beautiful people, people who have evidently bequeathed footprints in my life. Whether they were there at that one moment, whether they are about to embark into my life or whether they have been here from day one, God equipped me at that moment with that special individual. And let me tell you, He has equipped me well!  I warned you I may acquire the power to draw you into pondering! hehehe! But I formidably invite you to count your blessings.  Patricia! I love you to bits! But toothpaste? Come off it. Whatever you're on. hahaha. Coleen came over today =) She didn't have the energy to walk home, which in reality is 5 houses away so her father picked her up hahah. I wouldn't blame her. I myself know what playing soccer can do. Last year I was captain. Last year I was goalie. And let's leave it at that hahahah you know what I mean.  Oh dear. smiles =)  -- feeling drive --
