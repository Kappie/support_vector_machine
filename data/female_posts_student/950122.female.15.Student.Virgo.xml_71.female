I did what I thought was right at the moment, but now I realize that a moment can pass by without you even knowing.  We all made decisions, but not all decisions we make are the right ones.   I'm stepping out of the ring. This isn't my fight, but in reality, this never was a fight to begin with. I'm sorry I blew this whole thing out of proportion; making it ridiculously worse. I'm sorry if I coached you on, I'm sorry if I put you down. I'm sorry if what I did made you cry.  My dad was right when he said that this was childish. Friends shouldn’t be fighting over petty things. So I'm letting this go. What you do is your decision.
