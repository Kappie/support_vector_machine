Alright maybe its not that scary, but it looked very creepy blair witch-esque. Its this movie called "Open Water" and apparently its about these 2 divers/snorkelers people that were left behind in the middle of the ocean by their boat. And you get to watch from their point of view what happens to them with sharks and a bunch of other crap. There was this one part where you're watching the girl in the movie have a mental breakdown and then all of the sudden this shark fin goes menacingly by! I guess you had to be there, but me and Lauren freaked out!! We were the only people in theatre screaming lol. It was scary!      Oh yes and i think it was tuesday or wednesday that Roberta was so kind as to send me someone's elaborate photo album of distubing pictures of people i know. Actually, they weren't that disturbing, they were funny, its just that i had a major crush on one of the individuals in the pictures and it was quite odd to all of the sudden to see that guy in that light....if you saw the pictures you'd know what i was saying......yeah, just ask me, i'll tell you the story.      so i didn't really do anything today......Britt was at work, everyone else was at the Relient K concert at Six Flags and Ashley had puffy cheeksfrom her wisdom teeth removal and stayed at home. So i stayed at home and watched I Love the 90's all day. So far i think '97 episode was the best.      Blogger changed their posting thing so now i can change my font and font color!!! which is what i'm going to attempt to do in this entry.      And my mom wasted an ENTIRE BOTTLE of Raspberry Smirnoff Ice tonight. ENTIRE BOTTLE!!! Thats like my fave alcoholic beverage in the entire world and SHE POURED IT DOWN THE FRICKIN DRAIN!!!!! All because she didn't like it!!!! See, at my parent's parties (New Years, Christmas, etc etc etc), since i'm older now, i get to have one of those tiny-ish bottles of that or i get half or whatever......and occasionally my mom will let me share one with her because she can't finish one by herself. Well she was all like "I don't like this raspberry stuff! take a sip!" and i told her i've had some before at one of her parties and she let me have like 3 swigs/sips/whatever and then she took it away from me and started to pour it!!! it was painful to watch lol. sorry to be ranting about my mom's wastefulness, but thats about the most exciting thing that happened today.      $80 from work today! woop woop!      alright i'm out.      Love,   ~~~Taylor~~~
