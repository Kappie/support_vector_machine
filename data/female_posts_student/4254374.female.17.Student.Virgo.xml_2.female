I gagged  spat it out.  Anyway, I was so hungry today (despite munching on chocolate rolls  passionfruit tarts oh no) that I bought a ham sandwich at my school cafeteria. There were 2 slices of raw tomatoes inside. I was extracting them out with a fork when I thought: why don’t I just try it for once? I dislike being fastidious. So I chewed the sandwich readily. It wasn’t so bad after all! Perhaps the ham got some of the taste out but still, I’m glad I’m no longer tomatophobic!  La vida es una buena adventura!
