I was feeling alot better...and it was just a good day. That night went over to Swensons for awhile...just hung out not doing much...so yeah that was Friday.  Saturday: Got up -super- early and got to the school at 7. Went to Emmetsburg for our contests and we got a 1 for band and a 1 for choir. So yeah...I hung out with Tracy all day...it was fun cuz I dont get to see her much...so yeah...it was just a good fun day...very hot...and we had to wear hose...I havent worn that in forever...eh it sucked...but we all looked tan..so yeah I came home and sat outside worked on my tan a lil more and then just watched tv all night..  Sunday:Eh Mothers Day. I must be the worst daughter in the world. *sigh* oh well...we went over to visit my grandma who had eye surgery and has to keep her head down all the time...she was feeling a little better so thats good...then I had to babysit my sweetheart. We went to the park for over an hour and all she wanted to do was swing...so my arms are sore from pushing her alot. But it was fun. She was being so cute. Then went over to Hansens...sat around and ate. Rachel Katie and I went to the basement where it was cool and watched some tv...then last night we had big storms and i hate bad weather. Eh. It was one big dust storm. And a few people I know said they saw a few tornados...eh. I hate those. Anyways thats all that happened sunday...  Today: Eh. It was alright...nice and hot out. School was boring like normal...and in algebra I got all fed up and kinda had a break down. Oh well...Mr Wallinga helped me and its all good. I came home and sat outside for 2 hours and thats about all that happened....I'll write again when something interesting happens...which nothing really does...all I know now is that Kait is goin to the Annual meeting so I wont be alone...tho last year I really wasnt..but I'll just keep that to myself...lol me n church things I tell ya...anyways...later.  ~Tara
