Off somewhere with her friend," replies Adam, shrugging. "You let go of her? Sounds like somebody needs some friendly bacteria!" says Mickey, whipping out a Yakult. Adam laughs and shakes his head. "Are you still thinking about Morcheeba?" says Mickey knowingly. "Who's Morcheeba?" says Adam. "Oh you mean Jane?"  "Yeah whatever, Morcheeba Jane, Jane Morcheeba, same thing..." The two sit, watching the party. Then a girl comes over and sits next to Adam. Mickey's eyes brighten and he goes to sit next to her. "Has anybody ever told you that you look like Emma Watson?" he asks her in his "romantic" voice. "Is that meant to be a compliment?" she says disgustedly, and consequently turns to Adam. Adam is shocked upon seeing her amazingly beautiful face and nearly does the whole open-mouth thing again. "I'm Adam," he says. "I'm Jess," she says. And before he can stop himself, "Want a drink?" "Sure," she says, smiling. "Just a Coke thanks." "OK."Adam leaves and gets the drinks. On his return, Mickey is gone, but there are mice drawn conspicuously in chalk on the wall. "Sorry about Mickey, by the way," explains Adam. "He gets a little... excited, sometimes."  Jess smiles nervously. "So," says Adam. "You having fun?" "I'm thinking it could get a little better," says Jess suggestively. "Oh really?" says Adam, amused. "Yeah." Jess moves up until she is right up against him.  Oh my god. Am I sweating? I'm sweating. This can't be good. Sweat isn't good. Why am I sweating? This guy is sexaaay! OK. Not quite as sexy as his mate, that Mickey guy, but I'm hardly gonna admit to liking  that  weirdo.  She's so beautiful. Wow. I think he likes me. I hope he doesn't try to get it on too soon. I always seem to attract superficial, shallow man-sluts.  Eww. He's sweating. Um. Shall I move away now? I don't want my new top to get wet... Jess moves off.  What should I do? OK, she's slowly moving off my arm. Did I scare her? Oh god it's the sweat, isn't it? It's always the sweat. It's cos of that advert, "All girls prefer dry men". That's what it is. I knew I should have gone and bought some Lynx.   "Well I'll see you sometime. Would you like my number?"  Play it cool. Cool is the word. Or funky. Funky could be the word too you know. Shut up Mickey voice! Where is my Ryan voice? So. I want her number. Can't seem too desperate though, don't want to seem like a man-slut. Ok, breathe. Then say "Um, I guess" casually. Ok, go.  "Um, I guess," says Adam casually. "Ok, here you go," says Jess.  Woah, she has phone number cards? Posh! But I guess she's quite rich. That's good I guess. Jane's rich too though. Cool. I attract rich girls. That means rich dads.  Jess leaves.
