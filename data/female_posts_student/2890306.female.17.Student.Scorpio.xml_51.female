Like a mom.  What would a mom do if she couldn't fuss over you and make you clean your room?  And what would you do without her fussing and making you do it?  Everyone needs a mom.  And a mom knows this.  And it gives her a sense of purpose.  You get it?'  'Yeah,' I said even though I didn't."   Oh, exciting (semi) news!  I am nominated for Looking Best in a Tee Shirt and Jeans for the Drammy Awards.  Hehe!  How completely flattering!  *smile*  Anyway...  Today, I was having trouble calming my mind for some unknown reason.  Reading always soothes me, so I picked up  The Perks of Being a Wallflower  that I recently rented from the library.  In it, the narrator mentions a song by The Smiths called "Asleep".  It is a simple melody and simple words, but it calmed me down.  This was partly because I was reminded of being a kid again, in bed after a long day outside.  I have been wanting to revert back to my childhood lately, judging from recent posts.  I hope tonight you'll join me in remembering yours.  Click play.
