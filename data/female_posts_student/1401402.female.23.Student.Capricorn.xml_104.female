Not that I am complaining but damn I have to find something that is base on a true story and plus I have to get in contact with the author. Amazingly, I’ve got a few replies back and I think I found the rite one. This is just a friendly reply from D. Dexter Vizinau, a very handsome man, in his mid 50’s.   My new novel "Shine On Me'" is the story of a blind African American woman trying to raise two boys on her own in San Francisco during the 50's and 60's.  She was a Gospel Singer/Musician and sang and played the piano to support her family.  This is a story about faith!  Shine On Me is the story of my mother.  I was the oldest of the two sons and basically had to be my mother's eyes.  This book is full or emotion, drama, passion, suspense, humor, religion and sin.  Margaret Vizinau had four strikes against while living in San Francisco.  She was a woman in a man's world, she was a single parent, she was Negro, and she was born blind.  Shine On Me is for adult reading and contains strong language.  I will have a limited number of first edition (officially unedited) copies for sale this Saturday Night.  They will be on sale during our Holiday vendor party at Kimball's Carnival, and at Phillip Bell's Annual Holiday Party at the Oakland Downtown Marriott.  I will be signing books at Kimball's from 9:00pm until 12:30am, and I will be signing books at Phillip Bell's Party from 1:00am until closing.  I hope to see you Saturday night.  Below is a copy of the Prologue which is at the beginning of the book.  Thank you, D. Dexter Vizinau Author  Prologue      It is a rainy Saturday in the Fillmore district of San Francisco.  The year is 1959 and it's just before Christmas.  Eight-year old Dexter is looking out of their front window watching the rain drops fall and keeping an eye on the cars as they travel up and down the busy streets.  He is nervous and has a sinking feeling in his stomach.  There is a chill over him that's causing him to shake even though it's warm inside the house.  His younger brother, Hank, is in their bedroom playing with toys on the floor.     Margaret is adding the final touches to her makeup, applying a little face powder to her cheeks and some lipstick to her puffy lips.  Dexter approaches the dresser and watches his mother make herself up in the mirror.  He is used to seeing her look at herself in the mirror even though she is blind and cannot see.     It's not easy being a female like Margaret in the big city of San Francisco in the fifties; she has four strikes against her that makes it especially difficult.  One, she is a woman in a man's world.  Two, she is a Negro woman.  Three, she is a single parent with two small boys.  And four, she's been blind since birth.     When Margaret appears to be finished with her makeup Dexter asks, "Baba, why can't I go with you"?  She cuts him short with a stern "NO, you can't go and stop asking me.  You have to stay here.  I know how to get around by myself, boy.  I got around on my own long before you were born and I can get around just fine now".  Tears begin to form in his eyes and he begs "Please Baba, please you need me to take you".  He has thoughts of someone trying to steal her purse, or attacking her, or even worse being hit by a car.  Margaret is getting angry now and becoming impatient with him "Look, you can not come and stop asking me".     Since Margaret's two children have grown into little boys, they have been her guides.  And with Dexter being the oldest he has stepped up to the main responsibility of guiding her since their father left when he was five years old.  Because Hank is the youngest, to Margaret he has always been the baby and has less responsibility.     When the children are not escorting her on outings, Margaret's mother and friends will usually take them about.  On this occasion no one was available and she is Christmas shopping for gifts for the boys and she doesn't want them to know what she is buying.     Margaret turns from the dresser, pauses, and takes two-steps forward turns a perfect right and then a left.  She walks through the bedroom door, and makes a right, and walks down the hallway to the closet on the left.  "Dexter, I need my blue overcoat".  He takes her hand and puts it on the blue coat trying not to let her hear him cry.  She quickly scans her hand towards the top of the coat, reaches for the hanger, and pulls the coat from the rack.     She stands by the front door and turns towards Dexter and says, "Bring me my purse off the dresser".  Dexter goes to get the purse and Hank comes out of the boys' bedroom and runs over to his mother "Baba, where you going"?  "I have to go out and do some shopping".  Dexter returns and Margaret opens the purse and brings out her money pouch.  She instructs Dexter to check her money.  First, he counts the ones, then the fives, tens, and twenties.  He confirms the money and stands by sobbing, "Yes Baba, it's okay".  Margaret tells her sons, "You boys behave while I am away and don't let anyone into the house.  Hank if you get hungry, you can have anything in the refrigerator.  Just don't make a mess.  And Dexter, there is some soup on the stove.  All you have to do is heat it up.  The crackers are in the cupboard.   I'll be back before dark and I'll call you a little later".  Hank says, "Okay, Bye Baba", and pulls on her coat sleeve.  She leans over and gives him a kiss and he heads back to the bedroom to watch the Little Rascals on television.     Margaret puts her money pouch back in her purse and feels inside for her collapsible white cane with the red tip.  She grabs the black knob at the top of the cane and lets it drop.  She pulls on the leather strap and the cane becomes tight, and Dexter hands her an umbrella.      Margaret steps towards the front door and searches for the door handle, she quickly turns the knob.  Dexter now frantic stops her and cries, "Please Baba, please, take me with you.  It's raining outside and I need to go with you, something could happen".  Angrily she shouts, "Boy if you don't stop and let me loose, I'm going to whip you till you don't see tomorrow, now let me go and behave yourself until I get back".     Margaret heads out the door and uses the cane to find the top of the stairs, "Tap, tap, tap" on the ground goes the cane.  Once the cane slips over the edge at the top of the stairs she reaches for the banister and begins her descent.  Dexter stares at her through the glass front door and watches helplessly as she reaches the sidewalk.  He quickly runs to the front window to watch her travel down the street.  The rain is pouring down and the wind is fiercely blowing.  Dexter is looking for her but he can't see her because she is under the overhang of the window trying to get her umbrella up which is useless because it is so windy.  It just blows inside out.     With a plastic scarf over her head Margaret begins her journey down the sidewalk, "Tap, tap, tap" goes the cane.  Dexter is in the window attentively watching his mother and crying "Baba, Babaaaaa".  His face is so close to the window it's fogging up.     The intersection of Waller and Fillmore Streets is a busy one.  It's a major throughway in San Francisco, running from South to North.  The bus Margaret wants to take is the Twenty Two Line and the bus stop is one block up Fillmore Street at the corner of Haight Street.  Cars travel fast heading up Fillmore and there is no stop sign or signal.     Margaret reaches the corner and stops when the tip of the cane slips over the curb; she decides to cross Fillmore rather that turn at the corner and cross Waller where traffic has to stop.  Young eight-year-old Dexter begins talking to himself, "No, not that way, go the other way"!     Margaret is standing at the curb with her head turned and tilted; she is listening for the traffic, trying to determine when she should step off the curb and go.  A man walking up Fillmore doesn't pay attention to her and keeps on walking.     The sound of the traffic is dying and Margaret steps off of the curb and pauses, then proceeds, "Tap, tap, tap" go the cane.     Dexter's eyes are full of tears and the rain is beating down on the window, he wipes away the fog to get a better look.  He watches as his mother steps into the intersection and taps her cane as she crosses the street.     Suddenly it seems out of nowhere Margaret hears a loud engine heading in her direction.  It's a large delivery truck, the kind with a big cab on the back.  The driver doesn't see her because he is fumbling with the radio.  Baba hears the truck almost upon her and freezes.  Quickly the driver sees her and slams on the brakes and stops just short of hitting her.  Dexter sees this and yells out "BABAAAAAA".  The driver rolls down his window and yells out to Margaret "You black bitch, you almost got yourself killed".  Margaret just says "Thank you, Lord" and continues to walk in faith.     Dexter continues to watch from the window.  The wind is blowing and the rain is pouring down.  He watches as his mother reaches the curb, turns and taps to the next curb, to cross Waller Street where there is a stop sign.  She again listens then steps off the curb, taps across the street, steps up, and continues until she is out of his sight.  He leans on the glass, which is foggy and wet from his breathing and wiping, and just weeps.    After reading the prologue I wanted to shed in tears, I mean the story itself  is so sad, I felt like I was actually there, now I cant wait to see the movie (if they ever make one) sigh*.
