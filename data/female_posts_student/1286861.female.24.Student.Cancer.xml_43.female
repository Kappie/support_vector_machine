You know the tune...How many of you read that WITHOUT singing it in your heads? That's what I thought.  Yes, it is Brenden's birthday and I have yet to see him. I worked today and he looked for work today...Along with hanging out with the guys and helping John move back into his dorm room. He keeps telling me to not make a big deal out of it, but I cannot help it. I want to...Which leads to another problem of being broke and not being able to afford anything to get him. I think I will make him a card.   I am really growing impatient with my mother. She loves me, that is very obvious and very clear. It is only the fact that I see her and her love on a daily basis. I love her too...But I would be more apt to show my love if I was able to be a independent 23 year old...In the complete sense of the word that is. I live on my own, I pay my bills, I work full time, I am in a serious relationship...But yet I still find myself calling mom for a ride home. It is getting to me in such a bad way!  Work is moving downhill yet again. There was a bright spot when Ann was hired in the back office, and it still is. More estrogen was what I needed in the office. But there is still something that is off. Maybe, I think, I just don't like it. More research is needed on the subject.  I'm in love. Somebody help me. I no longer control what I do or say so do not blame me for things that may offend. It is the inebriation from the drug amore...There is no cure. At least not to this one.
