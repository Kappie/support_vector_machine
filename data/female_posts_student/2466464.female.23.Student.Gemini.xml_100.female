Major  I've decided to major on Emergency Administration  Disaster Planning.    Summer school  I  dropped my summer classes (Non-linear Editing  Television Lighting), my teachers weren't teaching much, truth is they weren't teaching anything, they're extremely overpaid bums.   Mum  My mum wrote me an email! Her first ever! Go mum!   Philosophy  It took a two month chase but i finally got my groovy philosophy professor to correct my grade from a C to a well deserved A.   Blogging  This is my #100 post!
