Aaron and i stayed up until like 3:30 am my time and 4am his talking. Then we talked this morning, actually, we're talking right now. My dads neighbor, Peggy, who is like maybe 60 or 70ish called and asked me if i wanted to go watch her senior citizen linedance class. I of course said sure, and thanked her for thinking of me. I mean...she did think of me, and how i was here all by myself and i couldnt make an excuse, because im not like busy or anything. And i can always go to the pool, even though i was gonna go swim. So...im just about to leave for a senior citizen line dancing class at the senior community center. wow...lol she made sure i told my dad i would be safe and its just a bunch of senior citizens so they dont do anything too wild...sounds like sooo much fun. naw, it will be nice to get outta the house. then when dad gets off work we're gonna go eat chinese and go to walmart and costco and prob. sams club. Fun stuff. Anyways, my senior citizens are calling. *much love*
