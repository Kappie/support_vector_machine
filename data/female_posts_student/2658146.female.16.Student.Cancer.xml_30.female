In a kindof happy fuzzy cuddly bunny way. I'm ashamed to say that, since I'm supposed to be Dave's loyal girlfriend. Especially since he's going to Nevada for two weeks and I promised him nothing would happen while he was gone. I just emailed him saying I wouldn't meet anyone. I guess it's true since I already know the who. I wonder if the who whats me, but the who usually avoids those types of questions. The who won't even answer questions about our friendship. I really have no idea what the who's opinion of me is. Maybe I could get Monchan to weasel it out of him. But then again, I had her do that a while back and he apparently didn't. But I still have to take into account that the who is good at hiding how he feels (most of the time) and may have kept it a secret this whole time or maybe developed feelings recently. *sigh* I'm really hopeless.  Monchan was really upset about the prank last week. I hope she'll realize that it's my fault for agreeing to go ahead with it and that me and Dave are fine. The only thing left is me needing to forgive myself for doing it, which isn't going to happen any time soon. Me being mad at her for it hadn't even crossed my mind until I read her DeadJournal. I'm still not mad at her though. Maybe I'm too forgiving, or maybe she's too paranoid. I don't know. In any case, we're both at fault for the prank, but nothing is going to get accomplished by being mad at others for it.  Dave has noticed me changing. We talked about it a lot the other day. I weaseled a lot of things he disliked about me out of him. He apologized for saying what he did the next day. I really don't mind him saying things like that, as long as he still loves me for the whole instead of only little bits here and there. He had made some valid points about most of the things he said, and apparently I'm either not changing fast enough or I'm not changing the right things. I feel bad talking about us though, seeing as the who lurkes in the back of my thoughts every now and then. He'll dissapear from my thoughts, but it's only temporary. I'm so selfish and unloyal. I don't know what I should do with myself. I'm such a disgrace. I think this predicament will lead to a much bigger problem in the future...   Current Mood:  Worried
