I feel like I am forever just one all-nighter away from pure artistic genius, and if I just had the courage to face myself, I could really do some masterful stuff.   Music : Cure, Wish; Loretta Lynn, Van Lear Rose.  Mood : Frustrated, Sleepy.  Miscellany : I dreamt the copier at work now xeroxes in color. I can't figure this inane dream out. Ideas?
