My Math teacher is a slave driver, and kindly gave us a huge assignment when he knows it's prom weekend.  I can't believe he expects it to get done.  What a loon.  I want them to play Rent music at Prom.  But I know it will be rap and country.  boo that. Oh well, not much I can do about it.    *Sits bored in prom dress*
