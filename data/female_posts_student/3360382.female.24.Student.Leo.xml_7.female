On May 5th my supervisor informed me that my hours would be decreased for the first half of the summer because our hours of operation changes over the summer so therefore we close earlier than usual.  On that note some of the hours will be cut down because the employees whom usually work night shifts will need day hours for the summer.  I understood this change and accepted the fact that I am a part time employee and hours are not quaranteed to me.  However, shortly before my last day a full time employee quit which means that forty hours were available and also two part time employees quit making an additional twenty or thirty hours available.  Interestingly, my supervisor did not mention the hours available to me but she begin interviewing outside people to fill the spots.     In case you are wondering I wasn't terminated I was just told that I did not have hours available for me in the summer in which I only needed twenty hours.  Also, I wasn't the only employee facing this same dilemma three other employees are facing the hour shortage(supposedly).  Furthermore, I have been informed by at least three of my co-workers that my supervisor hired an employee just a week ago and she is part time;I did not mention i that all the employees that were given hardly no hours including myself are all african-american.  I do not intend to upset anyone by making this comment or feeling this way because I see no color difference I think everybody's the same we just have different ways, act different, and see things differently sometimes. I personally feel that it is a discrimination issue, the reason I feel this way is because I have been an employee at this facility going on two years this August and this has never happened until a new supervisor came along and she just happens to be white and ironically the young lady she just hired happens to be white also.       I would like to close and just say this is not a race issue with me or anything it just seems to me that my supervisor has a slight discrimination problem because there are other incidents that have went on and no one has complained or done anything.     My question to any readers of my personal issue is: do you think this is a problem or am I taking it too far?  I honestly feel that this is a problem that needs to be taking to higher management because for no reason should someone hire another individual when it is shortage of hours in-house but they hire outside of the employees whom are already staffed.
