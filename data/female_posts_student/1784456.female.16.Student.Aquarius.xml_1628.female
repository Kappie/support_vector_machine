Sadly the stripper failed to turn up for izzy's party, but we've got johnny depp booked for next year and hopefully he should actually turn up! Yup, that's sleep deprevation kicking in! It was fun though! I had a sudden impulsive urge to watch Muppet Treasure Island but izzy didn't have it so we watched the Christmas one. Then we all had a foot war *so fun!* you have to err... whack the person with your foot... to win. Yup, absolute crap. Well, seeing as this room is getting dark, I'll go and lie down in a different one.
