Today's mood weather ::  sunny  I was going to start off by apologizing for any incoherent thoughts, considering I didn't go to bed until 5 because of...things. However -  Windy just walked over to me and started barking at me. I'm not sure why; I thought at first that she wanted to play, but now she's curled up on the bed with one of Zeus's rawhide bones. Oh, well. I bet I'm not the only one in the house awake any more. She actually spent all night in her playpen. She woke up at about 4:15 this morning (I was, as I mentioned, still awake) and had to go potty. Well, she wouldn't go outside, nooo. Instead, she comes inside and immediatly pees on my carpet. Grr to her too.Whoops, there's one of those incoherent thoughts I was talking about...  Anyway, I'm going to go see if I can't find something to keep her distracted; something that isn't my door. I'll try to post a more meaningful post later, but I'm not sure I'll even be awake, heh.   edit ::  I have a secret...and no, I'll never tell. Ha!    RIGHT NOW    mood ::  sleepy  listening to/watching ::  nothing  eating/drinking ::  chewing gum, yes this early  craving ::  uhhh....hehe  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  last night  wishing ::  nothing really  wearing ::  jeans and a t-shirt  random ::  Windy was looking at herslef in the mirror. I don't think she knew it was her.
