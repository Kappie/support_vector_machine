Went to choir yesterday, no one was there (aka, A!!!), couldn't go to band today because apparently I had an entire frikkin essay due first period, and then I find out in first period that he was giving us the period to work on it, and then my Frodo-boy left, and then music was boring because 1. we were doing theory and 2. Frodo-boy wasn't there! Ackkk! I waited in the Eng. class for like 10 minutes waiting for either Frodo or my english test (neither appeared), I just had an unwanted cold shower, I have to practice piano otherwise there will be a grisly murder in PN's house, I have to write a speech for the debate  on Friday , and my partner is the scary and explosive CM, I need to write my science handout and I don't have my science binder  here , the history Grandma's trunk is due next Monday, and...   *keels over, out of breath*   BTW, in case you hadn't figured it out yet: yes, I do have a crush on Frodo. *sigh* I'm stupid. ^^; but that's okay.
