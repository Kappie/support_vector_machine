I was actually walking a dog around this neighorhood ive never been in, but it was really nice with pretty houses and snow on the ground. lol A guy came walking up to me with brown shaggy hair (kinda like evans) and it flipped out on the ends and he was kinda hot geeky haha if u know what i mean. He looked like the kinda of guy who would sit around playin guitar and reading books that no one has ever heard of. He was walking his dog and we started walking together and talking about just life and what we liked to do. i remember his name it was Grace. haha ok a guy named Grace...how weird, but his named fit how he looked. I fell in love with the guy of my dreams!! haha well he was in my dream..and i did fall in love with him, but he doesnt look like the kinda guy i would go for. He wore these cute black glasses...like the fake ones u buy for just style purposes. thats all i really remember, but i do know that in my dream he loved me back haha of course, it was  my  dream.    oh and happy presidents day!!! yay!!! can i get a WHOOP WHOOP?! lol
