He's good at doing that. Oh well. I got mad and called him a 'fuck face' at lunch today. That's the ticket....impress him with my grand vocabulary that properly displays my intelligence...that will make him see things. Oh well, I was mad. Sam today in physics said I look like Martin. Damn Jew....doesn't know anything! The only thing me and Martin share is our red hair. Other than that, we don't look alike. Oh well. Oh, haha....funny story time! The Clay Aiken Kid (I think his name is Kirk) thinks I am hot. He told Chloe's friend Ariel that. haha. Good times. First I do a kiss and run with him, and then he thinks I'm hot. That kid is seriously blind, I swear. I dunno tho, I just find it funny. Well, I'm gonna go now, other than that my day was pretty much uneventful.
