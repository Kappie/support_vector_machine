It's 1130pm and I'm not falling off my chair from exhaustion like I usually do, probably because I haven't done more than sit at my computer since 11 this morning (when I woke up) to now.  I've been making up for all of the music I lost when I got another hard drive... I've downloaded about 300 files within the last three days.  :)  I even got some new software thanks to Scott :) to help me split movies in half so I can fit them onto cds so they don't suck up all my hard drive space.  While ripping some of my sister's NIN cds onto my pc, I was watching 28 Days Later.  Such a good movie.  My favourite part has to be where Jim gouges the army guy's eyes into the back of his head... I love it.  I really like the movie because it has to do with a highly deadly virus... I've been becoming really interested in that stuff recently.  After I read the Hot Zone by Richard Preston (read the book it kicks ass) I just love learning about viruses and when the next mass extinction will be... I think it'll be within the next few hundred years, so not that long.  Unfortunately I won't be here to witness it.  Ahhhh yeah... Jimi Hendrix just came on.  This is the stuff I've been waiting for allllll night.  I had a fun argument with Scott earlier about his Weezer obsession and he made me listen to some of it, it actually grew on me after awhile... I still haven't convinced him of that.  Plans for tomorrow: -continue to try to convince my parents to let me move the reclining Lay-z-boy (spelling?) into my bedroom -rake the lawn (much to my discontent, but mom wouldn't stop bitching at me for being lazy) -sit on my ass -finish my bag of Starbursts   such a strenuous day... I don't think I'll last through it.  ::rolls eyes::
