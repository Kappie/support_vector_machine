So much so, I failed in attempting to bottle my hatred for it, and try to not insult these people who are just too stupid to continue living. I read the article that that Conrad guy mentioned, and decided to send him an e-mail myself. Its better to try to sound civilized, but sometimes you think, "oh, to hell with civility"    Dear Mr. Christopher Bryon,  This email is in regard to your article on the New York Post, "Give Back Take-Two." After reading your article, several questions arose in my mind, firstly, I question your dedication to actually investigating this game and its actual influences on real people. Furthermore, your seemingly personal attacks on this company, rasises suspicions on the true nature of your comments. Were you perhaps viciously violated by an emplyee of this company? Did someone steal your car, with your prostitue in it, then killed her and took all of her money before you could have your way with her? Maybe you didn't quite realize exactly what you were doing when you wrote this article, and didn't realize the strength of the gaming masses. No, our actions aren't an influence of the overwhelming amounts of violence in video games such as the one discussed in your article. We are powered by our own minds, which also serves to disprove your argument, about video games magically turning the average adolecant, into a brainless, blood thirsty idiot who attempts to rob cars and run over other people to recieve points and cash. The assumptions that all people are indeed so easily influenced by a highly organized series of programming code and images, is completely absurd. The reality is, that we are driven to do something by our own, independant decisions. Truly, religion causes mpore violence and hatred, than a digital disk. Being as this is fact, why not go out and attack religion as well? Its ideals also cause people to think in a certain way, and behave a certain way. Maybe my original proposition on your personal feelings for the company are indeed fueling this mindless attack on a relatively harmless game, which mostly just serves to let other people relieve their frustrations in an envirionment that doesn't actually hurt anyone. How many times have you honestly witnessed a teen, sit and play Grand Theft Auto, then suddenly stand up, and seriously decide "Hey! I'm gonna go sell cocaine and get myself some whores! To hell with scruples!" No times. I suggest that you now stop reading this e-mail, go to the kitchen, turn on your oven, then place your head inside, and wait. Keep waiting, when you can't see, hear or feel anything at all, that's when you know you've waited enough. Now just lay there.   Yeah, its a sad thing indeed. Anyway, I've gotta go try to do some school work now, since I am such a failure. I'll say hello to Satan for ya!  I'm Deadinside, I need some sharp knives.  "A baseball bat! Oh joy! Now I can commit as many crimes as I want, thank you video games!"
