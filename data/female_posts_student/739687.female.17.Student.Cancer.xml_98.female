Monday I began to realize how high my stress level has become, so Tuesday I was so tired of everything that I skipped school and band and SLEPT. Of course, the stress returned by Wednesday; I was up alllllll that night doing a frikkin english project. Thursday was a really good day for no reason at all...just enjoyable.     Friday was one of those days that was in between really good n fairly bad. It was odd, I sorta felt like the center of attention in alot of situations. I also felt crowded by alot of people; in some ways it was kinda cool, and in other ways it was like "get the hell away from me!" So then, I hafta tell you about my great experience after the football game(at which Keller actually won, thank you very much). Ok, so Candace drives me home, and when I get there, both of my parent's cars are gone. Which is odd to say the least at 11:00 at night. And only to make things that much stranger, there's a random unlocked car sitting in the far end of my driveway. Ok, another fact: my front door is IMPOSSIBLE for me to unlock. No one else in my family has trouble with it, but I do. So i try for about 5 minutes to get it unlocked, Manda tries for about 10, and Candace tries for about 15, and finally she gets it open. So we go inside and there is no note or anything telling me where my parents are. How cute. So Manda and Candace leave, and I'm trying to figure out what's going...neither of my parents will answer their cell phones, and it's frustrating me....alot. So finally my parents get home quite a while after 11. Here's the situation: the random unlocked car in the driveway is mine, and my parents had to take my mom's car back to pick up my dad's, cuz he drove mine home when he bought it. Then they went out to eat and came home. But hey, I got a car out of the deal. It's a 97 Accord, in good condition. It's auto and a 2.2 liter, but hey...it runs, right?      So now, on to Saturday. We had area, and we had a really good performance. But of course, Duncanville, LD Bell, Fossil and Haltom go to state. We got 7th, which really isn't that bad. If you think about it, Area is a contest where most bands typically have their best performances.      Yeah, so I feel like going shopping today. I think I just might. Ah well, I'm gonna go now, and get a shower and such. Adios you crazies.
