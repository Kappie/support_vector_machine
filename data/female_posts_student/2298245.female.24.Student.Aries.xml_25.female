But I really needed a nap today.  I was up late reading, and then I awoke fairly early to meet a friend of mine from lunch.  She's my best friend from high school.  We aren't really best friends anymore, because she and I don't talk all that much.  But I still love her to death, and every time I get together with her (which is not all that often - the perils of choosing a college and law school 3000 miles away from home) I feel very happy, and I feel like, even though it's been ages since we last spoke, that it really hasn't...if that makes any sense.  Incidentially, I always say it is 3000 miles from Gulfport to New York....But I do not know this for a fact...I just say it because it sounds right...exact mileage coming soon...
