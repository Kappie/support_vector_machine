But Craig did say he might still be on sometime this week - not to perform but at least to talk. Which is awesome, I really hope he does. But they interviewed some Morrissey fans...you know...for jokes...like asking them to name as many anti-depressents as they could and all that jazz. Har har.  Tomorrow is Friday! I well-waited for Friday! The week went by at a perfect pace! Not too slow - but not too quick either. Now that we are here at the end of the year, I don't the year to end. I don't know why. I know I'm weird but I just am content where I am and then summer is going to come and then summer will be over and we'll have an  entire  year to get through again until the next summer. I don't know why I always do that...even if something good is about to happen...it doesn't matter because then things will go right back to how they were...
