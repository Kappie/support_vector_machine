The bar i can live with but... hmm... i might try a different comment service thing if i cant get this one to work. I want to keep my old comments though... :-\.  But, Fixed the title! and the description and the post titles.  So far i think im doing pretty good for somone with no html experience. Bow down before me, for I am an HTML God!  ha...or not.
