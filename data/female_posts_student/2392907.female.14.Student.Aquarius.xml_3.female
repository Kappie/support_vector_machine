Uh, cool. So his smile is nice. Please stop smiling. "How have you been?" "Hah, still trying to get over last night really." "Me too," chuckles Ryan. "You have no idea," says Jane.  Oh crap, did I say that out loud? Now he's gonna ask..  "How do you mean?"  Great.  "Well, it was nothing really. I bumped into someone. That's all." "Oh really?" says Ryan distractedly. "How about you?" "Oh same old same old.. Mickey my housemate is being a weirdo as usual..."  "Cool, you live with other people?" "Yeh, three others. We're in a band." "Cool," says Jane, rather intrigued. "Yeh, Mickey's a bit strange sometimes, but I have to admit, his quirks are funny too."  Jane starts to fall asleep.  Maybe I shouldn't have asked him about his housemates. God.  "...Jesse found some random chick and Adam... actually, I don't actually..." Jane's ears prick up.  Well, there's gotta be about 10 million Adams in the world.  "...But I think he did, he was that guy with the drinks. Told him to get over some girl. I think she dumped him or something. You know, I'm not too clear on the whole thing myself. I think he knew her since childhood, something like that... I think that's why he got so upset about the break-up..." "I see," says Jane, clearly not seeing.  "Mm hmm." They just sit there drinking for a while.   I wouldn't call it an  awkward silence.  It's kinda nice with him. She's so pretty. I wonder when we have to start recording again. I hope Mickey hasn't eaten the letters again. He has a thing with paper and card. I can't wait! Oh God this is where all my dreams come true. I can't believe it.  "Woohooh!" "What?" "Sorry, did I say that out loud?" "Yes..." "Well I'm really happy because our band got a record deal!" "That's great!" "We've been waiting so long..."  OK, don't bore her already Ryan! She doesn't want to know about your band and whatever. Ask her about  her.  "So, um, what do you do?" "Oh, I'm the manager of a company." "Wow, that's cool. Really cool." Jane smiles. "What does a manager have to do? I never knew what exactly they had to really.." "Haha, not much! I have to go into the office most days, paper work and calling people up sometimes, but my secretaries do that. I don't even know some of them! I have to have lunch and coffee with 'business partners' and people, but other than that, I just lie around.. I'm a normal person, as you can see!" "That must be so cool..."
