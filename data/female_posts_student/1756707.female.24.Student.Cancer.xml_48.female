Not just finding information about people, but creating new information, bouncing around ideas back and forth, etc.  Like Kathleen Yancey was talking about -- I wonder if only communally authored blogs can be used for this?  Which brings up another question: how many purposes can blogs be used for? I have six of them, and one is for a particular audience, one is a private journal on teaching, one is a group bookblog, one is a cooking blog with my best friend, one is something i rarely use anymore, and this one -- they all have different audiences, different purposes...I wonder if I'm alone in this.  Also: we're sitting in the kitchen together right now talking about blogs and I'm typing as we talk.  The intersections in this house between speech, writing, and technology never cease to amaze me.
