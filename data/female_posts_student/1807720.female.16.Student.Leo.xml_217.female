Mainly for that fact that we wrote a unit test today and it just took me a long time.  Some people finished really quick and scored really high.  I want to be one of those people.  No matter what though, it takes me a long time.  I kind of lost my focus near the end of the test too because everyone was being a distraction cause half of the people were done.  I felt like I was under pressure.  That probably lost me a few percent.  The test was difficult, but it was also composed of previous questions from previous diploma's.  I felt really "slow" though, like everyone was good at test taking and like I just couldn't answer anything as fast as anyone else.  I don't know if that is a bad thing, because maybe I just think things through.  I only got a 69% on the test though.  I know the information.  I know I know it.  However, I stopped my self-defeating thoughts this time and told myself that it's "ok."  A mark is a mark, and marks don't determine your future.  Twenty years from now, no one is going to care what I got in Social 30.  Anyways the questions were difficult.  The answers were all so close.  Social exams remind me of reading comp, and anyone who knows me knows that reading comp is the one thing I LEAST excel at.  Not to be degrading or anything, that's just plainly the truth.  I have more things to talk about.  My nightmares about not getting into university, my fears of next year, so much stuff.  I am really tired right now though from all the reading and homework and studying.  Summer School is a lot of work and requires a lot of effort.  This is yet just another challenge for me.  Just another challenge in which I will prove myself.  My dedication, hard-work, effort.  It will be all worth it in the end.
