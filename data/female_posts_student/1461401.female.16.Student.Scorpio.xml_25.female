Katie was still around back then. Yeah, fifth grade. Enrichment. Good friends. I suppose I ought to say something worth reading, but that's not going to happen, trust me. Man this isn't even worth typing, so I'm gonna stop wasting both our time, even if it is just for my own selfish reasons. Meh, it happens. ~Kristin
