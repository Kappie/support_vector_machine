Afraid of things like the water, snakes, spiders, the dark, or just being alone. Well I am afraid of the dark, only when I'm outside alone. When I'm home alone and hear noises... that's creepy, unless I'm on the phone or talking to someone online or if it's mid-day like anywhere from 6 in the morning until like 9 at night. I am afraid of heights if there is a chance for me to fall. I don't mind airplanes or tree houses or things like that, but I don't like cliffs or canyons. The bonfire was so awesome hehe! We had two fires one was mine Ashlyn and Codi's and the other bonfire was Amanda, Erin and John's and we were sneaking around comando style, on our knees and army craling or rolling, so the other thre wouldn't see us. Then we would try to wreck the other's fire. It was such great fun! My dad won't let me drive with any teenagers. It's so stupid! One year and three months (to the day) until I can drive myself where I want to go! Suze and I made up a song! Jizzel fo' shizzel in da hot tub my nizzle, and there's a second verse but I don't really remember it ^-^ Suzy and i are starting a nudest colong! It's great! PBSDC all the way! Clothes such hard core! I'm going Nike, Nike, Italy, France.... Romance! Does time truely exist? I mean how do you know, there will never be a final number. If there is such thing as infeinety than there can not possibly be a final number because infenity never ends! Well I believe I shall call it a night adios! Ciao... Actually never mind about bed this movie just became interesting! Ahh it's so scary! Queer eye for the straight guy is such an amazing show! Guys really need tohave some help dressing! Next year I want to run xc but I know I can't physically cuz of my knees... I feel bad but oh well. I'm going to do cheerleadign and track! Yippie!
