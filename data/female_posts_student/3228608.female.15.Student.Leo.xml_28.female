The plane ride was about 8 and a half hours and was suprisingly easy. during the layover in CHigaco i got to know my fellow travelers a little better. We are a group of fifteen. There are six teenagers, me anna riedel (sp?), a girl named Amanda (16), eddy (17)who is awesomely nice and wants to be a chef, kevin (17)who is really funny and wants to be a cosmotologist, and matt (18) who i talked to for almost the whole layover and is really intelligent. he is going to Boston College in the fall. the drive to stary sacz, which should have been an hour and a half, turned out to be over four because of traffic delays. we stopped to meet and visit with mrs. boron's cousin who had a beautiful garden. We continued, passing through nowy sacz, which has the second largest town square in poland beside krakow. all the building are absolutely beatiful. the area is rich with awesome culture. when we areivved in stary sacz, we went to thr dorm that the teachers would stay at. there were many children ther who knew minimal english. they were trying to ask us questions and makie conversation but all they knew were things like "what is your name". they would ask us a qu8estion and than laugh histarically at us and talk amongst themselves in polish.our host families soon arrived. Amanda and i are staying together with a girl whose anerican name is Joann. we live withe her, her two parents and her younger sister who is 8. the house is very nice. it is three stories high and amanda and i have the third floor to ourselves. we each have a sperate room and share a bathroom seperate from the rest of the family. they are extremely nice and are feedin us every five seconds. joann speaks pretty good english and the mother knows some things here and there. the fatherwalks around with his translation book asking us questions and the little sister just runs aroun whispering to her family and smiling.  today at the school we held placement tests in order to seperate the childeren for classes on monday. as we stood in the front of the gym where they gathered, all eyes were on us. when the testing started, we found out that polish children love to cheat- but they arent very good at it... after that i went with kevin and eddy and three polish girls (including the one who stayed with trisha edwards) to walk around stary sacz. the town is vey quaint and beautiful. we saw a church with a cloistered convent and a market place.tommorow we are going to slovakia (sp?) for the day.  i miss you all alot and wish that everyone could have come with me, but ill have lots of pictures. MUCH LOVE,                ****mary*** p.s.- rae rae, ive thought about you and your family alor and im praying for you. i love you so much!! i wish i could be ther at the funeral today, but that abvioulsy isnt possible, so ill be there "in spirit" and ill be thinkin of you.
