I want everyone to know my deep dark secrets and feelings, muwhahhaa! I guess I can start off by saying, I love you David! After a horrible week, talking to him really cheered me up, I don't know what I'd do without him. I really need to be doing my history homework, but I'm being lazy, so yeah, it'll get done before midnight, maybe. Ah, for the next 5-6 weeks I have after school rehearsals for A Midsummer Night's Dream until 6. I'm really glad I'm a fairy and all, but staying after school does get boring, even though, I'm sure me, Dylan, and Rhonda will get into some sort of trouble together, haha. Well I've gone on long enough, not a whole lot of stuff to say.   I'm here without you baby, but you're still on my lonely mind, I think about you baby and dream about you all the time...
