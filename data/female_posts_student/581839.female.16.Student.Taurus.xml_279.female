Night Shymalan's  the village .   so, i'm like, whatever. so we go see it and i like it quite a bit. it took me a bit of thinking and mulling to decide that i did like it, but i did. anyway. so. we saw it and then came back home and had to clean. and margaret and smith disappeared for quiiite a while to go get goggles and stuff. anyway, so we cleaned, and they came back. mary babysat for the bluhms from like, 4-9. and margaret, andrew, zack, and i went to the pool, but i just went mainly to leave the house. i didn't even have a swimsuit on. i just sat there, mulling, again. i think i've been in a bad mood ever since mary and dad made fun of my weight. the only reason it struck a chord, cause i know they were joking (well, i know mary was, i think), because it just reminded me of how close the pacer is and how much i need to work out, and how little i have been working out. and then, dad decided to take mom out. so, smith and margaret babysat (yeah, more like made out. psha) so, i was all, "whateever." so, i went up to my room, all angry cause smith has been a little mean tonight, and so has margaret, thought they may not know it, and listened to three days grace, "i hate everything about you." good angry music. geez. oh yeah, and i screamed a lot into my pillow. i think i cried a bit too. somewhere in there. the only thing really, that made my day, were two things. one was that i got to talk to annie cause she got back from wyoming today or yesterday i think. (wait, three things). talking to her makes me happy (thanks annie!). second thing that made me happy was i got a postcard from wyoming, from annie. ha ha she's always in my life somehow. and the last thing is mary let me drive her to micky d's to get some mcflurries for the luvers over here, and a coke for her. dang it today kind of sucked. summer of dreams, you abandoned me a month ago. why must you leave me alone like this? OH CRUEL SUMMER OF DREAMS, RETURN TO ME! oh my oh my. well. whats today, the seventh? well, school starts soon. i'll tell you a secret blog. i've been studying ahead of time. on one hand, i'm proud of myself. on the other hand, i'm secretly proud of myself. ha ha. well, this has been one large block of venting, eh? well well. i'm in the library updating this. listening to some wicked bad music. i'm going to cry soon, i can feel it. oddly enough, listening to snow patrol always makes me think of old school memories. like, exam memories, etc. it's kind of fun. but mostly, it makes me want to go back to school (and that's not good, is it?) arrrgh. pirates arrr cool. smith told me a joke last night, right before margaret got mean to me. it was, "where does the king keep his armies? in his sleevies!!" i thought it was cute. i'm still upsessed with the crux anasta. the ankh. i'm funny sometimes. i get so into things. well, enough for tonight.
