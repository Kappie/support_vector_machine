Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah no no nooo  Yeah, you will suck the life out of me  Bury it I won't let you bury it I won't let you smother it I won't let you murder it  But our time is running out But our time is running out You can't push it underground You can't stop it screaming out  How did it come to this?  Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Ooh ooh ooh yeah yeah no no nooo Muse-Time is running out    this song has a meaning but i dont no what its true meanning is yet....
