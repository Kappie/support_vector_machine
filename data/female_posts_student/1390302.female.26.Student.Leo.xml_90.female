I think I hate them so much because I am the kind of person who hates to be inhibited or prohibited in any way.  I think I should be able to do just fine until I start and see all the things I just can’t eat anymore.  The inability to eat all these things nearly drives me crazy!  I can’t say what it is that drives me to only want the things I can not have, but what I can say with certainty is that the things I can eat are crap…so maybe that’s why I only want the things I can’t eat.  Take for instance the Atkins Diet, which is the one that I am trying now.  I HATE this diet, I rue the day that Matt came home telling me he wanted to try it!  Apparently he heard about it on Rush Limbaugh’s show.  Now I hate Rush too, he should just keep to the topic’s he knows about like politics and such!  I am starting to hate everything having to do with carbohydrates, dieting, and all the people that perpetrate them!  I hate to diet. I hate them, I hate them, I hate them…   Guess I deserve this, ya know.  I shouldn’t have eaten all the things that made me gain so much weight.  But, alas, I did and now I am paying the price.  Matt shouldn’t have eaten all the things that caused him to gain so much weight, but he did, so alas I am paying the price.  To make things worse, I think I am addicted to Sugar.  I know, it sounds dumb, but I think I really am.  I crave sugary things; Splenda™, Neutrasweet, all that Crap, just makes me want sugar more.  Then if I eat something sugary and cheat on my diet I feel like shit!  It’s like I cheated and it wasn’t worth it.  It’s never worth it.  I really do think it’s being prohibited that’s keeping me cheating.    Then, with the Atkins diet, if you cheat, you have to start all over again!  The point is to make your body go into ketosis and if you go over 20 carbs then it kicks you back out.  It’s pretty shitty if you ask me.  I don’t know what I am supposed to do, it’s starting to make me depressed.  I am starting to hate myself…What I do know is that I hate to diet!  ~Kristyn
