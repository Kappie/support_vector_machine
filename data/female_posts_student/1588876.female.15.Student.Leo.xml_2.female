"there are sexual predators out there!" she was twisting everyting he said into an innuendo! oh my god! i was so pissed! she watches too much Law and Order SVU. so from now on, im not using that email address anymore. she started comparing me to my oh so perfect sister again...nothing new.  next topic: dirty baby no more? the mom recently asked me for my social security number so she could write off checks and she wouldn't have to pay more taxes. i had a bad feeling when she asked me for that. good thing i don't  know it. so anyway, i told my mom when i got home and se said that was really unnecessary. if she got my ss#, then i would have to start paying taxes! im only 15 and babysitting for 12 bucks a day. i agree with my mom for once. that was really weird. and like i said before, that mother is a total head-case. i mean, can you really trust that someone who uses cloth diapers in this day and age is really sane? this isn't a career for me- it's just a summer thing so i can have the money to buy some fantasmic new clothes for school. so yeah, someone's definitely off their rocker... and it's not anyone on my side of the street.
