Unfortunately she was tired and was going to just stay in. It wasn't too bad because I'd already had an invite from another friend (Nicole) to see i fi wanted to hang out at hers. Paul etc were going. So, I phoned Paul. When I phoned he was in the midset of shaving, I just ased the basics like "Will you walk me" etc. Then he said " Yeah, we'll walk you" and I was like "We?" he said "Yeah, Sarah's here" in the phone call i was just like okay and joingly said "thanks for phoning me" but in my head was..."Why the fuck didn't you call me! You actuallywere gonna go with sarah there." The other night I found out they had a thing for each other but he assured me that he only thought of her as a friend now, and anything else would just be wrong. Anyways, I met them up like 15minutes later! On walking up to Nicole's I realised that Paul was being kinda distant...or was I just being clingy? Either way, something was up. When we got to Nicole's things were cool,and everyone went up to the loft while Paul and I hung out in Nicoles room...well we made out and talked!:) not at the same time! That was the highlight of the night. Later on we went to Nicole's room; all of us this time. We just talked,played cards and doodled. At first things were cool, then Paul started like not wanting to hold my hand and stuff, maybe i'm just being a bunny boiler but hey, it was weird! Then I also noticed he kept staring at Sarah, I pulled Roslyn out the room and showed her, I know she was thinking the same thing. Right now, I'm just back from lunch! Went home for a bit and called Paul, we were fine on the phone and he told me his higher results (well some of them). Then just there I was talking to him on msn, things were y'know ok but he didn't do his usual ' Peace and Empathy, love and huggles -Rhona xxx
