In an attempt to get out of preparing for ward basketball night, he claimed that "everyone else should do the work because they are lazy elitists who inherited their money anyway." I'm serious, he said this out loud, even though:   My laurels counselor grew up in a lower middle class home, working hard to start and own the advertising agency under her name.  Our other counselor up the street, who has worked to become a specialist on cardiology while paying for the education at the same time.  My best friend, who isn't rich.  The 3 lawyers in our ward who started their own firm when they were all under 30.  Lazy elitists who inherited their money? I think not. When I tell him he shouldn't open his mouth so as to prevent the tragedy of sounding stupid, he says that I sound stupid all the time. "Going on about how much you love Osama and how we shouldn't be helping Iraq out. And then how this is a sign of imperialism? You make your self look stupid every time you open your mouth, Rach."  I can't believe it. I canâ€™t believe this is a 43 year old I'm talking to. I simply can't believe he's survived adulthood so far. I'm in shock....  But then again, he does work for the government.
