Fear is not it, but rather manifestated by a little child late at night, slapped into the woman being raped, slammed into the man watching his child die. But fear is delicious. We plunder these feelings off one another to feel good about ourselves. Fear evokes emotion, emotion evokes passion. So why are we so afraid?
