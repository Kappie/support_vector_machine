I got to see sammie (who i haven't seen in forever!!) and i got to hang out with Robin (one of the coolest Juniors...she's goin back to harrison :( but we'll still hang out!!) we went to her house and jung out for a bit with Matt then we went to Ross's house and played ping pong and watched the guys play video games lol and picked on Ross and Mark! then we went back to Robo's house and got a cup-cake and then went to Sonic and got a Vanilla COke and a large order of tator tots!!!! they were soo good but i had to hurry and eat it b/c it was passed curfue and i was prolly gonna be in trouble.....we were out till 12 and i was suppost to be home by 11:30 ooops....she didn't care though. it was cool everyone was asleep when i got home! I had a lot of fun last night just hangin out with friends...FYI Robin he is cute lol but kinda geeky if you ask me...he had the entire list memorized aw well it's cool!   Today i've done hardly nothing...i slept in until about 2:30 and that was good b/c i didn't get much sleep last night. i'm sore from working out and i was cramping BLAH....i hate being a girl when it comes to being on your period verses not having one like a guy. then i woke up and watched some T.V then i started cleaning my room....i didn't get very far until my mom came up and decided to take control...then she randomly left and i didn't notice so i got bored and came down here and got a bowl of chocolate cake ice cream!!! so healthy huh? well deal with it girls crave chocolate (or at least i do) when i'm on my period!   OK so 6 days til camp and i'm pumped....tmrw i'm going camp shopping and hang out with just my mom all day!! exciting (hopefully) I leave for Newton on Thursday and i'm soooo excited about that.I'm ready to see Richelle and the entire Britton family....b/c they are awesome!! OK well i'll get back with you later if anything interesting happens!  -Tori
