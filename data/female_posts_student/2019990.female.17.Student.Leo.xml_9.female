Then I have to do my makeup which may take up to five minutes today!  Then I grab my chemistry an head to Grand March.  I'm going to recite the elements and their atomic numbers as I walk down the stage.  Then I'm writing my english paper during the banquet, and my student council paper during the dance, and then I'll start getting my social presentation ready during the after party.  But I'm off.  *Dissapears in a whirlwind of flowers, hair spray, film, and shredded mylar.*
