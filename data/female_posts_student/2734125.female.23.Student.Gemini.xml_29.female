How common are those that truly understand, "There are more things in heaven and earth..."  That we seek knowledge for the pureness of seeking, and for no other reason?  The question is the reason, and the answer is a bonus for asking.    My guitar is watching me forelornly from the back of the library.  Maybe I need to go play.    When I speak to my daughter to be, will I weigh out each word, knowing that what I speak is embedded with history and blood and thought?  When I write a letter to my daughter to be, will my pen speak to her out of time, bonding my utterances with many voices?  Will any of us make it that far?    Last night I dreamed I was a pregnant elf with a motorcycle.  I saw Hunter Thompson and had to get out of town fast (not because of Hunter Thompson, but some people meant me harm.  You could just tell).  When I was leaving the hotel, and my money had been stolen, I went into a room to say good bye to some fellow mythical peoples.  I shook the hand of an old hunter, that wore silver rings on all his nut brown fingers, and I shook the hand of a night child, and a woman there gave me some magickal juniper berry, and I was suppose to just keep it but instead I ate it like a sunflower seed.  I wanted to drive the bike out of town, but a friend said she would drive.  Not all of our gear was attached right, and she went anyway, even though I asked her to stop.  She rode like a mad woman, with me above and behind, and I saw in advance she would be crashing soon.  As I caught up with my perspective on the bike I grasped a light pole and slid down it unharmed.  I had been worried about the baby, but it would be fine.  I was an elf, in a high desert town that was dirty and neon, with short hair and leathers, pregnant with a miracle child.
