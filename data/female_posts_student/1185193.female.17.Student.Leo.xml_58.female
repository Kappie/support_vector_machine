The theme is  urlLink Camp Creation .  And I have chosen our class name to be Butterflies.  I figured boys at that age wouldn't mind having a girly class name.  And besides, being the Butterflies is cute for little kids.  I am so excited!!  I already have so many ideas.  Since the theme has to do with camping, I can have a tent in my classroom where we read or pray inside.   And I can make wall murals of rustic scenery and hang them on the walls.  And the kids can make a class poster to hang on the door for the week.  Woohoo!  I am so ready.  Well, I'm off to go study for my Spanish final--I have the written (5 paragraph essay :l ) and the oral tomorrow.  Wish me luck!
