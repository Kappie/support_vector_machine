Some I'm sure need replies.. Heh, I know there is a few from a couple of weeks ago that I should have replied to...  Why aren't I taking a nap right now?  ...Good question...  I don't know the answer.   I got some pictures back today that I took of flowers (..and a couple dead birds..) in the rain a week or two ago... They're preeeety... I'm proud.  :D Hehe, and Mom said that Jeremy is getting me something camera related for my birthday.. But there is nothing that I need that is close to being under $100... well except filters...   I need sleep.  I'm really jumpy also.  ...Don't sneak up on me...
