We were going a little too fast for that road, expessally in Gales new car. We heard a big clank and really thought that we dented it. We went back to town, looked at the car made sure that it wasn't hurt (it was just a little muddy). We parked the car in IGA and walked downtown, and met up with BJ and a bunch of his friends. BJ is Michaela's cousin, and he looks at me and says...   How do you know Michaela... you're not related are you?   I told him that we weren't and he said,   just making sure we aren't related  . Then he asked me how old I was and I told him I was 14, and he said   WHAT IS IT WITH GIRLS LOOKING 25.. (he's 19) pretend you didn't tell me that... so how old are you again?   I said,   oh yeah I'm 25, I lyed  , he said   I KNEW IT.   It was great. I met just about everyone in town. One was a guy named Chad who reminded me of someone but I don't really know who, he was really cute. Michaela introduced us, and he was shaking my hand and he didn't let go for a while, and Michaela turned to him and said...   She's staying in Millinocket all summer  .   A guy named Garrett was having a party at his house, and one of the girls came back from his house and said,   they are all tokin it up over there  ,   all of the guys run to their cars and said lets go! And all went to go get stoned. We asked Craig (such a hottie) to give us a ride to our car up and so michaela and I piled in and headed back to our car. We went back downtown, and hung out with the other people down there. Michaela, Kyle and I were sitting on the bench and Chad came back and sat next to me, and we all were just hanging out talking, and Felicia called me and her ring tone is headstrong and Chad started singing along, it was great. My ass is bruised from last night. I said something stupid and Chad was making fun of me and I pushed him in a joking way and he pushed me back and I pushed him back and he shoved me off of the bench, and Craig says,   You can't push her!!   It was alot of fun. I got home around 11 or so. Felicia is acting weird today... like she's annoyed at me or something. At first I was supposed to be here until the 31st of August, but then I wanted to come home early, and I could come home on the 10th when the guys leave. But seriously, there is only two people that I would come home for. I want to know if things are going to be like they were before, or like they were back in June. I just want to know what to expect and whether or not it's worth going home for, because I am having a pretty good time here, and I know that I can most likely have more fun here than back home, the only reason I would go home is if I could fix things that got fucked up. If there is no use and it's going to be like we don't know each other anymore.
