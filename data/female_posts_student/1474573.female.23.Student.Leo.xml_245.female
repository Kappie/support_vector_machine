He gained something like 30 pounds in that month and his cholesterol shot through the roof amongst other things... He did this as a  project  to educate the masses...  Then there are the actresses and actors that gain and lose weight for roles.  Renee Zellweger gained 30 or so for the first Bridget Jones, lost it all and then some for Chicago, then gained it again for the sequel to BJ...Robert DeNiro gained and lost for Raging Bull, and Tom Hanks gains and loses all the time for different roles.  These people all work with trainers, I know... It may not be easy to gain or lose, but when your livelihood depends on it and you're making $10-$20  million  on the next film where you're supposed to be a size ___, I'd do whatever was needed too...  That said, what does one do when one has been gaining weight at a steady pace yet is not particularly depressed, not really that self loathing and is in love with someone who loves you for you no matter what?  Obviously I'm talking about myself, here...  Being a fat teenager and young adult, I really sorta resigned myself to being that way.  It was only lonliness, frustration and a 30 pound weight gain spurt that got me to lose in the first place.  And even then, I always thought that 185 was where my body wanted to be, and I was content in just getting back down to that.  But my steady progress made me want more.  Made me  NEED  more.  So I kept at it.  Exercising almost every day and eating right brought me down to a sexy 147 in less than a year.  And I fluctuated a little here and there, but never went over 160 in over 2 years.  I was  proud  of that and people were proud  of  me.    Now times have changed and things have changed.  I married someone who loves food like me.  With his coaxing I started school again.  I moved to Brooklyn taking away my daily walk through the park.  I wanted to spend time with him and on school work more than I wanted to go to the gym.  I started to gain weight and so did he.  We joined Weight Watchers to get ourselves back on track.  We started going to the gym together (which didnt really work since we had different workout routines).  Then he lost more than I did, even though I was trying so hard and I quit.  My quitting made him quit.  We gained the weight we lost back in no time.  At that point I had gained about 60 of the 70 pounds I lost back.  It had taken about the same amount of time to gain it back as it had to lose it.  Things changed again.  I started taking more classes at school making my eating schedule extremely erratic.  Then I lost my job in the city, we moved to New Jersey, I got a job in Jersey that I have to drive to.  And while Steve walks most of the time from Port Authority, I walk NOWHERE.  Not even to Blockbuster Video about a half mile away.  I drive EVERYWHERE now.  And there are never really sales in the supermarkets for healthy food, just the bad stuff.  Entenmann's, 2 for $5.  Sour Cream, $0.99, Pudding, 3 for $4... Lettuce, $2.99.   SIGH .  The only time I get exercise is raking the leaves or chasing after my friend's kids when they visit.    All of the weight is back and then some.  Some?  No, that's an understatment.  All the weight I lost is back, plus about another 20 pounds  at least .  I am pushing out of sizes I'd never dream of being in in the first place.  I feel like I look pregnant and I'm not remotely.  To me, I dont look like me anymore.  I mean, when I lost all the weight initially, I used to stare in the mirror because I truly didnt recognize myself.  Now I'm having the opposite problem, however, I dont stare in the mirror because what I see scares the heck outta me.  Let me make this clear.  I am not writing this because I want your pity.  I'm not writing this because I'm depressed,  per se ...I guess I'm writing because I'm in a rut.    I think it hit me last night after ordering out for like, the fourth day in a row that I wasn't feeling good.  I was eating and not enjoying it.  I'm unhappy with the way I look and feel, I hate that I have no energy and that with the weight came MORE laziness (if that were even fathomable) and overall I'm fed up...AGAIN... however, I'm not unhappy in general, and that my friends, is what stops me from taking it seriously enough.  I just want to be proud of myself again for my sexy legs or the fact that I can wear a bikini... Shit like that.  I want to feel good about myself again physically, because I feel just dandy on a intellectual level, a romantic level, an emotional level and on a work level...no, seriously!!  I'm going to try again, and by writing it out and making it public, maybe I'll stick to it.  The weather is getting nicer and school is almost over.  Nothing should really get in my way.  I will make a conscious effort to eat all those dang Smart Ones and Lean Cuisines clogging up the freezer.  I will fry less.  I will NOT order out.  I will ride my new bike and take a walk when the weather permits.  I will get my ass to the ground to garden.  I will get my shit together.  NOW.
