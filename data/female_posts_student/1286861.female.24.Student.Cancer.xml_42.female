We are in love.  I have a tendency to think more than I talk. This is both a good and a bad predicament. I tend to say what I mean, and to mean what I say...A quality I have come to find is lacking in the majority of the masses on the earth. On the flip side I do not say enough, I do not say what I am thinking and I tend to let things be overlooked when in fact they should be addressed. The former I will keep...The latter I will work on.  I considered my current life and lifestyle a lot last evening as well. I have realized there are things needing to be changed. As a result of me not driving I am falling just short of falling off the face of the world. In other words those who knew me before have somewhat forgotten my existence. Brenden questioned why I do not hang out with my buds when I am here alone and he is home in Fullerton. The answer took a while...But the solution is simple, I need my license back. It became obvious that I was the one visiting people and making the contact and what not. When I stopped contacting others, all contact stopped.   I realized how much I need to live close to the one I love. He will be starting school this coming week...Having class Monday through Friday...A booked schedule with little travel time meaning little long distance girlfriend time. It is do-able, but dammit, it makes me sad. I am working my application for Cal State Fullerton and for the much needed financial aid needed for such an endeavor. It will be tough.  I applied for a Customer Service Representative position at Countrywide Home Loans. Why you may ask...The response being that United Rentals is sucking the life out of me. Draining my soul through my eyes, so it is. I need a change. The work situation would take a page or two itself to explain, and frankly I am not up for it and it would lead to nothing but restless sleep if I think about it all and write it all at this juncture. So you will have to live with that. Like anyone reads this anyway...  I am going to watch some more FireFly now. It is (was) a wonderful series...For all those other sci-fi freaks such as myself. Look into it.
