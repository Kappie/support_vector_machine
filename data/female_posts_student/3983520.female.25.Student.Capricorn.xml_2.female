LAST WEEK I SAW AN APARTMENT ON THE INET SO I CALLED AND SPOKE TO THE LADY AND SAID THAT I WAS INTERESTED AND IF I GOT THE PLACE I WANTED TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY. SHE SAID I JUST NEEDED TO GIVE $20 FOR THE APPLICATION FEE AND BRING A $500 MONEY ORDER TO HOLD THE PLACE. WELL I DID ALL THAT AND DID NOT GET THE PLACE. NOW I AM WAITING FOR THEM TO SEND ME MY DAMN MONEY. SO I CALL TODAY AND THE LADY SAID THAT THEY JUST GOT STAMPS YESTERDAY AND PUT IT IN THE MAIL. WTF? I TURNED IT IN ON FRIDAY AND IT IS NOW WEDNESDAY. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE MAIL. THEY WERE EVEN OPEN ON SATURDAY. NOW I AM PREPARING TO MOVE INTO ANOTHER PLACE AND I NEED THAT MONEY SO THAT I CAN PAY THE RENT AND THE DEPOSIT AND HAVE SOME SPENDING MONEY FOR GROCERIES AND OTHER NECESSITIES. I AM SO PISSED. HOW STUPID CAN YOU GET. HOW ARE YOU JUST GOING TO HOLD ONTO SOME MONEY THAT IS NOT EVEN YOURS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A STAMP. WTF?
