I'm an expatriate!  “Expatriate” - someone who lives as a non-citizen in a country not their own.   We are, all of us who know Christ, expatriates- living for a time in a foreign country. We can enjoy it, but if we ever stop feeling homesick, we are in trouble.   So, next Fourth of July, go ahead and light off some fireworks, thank God for the freedoms you have, enjoy a nice parade or picnic… but maybe leave the Star-Spangled Banner out of the worship set, okay?   Awesome article, I didn't get a chance to see who wrote it, but you all should check it out- http://www.opensourcetheology.net/node/view/391  (i tried the whole 'weblink'...didn't work out too well. Just copy and paste)
