I am a first-year student at Colegio San Agustin Makati (IA gurl)././././././. Okay. So, thanks for getting here. If you don't find my blog particularly interesting... well *shrugs*. Anyway, since this is the very first post, I may as well talk about what I want to talk about...  Soccer. I am definitely and wholly addicted to it, but sometimes I just want to quit. If you know what I mean, varsity players... and now the noose of Report Cards is tightening around my neck.   GRADES. Now that it's the second quarter I need to improve them.  Richmond Fernandez... shame on you if you're reading this and you don't know who he is...  Friends... best friends...  Sibling problems... sometimes I just damn want to kill her!  Colegio San Agustin... home of the Koreans... no sense of respect...  Til' the next post... have to stop here, anyway. Promise to keep this more interesting.  *!^Noelle^!*
