Well, the songwriter wrote this song when he was 13 and somehow in love with someone he couldn't reach. Now he's the singer of a melodic heavy band (Sonata Arctica) and they're very popular, particularly in Middle Europe and Far East. His english hasn't got much better though ;) I recommend reading the lyrics of this band, I think you might have some fun with them unless you already know them. I personally don't like this band too much, they are pretty horrible live. For example the drummer is too often a couple of beats too late ;)   I should be cleaning up the apartment, preparing myself for the german test and washing the windows. Instead I've been lazy for the whole morning. But I have an excuse! Minka's been so sweet the whole morning and looking for tenderness...of course I had to give her tenderness! She's spent something like a couple of hours on my laps and also slept on my lap for 30 minutes or so. Now my left arm is almost numb ;) She's not the lightest cat in the world, you know.  It looks like we're gonna have to cancel our trip to Finland for financial reasons. It's a real pity, since everybody's really looking forward to meeting Rico and seeing me again. That means I'll get my stuff then. Shit... I'd really need my dictionaries and all... But in August we're certainly going to travel to Finland and spend a couple of weeks there. I think we'll meet up with Serge and Satu (a friend of Rico's and his girlfriend) in Finland and I think that'll be fun. See, Satu is half finnish and she wants (unlike me) to spend some time in Finland every year. Or has to, I'm not certain. She has to do regularly a finnish test and that's being held in Finland.  Relationship News? Not really, we're still disgustingly happy :) We've talked about the future and it looks rosy for us. But no more about that :)  Ok, I can't postpone my to-dos any longer... I really gotta go. A couple of friends (Siv and Daniel from Bern) are coming to meet us tomorrow and I want this apartment to shine when they come! ;D  Oh, and I'm planning to start a finnish blog since I also have a lot to say to my finnish friends and that happens best of course in Finnish. I also write poems in Finnish and need a place in the internet for those.
