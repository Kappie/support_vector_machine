Kinda like  The X-Wing Series.      ***    A  loud, raspy scream reached Sabina's ears. She continued to run, sensing the gaseous blackness that was nipping at her heels.  She ran into an empty room. There was no way to escape now.  Sabina turned and pressed her back against the wall as the shadow spread into the room. Through the vapor-like darkness, emerged a young man dressed in a black cloak and black suit.  A freezing feeling descended upon Sabina and her blood started running cold.  She sank to the floor.  By some ancient instinct, she reached up to her grandfather's coin hanging around her neck and clutched it tightly.  She closed her eyes against the figure. Her heart was now pounding in her ears.  Sabina was about to pass out.  All of the sudden what seemed like a miniature tornado blew into the small compact area.  It was quick to subside.  Out of shear curiosity, Sabina opened her eyes and was shocked by what she saw.  Someone else had appeared.  He was standing protectively in front of Sabina, a small dagger clutched in his hand.  "Stay away from her, " he commanded.  The other glared angrily at this new person and disappeared.  Sabina's rescuer turned and knelt down beside her.  He was very handsome.  He looked to be about her age except he had short white hair. His eyes were a stormy grayish-blue and shown with gentle worry.  "Are you alright?" he asked Sabina.  "Y...Yes," she stuttered, still in shock from the sudden appearance. "Um... Excuse me for asking, but who are you?"  He looked confused for a second. "You don't know who I am?"  "No," Sabina responded.  He reached out and touched the coin. "Yet you called me," he stated as if he was in a trance.  "What?"  Taking his hand from the necklace, he said, "I am Drake, a wind spirit."  He smiled at her and she felt safe.
