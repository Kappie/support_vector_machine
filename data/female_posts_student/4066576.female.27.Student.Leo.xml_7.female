That's why I have been worrying about study right after registering the school. I wish the TOEFL course is easy. It might be very difficult for me. It used to be very complicated to study for me. When I was in ETP which is a famous school to learn TOEFL and TOEIC, I could not get good mark even small test at the school.  I took the really TOEFL test which we call CBT(Computer Base Test) several time. It was so difficult to get high score. Last year, I applied three universities as a Architecture course. That major needs the highest score in every university. Anyway.. I failed to get into university this year. Therefore, I can not extend my visa with acceptance letter from a university.  I will apply again next year. I need a school to extend visa because I have a student visa in here. So, if I want to extend visa , I should get some acceptance letter from any school like ESL school or any university. That is why I registered Omnicom which is private ESL school in North York Center. Anyway, I want to say thanks alot to Jini and Eric. They help me a lot since I came here. Thank you, Jini.  I will never forget every your help.  I hope that I will get a chance to help you someday. ^^  ...  Now, My roommate, Jay is drawing now with some pencils which she bought today. She is quite enjoying to use those.  Tomorrow is Friday which day is my work day until Saturday. It will be so tough day for me. I have to take a shower and go to bed earlier than usual time.  Now, It is time to take a shower. I hope to write my diary tomorrow if I would not be exhausted after work. ^^;;
