Uhm, Gerardo did come over, and he did bring sushi! =) hehehe... and he ate it, too! but yeh, he still cant have any of the wasabi =( poor baybie.  But yehh.. he was over here, and he played with Isaac, so that's good.  And then yeh, I had my alone time wiff him too, but, it was limited, cuz his mom called, and he had to leave =(... but it's alryte. And yeh... It's raining lots now... LOOK AT IT! Pretty rain =) ahah.. yep, well, I'm going to go finish getting ready!  Oh, and whoever left me a comment for my last "blog"...
