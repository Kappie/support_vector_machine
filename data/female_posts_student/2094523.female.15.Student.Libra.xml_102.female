I am the least complicated person ull ever know. and it takes so little to satisfy me but many people dont take the time to do the little things that mean alot, thats why im never satisfied with anything. If u just took the time to see, ull realize how simple i am. If someone proposed to me with a $2 ring instead if a real diamond ring. if soemone gave me any pink flower picked outta the school yard instead of a rose. if someone gave me lollipops instead of expensive chocolates, if someone sang me a song instead of got me the cd i wanted, if soemone wrote a book for me instead of buy a book, if someone was just a real friend but didnt get me anything materialistic... id be more than satisfied.
