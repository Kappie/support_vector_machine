Its supposed to be some sort of conference/fun ‘get to have a good time’ trip or something….I’m not sure.  All I know is I got talked into signing up in February  by some of the pals, and now the trips here.  So tomorrow, I’ll grab my bag, make sure I leave all my ‘non-Christian’ cds at home lest they be confiscated, and hop on a bus full of rowdy church groupies.  We’ll play bull, talk our stinking heads off, the guys and a few of the girls (not ME of course, ahem.) will drink so much AMP and REDBULL that they’ll be freaking out and asking to urinate every ten minutes.  Then when it gets dark, everyone will get all snuggly and pester you and pester you asking who YOU are involved with, c’mon Camille, tell.  And I’ll sit there, longing for my shower, look at them with glazed over eyes and ramble off some generic answer that will make them step off for a while.  Then we’ll get there.  Oh yeah, every trip is exactly the same.  I have it down to a science.  Heheh, no I shouldn’t pretend to be so grumpy, I do have fun.   Seriously, I really am just going to try and take this trip time to really focus on the Lord alone when I can, I won’t have to worry about getting stuff done up here, I’ll just try and give HIM the attention he deserves.  I have really been awful about that as of late, so I’m praying that it will just be a good time with Him.  And of course, the groupies.  *sigh*  So yes indeed, I won’t be back until next Friday night.  Goodbye for a bit.
