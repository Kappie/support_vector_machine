So I've been shoving these Cold-eez things in my mouth all day in hopes I can get rid of this thing by Tuesday for my audition. Oh man, the worst thing happened in Wind Ensemble today! Mr.Buchenot (I think he's an administrator or something...he doesn't seem to do much of anything) came in and he's like "Congratulations on a great concert last night. Mr. Perkins is coming to see you tomorrow and all Mr. Snoeck needs to do is take attendance. I want to thank you guys for making this transition go well." Just by watching Mr. Snoeck's face, you could totally tell that he was super pissed off. After Mr. Buchenot left he said "I take great offense that he said that there has already been a transition, I have had no part in this, and he (meaning Mr. Perkins) has been alienating me and the rest of the staff for the past four days. And you know I don't lie to you guys." Then Kelly Scott started crying and we all got real depressed. It made this new guys sound like a real ass. Plus, Mr. Buchenot, what the hell were you thinking, coming in here and telling us what's going on, when really you have no part in the band?! If Mr. Snoeck wanted to tell us about anything, he would. We really didn't need you coming in and talking to us about anything. And so now the whole wind ensemble is upset, there's talk of us all ditching tomorrow and all sorts of stuff. We're also not crazy about the fact that Mr. Snoeck isn't going to be there when Mr. Perkins is there. I'm not really ready to have anyone else standing in front of me in class besides Mr. Snoeck. Also, its almost like Mr. Snoeck is being pushed out of the picture before the year is even over. I mean, he's still here until June! Come on. Its crazy. Tomorrow shall be very interesting. I'm not holding anything back tomorrow either. I'm definitely speaking my mind. Anyways, thats all that really happened today. The whole thing kinda ruined my day, but whatever.
