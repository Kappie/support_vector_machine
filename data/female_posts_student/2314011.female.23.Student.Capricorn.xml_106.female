Lately, it's been the new internet connection.  It takes up much of my free time.  Getting everything "adjusted" and "optioned" just so, then finding out all the tinkering left out the one step needed to make it work.  But it's all really peripheral stuff.  I have a reliable, stable internet connection, and before too long, it will feel like home.  It's odd, really, how different the whole thing feels.  It's the damn internet, for crying out loud!  It's the same!  Just the access to it is different.  It's just that I remember when AOL 4.0 was high-tech.  I grew up with the ISP (tear!).  And, as necessary as the break is, a part of me does miss the kiddy-gloves AOL handles all its subscribers with.  And until the new email accounts are up and running, it might be lurking in the shadows, faintly resembling a safety net.    So today was a very easy, light day.  It's amazing what a difference a cancelled class makes.  Plus, it's Joe's 20th birthday.  Ordered the 1st season of South Park on DVD over a week ago and it was due in at any minute.    Was doing some low-back twists in the early Yoga class (done for the day in time for the 4 o'clock class!) and it hit me:  "I should get Joe a birthday cake.  He's probably not going to have anything going on tonight, anyway.  Yea, I'll get him a cake; or at least a pastry of some kind.  Then we can watch some classic South Park tonight, because really, it WILL be in the mailbox when I get home."  And so, after class, I secured a slice of German Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake from the bakery next to the Yoga center and was feeling pretty damn Laura Ingalls about it.  Sure enough, a DVD-sized package was waiting in the mailbox.  I smiled, watching the clouds turn a bright, deep pink (as deep as pink can get, I suppose) against the early evening sky.  Noticed the name on the return address listed as "Wal-Mart" and the brows furrowed a bit.  "Is that supposed to be funny?  Well, the Half.com user names could represent any company, I suppose.  It was listed as factory-sealed after all.  This will make a great blog story, at least....fucking Wal-Mart..."  Tore through the industrial-strength plastic wrap, trying to figure out why the package was upgraded to 1st class when it should have been media mail.  Saw the white packaging first, thinking they must have wrapped up the box with tissue paper; then recognized the familiar masthead:  black, bold, lower-case letters and a classy thin rainbow running along the bottom.  Queer as Folk:  The Complete Second Season.  "What the fuck?  They sent me the wrong thing!!  Not that I'm complaining, but what the fuck!"  Flashback to a conversation earlier this morning:  "Your surprise should be there any day; Levi's too."  "What did you get him?"  "A scanner."  "Shut up."  "No really, I got him a scanner."  "You did not."  "I did too!"  "He already has one!"  "He said he wanted one!"  "He says all kinds of shit!  Now what did you really send him?"  "A scanner!!"  "Okay, whatever.  Do I get one too?"  "You don't want a scanner."  "So what did I get?"  "I'm not telling."  "Is it a briefcase?"  "No."  "An espresso maker?"  "No; you can't plug it in.  It's just something you like and you said you wanted."  "Did you really get him a scanner?"  And so on.  Fade back to present:  No South Park, but Lorraine's surprise was perfect.  The first season now has a buddy on the DVD shelf and the third is being released Tuesday.  Balance is a funny thing; and it's our friend.    And by the way:  it wasn't dark at 6 tonight; it wasn't light, but it wasn't dark.  Spring is coming; and it's almost here.
