Where you've just spent an AMaZING amount of time with someone, being with them all the time, hugging, kissing, walking, talking, dancing, sleeping, holding each other, even just plain sitting together. And you have to leave them. And you get this little empty feeling inside of you, not for that person, but for that feeling, that knowledge that you just have to reach out, and they'll be there, for that kiss, for that hug, for that little laugh you share.. It's horrible. And no one else understands, feels the same way you do. Everyone stares at you like your crazy, not ever knowing that feeling themselves.
