I have this closet full of art supplies downstairs...i just never know what to DO with them. I'm having serious artist's block as of late. I kind of have an idea which i know genie will love but i'm keeping a seek for awhile.   I need to go out and have some fun...this week has been so horribly stressful. I'm in the long run until school is out... we still have like...5 weeks...oh GOD...  Makenzie and I had a good long talk tonight, and it was good. I've decided something, I care about makenzie so much, and over the years I've kind of mutated into kind of a "motherly figure" for her. Kind of...I always feel like i need to look out for her, and take care of her because she's vulnerable. I know Todd is a good guy, but if he does anything to hurt makenzie...yeah... and the fact that makenzie has been drinking occasionally with kathryn and katie has really gotten to me, because i know what alcohol can do to a person...and i'm scared to lose makenzie, she's the only person right now that i know no matter what i do she'll always be there for me and love me as much as i love her. Now i'm getting all emotional *tear*.  Anways, enough of that. I went mystic tanning yesterday, way crazy. I look like it's been about two months of summer and I've had some serious outside time. awesome! I enjoy.  Anyways, sleep? yeah.
