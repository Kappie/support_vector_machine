Like I said, I told him before that this was our last time trying. He always makes me feel special until we don't see eachother every day at school, then it's like I've fallen off the face of the earth! I'm telling all kinds of other guys no just for him and now he treats me like this. Maybe if I tell him that I'm thinking about going astray he'll think twice. And Scott, I"ve tried what you suggessted before, letting him sweat it by waiting for him to call me instead, but last time I tried that he didn't call me all Spring Break! Or maybe, since he has the address to this site, he'll read what I'm saying and think about it and respond. Afterall, the last time he checked this was after my escond post, so... yeah. Maybe I'll go into the attitude I was in before, when I didn't want to date, just have random dates and a few fuck buddies.lol. I mean, my ex Tyler is still after me, a new guy at work, customers are always ashing for my number and other people I meet from friends or just in random places. But, I don't know. Kyle, would you do the honors of kicking him in the head like you suggested, knock some sense in to him?  EVIL SPASTIC CHEESY MONKEYS ARE PLOTTING MY DEMISE AND STEALING MY LEFT SOCK!    And thanx to Kyle and the Great George Carlin, I hve a new one. "Hurry, Hurry, get on the plane. Get on the Plane!  "Fuck you, I'm getting in the plane!"  Oh, Kyle, can you send an e-mail to Travis, giving him my e-mail telling him to e-mail me cuz I want to talk to him? I'd appreciate it.   Joke for Today  Breaking News...Just in! Reports from CNN journalists in Pakistan say that the Taliban have just made new demands. They demand that U.S. forces are removed or they will cut off the U.S. supply of convenience store Managers.
