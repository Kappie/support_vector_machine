We were gonna go in Fort Payne, buuut I think he said Patrick wants to play putt putt and that's fine with me b/c I love love love playin! I used to go all the time and I haven't been since my family + matt went...so obviously a long time. Anywho, Dustin's settin Patrick and this girl up on a blind date. Oh my.  Well, I'm starving to DEATH! I haven't had like..any food all day! :( Buuut moms gone to Krystals now. I will totally devour that food once it gets here.  I was gonna try to go hang out with Brad today but when I got up I had to help mom with somethin and I think he had some other stuff he had to do. *shrugs* It's never gonna happen. Made me mad/sad at first but now it kinda cracks me up... I talked to Adrienne and Brett a little while today! Adrienne is hatin bandcamp more than Brett is...Brett's just like "whatever" and Adrienne's like "AHH I can't stand it!" lol I love her. She kills me.  My food's here, so on that note...I'm gone. Anything that needed to be said, will have to wait :D
