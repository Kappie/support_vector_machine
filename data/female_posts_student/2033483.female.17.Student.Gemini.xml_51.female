Now, I'm sure it was when I was a child too but now I realize it and see it more than ever.  Christmas is a time to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, the coming of our Savior.  Christmas is not about Santa Clause coming to your house and delivering presents with the help of reindeer.  Sorry to burst your bubble for those who still believe but that is all made up and kids get too wrapped up in it.  The manipulations that go on between parent and child around Christmas are insane.  "Jonny be good now Santa Clause is watching you!"  "Mommy, Mommy, Mommy if Santa Clause doesn't bring me this for Christmas I'm not going to believe in him anymore."  Children have no comprehension of the fact that the Santa Mom is talking about is God.  But God doesn't just watch you over Christmas but he watches you ALWAYS!  Children should be good always because God is watching them.  Society needs to make an effort to educated children on the real reason we celebrate Christmas instead of the fabricated version that has evolved over generations!
