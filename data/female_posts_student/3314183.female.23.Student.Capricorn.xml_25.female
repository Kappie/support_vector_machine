But i gez if u pick it when it's ripe... the sweetness will astound you.   What is love?  Understanding it has its own mastery.  How is it like to love?  The thought of it makes one jittery.   Nought to be afraid.  For love, is the wondrous gift given by God, O great!   Love is like a fruit-growing process.  The seed of love sowed by its own prince.  Moved by his loving kindness.  The roots finally extend to greatness.   Stay rooted in the mind, they hold firm.  It’s in the one’s presence, the heart yearns. The stem stands erected with significant measure.  Only in his presence, I can find pleasure.   The branches stretch like love with arteries.  Without love, my life falls into a crisis.  Lush of leaves and flowers,  Pours out a fragrance of romance for lovers.   Bearing fruits of passion,  Come, taste the sweetness, needless to question.  Back onto the ground, the seed fell once again.  Flow with the waters to the place love once began.
