(yes, i like baking cakes. sue me) and everything was going great... until i put it in the oven. about 20 minutes into the cooking process i smell something burning and looking into the oven and HARK! the cake as bubbled over and is now burning. i turn off the oven and open the door immediately to be engulfed in a cloud of dense, dark smoke. hahaha it was SO funny. turns out i put baking SODA in the cake instead of baking POWDER. what's the difference, anyway? but i thought it was really funny, even though i am banned from the kitched until further notice. :-D   since i get annoyed easily i decided to make a list of all the things that get me annoyed. just because. i'll keep it updated. hahaha. here it is:    people who walk really slowly in front of you  people who try and get other people to feel sorry for them  people who lie, and it's really obvious, even though they deny it  misha barton- how fake  people who think that they are better than another person  clics  people who try and dress all ghetto when they live in suburbia  literalists- it's funny sometimes... but not ALL the time  people who repetedly say "what" after you said, "never mind"  people who whine about their "horrible" middle class life  when after you say something to someone, they just ignore you and pretend that you aren't even there, when you KNOW that they know that you are  steryotypes  girls who "flip" their hair  people who just can't admit that they're wrong  slow computers      mandy moore
