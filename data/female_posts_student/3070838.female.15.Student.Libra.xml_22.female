I can't tell you how unfair that was. My best friend thinks I should give this person another chance. However, I would like to point out that he has another chance, and he know's it. If he wants it, he'll take it.  Here's todays horoscope:  Libra :  You're really clicking with other people right now, and not just on a superficial level. The secret? You really listen, something many people just aren't willing to do.   Sure! Uh huh, my ass. I'm just confused right now. There's nothing else too it. I have to many people I'm thinking about. I can't wait till school ends.
