Now, I've done that, but am inviting myself over to the Posting section of her blog to make  a suprise guest post  an unsolicited guest post.     Damn, it sure is hot here, and for some reason I'm listening to  Bohemian Rhapsody  (by Queen).  They've been in the musical rotation in my head since either Saturday or Sunday night.  Whenever they got played on Fox on my way home from work.    While I'm sitting here typing this, I can't help but picture "Uninvited Bill" from that debt resolution commercial.  He got a snazzy green shirt with his name on it for being uninvited to that lady in the commercial's house; I think I should get a green t-shirt for writing this.    Anyways, that's all I have to say for now.  I think I'm going to get out of here before I overstay my welcome, or unwelcome, whatever the case may be as I don't really know because I was uninvited.  Alanis Morrisette has a song by that title.  If you're feeling girl power, you should check that out.  Or leave comments because I fixed them.  That's right.  Comments.  Now.
