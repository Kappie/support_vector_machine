I hate dial-up so much. I don't think I'll afford broadband for another five decades. I have a few assignments.. But I can't be bothered doing them now... Can you blame me??      Just listening to some Filipino music now... I miss The Philippines quite a bit. All the great music, food, hot weather... But I don't miss the cold showers. =o  Hot water heaters are quite pricey over there (apparently), so I didn't really have a choice. But at least I saved water. My showers were like, 3 minutes max over there... Here, mine are like, 15 minutes max.. Which is horrible because we have water restrictions. Nyehh.. =oS         Loving you...woah...is such an easy thing to do...No, you never know...it's driving me crazy 'cause it grows and grows..But I won't let it stop, no I'm not giving up..Loving you..just a bit too much..         *double-clicks internet icon*  Wow! I've been connected for 27 minutes! Hope it stays.. If not, then I'm gonna call my ISP and abuse whoever answers. With my singing ;oP         Foolish heart, hear me calling...stop before you start falling... Foolish heart, heed my warning... you've been wrong before, don't be wrong anymore...
