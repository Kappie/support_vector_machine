The six whimsical glass beads twirl across a stream of thin silver tubes as I twist my wrist.   Clinkclinkclinkjangleclink.   These are the sounds that tumble up to my ears as my creation bumps into itself, twirling and spinning.  It emits delightful strands of color that meet my eyes, as this simple bracelet dazzles my senses.  How satisfying to know I invented it.    Today, as you probably gathered, I went to the bead shop with Whitney.  We had a grand time carefully sorting and assembling beads for our masterpieces, all the while giggling and pointing at the baubles much too gaudy and large for our liking.  In the end, we each found the perfect pieces, she for a necklace, me for a bracelet.  We then went back to her house for a day of beading and talking.  I found that I, being more experienced at the hobby, enjoyed teaching her the various techniques and tips needed.  It is very true that to be able to teach something, you have to know it through and through.  I was glad I could help her learn.  Yesterday, Geoffrey shared Easter dinner with my family.  It is sad to me that his family never eats dinner together.  Luckily, I am able to share my family with him to help fill that missing part.  We always love to have him over here, and last night was no different.  Faja and Maja cooked a delicious dinner consisting of baby back ribs, baked beans, and green bean casserole.  Drool!  It was a valiant effort on their part, and a delicious one at that.  No food was left nor were any empty stomachs when all was through.  I hope it helped make Geoffrey's Easter memorable.  Mine was, largely because I was able to share it with the guy I love.  *smile*  (Okay, Sean, I'll end the schmoopie here.  Chase, I'm sure you can understand my interjections.  Tee hee.)  Now, it's about 8:21 P.M. on a lovely Monday evening.  Dad is out in the yard, Mom is downstairs sewing, and I am left to ponder in peace.  It is nice, and exactly what I have been needing for who knows how long.  Life is nice.  I end today with a quote from a friend on what it feels like to be in love...or potential love.  I found it quite satisfying.  You know how some phrases just kind of hit the spot?  Yeah, this one did.  "It's like dancing in a rainfall, but the rain is rose petals and [you] feel so at ease and beautiful and joyful because of the fact that [you're] dancing in a shower of rose petals."  Sigh.
