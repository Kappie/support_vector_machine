One day, Tweety was flying up above the sky when a sudden chill freezed him. His wings gave a feeble flap and then fell to the ground, going through a near-death-experience. A dumb old cow came by and shitted on Tweety. Yucks! Then, Tweety felt himself getting warmer and is no longer freezing. He managed to recover and was soon happily singing at the top of his lungs. Then Sylvester heard Tweety and came to dig Tweety out of the shit, and eventually, ate Tweety.   ·The people who shits on you may not be your enemy.  ·The people who gets you out of the shit may not be your friend.  ·When you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut.
