Catherine so gets on my nerves...she only thinks about herself at times. she wants to go out on a DATE (key word: DATE) with this nasty ass guy i hooked her up with to be mean (key word: MEAN) and she won't go ANYWHERE (key word: ANYWHERE) by herself! She always wants me to tag along and i dont want to!!!! So today i told her i was in pain from having my knee tied down to a thing for the MRI and u know what she said?   Catherine: are you in pain? J-SnizzleFizzle: well it hurt kinda cuz they straighen ur leg out J-SnizzleFizzle: and tie it down Catherine: im sorry Catherine: go get some asprin  UGHHHHH   Anyways, it's all good now, im listening to HOT VEGAS! wooo whoooo!! lol yeah buddy  Last night kaela came over to spend the night with me and we went to the mall to just see what was happenin and this guy came up to us and this is what was said: Guy: How old are u two? Kaela: 16, and u? Guy: 20 Guy: do u girls party? Us: *hahaha* Kaela: I dont know julia, do we party? Me: Hmm..i dont know...do we? Us: *hahaha* Guy: (uneasily) *haha*...well alright, u wanna call me? Kaela: julia, do we want to call him? Me: naw Kaela: okie dokie!  Us: Bye Guy:..later...  HAHA it was great...and when he found out our age he started to walk away...but then i just decided that he wanted to party with 16 yr olds...umm we would have said yeah if he was 21..but hello, 20?! cant do anything with that but put him in jail.   I started writting my book. Im only making notes for it..typing up notes! lol fun stuff, actually it's very relaxing.   i think granite causes cancer. *go ahead and laugh* but like at my church, it's made of all granite, the people who live in the neighborhoods surrounding the church surprisingly all have cancer! and my neighbor before he moved into his house he had it tested for some kinda radiological thing, stuff that causes cancer. and his house had a very high dose of this stuff so he had to get this special fan put in so it circulates it..idk its confusing, but it hink granite causes cancer. its all in the soil...mt airy is all gonna die of cancer because of where we live. by the way, my mom suddenly has skin cancer spots on her arms...that's what made me make the connection and learning that granite has those radioloical whatevers. but usually its underground so it shouldnt effect it..but noo..the granite is out to get us!   haha ok..go ahead and have me shipped off
