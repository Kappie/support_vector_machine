I'm only 100 pages in, but seriously... if you're struggling in your faith or having trouble relating the Bible to your life, this is the book to read. It's amazing - it's a book about what if Jesus Christ hadn't come two thousand years ago but today. It's so awesome to see how Jesus would have interacted with everyone in our society. It really puts everything into perspective, and I'm loving it. It makes the entire gospel seem so much more personal and Jesus seem so much more... real. Ahh, it's just so good, I can't really explain it, so you should just read it, like I'm going to go do right now. I can't put it down.
