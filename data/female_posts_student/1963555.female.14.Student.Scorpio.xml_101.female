So here's the story, I really really really, don't wanna type it all out but I know I'm gonna wanna remember it for future referance, so here we go.... Okay my Mid term project for Vis Comm. was a scrap book with a whole bunch of shit, like bands that I like and alot of ones I didn't (I needed the grade so I just filled it with anything I could find music related)and stuff like that. So I basically cut the shit out of a Spin magazine and a Guitar World. So anyway Dacia and some chick were looking at it in her Vis Comm class (She has it 4th period, I have it 2nd so therefore I was not there!) and Dacia is like "Dawn dooesn't even like these bands, She only pretends to like them to be like me!" which is total bull shit, I don't wanna copy her or be like her. I wanna be my own person, ya know? So I talked to her about it and she is like "uhh I never said that, that's so stupid!" and now I don't know who to belive. Dacia my best friend since 1st grade. Or a really responsible and reliable person who told me this information. I mean, it does sound like somthing Dacia would say.... I dunno I'm just gonna drop it but kinda keep it in the back of my mind.... any way today was kinda fun. We had an assembly at the end of the day on "disability awareness" I felt bad becasue I didn't really pay any attention, me and Dacia laughed at each other through the whole thing. The reason why is last year, this mentaly retarded boy, Tim, was in my class and sat behind me. So he had really really bad pimples and was kind of fat, well really fat not to be mean, and loved pokemon and mario brothers. So that's a little background anyway..... he always acted kinda annoying and I was always respectful and wasn't rude. Then one day me and Dacia were talking (she sat infront of me) and she all of a sudden made a wierd face and began laughing. She pointed and I turned to my right.... there was Tim's big head stareing down my V cut shirt. I have big boobs okay? yeah I admit it but the retarded kid doesn't need the fucking stare!! It was so embarrasing. picture it and fat retard staring down at your boobs! I know this all sounds funny and mean on my part but I don't know how to say it all different. lol now go tell all your friends of my sad misfortue. oh man Fortune. that word reminds my of a guy named Kyle that was in my health class this year. He moved to Norwich. I talked about him before. I love how he says fortune, I miss him, he was really funny. Sorry about saying "really" so much today, I dont' know what my problem is.... REALLY!! ha ha that was gay...... bye!
