Is he extremely busy (I doubt it) and has no time to call? Is he upset with me, and does not thrive on confrontation? I hate this. I don't like not knowing what is going on, because I can't do anything to fix it.   Breakfast this morning was actually a lot of fun. Marie did indeed pick me up, a few minutes late, but at least she came and wasn't grouchy. We sat by Greg, Doug, and Rick, and "chatted." Mr. Bragga even paid for breakfast for all 15 of us! And the tip! Completely amazing; not only is he one of the nicest men that I know, he is also the most generous. This world needs more men like him in positions of authority as he is currently. People who actually cared, not out to stab the next guy in the back and rob him of all of his worldly goods.
