WTF was that person doing in there? so my friend was stuck wearing the globus tee. and i was mad enough to ask him to try out the swimming trunks as well. shamless rather???. yeah ok im shamless all right. more than all the other girls too. but what the heck? i love being shamless anyhow. lol. yeah so i was fuming coz i wanted to go home and that dog or whatever in the changing room was refusing to get "his" ass outta there. ask me how i know that the person in the changing room was a "he"? well coz after i knocked (and later banged)the door for the idiot inside to get his bloody ass out and got no reply... i shamlessly bent down and looked under the door...!! i looked under to see if there was someone really inside or if the door was just plain stuck!!  and GUESS WHAT I SAW.....!!! there was someone inside. and he was trying on the same trunks i asked my friend to try on. now obviously a girl wont try on trunks right?
