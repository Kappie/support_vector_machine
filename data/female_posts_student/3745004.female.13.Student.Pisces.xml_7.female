So it starts off with me and my brother in my room just sitting when my mother and some random lady person comes in. They sit at a table that is at the foot of my bed in my dream and look at us. We look at them. Mother dear tells us that we re wolves!! And we are all like YAY! ^^ *bouncy bouncy bouncy *! And the lady person is all nice and gives us papers to fill out. Something about mating season. Well like. We don't have time to fill it out and we go to this place. We walk right next door to the old school, but as we are walking it changes to a forest. There we find wolves everywhere! hundreds of wolves! And like, most of them are really thin with their face and body so I change into a beautiful pure black wolf (most of the other wolves were brown) and like I walk down there. Here I look around and see the lovely brown wolf. Not thin like the others and not fat. Just, perfect. I run up to him "Hello? Hi? Heeeelllllooooo?" But before he can answer me some random werewolf in his human form blows a whistle and we all have to line up just like in the old school! Then like, I look for that wolf I was trying to talk to, but I can't find him. After that we went home and got the papers to fill out again. I started to fill it out like my brother, but he finished first (because most of the time he was trying to sit on my paper). When the lady comes back from where ever she was I showed her my paper and she gives me another one after telling my brother to not do that. I try to fill it out again, but for some reason I was not sitting at the table. I soon lay my paper down again just to take a break when my brother comes over and sits on it and tears it. I'm all "grrr" The lady comes in and I show her my paper and shes all "*sigh* I didn't think it would take you THIS long to fill it out." I get the paper and sit at the table and do the second question then look at the first. It says to write your parents and grand parents and great grand parents madden names and I'm all "What the heck? Do we have to do the first one?" and the lady is all "No, you can skip that one." So I do most of the paper before I wake up. OHH! Wasn't that fun? Being a wolf was the best thing I have ever felt. OH! I want a continuation of that dream!!!
