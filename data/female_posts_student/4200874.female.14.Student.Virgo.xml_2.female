Jade gave me that Salmon thingy Majella was eating the day before. SO nice of her. Pleasantly surprised. I'm  definitely  one lucky gal, not only to have such pals, but just for being... lucky! ;)       Oh wait... so contradicting myself here... Not too lucky coz I do have homework, contrary to what I'd been hoping for. Well, at least it's just a G.E worksheet. Not forgetting my revision for the tests next week.       Okay so here's the plan. Finish up G.E worksheet, highlight important points  rearrange notes in G.E textbook to prepare for G.E test. Read King of the Castle. Do the same for Biology. That's only for tomorrow. And on Sunday, Biology all the way. Sure as hell hope I won't screw this organised, brilliant  beneficial plan of mine like I always do. Cross my fingers.       Got locked out of my home today for about 15 minutes while my sister was having her shower inside. She used 20 cubic metres of water, good? Or bad? I serioualy have no clue. Oh  English lesson was a BORE. Lilo  Stitch? Oh c'mon. What a DUMB show! Really pissed about both, waste of MY time! Anyhow, was barely watching the movie... reading Anna Karenina. Made progress. Perhaps I shall read that book during the weekend dring my 'breaks'. Not a bad idea... FAT CHANCE.       And I wonder what happened during Amath remedial today (muahahaha). :P        Oooh... more gossip. Firstly, this damn well better be a rumour. I'm pretty sure it is. This just isn't allowed to happen. Not in THIS decade at least.     Justin Timberlake is out of sync with his bandmates - and they're not happy about it. The most successful member of 'NSync recently broke the news to the other four warblers that he's not interested in being part of their next album. "Justin said he's not in the mood and doesn't think it will work," a source told People magazine. "He doesn't want any part of it." Maybe he's too busy romancing Cameron Diaz or working on his second solo album, but his old buddies are crying a river. "They aren't really talking to [Justin]," the insider said. "They haven't taken it so well." Timberlake's turnabout could spell an end to 'NSync, though their record label is hanging tough. "There's no album scheduled for this year from either 'NSync, Justin Timberlake or JC Chasez," a spokesman said. "The group is still together."
