They didn't own the Canadiana sources (wish they had told me that yesterday!) nor was the book I wanted on the shelf.  I headed down to the shopping centre and went to the Gap where they were holding two pairs of 12-long flare jeans for me.  The dark rinse fit like a glove; the sandblast rinse, not at all.  Frustrated, I bought the dark pair and then taking the advice of the extremely helpful and attentive young man with the headset in the change room, I went down the street a little to another Gap.  They had a pair of sandblast that did fit, so I bought those too (also from a very attentive young man with a headset).  Pleased with myself, I returned to the mall, picked up a thank you card and I returned home to remove the tags and waltz over to Mass and ... discovered that the Gap in the shopping centre left the security tag on my jeans!!  Now, the centre is a good 35-40 minutes away by subway, so I didn't want to go all the way back there.  I checked online and found a Gap much closer to me and went there instead (with receipt as proof!) and they kindly removed the security tag.    Eventually I made it over to 12:10pm Mass.  D. was the celebrant (probably the main reason I go at all every Tuesday!) and I read a fantastic bit of news in the bulletin.  It's moving season for the priests and I was extremely concerned that D. would be leaving the parish.  Well, he is ... but he's only moving to be the chaplain of the university, of which now I am officially a member!  Sweet!  He'll be a lot more accessible just generally speaking, and if he's half as sweet to the other students as he is to me, he'll be perfect for the role.  The current chaplain will become pastor of the parish, which is also a good move as far as I am concerned.  Of course, selfishly, I'm just glad D. will still be in the city at least another year and probably another two.  I forgot to mention yesterday's good news.  The SSNDs (nuns in Waterdown) gave me a $2000 bursary contribution towards my theology degree.  I'm so grateful to them; the thank you card is for them.  Time to study; I've been putting it off all week.  More to come...
