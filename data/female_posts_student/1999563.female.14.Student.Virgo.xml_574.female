Then the parents came to watch and all my mom did was like critize and I was like mom, just go away.  But yeah.  Lallalala.  Oh! We have a two hour layover in San Jose so I was like "Ooh!! Mandy can come and visit!" but then my mom was like she can't get past security. But we could still like..i dunno. I could go out of security then come back in or something. Haha.
