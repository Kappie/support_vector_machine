Hmmm.. i hate to be rude but i honestly don't quite like her.. =\  i dislike people who purchase tinted contacts. she has grey ones. yuk.    Mr hang  came and spoke to us today as well. although he didn't quite emphasize on what he actually wanted to as he kept cutting in with all kinds of diff experience.. the msg he actually wanted to bring across to us is to not look down on ourselves..must be confident..etc =) yeah. to find out more, read  nic 's (amelia) blog. he's a gd principal i know.  After assembly, we had a spot check. hahaaa we pretty much humiliated myself in front of my classmates and teachers.  mrs abdul  wanted our blouses tucked into our skirts/pants all the way. aah. like  lin yi qin . *tsk tsk. damn funny though. lols. we looked so much like geeks! i had a tummyache after laughing too much.  Anyways,  nic  eats too much whip potatoes..  =\ nic, cut down on that will ya? you don't wanna turn into a potato do ya? hahaaa =P
