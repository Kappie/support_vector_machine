Today's mood weather ::  sunny  A friend and I were talking last night about our muses and how there seems to be a shortage of them...let me copy what he wrote in his own journal about it.  "...we came to the conclusion that we all have a muse assigned to us. The difficulties arrive when we realize that there are only nine muses, and 6 billion people on the planet. This is obviously a problem, for even a legendary character has boundries. So, we decided that if we gave our Muse an impressive and complimentary name, she might be more willing to help us specifically."  He named his muse Melete, which means meditation. I did some research and decided on the name Isaura. It's a greek name meaning "soft air." This may not make much sense to those of you who aren't writers, but when I think of something like air being described as soft, I'm somehow comforted. The connection here is that my writing has always been a huge comfort to me. Hence, Isaura. Plus, I find it fitting that its a Greek name, as the muses were originally from ancient Greece. Hopefully now that she has an "impressive and complimentary" name, she'll be more loyal to me and will come when I need to be comforted.  In other news: I'm being published! A group I'm part of is publishing an anthology of work relating to pain/coping and one of my poems is going in it. The book will be published through lulu.com, a self-publishing website, and will only be available online for the time being. Isn't this great?! I'm so incredibly excited about it.    RIGHT NOW    mood ::  inspired (perhaps naming Isaura was just what I needed)  listening to/watching ::  Superfly by Thousand Foot Krutch  eating/drinking ::  Dr. Pepper  craving ::  nothing!  talking to ::  nobody  thinking about ::  I need to go read Huck Finn.  wishing ::  nothing really.  wearing ::  jeans and a red sweatshirt (it's been uncommonly cool here for August)  random ::  I'm being published!
