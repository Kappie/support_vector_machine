This is for several reasons.  1, My life isn't very interesting. 2, I'm afraid of really posting about my life (Why ?, I don't know.)  and 3, I don't know.  It's not that I don't go online very often.  I spend over 27 hours a week online.  I do have a life but I just don't feel it's very interesting.  Imagine this life..  6:30 am: Wake up  get ready for the day. 8 - 10:15 am: Go to school. 10:30 - 4 pm: Go to work. 4:30 - 6:45: Go to school. After 6:45: Go home, eat, do homework  go to sleep.  This is my schedule Monday through Thursday.  Friday, Saturday,  Sunday I stay with my boyfriend most of the time.  We go out with friends on Friday  Saturday night and get drunk.  During the day on Saturday's I either go swimming or hang out with my dad and nephew.  WOW !!  What a fuckin' life.  That brings it all together.  Basically, my life is a fuckin' bore for other people to read.  I realize that it's boring...but regardless I'm happy.  I read a lot of people's blogs and they are so full of excitement and change.  I don't have guy problems or other issues (which I believe is what makes an interesting read) but I'm so glad I don't.  I'll tell you why..All my life my mom has tried to give me a stable life but unfortunately my dad is the most unstable person in the world..constantly moving, constantly changing.  I've had plently of drama in my first 20 years of life.  Family drama.  Guy drama.  Love drama.  Friend drama. drama. drama. drama.  That's all I had for such a long time.  This past year has been great for me.  I've changed my personality and I've changed the way I react to situations.  I don't want drama anymore.  I'm tired of it.  I don't want to cry.  I don't want to hurt.  I don't want to be afraid.  I just want to enjoy life and my loved ones.  During the past year me and my boyfriend have changed so much...for the better.  I can honestly say we don't fight.  Occasionally, we will  have an argument but we don't let it get past a simple acknowledgment of different opinions.  I'm not jealous anymore.  Jealousy is ugly.  It made me such an ugly person, it wasn't me.  I remember when jealousy controlled my life.  This really stems from the fact that I was not comfortable with myself.  I only have one drama left in my life and that's stupid co-workers..I'll get to that in my next post.  I've got to end my first real entry cuz I've got to go deal with shit @ work.  I'll get back to this next time.
