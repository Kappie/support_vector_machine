I guess you could say it sucked. If you want to know why then you can just ask but I'm not going to take the time to write all of it in here. All I'll say is that a couple of my friends (or so they are called) flirt really badly with the guy that I like. That's all I'm going to say about that because it's to upsetting to relive. Well, spring fling was fun for about the first half an hour. Then it all went to crap. Oh, and I saw Heather's prom pictures today. I realized I have no physical attraction towards Gavin whatsoever anymore. I still love him with all my heart though.  Sometimes I wonder why I'm even here. My friends betray me. My family could care less about me. Guys don't like me. I'm just "average" at everything.  By the way, I'm over this whole stupid thing. I'm just going to forget about this because he's not worth it and I hate everything. I'm just going to go back into my depressing phase and stop eating and harm myself again.  Just to make this clear: I AM COMPLETELY OVER LIKING THIS PERSON! He is not worth it at all. And by the way, I don't stare at him in spanish. He's just to vain and thinks that everyone wants him. Well, guess what, here's a little awakening, not everyone likes you. In fact I'm suprised that anyone does. I don't know what I was thinking when I liked him. I must have been on hyponotized or something.  Oh wow, how I change emotions so quickly. This was written over the course of an hour.   Listening to: [All Downhill From Here by New Found Glory]  You’re hiding something, ‘cause it’s burning through your eyes I try to get it out, but all I hear from you are lies  [Pre-Chorus:] And I can tell you’re going through the motions I figured you were acting out your part  Once again, we’re playing off emotion Which one of us will burn until the end?  [Chorus:]  Catalyst, you insist to pull me down You contradict the fact that you still want me around And it’s all downhill from here And it’s all downhill from here    Your good intentions slowly turn to bitterness  Reoccurring episodes with each and every kiss (Let’s go!)  [Pre-Chorus]  [Chorus]   And I can’t believe you pulled it off again Or notice till it all sets in You’ll deny it ‘til you’re at your bitter end   [Pre-Chorus]  [Chorus]   And you keep pulling me down!  (pulling me down) (pulling me down)  You contradict the fact that you still want me around  And it’s all downhill from here And it’s all downhill from here
