He has told me he wants it a few times on the computer, but he can't say anything when i'm in the room with him.  That makes me feel sooo bad.  It makes me feel that he finds me so unattractive that he can't think of sex with me until he doesn't see me.  Until he's watching hot girls get fucked in porn.  I know i don't look that bad.  But it makes me feel like i must be such a horrid looking person.  This constant rejection is killing me.  I really need to do something about it.  But he's basically become my best friend over the past year and i don't want to lose that.  ANd i don't want to see him with anyone else.  UGH.  It's just very painful.  Well, i got a C in financial accounting.  I passed, but if i hadn't gotten bronchitis i prolly would have gotten an A.  BLEH.   I'm supposed to write down 5 to 10 goals for my character in the Shadowrun game, due tomorrow.  I will get an extra point of Karma for it.  But i really don't feel like doing that now.
