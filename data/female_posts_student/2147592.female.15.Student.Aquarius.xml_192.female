Tough luck is that a week has already passed, so only another to go. And soon he'll be moving to America :| Just what I wanted... I am now no longer orange :(...but brown :). It looks ok I suppose, I just need to get used to the change... my life is so boring! Lol...well yeah, I've made loads of friends at teh place, it ain't awkward at all, at The Strand I hate it...probably due to teh fact that they kept swearing at me...well I'm off, I'll try to write more detail another day Toodlepipxxxxxxxxx
