I hate when its muggy out, because it reminds me of how many unnecessary vehicles we have on the island. Honestly people, car pooling is the way to go. And Im not one to tell others to be more energetic, but you can walk to wherever you want to go a lot of the time in half an hour.  Anyway, so it got nicer out at suppertime which is good.. That and toothpastefordinner.com and some random harry potter puppet show website that katie sent me to is just making me in a better mood. Which is great because Ive been out of it and anti-social all week, and I just keep telling you, Im done of all that!  So apparently my family is having a yardsale this weekend and didn't inform me.. Its good because I wont be here to deal with strangers wanting my old crap but I love yardsales.. so Ill be missing that. But it will be good to clean out everything in my room and get room for more, newer crap. [Packrat? Just a little.]  2 days of school left.. even though I was convinced for most of the day that today was Thursday. Well actually I guess its 2 and a half days now because I have to show up for viscom and Ill just go to english because Whitlock loves me already, why not stack up some brownies before exams right?  ... I am such a keener.  btw, check out my  urlLink viscom website
