I look at my dad and was like i didn't want you but i had him look at it.  he just yelled for my mom and told her to come look at it.  my mom took one look at it and started getting sick to her stomach.  she made me sit down and then she said she had to look at it again.  well she saw it again and said lets go.  she took me to the er and they got me in right away.  my doctor was HOTT!!  he gave me six shots to numb my heel and i didn't feel any of them until he told me that he was giving me the last one.  he also told me that my heel was so hard that i broke one of his needles. it was kind of funny.   i ended up getting 12 stitches.  it hurts but it is all good.  i get them out on the 21st.  i am excited to see the scar.  i love scars.
