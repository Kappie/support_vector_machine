It's nice to fall asleep to...I can smell gasoline from the world outside my window.It's also nice to smell the city. You don't really notice a lot of things until you're re-introduced to them. Only when I've been away can I come home and appreciate the sirens, and gasoline, and constant barking of dogs. "If I could be like that, what would I do??" I don't think I'd ever want to be anyone except myself...except maybe the girl that he* loves, but that would be living a lie.. The song just changed. It's Iris by The Goo Goo Dolls. "I'd give up forever to touch you.." God, this song makes me depressed...I can be such an emo kid sometimes, and at other times I'm the total opposite. Some emotions scare me. Like being in Love...I don't have to worry about that. It's not like I'm actually in love or anything...I just have a crush on a guy...Crush. I hate that word. It soundsa so juvenile and meaningless. Maybe that's why I wanted to call it love, tho it was probably a one sided love.. It meant something to me. Actually, it still means something to me. It shouldn't though. I know that. I can't quite accept it though... The song just changed again. It's If All Else Fails by Matchbook Romance. It's hard not to go all "emo" when you're listening to lyrics like MBR's. Yeah. It's all Andrew Jordan's fault.... It's not like it could be mine, or anything...  Please don't let me cry again tonight stop the tears before they've begun and kiss me goodnight and then forever will be alright I know it will...
