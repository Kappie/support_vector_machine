I've been to the mall 4 times in the past 5 days and have spent way too much of my parent's money, I myself have not spent a penny.  Nothing personal or insightful right now, brain shut off somewhere along the second mile of our 3 (or maybe 4) mile walk, along with the circulation in my hands which are still cool to the touch.  Walking at the lake is emotionally therapeutic if nothing else.
