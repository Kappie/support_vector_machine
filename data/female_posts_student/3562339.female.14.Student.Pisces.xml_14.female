It's the same phone that my sister got for her graduation.  Graduation wasn't that bad actually.  It was outside (thank god) and it wasn't too hot.  I didn't trip or anything!  Yay!  though I was like getting chest pains and felt nauseous while waiting to "march" to my seat.  I got paired with Ian Packman... Eh.  Dr. Rosenau actually came up with a new speech this year!  Lol.  Though like the entire thing was bragging about how good he was at life.  And I mean, who would hate someone just because they had poor eyesight?  I don't get the logistics of that.  Whatever.  Tyrone didn't graduate.  He just kind of walked across stage when his name wasn't called.  Sucks for him.  It's hard to believe that the school year is over.  Good bye Welsh Valley.  I hated my experiance there, and I hate most of the people there, but eh, I'll miss it, slightly.  Yay for Lower Merion!  Yay for BC people!  Harriton   SUCKS ASS!  .  Anyways, after graduation I went out to lunch with my mom and my sister and we went to Fuji Mountain, which is like my favorite Japanese restaurant.  After I came back was lunch at school and yearbook signing.  It was a lot of fun, though it was overly hot outside.  I got soooo many signatures.  I got every single teacher's signature that I've had over all three years except for Munro's (since he pretended to hurt his arm), Mrs. Machnicki (since I didn't see her), and Mrs. Pillard (since I hate her).  Fun times.  And my picture wasn't overly bad, at least compared to last years and the year before.  De gustibus non disputandem est.  ONLY A HALF MORE DAY OF SCHOOL!!!!!!!  ...la Gu
