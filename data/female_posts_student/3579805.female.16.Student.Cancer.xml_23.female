Bill even said that i sound horrible.(side note-excuse any typos i just got in from outside and my hands are numb) Anyways....i have been thinking a lot lately. Who is to say theres a god? How are peope even supposed to really know if they believe in god or not with all these outside influences. Sometimes i feel like there just cant be a god because all these horrible things wouldnt happen. Which brings me to my next point. People are so horrible to eachother all the time. You would think that if you were raised in an abusive home you would want to treat your children like 110% better than that. So that they wouldnt have to go through what you did. I dont get peoples logic. I mean of course i dont expect people to always be happy....but just try to be better to each other so even when the world sucks maybe it wouldnt suck so bad.Another thing i would like to talk about is purpose. I dont underdstand how to know why your here...what you need to do and how to get yourself in the position to do that. Some of my friends andmy boyfriend know what they want to do. I mean did they go through everything im going through to know that, is it this hard for everyone. My granny always tells me its because i have so many options...but do i really? I just wish i would wake up one day and know. High school always puts so much pressure on you to know what your gonna do and have a plan. I dont have a plan. I dont even have an idea...i've thought of thing i wanna do but then they just conflict with other things. I wanna have a family...but i wanna travel. I dont wanna be tied down but i wanna know that im secure and have someone who loves me to come home to. I have so many things i need to decide on but the most pressing is what im supposed to do with my life. I ish i could just figure it all out. Ya know? dont even know who i am. I thought i had a pretty good idea and im not totally clueless. I know what my morals are and i will stand by them but thats not really knowing yorself completely. I know that i dont know if i believe in god,or if theres such a thing as true love. I know im afraid of being hurt. I know im afraid of losing somebody i love again and that i will do anything in my power to keep it from happening. I know that i care about my friends and i would do almost anything for them. I know i have a boyfriend who i care about very much...i dont understand why thats not enough for me.I guess i cant really do anything except for take each day as its given to me and do my best to make it count.....
