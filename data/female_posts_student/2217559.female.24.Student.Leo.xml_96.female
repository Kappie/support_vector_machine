I am leaving for Austin tomorrow after work to hang with Jen before we head to San Marcos for the weekend. It should be a lot of fun.  (Although, it has been raining a lot and it may even been raining this weekend, ewwww.)  So, it's June 23rd. I can't believe I have been home almost a full month.  It feels like forever - yet, not quite.  I don't know. Hmmm....strange.   So, a guy I grew up with (kinda - actually my aunt and uncle taught him in school and he lived in the same small town as my grandparents) has nthis totally kick ass website devoted to his incredible talent as a web designer. His site is awesome complete with great music and a showcase of his incredible photos. You must check it out. Go to Section 3, (Photos), And click Places.  This photos were taken in the same town as my grandparent's - Apple Springs, TX 75926.   www.screamingchaos.com  is the website.   what else? can't really think of anything. Everyone should join  www.friendster.com  too - it's fun and I need more friends. Even Beyonce is a member - click on the link of the day on the title of this blog.   Love you, have a great Wednesday. Oh and I will have some photos to post after this weekend.
