I still have to get my mom some things cause I feel bad I only got her 3 little things so I'll head to the mall today I guess. I'm going to Erica's in a little while where me, her, and Deb are gonna exchange gifts. I got them really cute things but I don't want to say it on here cause I don't want them to read it.. ha ha ha. Yesterday was a good day. I watched movies in like all my classes so it was a really easy day. Then, at track, Coach K kinda scared me with this whole "Milrose" thing. It's this really big track meet at Madison Square Garden. I really wanna make it but I mean I'm not out to cut my team mates throats to get it ya know? But, she kinda freaked us all out. Then we did out workout and like I was just so fatigued (sp?) but, then was the party which was outside on the bleachers by the tennis courts. It was really fun we all just grabbed everything and drank all the stuff coach brought. It was a lotta fun. Just the whole team sitting there and enjoying each others company after a long workout. I love my team I really do. I can't wait till everyone comes over New Years Eve. It's not going to be the big party that I wanted but I mean just me and my close friends. It should be good. I hope Mick isn't disspaointed that it's not the big party I told him I was gonna have but I mean it should be fun.  I talked to Shawn and James the other day on the phone. It was so nice to hear thier voices again. And James did his Dr. Evil impression for me and God I was laughin SO hard like, I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. Canadians make everything better don't they? I actaully just got back from the mall, I started this post a while ago and then I had to go to Erica's and now I'm home. I got my mom, dad, and Sheila, some more stuff for Christmas.  But, Erica and Deb gave me really nice things. Deb gave me a bag and this hat I had wanted for the Cross Country Dinner. Erica gave me "Down With Love Chocolate" (LOL) and these speakers for my head phones that I have wanted for a while so I was really happy and (now I can tell you) I got Erica an Abercrombi shirt that says "Bring me to the Mistletoe" and underwear that say "Vixen" and "Prancer" and I got Debra Abercrombi PJ pants and underwear that say "Unwrap Me" and "Gifted". I thought they were cute lol. I think we are the only girls who buy underwear for each other lol. Then Barbra made us breakfast and then we chatted about how we miss being little and like Christmas when we were little. It was nice. It was how a Christmas Eve Morning should be spent. Well... If I don't talk to you again tonight or tomrrow, Merry Christmas and I'll talk to you all later! 5 Days Till We Are Mickorized!!! XOXOXOXOXO
