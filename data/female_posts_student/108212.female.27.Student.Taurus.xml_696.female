For those of you out of the loop its a "Nerd" convention filled with would-be-hackers, network gurus, and of course nerds like me.  This is my first DC, I am so anxious.  I ran into Pat Norton from TechTV at the Hard Rock Hotel playing Black Jack.  I played a couple of hands on his table but lost.  (not much of a gambler).  This is also the first for me that my manager agreed that I can charge the flight costs to the company. Woohoo!!! I am so appreciative of it since I got to fly first class thanks for the upgrade from my JFK connections.  Flight was kinda bumpy but it was great to be in "friendly" skies. Las Vegas is soooooo HOT.  Okay, gettin ready to dip in the pool I am putting on some sun block...for those of you that tan easily I recommend SPF45 or higher. Who is the server for our site?  I might be able to find some answeres here at DC.   more to come  ~NET
