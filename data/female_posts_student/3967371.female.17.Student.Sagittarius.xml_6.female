It is only now did I consider concede               Why must I, for so long, hope   When I knew that I had no hope                                 Why must I, for so long, love   When I knew no love was meant for me                           Why must I, for so long, stand in the rain   When the sun is waiting just beyond the clouds                                      When the song can be stopped   And my life can finally continue.
