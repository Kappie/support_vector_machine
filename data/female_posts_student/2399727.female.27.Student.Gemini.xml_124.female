They more or less match my iris dinnerware.  Took the subway back here, washed everything, then left for SMC.  Dropped off OOTC reflection to Fr. Terry, picked up  The Mike  for  urlLink a nice article in Memoriam on Fr. Pat , then dropped into Mass.  Celebrant was Fr. D.  OK, I still haven't heard from him.  Two weeks now.  What's the grace period on returning a phone call anyway?  Dropped into  urlLink Rabba  for lunch, milk and, as it turns out, cheese-for-pastor.  This is getting expensive!  I think I have everything now.  Roommate M. is lending me some sugar so at least I don't have to go buy a pound of sugar I will use a teaspoon of.   Only forgot to look for a pot holder.  I will be creative and improvise with a newspaper or socks or something... :-)  M. called.  She is under the weather so no  urlLink Mr. Greenjeans  for us tonight.  No A.I. either; Pres. Bush is going to be yammering on about something.  Came home, ate, watched S.O.  Stupid today.  Glad Amy fixed her roots, though! :-)    Can't register for Psych until April 20.  Hope there's still space by then.  I will try at 6am and then let the secretary know if I got in or not.     So don't feel like working on my diss. proposal.  I made a list of things I need to look at but I just don't care!!!  I'm too tired.  No blogs lately E.?  Back to work now?  More to come...
