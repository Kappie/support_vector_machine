I don't want anymore of this drama lol. I'm a reformed drama queen lol. Last night after everything happend i felt centered but now im iffy. Maybe i should...nevermind..not gonna say it on here. Tomarrow is FCAT..and if ms.bitch from hell dempsey didn't want us to bring our holocaust stuff then i wouldn't have to bring anything to school. grrrr..makes me pissed. All of the other teachers are letting us relax and stuff and watch movies. But NOOOO ms.dempsey just has to have her holocaust packet done for a grade. They tell us to relax...Like history is relaxing..its FREAKIN DEPRESSING!..Everytime we watch a movie or look at pictures of the holocaust i feel like crying. Anyway...emily hope you feel better.     Well i'll post later on today.
