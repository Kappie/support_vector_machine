Which was really nice of him. After that we played pool. I had a great time. We also met Jeff, Jason's roommate. We had fun and did a lot of talk...well i did a lot of talking. I just couldn't shut up. What is my problem??? please friends be honest with me. Am i some bitch that can't shut up? I have been questioning myself since last week. I need to change things in my life. Since i have been in Fredericton things have been so much better. I am having the most amazing conversation with Robin. Thanks Robin you always know how to make me feel so much better. Your an amazing friend. Love and miss you!! Well thats all for today.....have a good day!
