Cause someday, someday I'll be all  urlLink Scary Spice Fit  - don't forget the  urlLink rack of terror   the  urlLink jumping mat   3.  urlLink And because I want to save on gas   4.  And I'll need something to read - so perhaps  urlLink this nice collection  or  urlLink this one  by my man Luther. (Note:  I'll accept either the CD-ROM or Hard Copy versions of either.  But if you get me CD-ROM's I'll also be expecting a  urlLink Windows emulator  program for my Mac.
