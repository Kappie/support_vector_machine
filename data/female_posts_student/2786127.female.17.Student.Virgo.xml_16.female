Strange. so very strange. I remember why we used to be good friends though...him and I have an easy time talking to each other. Thats rare with me, having someone around thats easy to talk to. right now the only people i have for that are tim and makenzie. I used to have lindsay, but as previously stated, no more.  My hair needs to be CUT. Its way to dead and blonde and over stripped of all its natural beauty and nutrients. Stupid freshman year where i began this stupid hair dye journey. Now look where its gotten me. Its lead me straight into the hands of hair death. I can't cut it right now though i desperately wish too. Must keep long hair for senior pictures in about 4 months. must...resist temptation... I have so much shit to do tonight but here i sit typing on this because i don't want to do anything. That and I'm waiting around for nate to come over...I'm scared. I hope...he still misses me i guess. I dont know. BAh. I need to pack because i leave tommorow. And i need to do homework, because in us history i'm BARELy pulling off a B at them moment and i can't blow off this stupid paper thats due tommorow that i've had all week to do but somehow *magically* haven't started until...well...i haven't even started it yet. hmm.  I feel sick. to much coffee. Stupid not sleeping...ever. I have to go.
