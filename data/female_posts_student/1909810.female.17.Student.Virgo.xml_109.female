Wasn't too difficult but it took me a little bit of time to figure it out. Anyways. Ani. What is there to say? There are not enough words in the english language to describe how incredibly wonderful she is. The show last night...wow. She played some really awesome new songs that I can't wait to buy on her next CD...(wonder when that will be coming out..?) She also played a handful of my favorite songs. Some of them include: Your Next Bold Move Anticipate Everest Shameless As Is If He Tries Anything Dilate (awesome :D) Swandive Phase Rain Check and two poems: Platform and Grand Canyon  Pretty awesome choices no? I bought her "vote dammit" t-shirt ( urlLink clickety ), the first in her series of bootleg CDs :D it's really awesome, an Andrew Bird CD (he was the opening act, I thought he was pretty awesome), some magnets for my lovely Erica (one says "Babe Magnets" :D) and Leslie bought a shirt (well I bought it but she's paying me back...she didn't have cash at the time) She got the "Folking you up" one. Yay, and I was also given a free CD, with a bunch of the RBR artists on it. So yeah, it was fun. Awesome. I had a GREAT time, and I wish she would play here more often...
