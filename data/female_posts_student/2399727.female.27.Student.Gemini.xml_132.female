He'll only redeem himself in my eyes if he gives his kids a decent portion of his winnings.   I won't comment on the three ex-wives...  As the Toronto Star said today, we're reveling this seventh day in  urlLink music history  happening in Toronto.   Renée Fleming is at Roy Thomson Hall, Isabel Bayrakdarian is appearing with the TSO, and at our very own barn the Canadian Opera Company will premiere Richard Wagner's  Ring  cycle with the opening of  Die Walküre , directed by Atom Egoyan and designed by Michael Levine.   I have a ticket, of course, to the latter, which I am clutching as if it were gold.  The tickets have sold out to most of the six performances.   You go,  urlLink Richard .  So, in anticipation of this four-and-a-half hour spectacle, which I have never seen in a stand-alone production, I shall be packing my purse full of inconspicuous goodies and preparing for the musical event of the year in Toronto.   I couldn't sleep last night but I won't let that hinder the excitement...  More to come...
