If you spend enough time with a person, when it's just you and them, the person can turn out to be almost completly diffrent than they normally act around you. I definitly have a new respect for someone.  Yes, that's right folks. I have absolutly no courage. None. It's definitly not there.  But I'm also lacking major in the self-esteem, self-confidence, all of the above. Yeah. I think I might need to work on that in order to aproch the aproch-ee. Yeah, about that, I'm definitly not saying anything to anyone else. Word gets out. Easily.  I'm definitly going on a hour and a half of sleep. That's so not cool man. I didn't sleep until about 9 in the morning until about 10:30. But, for some odd reason I'm okay. I mean, I had the all day track meet @ East Palestine from 7:30 a.m. until almost 6:00 p.m. when I got home, then I walked down to Harry's hung out there, came home and got my clothes, went back down and hung out all night. And, I basically just got home. Sounds like loads of fun, right? Damn right it was fun. Wow. I bet you wern't expecting me to say that, were ya? Well. So what. I can't wait to talk to someone! Seriously!  When I wasn't talking to this person, he was always online. And now that I'm not, he's not on. Go figure. That's okay.  He's still talking to me.  Does that make me Mary? Wow. I hafta talk to Rachel Martin today. I have somethings to tell her, a few updates. It'll be gravy, and she'll be mad, then she'll be sad, and it won't be gravy anymore. It will suck. But that's okay, because that's what I'm here for! I listen to everyone's problems! I don't know why, I just do. I don't like to all the time, but I honestly can't be mean. I don't have it in me. I wish that I could be mean sometimes, just to know what it's like, then I'd want to turn back because I don't think that I could go that long with out cracking a joke, or being anti-mean.  Some people think I am mean already.  I don't think I'm mean.  You know what? I am so totally just rambling on and on and on and on in this entry it's crazy shiz pimp. That's right. I guess that's what happens when you get this little of sleep, worry about everything that's going to happen, are mad hungry and kinda bored out of your mind because there is no one here besides, me and the 'rents. It's amazing that I can go from never being allowed to do anything, to actually finding that I barley spend anytime at home. Not like that's a bad thing or anything, because it's all fun and games, but I do get tired after a while. Like riight now. I'm so freaking sleepy man. Oh well. It was fun. No regrets right? I think I need to stop worrying so much. That's not good. I think it might be making me go bald. Even though I'm not going bald. It might soon if I don't stop.  Im going to go, before I ramble on even more. Blah. See YOU on the flip to the dip side.
