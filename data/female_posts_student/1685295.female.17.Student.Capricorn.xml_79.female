'Sides, Deadinside does things alone...shut up...Anyway, sorry about that Dollface, I think it might have been my fault for your bein' sick and stuff...so yeah sorry...  Yeah, I know you girls love us, can't help but right? Ha ha ha...you're gonna kill me...Bunch of crap goin' on for those people unlucky enough to have chosen to eat a nice juicy stake, filled with E. Coli and other goodies.  Seems people just don't get the idea about THROWING ROTTEN MEAT OUT.  And eating it too? There are better ways to clean out your stomach you know.  Wow, I really have nothing to talk about, since I'm not gonna share my personal life...hm...well I'm just gonna wrap this up with more boring drivel and yet another uncredited quote!  I'm Deadinside, and I've effectively bored you all.  "Republicans need to understand the importance of bondage between mother and child" (If you want freedom from this and other crap destroying the US, go  urlLink here )
