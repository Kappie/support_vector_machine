I was there!!!!   And Wal-Mart!!! We've got to quit missing each other!!! Grrr...  Anyway, people, I demand that you call me this week.  I won't be home until Next Sunday.  Not like 2 days from now sunday, but the sunday after that.  473-2890.  Screw the stupid psycho-killers who might get this number.  CALL ME!!!! I'm BEGGING you!!! PLEASE!!!  I need at least some sanity.  Besides, you'll be able to hear my funny Southern accent.  So there's a plus for you.  CALL ME!!!
