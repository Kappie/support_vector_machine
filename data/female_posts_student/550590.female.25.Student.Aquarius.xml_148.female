(2) If you get injured at your internship, you're not covered by Workers' Comp because you're not an employee and you're not covered by the UCF insurance either, so I hope you have your own health insurance to cover any injuries...oh yeah, and home visits are a mandatory part of the experience.  (3) If you want to do your internship at your job, you have to get them to give you another position so you can learn something, and you have to write a paper about it...oh yeah, and we prefer if you don't get paid for that either.  (4) If you want to spend even more time at your internship than we require, you can take an Incomplete for the year.  (5) Get over the fact that no one here will get all A's...  ...Over my dead body. It's gonna be a hell of a semester, folks.
