I'd never want to have witnessed something like that! Okay...some guy killed his girl by shooting her like 3 times in the head! Then goes to some chinky hotel! And guess what else...I went to Brandon's and we went visit his grandma who happens to live like next door to that same chinky hotel...I HAVE  BAD  LUCK! This is so freaky!      Well...besides all that, I didn't do anything today. Just sat around being lazy. Woke up late...watched  Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights ...which is like an AWESOME movie! Then I went downstairs, got my new pants in...these actually stay up...but the pant legs are so wide and the crotch is still a little long so I stuck them in the washer/dryer to make them shrink...they fit a little better now, the legs are still wide...but hey, they're comfy...then I ate some  Dominoes ...mmm pizza...then I went to my baby's house...that's it...WHOO-WHOO!...haha
