I'll be the platform shoes and undo what heredity's done to you... You won't have to strain to look into my eyes I'll be your winter coat buttoned and zippedstraight to the throat With the collar up so you won't catch a cold  I want to take you far from the cynics int his town And kiss you on the mouth We'll cut out bodies free from the tethers of this scene, Start a brand new colony Where everything will change, We'll give ourselves new  names (identities erased) The sun will hear the grounds Under our bare feet in this brand new colony Everything will change
