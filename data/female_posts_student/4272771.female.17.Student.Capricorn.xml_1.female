But despite the carefree look she admits it;s a carefully crafted disquise. 'If I'm having a crummy day, I pick out clothes that look like how I want to feel,' she says in her trademark breathy voice. 'The flowers, the butterfly, they're...happy'" Isn't that great? I just thought it was an optimistic remark and very true. Okay...so the best thing to happen to me since water bottles with sports top lids??? Well  urlLink http://www.indie1031.fm/main.html  is a radio station online with all of my fav music. Literally I love all of it. Now seriously I was having this thought today...what if you date the guy you are supposed to marry too early? What if God meant for you to not be together until you were actually ready to have a relationship in which would last a much longer time. Cause if someone starts dating in lets say high school but they were actually supposed to start after college then they may have met too early and gotten sick of eachother. Can that happen? Just a random thought...
