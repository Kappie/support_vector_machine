We went on this very intense hike on Wednesday and saw and Indian Rock shelter and an older Miners Furnace. So after work on Thursday I jetted down to Ross's (I get Fridays off). And had lobster two days in a row! I love that stuff. Ross even made me hush puppies. So I continue to work out all the time and chill with my friends. Just been busy getting my life back is all. I would also like to announce the arrival of my Mac Power Book LapTop! It is my baby and I pick it up today! YAY. I enter the  urlLink  Mac World  .  On my other hand, this is the third night in a row I have had really disturbing dreams. In fact whenever I am around Ross I get them, maybe he keeps me in tune with my subconcious. One is a continuation where I dream of the love of my life. As good as that sounds, if you know who that was then you know my dilema. He's gone. I would love to dream about the man I will marry and whom I love very much, but instead I still get haunted in my dreams of someone else. Second is sort of a continuing theme. The albino snake. But unlike last time this one looked like a cobra and in parts was almost translucent. Mom and I went for a job interview with John for a Basket Ball Coach job. John looked at the snake and accidentally let it escape. The owner (the man giving the interview) said it was fine and smiled. John was bit in the leg first and left Mom and I to go to the hostpital. Then I was bit in the legs three times, but I did not notice the third till I was at the hospital. My Mom noticed hers when I described that the snake bite did not hurt really, hers was on her toe. And then I woke up. Like the last one of the albino snake I could not fight it off or stop it and was bit. But this time each family memeber was bitten also and in the legs of all places. Not sure what it means but this theme bothers me every time. A friend suggested it might mean purity (the white) but then why would it be so evil?
