T_T (BTW, the UPCAT is a college entrance exam. Prolly the hardest, not only because of the test, but also because of the sheer competition) Then the week after the UPCAT is exam week! Haay. If I didn't study before, I don't know how to compare how I dont' study now. It's not that I really don't care, it's just like.. I don't have any motivation. No dream. No goal. I dunno. It's like I'm letting myself get blown about by the wind? Where ever the wind may blow.  I wish I knew what I wanted from life.
