He had a go at me over something he obviously feels strongy about, and it's not as if I'd know anything about it, so just basically took it very badly. Not sure if he's noticed yet.  I'm the sorta person who gets offended and upset quite easily but I don't show it with words, just tend to give the guilty person the silent treatment. Feeling pretty pissed off at the moment and not really willing to show any affection towards Jamie because he upset me.  I never seem to be able to forgive people easily, and so give them the cold shoulder for a few days before giving in and showing affection. Never really worked out why I find it so hard to trust people and forgive them when they do silly little things that upset me.  I'm guessing it's all to do with the fact that I was bullied at primary school. Not very confident with myself, and so prefer to stay in rather than go out and possibly be faced with someone who likes to express their thoughts openly. A lot of my 'friends' don't understand why I lack self esteem. Even Jamie is pretty oblivious to it, though he does know I don't particularly like who I am, not sure he's chosen to acknowledge it properly though. It's usually "go to the gym then." It's not as easy as that though, is it? Nothing ever is.  I've been asking my parents to pay for me to go to a gym with my sister for 10 months now. My sister has lost a lot of weight and is currently a size 12, while I've only managed to lose three stone. She often nags me to go to town with her and then she drags me to shops where only the skinniest of people go - New Look, Select and so on... I'm sure she just likes to shove it in my face that I can't wear clothes like that.  Then we come to my sister. I hate her sometimes. I can't say I love her, even though I'd be devastated if anything ever happened to her. She's one of the people that used to bully me I guess. She has always been bigger than me and so if we ever had a fight it would usually result in me cowering in my room after having her take her anger out on me by hitting me repeatedly. My parents didn't stop her like most parents would do... They just ignored it. If I remember right, I'd catch mum laughing a little sometimes. My grandma was the only person who stuck up for me. She hasn't really done it much in recent years.  It's unfair that everyone in my family is thin and I'm fat. I feel out of place, kinda like the black sheep of the family. I feel so out of place with my so called 'friends' as well. Maybe they want me to be fat so they look good. I dunno. I feel out of place with Jamie too. He deserves so much more than I can give him, and I hate myself for that.  I feel out of place with everyone.
