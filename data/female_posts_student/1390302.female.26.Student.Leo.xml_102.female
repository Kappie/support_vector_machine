Still, there are some things that I feel very strongly about.    Once such thing is my Internet group. I talk part in several Internet groups, writing groups where I contribute to an overall story with lots of other characters.   They’re Startrek based, and it’s something that I find very much enjoyment in.  Though work, and several years of membership I have obtained a command position, but there are so many issues.    I am dedicated to working them out, very dedicated.  I just wish that everyone else were.  I am not willing to let it go and I don’t think others should be either.  So call me crazy, but I’m dedicated to something that I enjoy.  On another note, I got my first assignment to the writing group that I joined.  I will be working one on one with a writer to improve my writing skills.  I will also be earning college credit.  I am really excited about it so wish me luck!  Oh, one more thing before I go.   urlLink Matt’s opened a new blog , y’all should check it out!  Kristyn
