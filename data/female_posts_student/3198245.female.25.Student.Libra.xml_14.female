I dunno, I just like Gil Grissom's personality better than Horatio Caine. It's wednesday right now and I have my CSI appetizer on Studio 23...later, the main course on AXN. I also watch the double episode every mondays. My fascination doesn't stop there. Every friday and saturday I watch Crime Night on Discovery Channel. Although it's not as dramatic as CSI it's still fun to watch. I'm just a sucker for mysteries.   I have to watch CSI as much as I can before school starts again.
