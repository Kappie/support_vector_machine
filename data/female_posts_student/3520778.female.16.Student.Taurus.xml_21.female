I've seen so many people been broken for weeks and months on end because of a love relationship that fell apart.  Whether it be between two friends or a couple...it's a lasting thing that stays with you most of your life.  It's also interesting how words can affect you so deeply.  There's a saying that goes, "I might not remember what you said, but I remember how I felt".  How true.  One right word might stick with someone for a week, but one wrong word will stick with someone for more than months.    It seems so obvious.  People get attached to people, and then words break them apart or bring them together.  But it's almost sickening how one person can be so heartbroken and so hurt and so...damaged over someone else.    So why, after so many mistakes of the human race, haven't we learned to guard our mouths and our hearts?  To remember that nothing is final with a boy or girl until marriage and nothing is final with your parents until they pass away and nothing is EVER final with God?  and that you're friends most likely will move away.    That the words you say can never be taken back and neither will the actions.  That no matter how hard you try you will always have some heartache if you don't guard your mouth and your heart.    I would bet big money on the fact that the devil LOVES it when we don't guard ourselves...knowing that we'll mess up and eventually, get hurt.  Too bad we can't gain the wisdom of 54 years of life when we're 17.  Too bad we can't get God's exact plan for our lives when we're 4.  I guess that's what the bibles for...and good pastors...and good spiritual mentors...and the Holy spirit.  To help us through the big mess ups and the emotional and spiritual 'scrapes' of life.
