We played Pom and Circumstance 9 and 1/2 times through. Then, Kristen, Matthew, and I left to go to Steak N' Shake to get some shakes. We also brought back some for Chris and Emily. Good times. Then after graduation, I just hung out with Chris and Kristen for a bit.   Yesterday, hm....I went to a few graduation parties. Less than I expected but, I couldn't get to the other few I was supposed to go to. I went to Brandon's with Allyce. That was fun. Alstadt and silder showed up. I was surprised, but I guess they were showing up at all the graduation parties. Then, Anna showed up and I went with her to Peter's party and I was there for a while waiting for Chris because I was supposed to meet up with him before going to Matt's. Ashley came to Peter's! I was so happy to see her. We're going to hang out this summer and she invited me to her graduation party. She's so nice. :) I miss having classes with her. But, yeah, it was fun. Then, I went to Matt's with Chris and that was pretty funny. There were some people there I didn't really know but...eh. It's ok. Then, Chris, Bryan and I just hung out. It was cool. Fun times.  Today, I must study for U.S. History. Well, I'm considering it at least. I definitely need to. Anyway, I'm out. :) Peace.
