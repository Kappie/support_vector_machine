He probably wants to be home with his family. Hell need to unpack and will probably have to do some work that he missed. He only lives 5 minutes away form me. If I hear a door or car I run to my window to see if his car is in the driveway. Its so pathetic. But I guess its ok as long as I know that. Our new snake is really neat I didn't wasn't one ... Car..I resist getting up.......Anyways like having it now. It wraps around my hand and is very little. Hes sheedind skin right now because its all brown and black but when its done it will be a bright red and orange its a corn snake it will eat live mice. I haven't seen it yet but I will soon....Another car.. But no Chris *sigh* yeah again sad.  LOL I use to have this poster that said you haven't grown up until the day you have your first good laughed at yourself. I believe it. I don't know if I wrote it in the last bloc but in February ill be 15. On the 10th.    I recently broke three of my glass bookshelves. They strech across my shortest bedroom wall which is actually quite long. (car) It really is pretty bad cause I have 3 shelves worth of books reamed on all my other shelves. Or in the floor.   Even if he did go home it would be nice if he would get on the internet (AIM ) pretty fast he usually does but he hasn't went out of town but once since we've been together.(car) and IM really anxious because I want to know how everything went. I cant imagine how he feels if I feel this way I miss him... Las Vegas sucks (is this aloud) when you younger I went a good while back and it was just bad I don't know why IM complaining now. IM a really slow typer. Chris types really really fast and makes fun of me.  In the class we had together a paper I typed got erased (when I first met him) and so he typed it for me and he started pecking the keys and it was mean.   Car
