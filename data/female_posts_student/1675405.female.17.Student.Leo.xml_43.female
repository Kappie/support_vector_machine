Oh my God, its like... permanent goosebumps in a jar. Anyways... let's just say I am now $2.00 ahead. :-) Wonderful.  Today was a good day. I woke up to my alarm clock -- and of course I pushed snooze a good 5 times -- and when I went downstairs, much to my dismay, I realized that it was an hour behind. I forgot to "spring it forward" on Saturday night. I changed like a madman and practically ran to the community center for the senior Easter breakfast this morning. Chad was already there, and being the lovely friend that he is made a short but effective comment on how I look like a trainwreck--- and on top of that a lot different without makeup. Indeed, he needs to really work on his charm but hey, maybe he won't grow up to be a schmoozer like most of the guys I know.   Dad took all of us out to Chinese tonight; probably a sheer attempt to cover what happened yesterday, and I am so not one to argue. I can never turn down a nice steamy hot order of broccoli and garlic sauce. But it was nice-- we didn't argue today like is typical of any school vacation week. And to top it all off, we played a mind boggling and table turning game of Pictionary this evening that did not result in any hurt feelings or torn hearts, but instead a bunch of sore mouths after all of that smiling. So yeah, it's been good.
