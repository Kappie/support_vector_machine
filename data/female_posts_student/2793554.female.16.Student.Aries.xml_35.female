OH wow! i dont know why im writing today, i have lots of homework that i dont feel like doing and so im not gonna do it.... im going to do this. Even though i am failing 3 of my classes....eep.  Im wearing melissas jesus pants, and they kick lots and lots of ass. thanks melissa!  Last night was crazy. I called melissa and she was all "come over theres alcohol and lots of people here!" and so i did... and when i got there i walked in the door and a whole bunch of people were crying... cause this girl was breathing all wierdly and having an anxiety attack along with being REALLY drunk. And her eyes were rolled back in her head and she was convulsing and it was all fucking intense.  But everyone took care of her... and eventually she was ok...but wow.   Alice called me today. Wierd. She sounded really pissed off, but she wanted to go snowboarding. I was not home... she left a message being all "Hi. ITS ALICE. my FAMILY is going snowboarding grumblegrumblegrumble and i GUESS i was GOING to invite you but YOURE NOT HOME. call me later or whatever. robblerobblerobble*click*" I dont even know what to do. She's insane.   Katie is back from Canada.. I'm scared. ::huddles in corner:: Dyke comes stalking, wooooooah  Im hungry, and i miss dylan.  Poop.
