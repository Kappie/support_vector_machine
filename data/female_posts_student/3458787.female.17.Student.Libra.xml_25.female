Others would say is probably the television just because it keeps them company during the most boring of times.  Teachers would say it is the pen because then they can make students write exams! hahahahaahahahah  The handphone will be  popular choice for many as some can't live without it!!!! hhahaha I bet many of you are guilty of this!  Some would say it is the lift. These are the lazy ones!  Then there are those who believe it's the calculator (the Mathemagicians of course)  HAHAHAHHHAAH but I think its the toilet bowl for obvious reasons!!!! LOL
