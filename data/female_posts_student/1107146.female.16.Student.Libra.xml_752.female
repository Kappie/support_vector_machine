Anyway, so around 7:30 (like, right after Friends, which was incredibly convenient) he called, and there was the whole small talk thing for a little while, and then he was like "Look, I need to apoligize for something."  And playing the innocent, I go "Really?  What's that?"  And he's like "I'm sorry I've kinda been ignoring you and stuff (actually he used a word other than ignore, but I can't remember what it is, but it set a different tone which is why I'm mentioning it) but I do have a good reason.  When I was going out with Anne Marie, she broke up with me because she thought I was too clingy.  I just didn't want to make the same mistake and lose someone I care about."  Yeah, so after that he'd completely won all forgiveness and everything just because he was being so damn sweet, so I was like "It's ok!"  and stuff like that and then I said "But in all honesty, just forget everything Anne Marie ever taught you, because I'm like the exact opposite."  And he was like "yeah, I figured."  Then we set up a date for Saturday.  w00t.  Lots of fun, and I (semi) did it myself.  With a lot of help from Becca and Josh.  And I'm happy.  Which is really all that matters.
