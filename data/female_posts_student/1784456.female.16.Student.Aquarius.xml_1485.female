And thismorning we had an argument about her stupid babyish clock being up on the wall, i mean, for gods sake, its got bloody teddy bears on it and it is soo lame! Did u c mars last nite, the brightest star in the sky it was, closer to the earth than it has been for 60,000 years, i saw it, i thopught it was quite cool being able to see mars but the rest of my family weren't convinced, my sis shouted 'take me home, i wanna go home' when she saw it which was rather amusing to say the least. Still doing homework, it is soooo boring, but i don't get half of it so i need to ask some of my teachers to explain it to me. hee hee! extra time! thats about it for today. xx
