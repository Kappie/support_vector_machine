I was banished from the living room because the board game Risk came out and we all know girls are incapable of playing it, or so Stephen would have you believe.  But thats fine  because conquering countries as a sport doesnt seem like that much fun to me.  Something is wrong with this keyboard, I have to type everything twice because it doesnt get every other letter.  Grrrrr.... I dn't lik tis thig.
