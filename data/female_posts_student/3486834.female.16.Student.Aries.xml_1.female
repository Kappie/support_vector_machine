We were gunna go to the mall and then see a movie.. so I ended up going with my mom. YAY! So yeah.. we saw Shrek 2!! It was soo fun! Puss in Boots is the biggest stud! Ok.. well uh Paxton and Trey were there, they sat by me and my mom. Through the movie Paxton kept saying 'dirty'.. what a weird-o! J/K, but it was sorta.. not normal.. Oh and another thing is when I got home.. Jennifer totally went off on me thinking that i went to the movies with Pax and Trey.. So that was sorta MESSED UP! But she is kinda PMSing, so I can't blame her, but shhh don't tell anyone. So it's all good between us. Well Jennifer should be over here right now, but her dad is being gay. So I am going to stay home, writing in my blog, since everyone else is busy.. no time for Asia.. :(. Ok well anyways, Michele is moving to California, I will miss her soooooo much, she is soo cool!  Much love to Micha!  I don't think there is anything else.. Hmm I am going swimming tomorrow, so that will be cool, if my mom doesn't go. Just kidding, she's.. uh.. fun.. sometimes, other times she is just .. hmm.. embarassing. Okay, well I guess I better go, you are probably about to die of boredom (however you spell it).. If you want to make me smile, post a comment, but if you don't then that's cool.
