By nights we ate quietly, listened to music or read in the library. I spent many of my nights hidden deep within the library. Fortresses of books hid me, but my real reason there was to learn. I gather books about science and medicing until one day I found it. It had been written a long time ago, by a man most likely put in a penitentiary for such radical ideals. His first page caught my eye.   Vampirism is a rare but real disease. Another name for it is pofiria. It causes changes in the blood formula: shortage of erythrocytes and iron. For a "normal" life the ill people really need blood, but not necessarily human. Receptiveness to the sunlight grows, which can cause burns even after a short period, so the vampires lead a night life, their faces whiten, bodies get skinny and so they look like classical bloodsuckers from books.   Physicians do not agree on the causes and development process of the disease. It is often said that it is being formed at genetics level, but alcohol abuse, hepatizes, some medical drugs overdose can also cause the disease.    I knew immediately that my childhood fear had manifested. Little darlings all over the world gave a silent scream as they shared in my pain. I knew, that somehow I had to stop the Windsor beauties from spreading, I knew that the vampires must be killed effectively and quickly.
