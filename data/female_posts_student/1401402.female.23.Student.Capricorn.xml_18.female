While standing in line, eye contact was made. A cool clean cut, attractive, well proportioned and imposing appearance white man glacing at me several times. Glanced away, glanced away get it. His about 5'9", mid 30's, well dressed like a business man.  After everything was paid for I rush to my car in a quickness. But I wasnt fast enough. Without noticing, the handsome man appoach me. The conversation begun....  Gavin: Excuse me, what time is it?  Me: Its about 6:15.  Gavin: What nationality are you?  Me: I'm Cambodian.  Gavin: Do you date Italian/french men?  Me: Maybe, but I dont know any.  Gavin: Your such a beauty, I had to solicit the interest of asking you out to dinner sometime.  Me: Oh my, oh wow. Why thank you but I'm involved with somebody rite now.  Gavin: Do you have a boyfriend?  Me: No.  Gavin: So that means your free!  Me: Not exactly.   Gavin: I'm a promoter for Club Hussler and I'm looking for asian girls to host or dancers for the club. Would you be interested? Making good money. Do you like to dance?  At that point we exchanged #'s  Me: Oh cool! Being a host sounds interesting. How much are we talking about here? What about being a dancer? What types of clothes?  Gavin: Host starts out about $12.50 per hour and you get to keep the tips. Dancers starts out $20 an hour. You can wear anything you like. The dancers at 1015 dresses very similar as Club Hussler and the music are basically the same as well.  Me: Ouu, that sounds like fun. So what are the hours?  Gavin: From 3pm - 9pm or 9pm - 2am. If your interest maybe we can rearranged somthing out for you. Are you a rambunctious?  Me: Hahahahha, yes I can be really wild and unruly once it comes to alcohol.  Gavin: What about Extasy? Do you like having sex when your drunk or what about on E?  Me: Umm, no, I'mnot that kinna girl. Why? Do I look that bad to you?  Gavin: My god, you dont like sex? Your just a very attractive girl, I'd just want to know you more. Do you like big men? Do you play with toys? Do you watch porno's?  Me: Gosh, what are you?  An undercover? No- No big men, no toys and yes I do watch pornos sometimes.  Gavin: Your funny, No i'm not an undercover. Just someone whos very interesting in dating a girl like you. When you watch porno's do you like to watch the big guys or the lovely women?  Me: I like the fine women.  Gavin: Your into girls?  Me: Maybe.  Gavin: Have you ever been with a girl? What type of women do you like?  Me: Never been with one. umm, in particular, I like blonde women or anyone thats really attractive.   Gavin: Would you ever be interest in making a video?  Me: NO_NEVER_What are you exactly?  Gavin: Umm, I'm a producer_ in the adult films (porno's).  Me: LOL. Oh my god, so the club is actually a strip joint?  Gavin: Not exactly as exciting as a strip joint. but would you be interested? A pretty asian woman with nice ass is what I'm looking for rite now. Would you go out the back door if a customer asked you to?  Me: NO THANK YOU but I've got to go now. Its very nice to chat with you and thanks for the offered.   Gavin: Alrite heres my business card, call me anytime if you ever need anything or come by the club and check it out.   Me: Alrite GOOD BYE.  Damn, WFT I was just talking about Seamore Butts the other day. Fuck I cant believed its really happening to me. Damn I feel really bad. Who does he think I am, a prostitute? I'm not that LOW, I'm not engaged to sex nor having sex with people for money. Damn what an asshole. At that point I was provoked. I was thrill. I was dreadful, man extremely bad. I was so hapless. I'm just so disappointed right now. But I should be happy tho. But making money in a dirty way like that doesnt exist in my world. No matter what, I'm still feeling so SHITTY.   I regret giving him my number. He called me this morning with a 408 area code. I thought it was a good morning call from the person I'm looking forward to having dinner with but it wasnt. It was Gavin! I was disappointed. Talking to Gavin really gross me out. All he talks about was wanting to know about my sex life, what turns me on? Would I ever go on dates with him. Fuck I need to blow this guy off shit. Somehow this whole Gavin thingy really irritates me. YEAK YEAK YEAK. Fuckin old fart MF.
