I mean I can't pop up on a website without someone sticking their noses where it is not concerened. *sighs* I wish I could get out of here. Just up and leave. I'd be so happy!! *cries* I wanna go to new york or tampa, or england!!! Why can't I leave? WHY, WHY, WWHHHHYY!!! Also, why am I so poor. I'm stuck watching dubs cause I am moneyless. Is this the cost of being young in america? Is it??? I swear, I have to rant so much, that, that I can't even rant here!! I swear its unbelieveable!! UNBELIEVEABLE! *sighs* That felt good, all out of my system now. *pulls on headphones and goes back to watching AMVs.* Yes, I know I am such a nerd.
