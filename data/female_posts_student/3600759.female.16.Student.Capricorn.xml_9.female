This is what Mike wrote to each of us and it is SO true:  This weekend was a blast and with so many things going through my head I forgot one thing.  I never had the right situation to let all of you know you are amazing people.  Read that sentence again.  Stop.  Think about it.  Read it again.  I wish I could have shed more light on situations but I was not supposed to because this weekend was for you, but if you ever have any conversations you want to take up with me about anything, I'm all for it.  On a more personal note:   Kara -  this weekend was started with you.  You raised the bar high for the team and everyone willingly stepped up.  Chloe-  your insights this weekend added a lot to discussions. Thanks  Melissa-  you overcame your timidness and now shine and have no fear.  Thanks  Steven-  wearing that shirt Sat. night proved your individuality.  Thanks  Lindsey-  talkative, talkative, talkative.  You were able to initiate others in the conversations.  Thanks  Veronica-  you know how to make decisions.  To know you want to be involved in creative writing already shows determination.  Thanks  Jordan-  Hey, you look like....Yes you are that guy because people want to be attached to you because of some quality you have.  You need to find it and exploit it. Thanks  Chris-  the pivot man of the group.  From your jokes to your serious thoughts, all of your statements were unique.  There is none in comparison.  Next time you travel send me a postcard. Thanks  I love all of you. Aww how Nice of you Mike or aka Nash! Well HOBY was amazing! But now I am back to real life.  Had my Bio final today, it was pretty easy, I think I did really well. Talked to Courtney on the phone and Oh Boy did she FREAK out when I told her something. Hahaha. I have a Math Regents Wednesday, Global Regents Thursday, Bio Regents Friday and a Spanish Regents Tuesday. Oh what a week! Hopefully I'll do good on all of them! Ok I think I am going to go take a nap on the couch. I'll write more later about my finals and regents and stuff. Love and Peace to all!!!  Love Ya, Liss
