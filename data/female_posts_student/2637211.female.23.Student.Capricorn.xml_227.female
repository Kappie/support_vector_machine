I mostly shouldn't even be posting, but I wanted to talk about what a nice time I had with Melissa and Liz last night, since last night I was too busy freaking out about my insane family and friends. Melissa fed me a fatty and delicious dinner. She has a good description of the meal  urlLink here . Then Liz came over and we talked a bit then walked to downtown. I probably shouldn't have worn flip-flops, because my feet began to hurt, but everything seems to be okay now, so no worries. It was nice to be out in the warm Davis night. Good times.  This morning has been about not studying for the final I should study for. I think I'll make sure I know the IDs, and that I know enough of the books to fake something, but the TA'll probably give me a B- anyway, so why put in an A effort, you know? Oh well, off to eat and study.
