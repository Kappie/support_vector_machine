He's just honest, funny and he loves me to pieces  I love my dad. I needed to go home last nite but I have duty at 1pm which would make it do difficult to come back that  early so we decided to get a late nite dine at French Roast.  There's a reason why my dad is one of the best friends i have. There's so much love in my family between me my dad and my brother  but I came to an ephinany tonight vis a vis my depression.  I haven't felt like this since me and Mike broke up. I couldnt get out of bed and though i didnt want to die , i didnt' have the strength to want to live. I was just breathing and every day even THAT was struggle.....  Same symptoms different situation.  then i realized something...... I'm going through it too... I'm leaving this relationship with my mother we are ALL leaving her.  Most divorces are just between parents and the kids get tossed in the middle but it's this messed up dynamic with us vs HER. We ALL want this to happen and until it does we are all living in this weird limbo, waiting for life to start without this dark cloud hanging over us....   To say it hasn't affected my relationships would be a lie.  I've been in some really shitty ones. The kind that put your heart through a blender In the end I've always vaciated from playing the victim to being the stone cold hearted bitch  that some might paint me to be. I don't even know what the truth is before. I've been no angel but I certainly don't deserve what I've gotten either  I have developed such a contempt for relationships in general and the institution of  marriage in particular... The thought of even kissing someone makes me sick yet I still long for an intimacy that I know I can't handle. It requires so much work to tell the people i care about that I do in fact care, but that I have neither the time or the patience to really be there for anyone...... and any attempts at that just turns out seeming so ingenuine.  And my friends? take it so damn personal.... I feel like this huge weight on my loved ones... this heavy cloud bringing those I love down with me So my not being around? Please dont take it personal, it's not you.... it's me.  I need sex but i dont want to kiss any one  I need a hug but no sex....  the two are to volatile to mix right now....  that would require  *gasp* a relationship   Epiphany # 2  I hate God and I've lost my faith in humanity  what do i have left?
