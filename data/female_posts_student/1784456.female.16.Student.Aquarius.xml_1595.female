I was online earlier i no that, and so were u lynne but u bugarred off as soon as i signed in *highly suspicious if u ask me considering u probably knew i was gonna pester u about what was going on in the quad yeaterday* actually thats a point, what was going on, i tried to get izzy and pete to talk, but no amount of tickle torture seemed to work *just kidding*. have finished my forever friends x-stitch, and am now starting a geisha *for those of you whose cultural knowledge is lacking, a geisha is basically a chinese/japanese (can never remember which) lady* It is so cool! but quite hard. it is my present for agreeing to go thru with the needle. my trousers should be coming on tues or weds so i will wear them when they get here. I am sooo glad the hardest exam is over first, but i am beginning to doubt the difficulty of the paper, of course, i am talking about maths non-calculator. rite am gonna stop wittering now. xoxoxox
