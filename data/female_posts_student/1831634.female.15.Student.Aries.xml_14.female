I just noticed.  the blog thing is back to normal.  I like this normal one waaaaay better.  anyhow.  I'm bored.  but I'm determined to enjoy this last week to the fullest.  oh!  yesterday I just read this book called "this lullaby".  it's very interesting.  it's about this girl, remy, who doesn't believe in love b/c her mother's on her fifth husband.  and then she meets this guy, dexter, and of course they fall madly in love (even though remy is denying it) and they go thru hardships, etc.etc.  ya.  v. stereotypical, but good.  in a stereotypical way.  and it's "appropriate", too, so meng won't freak out.  ya.  I started reading it and didn't go to sleep until I'd finished the book.  *sigh*  I think I listened to the dido CD 6 times through on repeat while reading that book.  -__-;;  you know, perhaps going to school isn't that bad.  *sigh*  ho-kai.  outta stuff to ramble on about.  ++sunny
