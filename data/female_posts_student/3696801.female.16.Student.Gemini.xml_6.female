Hey im not complaining though...i got to hear him...which was soooooo awesome. Mercy Me was really good too...but Micheal W. Smith...maybe its just because im young and don't like his type of music...but i guess it was ok...sorry. But that night was probably the most fun ive had all summer. I hadn't ever hung out with the older youth...they are very very fun. It was me Tyler, Nick, Jana, Jakob, Alicia, Shelly, and Craig, fun fun times. I was sooo tired this morning though...cuz i went to bed at 3:30 and had to get up at like 8:00...ok yeah yeah i got 4 hours...but that not enough for the cranky melinda...she gets cranky without atleast 6 hours of sleep. But she has gone away now...thank goodness. Well im out now. See you guys later.
