What sup with peopel constantly trying to pry into your private life? i think everyone needs their own secrets and once throw it away you're left with nothing for yourself. I have pgs of secrets, confidential poetry, no one ever knows what goes on in my mind, they have no idea what i wake up to. im keepin' it that way.  I like cute more than hot.. i just thought about that. Hot is intimidating and cutes just.. aww! meeh well. .id tap a hottie or a cutie so gimme gimme gimme  Take what you have and stop wishing. I mean when you're always craving this, craving that.. when will you finally get to a moment to liek who you are. you'll never be fuckign satisfied. live with it.  I don't even know you, why do you talk to me, just show who you are and take off that gawddamn mask. The more I see you the more I hurt.  I can't breath with out you, yet i suffocate in your presence "Now that I can see you i don't think you're worth a second glance." - Dashboard Confessional Italian movies are good. I just realized that. The ones Ive seen i love..   Infatuation   end of the fucking line
