I won't list them all cause that would be one huge run-on, but I will mention the ones that read this, and my friends, and people I'm friendly with: Shaheen, Sarah A., Scott B., Kelli B., Justin B., Jherrica B., Marcus C., Edwin C., Jasmine D., Josh E., Megan F., Lindsay F., Tripp, Sarah H., Whitney H., Kevin H., Alex (yes, I am a nice person MOST of the time), Jeff J., Stacey K., Ali/Mustafa K., Reid, Sunny, Craig, Amanda (yea thanx for that awesome and *accurate* info...u too Katrina), Anne L., Lauren L., Deanna (yay you didn't catch the stage on fire!), Russell M., Julie Ann, Nikki M., Cory, me (of course!), Stacy P., Michelle R. (double congrats on the thing we were talkin about...that's great!), Joe and Mallory S. (PLEASE tell me u got the agenda for tomorrow), Lori S., Kristen T., Yasmin T. (yay!), Kim T., Katrina (see Amanda L.), Patrica T., (Mc)Kenzie, Meredith, Megan W., EJ, Stephanie H., Lee, and Matt Z.  That was one of the most awesome ceremonies I've been in (definitely kicks Ring Ceremony's butt), and a real honor.   Oh but the best part - the stories!  I'll start from the beginning.  Hey look to ur right.  No.  Seriously look to ur right.  How about u look to ur left?  You had to be there for that one...right Nikki and Cory?  Anyway, we came into what had to be Camelot - the soundtrack, and sat down.  Meanwhile, my back is killing me from sitting up so straight, so around Nick's speech on scholarship, I began to slouch.  Then I got called onstage, and I didn't know that ur supposed to shake everyone's hands, so I almost walked right past the Vice-Principal.  I finally got thru everyone's hands (I felt sooo sorry for Bryan, having to shake everyone's hands after all those other hands...eww imagine all those germs from everyone), and went to light my candle.  The trouble was, I didn't have one of those new candles, so the wick was really short.  That meant my candle wouldn't stay lit.  First, it went out while shaking Shannon's hand, so I bummed a light from Cory.  That one went out too, so I went to Stacy P., and THAT one almost went out too!  I could see my mom mouthing something, and after the ceremony, she told me what she said: watch out!  Apparently, I almost lit Cory (who was standing next to me), Stacy, my boobs, my shirt, and my skirt on fire.  Anne L. and Julie Ann almost had their hair lit on fire, and Michael F. almost lit Josh E.'s crotch on fire.  Needless to say, don't trust the best and brightest of the Class of 2005 with fire.  So, after the ceremony, we went to get some drinks.  Man, that punch gave me a huge headache!  What was in it?  Also, something embarrassing and truly frightening happened in the length of ten minutes.  I went up to Anne to congratulate her (by the way, her dress was absolutely adorable), and her bf reminded me of someone, but I couldn't think of who.  So I said, "You remind me of someone, but I can't think of who."  "Patrick V.H.?" he asked.  "Yeah!" I exclaimed.  "That would be because we're brothers."  Yeah, that was awkward, so I basically just said something like nice meeting...bye.  Patrick got a kick out of it in 6th today...haha the ashen one!  And now for the frightening one - I was walking to the door, when something about yay high (motions to my chest) hit me, and I look down, and it's a mini-me of Alex!  Wow that's scary...I love Austin Powers, especially The Spy Who Shagged Me, but it's just frightening in real life.  Just imagine someone 1/8 of his height.  LOL!  Ok, that was a bit mean...sorry.   So it's basically downhill as far as being busy, until Saturday.  Tomorrow's the editorial board meeting for newspaper, and I'm leading it for the first time.  I'm a bit nervous about it.  This reminder goes out to Joe S., Mallory S., Mary S., Brynne, Sarah A., Alex I., Yasmin, Greg G., Brittany V., Alex F., Cory N., Summer F., Amanda P., Matt F., Karlin, and all the other people I forgot: remember to be there at 6:45 AM.  Yes, u read right - 6:45 AM!  Please be there if you can, cause it's important for yall to get used to voicing opinions (not like some of u need the practice) and just sitting in on newspaper functions.  There's a lot to talk about tomorrow, but usually we just sit around, staring at each other and eating donuts.   I talked with Boswell today, about how to raise the research paper grade, and do u kno what she said?  She reiterated, almost VERBATIM, what Alex said to me about how to make my paper better.  Even the comments are about the same.  So I guess that paid off somehow. Well I gotta cut this one short, cause my sister needs to get on for homework.  To Mallory: PLEASE remember to forward that thing to Joe!  To Joe: PLEASE remember to check ur e-mail!  To everyone else: good night.  To Alex: thanks.
