Is there really anyone out there who really has a deep crave for anchovies? what the heck are they really anyways...for some reason i thought they were some kind of artichoke, but HEY guess what they're fish...the things you learn everyday. What is the diffrence between a sardine and an anchovie anyways? All i know is that sardines got a game named after them, so they must be higher up on the appreciation scale. Have you ever heard someone respond positivley to the remark at a resturaunt : would you liek anchovies with that? Right you are: no. It's a sad sad thing, but I'm getting the hint that the little buggers aren't going to be swimming in the big blue for too much longer.   Rambling. It helps :)
