It isnt even 9 yet and already i have done 2 loads of laundry,got Noah up fed,dressed and off to day care. Cuddled with Tish :-). Payed the phone bill,had breakfast and watched 90210.     Things i still have to do before 4pm     Clean our room,Noahs room,Do dishes from last night,clean and feed the turtle, write a paper for school,study for my test tonight,work on my web site,make some phone calls,put laundry away,make dinner for Noah(his uncle is picking him up  and baby sitting him this evening)it is easier if all he has to do is heat it up.      Things i would like to do today are-- watch the movies i rented on sun,wash and vacume my car,watch all my shows that are on my tivo,play the SIMS,get a pedicure,give myself a facial and finish my book.HMMMMM i guess we will just have to see what i get done today. I always say i just wanna veg out and do NOTHING,but i cant sit still  it drives Tish nuts . I always have to be moving around i can always find something to do. Opps see just sitting here i thought of something else i need to do. Tish and I want to move so bad so i need to look online for something for us. It is crazy we cant seem to find what we are looking for at all.I am so ready to get out of here. When we move watch out i am going to be a decorating fool. I love to do that kind of stuff so much. Getting so excited just thinking about it. Well the laundry calls.     Blog ya later!
