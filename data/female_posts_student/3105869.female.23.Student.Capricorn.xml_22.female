Hm.  On a happier note, looks like the BLE has approved me.  Nice.  They had been threatening rejection.  Oh, and crim law was an A-.  I knew it.  haha.  I guess that grade just shows I understand the criminal mind, haha, of course only in a purely educational way. Not in practice.  Yeah anyway.   I heard this country song, yes I realize that is the last thing I should listen to when I'm teary, but anyway the song is called "Love, Me"  Awwww I started bawling, Dad and I heard that song together once when it first came out and both of us got teary and I knew when it came on I should change the station, but no, no...   If you get there before I do Don't give up on me I'll meet you when my chores are through I don't know how long I'll be But I'm not going to let you down Darlin' wait and see And between now and then  until I see you again I'll be loving you           Love, Me  [to: A.]
