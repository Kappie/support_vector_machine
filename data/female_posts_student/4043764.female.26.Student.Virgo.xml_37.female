However, I woke on Saturday morning with menstrual cramps from hell, an upset stomach from who knows where and an overwhelming feeling of nausea.  I slept into the early afternoon, and felt better after stuffing my face with painkillers.  As I awoke from the usual boy dream, I decided that I needed to give him his shit back.  Oh, lord, what was I thinking?  I caught  urlLink MARTA  to a station that I was *certain* was within close walking distance to his house. Little, little did I know...  An hour and a half later, I was dehydrated, hungry, crampy, bleeding, sore. I left a message with atlblingbling, depressed as hell about the fact that I was in the middle of nowhere, with no chance of walking my ass all the way back to the station. I thought I remembered the short-cut - I was just too tired.  I went to the  urlLink House of God  Church, certain that I looked pitiful enough to elicit some of the good ol' religion and hospitality. They gave me water and offered me food. Fearing a proselytizing moment, I just accepted the water and stood outside.   A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM  Atlblingbling took care of me. I am grateful. We stopped at  urlLink CVS  - started in Woonsocket, RI, home of mommy's favorite little Brownie - visited the "feminine care" aisle and stocked up on heating implements. You cannot beat 8 hours of continuous *heat* in your underwear, now can you?  Stuffed my face with more painkillers, went to the  urlLink Highlands  and stared at lots of fake sparklesparkle. And started to have more cramps.  These were damped by alcohol - no sermons please - and then followed up with tears of depression.1) Am I crazy? 2) Why did I walk so far? 3) Am I trying to abuse myself?  Answers: 1) Of course I am not crazy, just maybe a little spontaneous. 2) It was good exercise, that five-mile walk in the sun. 3) See answer #2. No pain, no gain.  Night ended with me doing a  urlLink condom demonstration  with an oyster sauce bottle and picking on the boy and how he is "so over me".    THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE  Why do I love the boy so much? Maybe because he is desperately clinging to those little heartstrings. He called and woke me from my Sunday slumber with a proposition. He fully introduced himself and used my full first name. As if I had forgotten who he was...  He wanted to cook for me on Wednesday. He called to whine about that goddammed bed (it's mine - why was there discussion?) He will not attend a going away party because he thinks that everyone who would be there would hate him. (Always worrying about who hates his ass instead of thinking about the fact that he might not see *my* ass again).  I am sure the meal will be good. He will talk, I will listen.  I will eat. He will watch.  I can practically see his heart beating every time that I see him. He is always so nervous.
