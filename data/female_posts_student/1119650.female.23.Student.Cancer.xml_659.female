Friday I went over to the boy's house, but he was already half in the bag and incapable of functioning normally. (Oddly drinking tequila with your boss since 4p.m. will do that to you come 8 o'clock.)  Hank, his brother (Hank Jr.), his brother's girlfriend (the delightful Marianne), Vicki, the boy and I watched Boondock Saints.  I'd never seen this movie and everyone who had seen it raves about it.  Now I know why.  Well there are acutally 2 reasons why:  urlLink 1    urlLink 2 .  Just kidding, it rocked my socks off, the shootouts, the concept of it all, really well done.  I finally understand a lot of people's random quotings that I never got and I'm excited about the prospect of  urlLink All Saints Day  as well.    Saturday I went to look at my new *dream car* I will withhold any information on it to avoid jinxing anything, but it was truly an amazing thing.  I'm very excited for it (hopefully).  Saturday afternoon Andrew and I went to lunch in Greenwich and saw the delightful Al Roker out with his family.  Good times indeed.  Met back up with Hank, Hank Jr., Vicki, Marianne and Becki and we headed out for a 3 hour tour of the Bronx...um, er, I mean a trip to Arthur Avenue (just kidding, Jim!).  We picked up some cheese, saw cheese elephants, bought pasta, prosciutto and bread.  The lovely Jimmy  Vicki made us a homemade Italian feast with Vicki's awesome ass kicking sauce.  Yum.  We all got our drink on some hilarious photos were taken, Reg and I headed to bed early and that was that.  Sunday yummy panckakes, trip to the mall, purchasing of some old skool nintendo-y goodness and a little starbucks  zelda thrown in for good measure.  All in all a great weekend as always, with great friends and some funny assed photos to go with it.
