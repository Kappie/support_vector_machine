I discovered that I do have a port on the front of my computer - everybody jump and clap!  I don't suppose I can insert a sound clip here? This new technology should really be a big help this upcoming semester when I plan to take more classes than I have before.  Anything that will make that easier for me and reduces the stress I feel.
