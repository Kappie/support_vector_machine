I had one of those weeks where it pains me to be without Ross and when I'm with him I just can't stop smiling or that feeling you get in your chest when you think it's gonna burst with excitment and feelings. No one wants to ever hear the good things, just the drama and sad depressing shit. It will come to me don't worry, unfortunatley I really wish it wouldn't.   It's really busy this month with birthdays:  Happy Birthday Dad, Brigid, Jacquie, Rachel, Rachel E., my friend Russ and oh yeah Happy Father's Day John and Dad and my two Grandfather's...
