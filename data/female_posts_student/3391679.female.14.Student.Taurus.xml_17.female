On the way up the mountain {by car} there are thesse two tunnels. Past the tunnels is a 3rd tunnel. Sometime in the 1800s a bus load of kids were going to the school house at the top of the mountain and the third tunnel collapsed on them. they all died. if you go in the first two tunnels in your car and turn off the lights it is creepy, b cuz it is said that the kids try to get ppl out to save them from the tunnels. One time i was with my cousin and he turned off the car entierly and we started to roll. I know what u r thinking yah it happens, but what you don't know {until know} is that we were being pushed UP hill. OK ok another thing ppl do is put baby powder on their cars and turn off the cars and when they get out of the tunnels they have handprints on their cars. Freaky huh?
