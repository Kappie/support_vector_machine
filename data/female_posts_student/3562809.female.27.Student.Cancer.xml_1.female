Or maybe it's one of those other number bands... I don't know, they all sound the same to me.  I do have a "modern rock" station on the #6 button in my car, but for the life of me I don't know why.  Tuning into it is usually like hearing tinfoil put through a cheese grater.  I can tune into an R station, or even most classic rock stations, and within 1 second I can tell what song it is.  But this modern rock stuff, it takes a good 12 to 15 seconds to even place a beat!  As a busy girl, I don't have time for this type of complexity in my life!  If I did, I'd call up my most devoted ex and spend an hour debating with a brick wall. But revenge is sweet.  On comes Music Choice!  For those cable-impaired, Music Choice is the 30-or-so channels of straight music, arranged in categorized channels.  I think the Party Favorites channel will do nicely, heh heh heh.  Ah, lovely, BlackBox!!!  Volume up, babies!  Ah... it don't get any better than this.  Cue more evil laughter  self-satisfied smirk.
