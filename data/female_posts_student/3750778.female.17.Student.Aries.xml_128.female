As you can tell, I received an invite to the blog. *searches for something to say...* Well, I don't think my scheldule would interest any of you since none of the other contributors are in my grade. It has to be changed anyway. They put me in percussion band. *sighs* I just hope they can get it right in less than 2 new scheldules (unlike last year.)  -insert dull silence- ...  Wow, such an interesting post. Hopefully I'll have more to say later.
