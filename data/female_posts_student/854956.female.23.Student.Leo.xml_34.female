That which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet    Okay... so I realized after fixing my archives, and going back and checking that they pull up and everything that in my VERY first blog post... back in Sept. of 2002 I was attempting to pick a name for my frog tattoo.  As stated in the email... I've concluded that the frog is male... so, now I bring this to my friends and whoever else may stumble across this blog, to leave (via the comments) any suggestions for a name for my frog tattoo.  He MUST have a name!  :-)  I was thinking, since Ricky's name isn't Dax, and everyone thinks it's cool... maybe we should name the tattoo Dax.  Dax the frog.  It has a certain ring to it... ; )  LEAVE COMMENTS PLEASE...       urlLink  postCount('31Jan2003');
