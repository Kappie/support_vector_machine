First my Aunt dies and my parents wont let me go to the funeral and I found a way I could help my aunt and let her know how much I love her and I am going to miss her and my fucking parents wont let me do it! You know because I was "bitchy" on Sunday when I got home from Ashley's when I all I wanted was to hear the answering machine! I am so upset! Why can't I help! Do parents not understand the feeling of wanting to help people?! I hate them so much some times! I know I love them deep down but its so deep down I don't know if I can find love for them now! My mom leaves tomorrow till Sunday for the funeral I think its going to be a living hell while she is gone my dad and I really don't get a long and after this decision I really don't see us getting along any more!  Why is he being so gay! I had to miss my uncle Jackie funeral last year because of all and now I have to miss my Aunt's funeral because my family is fucking gay! I wanted to have fun on Friday night instead of dancing comming home and wishing I was dead! I would have been with the worlds greatest people ever and now I don't get to even walk one lap at all because my Dad is gay!!!! Later Gator
