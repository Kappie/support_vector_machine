I didnt do much today, had band  rehearsal this morning then took pictures and then showed the freshmen around the school... I was supposed to go to this movtivational leadership clinic with all the section leaders afterwards but my parents had some issues with it.. For one Mr.Monroe didnt seem too organized with this because he didnt send any information to us or to our parents explaing what we would be doing, pay $20 to go; then have to make arrangements to get yourself to highland park in friday afternoon traffic in a caravan of student drivers who dont really know where they're going.. so nevertheless my parents weren't to thrilled about this whole sitaution and so i didnt have to go. But im kinda glad that I didnt go cause I go some time to relax and go out and eat with angie, lol and stare at our cute waiter... but after that I didnt do anything but come home and wait around for everyone to get back.... and yeah ive been kinda doing that this whole time and will probably end up leaving then going to sleep. Then its play time at the anual band picnic... so that ought to be fun.. yeah right doubt that.. but neways im gunna go now.. talk to yas later
