Too bad that state was not won on my birthday this year, i've shed my tears (against my will) and i'll move on.  We got 4th place because we lost 3-2 in overtime.  It sucked.  I would just like to say that i am a dedicated coppell hockey fan because i went to the 8 in the frickin AM game to watch my boys' final game.  They played like shit, but i don't blame them for doing so.  I'll be ok though, i just want my boys to know that i love them and that they're awesome and we had a good season this year despite the loss of state.  So the agenda for today is: 1. buy brittnee's bday present 2. go to brittnee's birthday party in which supposedly something is going to happen to me because my birthday is first lol 3. tell my boys that they're still awesome even thought they lost.....i hope they don't get too drunk tonight.....  After the game, my mommy took me and Brittnee out to breakfast and she comforted us because we were all bummed that Coppell lost.  So it was cool.    Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
