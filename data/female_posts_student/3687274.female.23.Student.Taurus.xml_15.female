Why I'd ever doubt your need for me...  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am full of me  So if I decide to compromise And if you understand my point of view When I come round just be on my side And I'll do the same for you  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am full of me  I'm angry and depressed at times And you're crazy and always pressed for time But we're still here, after all those times And we'll be here, And we'll be here  Cause we are, what we are And we are, who we love And I'm not full of changing But I am so full of me  Hope you like it!!
