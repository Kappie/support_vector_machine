You don't think on the same level as me. Only poets, scientists, and... writers of all kinds... think on the same level as me. Sarah: So, I'm actually a writer. I write in a journal. All the time. (pause) Austin: That's not really a journal. Sarah: You're right. It's actually the list of people I'm going to kill.  "I'm so mean... why are you still friends with me? You need to work on not being friends with me." -Austin  (I don't remember what started this conversation) Sarah: Why are you so mean to me all the time? Austin: I'm not mean, you're mean. Sarah: I'm not mean to you. Austin: You're the one who called me an immature little elementary kid. Sarah: Well you were acting like one! Austin: So am I immature, or are you just really mean? Sarah: It's both. It comes and goes.  Austin: No, I think my immaturity comes and goes, and your meanness is just there all the time.  Austin: This is stupid. So the spicy wrap is just a regular wrap with spicy sauce.  Sarah: Well if you're used to eating Chipotle and Qdoba all the time then yeah it's not going to be spicy. Austin: This is the Americanized version of it. Sarah: I don't think that will keep you from eating it. Austin: Are you kidding, I'm a Mueller, I eat everything.  That just made me think of this other one from the spring retreat: "Don't make fun of me and say I made this huge mess just because I have the Mueller gene that means I do not have the ability to be clean when I eat." -Austin
