Well, it seems a common theme for procrastinating thesis writers. I have a great quote from one of those 'how to write a thesis' books:  "The most important feature of a sucessful thesis is that it should be finished." (Wilson, 1980:238)  Despite that being written in the year I was born, it's still true now! I must finish my thesis so I can go back and present it to the community, and also so I can go and visit Inner Mongolia on my way home. Surely that's inspiration enough?   I also have another stupid quote, the guy should be shot, or otherwise he's a 'real scholar' and I'm not:  "A scholar knows no boredom" Jean-Paul Richter 1763-1825  My thesis is fascinating, really. You'd love to read it. But  writing  it is total boredom. I've done the interesting stuff in the field, but now I have to put all that on paper, and try and sound clever in the process.
