A broken heart, divide in two Half of it i'll share with you Then you can experience what i went through The judgement and betrayal, just to get to you Splitting headaches, screams of pain As you hurt me, and drove me insane Now i have no heart to share with you It was destroyed in the ashes as i burnt you.  hmm. a reminder of my past, most likely my future.
