Helped out in church in the afternoon n went ouf wif evan, gary n wm. haha.. really enjoyed myself n think tt all my frenz r so nice. haha... we walked from suntec city to bugis junction, then to bugis street to nibble on some pancakes n finally went to ps to have a drink (wm, thanks for the drink as well as the brownie). haha... u may think tt it's crazy as we did almost nothing except hanging out, but i feel tt today was fun. (oh yah, sad for dayima as the forms for singapore idol were all gone. dun be sad, u can it register online.. hehe)^_^ everyone was happy (even though evan was complaining abt how wm cheated her feeling), which made my mood both as gd as theirs. haha... i hope kq is not angry wif me for lending my hp to wm to sms(irriate)him. I think he's so innocent and yet he was been dragged into the picture for no reasons. haha... Johnathon n his gang r having a great time in cine (i noe, dun need to tell me lah) haha... so i believe tt they also had a great time. *yawn* tired...   My frenz r all so great. haha.. without them, i really will rot without even me myself noeing it. haha. Kudos to evan for accompanying me out. Without her, i would be as bright as usual when i hang out wif dayima n wm. haha... without dayima, i will be very bored as he would not flood me with lame jokes... without wm, my life would not be so exciting. haha... thanks guys. n not forgetting johnathon, keith n jasmine who bugged me contiunously over the phone. lol. jking.   tml is a new day for me, like wat ms said, we should start working hard for our prelims so tt we wouldn't regret too much. haha... thanks to ms for triggling my thoughts. thanks cg for sending me wonderful msgs to cheer up my day. thanks to mad for asking me out to shop n distress. thanks to dori who always makes me laugh. thanks to qt who continuously encourage us. thanks to mavis who is always there for me to bully. thanks to all my frenz out there who always make my day so wonderful n meaningful. haha... really luv u guys... haha.. (sori i crap again. but can't stop thanking u guys as u gave me the strength to be strong. :D)  haha... okok.. enough crap i think. now going to help someone to do his blog liao. lol. take care everyone n nitez. ^_^ hehe...   ~Wind is to fire as distance is to luv; it extinguishes the small n enflames the great...~    ::oh yah, the leaf story, i think i would start writing once i get some fantastic ideas.. hehe..::
