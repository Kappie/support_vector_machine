I spent a good chuck of my time fighting two corporations Bechtel and Shell from building a liquefied natural gas (LNG)  plant in our city of Vallejo. Shell pulled out from doing the LNG project, but now Bechtel, the construction corporation, wants to continue with the project, and it's up to Vallejo's government to make the final decision if they want to continue this project. Tonight we are doing a poetry marathon to protest the gas plant and raise money to print more copies of the chapbook, "Environmental Terrorists" http://www.cinader.com/Books/environmentalterrorists, a collection of protest poetry against Bechtel/Shell. > > On the lighter note, I will have my first book signing party Feb. 27. for more info go to http://www.cinasphere.com > > Gossip, gossip. I'm dating a man about 20 years my senior. This is so unlike me, considering I'm known as a craddle robber. He joked that may be I've become a "grave robber."  > > This is glee signing out...
