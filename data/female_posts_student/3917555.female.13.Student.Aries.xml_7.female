Look @ Katie...she just woke up right now (1:30) and shes eating breakfast, when is she gonna eat lunch? Dinner time? haha that stuff just makes me laugh cause why can't you just wake up at a normal time? But anyway, I would like to thank Amber for helping me with the whole Britni thing-besides i started that from standing up for you!!!  I'm really bored right now and yay!
