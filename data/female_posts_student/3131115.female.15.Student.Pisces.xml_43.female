I really miss bill, and I just got off the phone with him about a half hour ago. I hate sleeping alone. :( I dont want to go to bed. A lot went on in my mind about Ashley today, but that's another story. *sigh*...Life was so simple when it revolved around Bill. Now I have so much more going on, and I dont like it. Not that I dont have fun with *other* people...it's just that, I seem to hurt people, and I hate that I do that. I really dont want to go to sleep, but right now, I have no choice.   ~I'm left here with nothing..nothing to live for..but you~
