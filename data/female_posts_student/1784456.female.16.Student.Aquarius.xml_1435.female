And for some reason I cried... anyway, enough of the boring insight on with the crazy ramblings! I was thinking about seeing Lemon Jelly... guys come to Bristol!!! I'm not sure though... hmm... Ahh I'm going to Russsiaaa! *did I mention it already? Oh well!* MUHAHAAA! For a week! Sheesh how are we gonna survive?! Just kidding... I'm taking a large supply of energy bars! *so if I go hyper Izzy, sorry!* Wow it's gonna be sooo much fun! I'm gonna get myself a russian dolly! Hehe, then when I get back I can play on my new dance mat! COOL! Ahaaaa life's too great... damn... must make it less great! *the higher you climb the harder you fall* Hey, don't ask who, it's hard enough to quote!
