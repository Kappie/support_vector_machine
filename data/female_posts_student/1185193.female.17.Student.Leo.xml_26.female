Write down what it says: "ahoy--Used to hail a ship or person or to attract attention" (The American Heritage Dictionary) I wonder why they call them Chips Ahoy?  2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?: A glass globe paperweight that says Santa Clara University on the bottom.  3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?: Frasier.  One of the most hilarious shows on television.  It was the one where Frasier gets set up on a blind date with his ex-wife.  Great fun!  4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is: 10:50pm  5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?: 10:47pm...damn, off by 3 minutes  6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?: Alias soundtrack.  It's the freaky music they play when "the tooth doctor" comes to torture Syd.  7: When did you last step outside? what were you doing?: Coming home from dance and Taco Bell.  I think I  eat out too much.  Is that bad?  8: before you came to this website, what did you look at?: A website with endless varieties of afros.  Yeah, that's a sure sign I should  go to bed.  9: what are you wearing?: What a provocative question. A grey softysofty sweatshirt and pink leopard print undies. I prefer to look at it as "high school meets the amazon."  10: Did you dream last night? Very bizarre.  My street outside my house was was a river and I was playing tag in it with youth group people.  It was weird because everyone was just running on top of the water.  11: When did you last laugh? When I went to that name generator website like 15 minutes ago.  12: what is on the walls of the room you are in?: Old pictures of when Bobby and I  were young.  Also my mom, and my dad and his brothers.  Man, I wish I still had blonde hair and wore a size 0.  13: Seen anything weird lately?: Naked women at the gym.  But nothing out of the ordinary, right?  15: What is the last film you saw?: This question makes me sound like a loser.  I don't remember.  But I do wanna see 13 Going on 30.  16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?: i would buy an apartment in nyc, lower east side or if i wanted to stay in california (which probably i wouldn't) i'd get a mustang convertible and restore it. and then still buy the apartment in new york and thrust my muscle car down city streets. and i'd get an apartment in san francisco and london. real estate is a good idea. or i'd buy a concert hall and build an apartment above it with the whole floor super-duty soundproofed except for one room which has a huge skylight and glass floor right over the stage and i'll call it the 'soundlab' or something retarded. and get awesome bands to play. and inside will be a bar that has jagermeister on tap! did i ramble? ohhh yeah.  17: Tell me something about you that I don't know: I cry everytime I leave Disneyland.  I become like a little kid when I'm there.  Gosh, I wish I was there right now.  18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?: i would make people think. that isn't something that is done too much anymore. oh yeah, and i'd make the bestest person in the world fall in love with me. whoever he is. but that's just selfish.  19: Do you like to dance?: it's my passion  20: George Bush: is a moron. but i went to this online game yesterday, it was quite funny. you got this retarded saying and you had to guess who said it... george bush or ralph wiggum. it was quite entertaining, and it makes a good point.  21: Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?: i really like the name Leandra, Ella, Emma, but i just don't know.  Maybe I should base my decision on the name generator.  21: Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?: Evan?  Again, i must consult the ng
