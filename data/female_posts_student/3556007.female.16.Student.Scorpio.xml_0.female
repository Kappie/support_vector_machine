The One Boards are beginning to bore me more than ever, so I just went and posted a bit on the Cinescape Harry Potter boards. I like that place so much more! It was so much more entertaining... I can't get this one stupid thing to work on the internet! You have to pay for freaking everything cool. You can't do anything fun for free. Oh well... Tomorrow I am going to the barn! Yay! I will probably ride Waldo the psyco horse again, but it is kind of fun now that I know how to keep him from killing me! I don't know why I keep thinking about Matt. It is so stupid because he is a freaking senior now and I won't even see him anymore after he leaves for college (if he is even going to college... LOL). I am going to go now to work on the gay website that won't let me do cool things.
