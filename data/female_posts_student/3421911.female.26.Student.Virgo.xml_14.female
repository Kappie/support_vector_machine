Everyone, of course, talks about freedom, but no one has the courage to be really free because when you are really free you are alone. If you have the courage to be alone, then only can you be free."     i have always been alone.  i never have been scared of being an island; i have a world of my own.  but we all need backup sometimes. sometimes all the time.
