I just finished watching Backdraft...and now I can't stop crying...and this song again...God...Today has been full of tears...First singing in choir...I thought of Howard leaving...then when we sang at the end...the song got to me...when we all claped cuz we elected Jeff in...It made me remember that Howards last Sunday is next Sunday. Then I've just been teary since. All day....God. One week seems like 4 years away right now. From this low Im at. I just miss him sooo much. Sometimes I feel stupid for feeling this way...cuz it seems like no one else cares that I do...or they just don't get it. *sigh* I know your all gunna tell me what you always do..."its your own fault for falling in love with someone who lives 2 hours away" well im sorry...I love him and nothins changin that....*Sigh* Tuesday should be the best day of my life....Im almost certain I'll spend all day in tears...*sigh* Im going crazy aren't I? But I guess I wouldn't be writin this if I didn't care bout him or love him...so yeah...Im outta here before I drown in my own tears...later all.
