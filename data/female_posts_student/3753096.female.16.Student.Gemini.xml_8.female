The movie deals with feeling neglected, social status, and pressures without being corny. The parts I find touching (read: I smile/get tears in my eyes) make me love the story. I like that it brought emotion out of me. Ironic: the sticker says "Comedy." That appeals to my sense of humour. Funny: It's rated R. Those naive folk back in 1985, heh heh. Ironic: The story's set in 1984. (Orwell!)
