Brittany and I are gonna convince Max that Britt had an experience w/ Hal *Sarah's dog* but lead him on to think that Hal's an actual person. It'll be great...must remember lol. So yea, I like died earlier. I was so tired. I forgot to call Britt to tell her I couldn't go to Cole's party but I think she figured it out after a while lol. O well. One day, the two of us will party, get wasted, and spend the night @ the SSPP playground. *sighs* Not anytime soon though. I have a lot going for me in the acting/singing community...it's not worth it just yet. Maybe if I get pissed at my dad again, that'll be a different story. I swear, someday, I'm gonna just drink my problems away. Tasha, you can then kick my ass. :) I'm hungry...gonna eat more peanut butter sandwiches...I'm just obsessed...
