My mind is a blank.  It feels a little zen.  Like being a chalk board that's wiped clean with a moist towel.  Its taken me about 20 minutes to write these lines, like a stunted poem.  Thoughts moving sideways.  Flower behind my ear.  Blue on black computer before me.  Its all quiet, and tired, and ready to be spoken in whispered memories, half moments, half seconds dripping out on to my stomach and its all etching its way in to this time.  Time to stop weaving out of air impossible things and generous impossibilities, to get on my ride in the cool night air and slide through night like a woman with wings.
