Because it can have bad consequences and I beat myself up over shit in other peoples lives.  I think I'm a nice person, in fact, maybe I'm over nice. I can't hurt people purposely (unless your my sister or have annoyed me until my anger genes spark up) but I feel like I basically have hurt someone if I've failed to fix their problem or at least attempt to fix their problem, you know?  I feel guilty for things I have no part in. But those who had part in it don't care. Maybe I'm just trying to correct the mistakes of people who I don't know, too?  I'm trying to get everyone's links right now placed over there. If you email me I'm more likely to get you there than right now.  My mind is skippy.   I'll probably post later. I'm not even suppose to be on here...
