AUGUST?!?!  what kind of neurosurgeon's receptionist tells a newly-diagnosed MS patient she has to wait until august to see the doctor?!?!?!  jesus.    i called mary ellen at dr. grady's office and left her this big long message about how i'm sure she understands that this is a scary time and i have so many questions that need to be answered and if at all possible could she intervene and get me in to see dr. pruitt as soon as humanly possible.  i've been very nice up to this point.  i think it's time i start to get a little pushy to make sure i'm getting what i need.
