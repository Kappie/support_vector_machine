We just had so much fun looking through recital pictures, gossiping about the boys in our lives (or lack there of), and chatting about what the future holds for us at college and beyond.  We've shared so many memories from our years dancing together that are priceless.  It's hard to get used to the fact that this year's memories will be made without her.  It won't be the same.  I will truly miss her.  I send her my best wishes and prayers for her college career :)  OH--btw--I found out something HILARIOUS from her!  She was a dance teacher aide at Bellarmine for two weeks this summer, and guess who was taking dance from her!  Mark Rosetti!  I found that to be the funniest thing I've heard all day.  Mark, doing jazz and tap dance?  She said he was one of the more challenged students she had the pleasure of teaching.  That gave me a good laugh!  Rumor is he's not  that  bad in tap, but jazz in another story.  I still remember him  trying  to dance at the Bell mixer.  My friends and I laughed for hours after seeing him try!  It's a spectacle that everyone should witness sometime in their lives!
