Then jenny blows up the microwave and everybody's running around trying to clean up.. i remeber somthing about carlie and tinfoil..haha..anyhow, i'm thinking about geting a towel or somthing, but laura comes up to me, and says "BRIAN'S HERE!!!" and i look out the window, and sure enoguh, there he is. and she says "should i go out to talk to him?!?! hehe, i don't know" like all giddy and stuff, and i'm just thinking, "laura, it's your boyfriend, what are you gonna do, leave him out there?" (oh, it's not over yet). All of a sudden maggie runs out of the halway. turns out she went to change or somthing, and she's wearing these really slutty clothes. she's ripping though the place, grabs me by the arm and says "oh oh, and john (brian's friend) is here too!!! i'm going to go out and talk to him. when i'm done, come and get me" and i'm like "how the hell am i supposed to know when you're done talking?" but she's already out the door, TOTALLY hanging on john and bending over in front of him and stuff... and finally ryan calls me over to the other window , and val's stealing this golf cart (like the one's at school) well, ok, she isn't stealing it, just driving it around in circles, and we're laughing, but all of a sudden this cop sees her and starts running after her, and totally arrests her...so we just keep hanging out...   haha, so yeah, that's what sleeping in hotel rooms gets you... i figure y'all ahve to do homework and stuff tomorrow just like me, but if anyone wants to hang out for a short while or somthing, t'would be nice. call mi cell phone. i'll be down at orchard valley probably around 2 if anyone would like to join. until then, adeu.
