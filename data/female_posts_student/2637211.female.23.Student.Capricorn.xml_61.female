I was supposed to get the paper for Russian history done today, but so far, I've been reading the book it's about all day, because it's longer than I thought. I guess I'll stay up late tonight and get it done, I can turn out 6 pages, right? It's about the Turgenev's  Fathers and Sons  and using it at a primary source to examine the social upheaval of the 1860s as evidenced by the intergenerational conflict. I just need to figure out my structure and I'll be on my way. Then I have to write an editorial for 20th century European history about legacies of WWII, which should be easy, since it's only three pages. After that I'm writing a compare/contrast essay between US Foreign Policy in Latin America and Asia between 1898 and 1920. It all sounds very interesting, and I probably should have put more time into it, but I didn't. It's important to me to get it done on time, so I'll just work my butt off now. At least I didn't put it off to do on Monday. I'm hoping to only have one paper to write and some editing by then. I just need to work hard tonight to get  Fathers and Sons  done. It's only six pages, I can get through it.
