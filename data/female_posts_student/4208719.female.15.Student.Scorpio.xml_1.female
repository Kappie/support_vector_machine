But our director wanted some more people to play cymbals because K was the only one. with much coaxing from my friends, I volunteered. I knew it would make his gf pissed. It did.. hehe. (but what is so sad is that we now have me, K and 2 other juniors playing cymbal. Its usually a freshy job, being cymbal bitches. o well) Its actually a lot of fun, once your arms get used to the pain..  well thats all for now  hehe
