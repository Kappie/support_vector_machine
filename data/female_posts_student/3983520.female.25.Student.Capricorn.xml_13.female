There has still been tons of drama going on but all in all if I eleviate some people out of my life everything will be just fine. The hard part is just doing it and I don't want to make it seem like I am running from something by packing up and moving away but there are a few people that I just need to get out of my life. If any of you have any suggestions on moving on please post me a comment or two. I need all the advice on this situation as possible. Have a nice day and take care. Once again thanks for all the support       Had to make it orange instead of yellow because the yellow was not cutting it.
