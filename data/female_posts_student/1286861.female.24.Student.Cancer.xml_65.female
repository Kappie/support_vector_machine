Going from a workplace dominated by testosterone to my new work place where testosterone is non-existent.   I have never been a fan of women. My mother, yes, girlfriends...Sometimes. We simply do not get along at times. Please pray for me, make a wish, sacrifice a goat, whatever it is that you do to send me luck and the will to survive and enjoy my time here.  Let's face it.  I am never happy.  Otherwise, my new job is wonderful! I manage contracts for service and maintenance on office equipment (ie copiers and fax machines). There is no telemarketing, which I was worried about, and I simply help customers with existing accounts and contracts. At least I will...Eventually.  Like I said, I have my own cubicle, pictures on the desk and all. Question is...Do I have a picture of you?
