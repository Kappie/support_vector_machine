Was quite good, made me want to go back so I can look round my way.  5th wheel - in a non conventional way, which wasnt so good but proved some things to me.  Wednesday - School, SACRE - which was quite good, some good contacts from there  Thursday - Oxford.  Very good, I'm impressed.  I love the city and the university and Im definately going to apply!  I was on my own most of the day but it was still very good, I managed to saunter sufficiently, get lost and go to bed at  9 - just what I needed.  The other theology candidtaes are so well informed, well read and clever - *decides to read more* - where can I find the time?  Friday - Home.  Yay.  No plans!  I need a day off LOL.  Got caught in the terrential rain and my feet are wet but all else is shiney.  Madam Wolfie shall be adjoining me at the hip on Tuesday, which shall be good also, fun and she drinks the same drink as me from starbucks, which, considering the range is relatively spooky.  Anyway - bored now :P JD
