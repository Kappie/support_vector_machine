Like, when I'm holding a heavy crate of ketchup, but I can't put it away because a customer is blocking off the condiment stand, pondering for extended periods of time on the exact number of napkins and ketchup packets they need. Or the customers who spill soda all over the floor, and then make it worse by putting paper napkins all over, trying to "help", of course. And kids. Kids are the worst. You trip over them whichever way you turn, and their parents make no effort whatsoever to control them.   I especially dislike customers who come in groups. Sports teams, youth groups, sororities, birthday parties. Can't stand em'. They push the tables around and rearrange chairs so that you can hardly tell what order the furniture started out in. They leave gym socks and cupcake wrappers everywhere, and generate more noise and more mess than one hundred people would have license to. And they all get up at one time, making it impossible to catch up on cleanup for the next few hours. Big groups throw my whole routine off. If they had any consideration for my well-being, they would take turns coming in in units of 3-5 customers.  But the worst customer of all is, well, not a customer at all. It is the un-customer, the person who comes in from the deli next door or the barbecue restaraunt accross the street- after purchasing their meal there. It may sound unreal, but these people will actually march into the restaraunt, take-out in hand, sit down at one of my clean tables, and make as big a mess as any paying customer. Shameless.  Well, I suppose I will end my rant here. After all, it is the customer(but not the un-customer!) who keeps the money coming in for me. I just get a bit frustrated sometimes. but, if you are an obnoxious fast food customer, please do a few things for me: 1. Keep your kids under control 2. Try to clean up after yourself, BUT, 3. Do not try to clean up spills. Contact the dining room employee, as they have access to a mop. 4. Never make use of a restaraunt facility unless you are planning on purchasing food there. 5. Do not spend excessive amounts of time in front of the condiment stand. Get what you need, and leave. It's okay if you end up with a couple extra straws. 6. Never, EVER, leave sweaty gym socks on the restaraunt floor! Thanks!!!
