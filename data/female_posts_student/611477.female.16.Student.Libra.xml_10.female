This pattern also uses  urlLink steeks  - it's much better to overcome your aversion to cutting your knitting on an acrylic pet sweater that's taken two afternoons instead of trying steeks for the first time on your 2-month fair isle masterpiece!  Finished size - 18" around; 10" long.  If you'd like the pattern re-written for a different sized pet, leave a comment.    Yarn - any worsted weight acrylics that knit to about 5 sts and 6 rows per inch.   Cast on 90 sts in colour #1 In K2, P2 rib, work 12 rows  (approx. 2")  Change to colour #2; work 12 rows in stockinette stitch ( 24 rows from cast on; 4")   Change to colour #3; work 12 rows in stockinette stitch (36 rows from cast on; 6")  Change to colour #4; work 12 rows in stockinette stitch (48 rows from cast on; 8")  Change to colour #1 Work 2 rows in stockinette stitch Next row - ( K2 together (2x) , p2 ) 8 times, (p2 , K2 tog (2x) ) 7 times (so it's all rib-ey except for the four where it's not) (60 sts) Next 5 rows - follow rib pattern because I really don't want to figure how to type that again   Next row - change to k1, p1 rib (except for the 4 purls in the center, where instead you'll end up with two k's next to each other) Work three more rows, bind off  (If your cat would prefer a higher neck than what is shown, work another several rows in rib.  Simple enough.)  Sleeves: Cast on 24 sts in colour #1 K 6 rows in garter stitch, cast off Seam up side, clone sleeve. Or knit another, it's all good.    Now for the fun part!  Your main body piece is flat and as wide as the pet is round - as shown, 90 stitches.  On the stripe of the fourth colour, count in between 15 and 20 stitches and follow the  urlLink steeking  instructions.  Takes a bit of trust, but it's a gorgeous result.  Working the steek over either 3 or 5 stitches are both good, though I'd recommend doing it on just 3.    After you've crocheted your steek and cut the ladders, double-check that you didn't cut to far anywhere and the ends won't come unraveled.  Now grab your little sleeves and seam them to their respective pawholes.   Sew up the two sides of the body and weave in all the ends!  The best way to hunt down a cat and get them to wriggle in, well, that's your problem.  If you have any trouble with this pattern please comment - I'm more than willing to try to explain any confusing phrasing.
