Greg is leaving sometime next week to go to spring which isnt really far away but its farther then what im use to and i wont see him for probl. about a month hes going to finish school there! :( so sad!! sabrina broke up with her boyfriend and promises she's going to stay single for a while but i have a feeling thats a lie! my parents are being freakishly nice to me, there always yelling at me for somthing i dont remeber the last time a day went by that they dint but today it was just weird im still expecting one of them to just out of no were bring up the bcp's :(! kerri's actually's keeping a relationship longer than a month! britt. finally is going out with john and im pretty sure he loves her! jessica got back from a weekend/week of pleasure with and old friend of hers, peggys enjoying the freedom from her last boyfriend who was a complete ass to her i might add, and here i am still stayin single! : )
