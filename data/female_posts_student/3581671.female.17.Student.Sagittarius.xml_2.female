I don't know what to do, I ran x-c and track with him, and he was in my french class but I'm not sure how to mourn.  I didn't know him ultra well.  He was such a nice guy, very polite and kind.  I can't believe he's dead.  It's so permenant.  I wonder how all the other runners are handeling it.  I feel soo terrible for his family.  death is so permenant. good-bye. katie
