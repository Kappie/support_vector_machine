Commission staff investigating the Sept. 11 attacks announced Wednesday that they had found "no credible evidence" of cooperation between Hussein's regime and Al Qaeda in targeting America or its allies. A senior CIA analyst and a senior FBI official, both of whom appeared at the hearing, said they concurred with the finding.   Thomas H. Kean, the commission chairman, told reporters Thursday that the panel did not dispute that Hussein's government and Al Qaeda had been in contact. But Kean, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, said investigators determined "that there is no credible evidence that we can discover, after a long investigation, that Iraq and Saddam Hussein were in any way part of the attack on the United States."    In his comments Thursday, Bush said his administration "never said" that the Sept. 11 attacks "were orchestrated between Saddam and Al Qaeda." Bush had first denied that linkage last September, six months after the invasion. His comments then were in response to Cheney's assertion that U.S. success in Iraq would strike at "the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault for many years, but most especially on 9/11."    The administration's other prime rationale for war — that Hussein's regime had secretly produced and stockpiled hundreds of tons of chemical and biological weapons and was actively trying to build a nuclear bomb — has largely evaporated. U.S. weapons hunters who have scoured Iraq over the last 15 months have found no evidence to support those claims.       So... even though this bipartisan committee with CIA and FBI say there's no link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, Bush still says there is? What evidence does HE have? I don't understand how there is SUCH a disconnect within our government with a president basically saying "You're wrong." when presented with evidence from his own government's committee. Then why have the committee in the FIRST place if you were just going to reject all their findings? Gah!
