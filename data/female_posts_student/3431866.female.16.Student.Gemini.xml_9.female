Henman is in the fourth round-but its against Philippoussis,and hes pretty darn good. I love him. I'm very annoyed. I wrote an impossibly long entry yesterday, and then my computer gave up on me before I got a chance to publish...it was all very happy and I wanted people see that Hey! I can be happy...  Anyhow, yesterday was about getting my life and my summer organized. I'm part of this agency called Childrens express. It's Ok, and its very journalistic. I hadn't been down to Islington since February and so I wanted to make a good impression. Of course, my Dad is annoyingly blaze about my passions andwe were half an hour late and practically missed the whole thing. I didn't want to just be in and out so I searched for stories and stuff to do. Its strange because I've been there for three years and yet I've never done a proper story-just some roundtable discussions. So, I ended up talking with this guy called Samir about all sorts of politics. It was nice to hear someone so focussed and uncondescending, so young. Plans: HIV conference on Ria's birthday (20th July), and I'm working with Samir and Fikir on that one. Then maybe an article on cultural identity. Sorry, my brother's talking again..:why do I bother? He thinks hes soo impressive, and I feel when I hear him talk, that I've just heard all this crap, all before.  Tomorrow: hopefully, I'm really praying here, my last day in school before August-I have to find all sorts of teachers and I'm finally talking to my therapist about the last two weeks. I'm sure she'll have lots to say. Then i leave, and find a comfy job washing dishes, and do...stuff. I'm a feeling a lot stronger.
