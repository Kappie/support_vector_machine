The air marshalls would be disguised as normal passengers. The ones in Amnerica are on all flights in the US. If there were 6 terrosists as you say then ok so maybe it wouldn't work but at least those on the plane would have a better chance to live rather than dieing without a fight. Like those on teh plane that was headed for the whitehouse, it crashed before then because of the passengers taking over. They died yes, but they still gave themselves a small chance. I can see what you mean as well about them coming over from the Muslim countries but the amount of terrosists we have in our country right now is amazing. So many have been caught etc.. I don't know if it would work but I think its worth a try. Air marshalls to be on suspected flights or random flights. You never know, they may just be there to help one day.
