Our phone line is dead, no-one can call us, and when pick up the phone you just hear nothing, not even the dialing tone. And it would be on a day that I need to call loads of people to sort stuff out! Plus my phone battery just died. And I discovered I only had 3p credit so I had to go out and buy some more. The umbrella shading me from the scorching sun in the garden keeps falling over. And then to top it all, a bird flies over and craps on my history book. Oh the jiys of living in the Great British countryside.  Hope whoever went to the cinema had fun, that film sounded good at first but then the trailers looked a bit silly, and hope people who went to the fair didn't get too burnt, and didn't spend all their hard-earned money!!
