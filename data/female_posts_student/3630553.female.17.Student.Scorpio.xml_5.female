But I was touched so deeply, that it opened my eyes wide enough to witness the charm of the blinding flame. Weak-hearted, I saw the bright light... And in no time, it surrounded all of me. It was bliss! And it felt so wonderful – so good that I’ve forgotten every doubt and every pain of my lost spirit. It was beautiful. Every sight was pleasing. But the light didn’t last for long... The darkness of the sky broke into sunrays of dawn. The light that gave me happiness, taught me to fly and brought me to life, faded momentarily... My eyes froze in fear; my body trembled in cold. It was all darkness again. It was all sorrow. It was all pain... I fainted.
