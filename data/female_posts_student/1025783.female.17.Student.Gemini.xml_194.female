I always win in this world I cheat and steal and lie Your mothers shake their heads Your fathers frown and glare I leave each town in a whirl of perfume and torment I enter in a quiet foreboding shadow I'm not perfect which makes me excel I intrique you, admit Begrudgingly you watch my show each night Hide in the back row so you can't be seen Up front I can still see your wanton lust I laugh because I know you're weak Which makes me stronger
