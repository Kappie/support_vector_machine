Who knew?) and then not as amazed as I thought I would be by pretty much all of the solo singers... God DAMMIT i should have tried out. Siiiiighhhh. Next year. Next year. And I won't sing some crappy ass song like Britney Spears' "Not Yet a Woman". I'll sing Beatles, baby. That was depressing for me, because I was sitting there thinking THIS SUCKS and because I blew it. AH WELL NEXT YEAR We got our yearbooks today, hooraaay! My picture is very bad, but then again, isn't it always? Well, I slept over at Caitlin's the night before and didn't get all pretty for the picture... yeah... And there's this huge picture of me on the Orchestra/Band page which uh I guess is cool but um yeah. And I'm on the fashion page, whoopee. No sports for me this year. That's weird. I thought I would miss soccer more than I do. But i don't! And tomorrow's Friday and that means the next day's SATURDAY and then we have TWO more days of no school! Then it's only 15 1/2 more days!!!
