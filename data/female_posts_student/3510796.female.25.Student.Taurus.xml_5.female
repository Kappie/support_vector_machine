Hope he didn't drive down that 8 mile.  :-/   Class was exciting, like always. I can't wait for finite math!!  All those numbers and functions and stats.... oh boy!  I had chips and m's for dinner while thinking about my psychology prof.  hehe.  That's another story.  After class I went down to  'The Bar' , where I always go when I say I'm going out.  Drank some Miller Light and watched my two friends play a mean game of pool.  Won against two guys.  Don't you just love that?!?  I do!  They were good sports though.  My friend KR had played some music around 9:30pm and we were still waiting to hear  'Nicotine  Gravy'  at 11:00pm.  I ended up doing the Play Now and heard it right away.  Yey Me!  Such a good song.  You know what else is a good song... urlLink this is a GREAT SONG ! check out the entire site while you're at it.  I can't get enough.  Only 15 more days and I'll be dancing in the lawn.  Can you tell I'm excited?!?  I have an exam tonight in Psych. and then I don't know what I'm doing.  Maybe I'll go to Target and get some stuff n' things.  Shopping isn't that much fun, but it's got to be done.  I always want to buy music.  Something else worth checking out is  urlLink jambands   OK, I think I've posted enough for today.  Hurry Home Sod!  ...  Peace.Love.DMB.
