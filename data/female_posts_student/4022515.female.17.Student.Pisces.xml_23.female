I decided that from now on, I'm not going to mention kevin becuase he doesn't want anything to do with me, so I'll give him what he wants, if that makes him happy. I worked yesterday then went to a party, but it wasnt any fun. Today I went over to Charlie's house, which was fun I guess. I hadn't seen him in a while, so it was good. Hes so tall! I felt very small, which is a good feeling. I couldn't sleep again last night, but I really don't wanna take anything, I take enough pills as it is. I'm working 4-9 today. I got a paycheck yesterday, and theres almost nothing left of it. 95 went to my dad for car repairs and my huge cell phone bill. 25 went to gas, leaving me with like 30, which sucks balls. I talked to my friend jessie today, which was awsome cuz I havent talked to her all summer. Hopefully we'll hang out soon. I've got a lot of stuff comming up with week with club meetings, so I'll wait til after they happened to talk about them. I'm gonna go take a shower so I'll post more tomorow.
