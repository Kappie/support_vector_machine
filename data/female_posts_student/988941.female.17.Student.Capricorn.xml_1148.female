Although I was annoyed with with the cleaners because they didn't finish cleaning until the trailers had started!!! Gah. And they didn't even clean that well. The film is pretty funny. Its good. School on Monday. Gaaaaaaaah. Who else is willing to protest and not got in? Not me. :( I have too much work I need to give back because its clogging up my room. Aaaaah.  Matt - Jackie is right. If you don't blog at least once in a week I will kick you off. Lol. Harsh yes but keeps you blogging so: BLOG. :)
