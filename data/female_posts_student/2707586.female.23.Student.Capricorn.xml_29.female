Two hokies in the bunch besides me :)...I am like the bastard stepchild with Whitney and Leatta gone for the weekend. I don't have anyone to take me out :(. Anyway I think I may have found a roomie for next year. No one could ever be as great as Tiff but this girl is the girlfriend of one of my TA's and she is super cool and she needs a roomie and so do I, so I think it will work. I just have to say that Jake's ran out of Hotdogs and that put a big damper on the night but I did get some great peanuts and I threw the shells into a womanizer's drink. It was great fun. Well I really should hit the hay so until I regain consciousness this is Jody being drunk and fun and needing to sleep!
