Anyway, I just finished watching The Simpsons, a parody of life itself.  I absolutely love it.  Any show that can satirize history and make a history lover like myself laugh is definitely on my to watch list.  My top 10 list of shows is (in random order): -The Simpsons -Friends -The OC -Las Vegas -Eight Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter -The Monk -Law and Order -The Tonight Show -SNL -Seventh Heaven Well, that's it for now.  Later.    You are a child's kiss.  Completely sweet and innocent and pure. You mean no harm and only love in your sweet kisses.    urlLink   What kind of kiss are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
