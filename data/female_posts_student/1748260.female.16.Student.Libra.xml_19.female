Don't stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just gimme myself back and... Don't stay  I dont need you anymore, dont want to be ignored I dont need one more day, of you wasting me away I dont need you anymore, I dont want to be ignored I dont need one more day, of you wasting me away With no apologies  Don't stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities What you were changing me into Just gimme myself back and Don't stay Forget our memories Forget our possibilities Take all your faithlessness with you Just gimme myself back and Don't stay Don't stay Don't stay
