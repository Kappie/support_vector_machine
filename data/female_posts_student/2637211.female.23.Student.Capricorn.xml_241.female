But it seems to be the right thing to do, and Alex is going ahead with registering for expensive things that I hope no one really feels obligated to get her. It's a little bit offensive really. I think I'm going to tell her to get some more lower priced items for other friends, because she seems to have a lot of big ticket items. The way I see it, all she needs is a car seat and diapers. She can carry the kid in her arms, and let the kid sleep with them in bed, and feed him breast milk, which is free! And of course they're moving to Humbolt, and whether or not they have financial aid is beyond me. It's all a big cluster fuck. If you aren't aware of my intensely bizarre family drama, it's probably explained in the archives, or you can shoot me an email and I'll let you in on it. It's just to ridiculous and complex to discuss now. Bleh.
