I'm not going that far into details but he tried to set the bull dog on fire and instead got gas on a couple of the Pikes and some Fiji pledges. The school is trying to keep it under wraps I guess, and they're doing some stupid shit to the people that were involved. I hope the best for my brother, and even though he was never there for me when my whole thing in court went down, I'm going to be there for him.  Here's the petty shit... Don't get a twist in your panties...  I'm sick of being everyone's little thing. I don't know what to even call myself. You come, you go, you come, you go. JUST FUCKING GO ALREADY!!! STAY GONE! I'm a fucking puppet to everyone. Aren't I? Mr. Sex, Mr. La-De-Da-Fuck-You-When-I-Please, and Mr. You-Need-To-Talk. I have something for each of you...  Mr. Sex - You're an asshole, you need to leave me the hell alone. I'm not going to fuck you EVER. You have too many problems and I don't need to be one of those and I don't want to be included in anyone's sex-scapades or end up as just another tick on the bed post. So go try and give yourself a god-damn blow job already.  Mr. Fuck-You-When-I-Please - Though I was actually considered fucking around again, I'm almost too sick of you. I get this feeling inside me whenever you say something, or plan for something to occur. I feel this pit of dispair but I also feel this discust that just makes me want to fully vomit all over you. So bring it on... and I'll show you the bile left in my stomach. Oh yes, I forgot to tell you. I'm not small enough? Cute enough? Sexy enough? So I was almost willing to starve myself to be the perfect something that you'd enjoy, but I already blew that out of the water. What did you expect? Pah... fuck love...  Mr. You-Need-To-Talk - I don't. I can't. And whenever I remotely come to a point where I'm willing to say the tiniest fragment of a sentence it seems that I'm completely cut off or put on hold. I really don't need to waste my time getting my point across to anyone, seeing as no one's willing to listen. I don't need to talk, so I won't.  And I'm SO IN LOVE it just drives this nail straight into something that wasn't there to begin with. I'm saying good bye.
