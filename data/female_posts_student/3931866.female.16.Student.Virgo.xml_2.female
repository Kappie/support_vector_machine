(most of the time, he is right there) sunday i got out of going to meeting by everyone taking a trip over to my mom's parents house....wow.  that was interesting.  my aunts and uncles are more than a little rough aroung the edges.  there were 4 babies there...and liam was the only one born in wedlock.  oh, there was one Born in wedlock, just not concieved.  does that count?  i don't think so. anyways, then i fell asleep adn had a nice nap, then got up and left.   i had to work today...that was not fun.  it was slow, and they had too many waitresses on, and so i only got a little bit in tips, which stems from going for about 3 hours of not having any tables.  kind of disappointing, but i got tomorrow off, i get to work wednesday late enough i don't have to go to bible study,  adn i have thursday and friday and saturday off for the jazz band concert and then the relief sale.   THE RELIEF SALE!!!!! i almost forgot about it!!!  wow.  it's, like, this weekend.  sweet.  crap...i have no money.  oh, well, God will provide.  (for my trip to cedar point, yea right. i better git working)  and to work, i need to sleep, so i'm going to bed...it's after 11.   it's not the end  it's still not the end  it's almost the end  it's not yet the end  it's the end  bye  BethAnne
