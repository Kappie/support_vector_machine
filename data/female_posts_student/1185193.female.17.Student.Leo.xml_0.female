I opened up to her, confiding how difficult it has been for me to dance and attend dance classes, and how my dance teacher and I have been meeting outside of class to catch me up on the performance numbers.  There was a brief silence, and all of the sudden, she started telling me how frustrating it is when little kids at her studio stop attending classes because it adds the stress of rearranging choreography to accomodate their uncomittment.  What?!  Could she just listen to me and ask me questions regarding my situation?  Was she inferring that I was uncomitted, like one of the little children?  She just made me so angry, but before I could say anything, we peeled off into our classrooms.  It is incredible to me how hard it is for some people to just be good friends sometimes, especially when another friend opens up.  Maybe that silence indicated that she just didn't know how to respond.  But that's bull because we have been friends since first grade.  Nevertheless, whenever I try to find some solace inside of one of my friends regarding my illness, I'm always shut out.  It is almost as intense as opening up your heart to someone you love and deeply care about, and feeling almost a sense of betrayal and shame after it is not received.  But then again, maybe she just didn't know how to respond...but what are the rest of my friends' excuses?   Random Blurbs   Here are some random observations I made at school today:  1.  Adrienne always eats Cheese-Its for lunch.  She talks too much and always has the orange carbs infecting her braces,  And when she throws back her head to laugh, you can see it caked on the inside of her cheeks.  *shudder*  2.  No one in the library seriously works, except Jacob Inglander (sp?).  He wore a magenta polo shirt today.  Combined with his yellow back pack and hair that is fierce competition for Gianni Garbagnati, I'd say Jacob is definetely gay.  Maybe bi.  Clearly, I'm only speculating, but he just has that look.  (don't worry, I'm not homophobic, I'm simply making an observation).  3.  Conversation from the frosh table at lunch revealed the main difference in how to "be cool" at Bellarmine v. Mitty.  At Bell it is cool to participate and raise your hand in class; in other words, it's cool to be a teacher's pet.  At Mitty, no one likes the person who is involved in a teacher's lecture in class (*cough* Catherine Dietrich)--that would be lame.  If a teacher chooses to call on people for participation, everyone is chanting "Don't pick me" frantically under their breath.  (In no way does this challenge Mitty's unquestionable superior intelligence over Bell :)  4.  For the first time, I heard Dorothy Lau speak today.  If I closed my eyes, I would have never guessed that that was her voice.  As a somewhat cruel joke, she is known to many as "the antelope."  She walks with a hilarious natural bounce on the balls of her feet.  I'd like to see her try and balance a book on her head.  Her name is also derived from the fact that she runs through the grass and flower planters to get to class.  In conclusion, does anyone know if Shingles is contagious?  Mr. Fajardo has Shingles and I accidentally sat in the same chair in the library as he did.  Should I be worried?
