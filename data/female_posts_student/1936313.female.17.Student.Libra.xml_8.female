I haven't written poetry since.... well for at least a good 2-3 years now, but here it is... my jewel -rolls eyes- all this obscure talk about the River of Styx inspired me... and some great singing from High Holy Days...      River of Hate  Time here has no meaning it left on the wailing winds battered, beaten, and broken like my soul. I have travelled the worn path of misery, and pain is my well known companion. But nothing compares, to this new hell you've sent me to.  The comfort of my illusion has been stripped, stolen by your own hands. Your treachery, your betrayal, your irrepressible desire to rip me apart. This is all that I know, your lies that leave me wounded and dying.  So here I stand now, alone. Standing on the shores of the River Styx, no money for the ferryman. I'll just have to jump in. I'll drown in the River Styx, before I ever let you have my heart again.    Hooray? My poetry is always suckily dark and dreary... I should write a series about the five rivers through hell... Except that its hard to work the River of Phlegethon (River of Fire.. Styx is the River of Hate) into a poem... woohoo for challenges.... or...something
