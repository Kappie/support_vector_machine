In other news ... work at salve ends the 13th of august leaving me homeless in newport until the 7th of September. It would appear that I am moving home durning this time but will be commuting the 1.5 hours to work three shifts a week at shaws.... booo hisss.... on the upper swing to that story i will then have a chance to see and visit with people back home before the head off to law school or i am on my way back to salve.  I have the night off from work tonight which is always good ... I am out of work at 4 and then having the night to myself is always a good end to my midweek slump. I believe i am headed home with rick and mums tracker on friday to then switch off and bring rosie (ideally fixed and raring to going) back to NPT with me that night.  Awe-inspring Lyrics of the Day:  "I remember when I met you All the stars were hanging in mid-air In these moments - nothing mattered But the way you caught me in your stare We were walking - we were talking We were laughing about the state of our lives How our fates brought us together As the moon was rising in your eyes  On and on the night was falling Deep down inside us On and on a light was shining right through" ~Belinda Carlisle "La Luna"
