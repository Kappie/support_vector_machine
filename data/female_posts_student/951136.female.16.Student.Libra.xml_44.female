GOD DAMNIT! what the FUCK is their problem! i NEVER want to marry someone who i EVER fight with. EVER. b.c. then i know i'll turn into my parents. they disagree about EVERYTHING and argue about the MORE inconsequencial things! GAAA! i woke up this morning nad sat down w. them to breakfast, and all they did from 9- 10:30 was argue about our vacation to baton rouge. bloody fuck! whats even the point in going! i didnt say a word i jsut sat there and ate. adn then got up after not saying a single word. ad then not even saying goodmorning to me when i came in .nothing. adn so i walked out. and then my mom yelled to me to come back and talk with them. HA! i cannot WAIT til i get out of here. sigh  i saw a really cute movie last night. it was about thanksgiving and about 4 different families in a neighborhood. mmmmm. a real THRILLER!....no it was good. i just have nothing to talk about in here.... lets see...  my life: -i have c's and low B's in all my classes. -i hate being at home w. both my parents. 1 is fine, but they need to seperate themselves when they get each other into bad moods.- which is all the time. -i am single, but am at the moment happy about that, b.c. i've been thinking. ya, sure who doenst want to be wanted. but, i just want my life. i dont want to share it yet. i dont want to have to wait for someone, feel guilty if i dont call them, or go places all the time w. them. i'm a 'lone person'. thats not really what i mean. but i LIKE being alone alot of times. or just being w. someone i am not expected to do anything or say anything. have problems if they are not friends w. my freinds and vice versa. i dont want to be trapped, and ppl constantly making quips about us. i dont want to hide it from my parents, and it would just be uncomfortable, b.c. they still dont want me to grow up. -i love my freinds, but, i'm an irresponsible person, and i need to try harder to keep them up. - i hate guys. honestly. they SUCK ASS. not that i'm like aw i'm alone, why! guys are stupid whats their problem?. i'm more like, they are just annoying! all the 9 th and 10th graders are SO stupid! and disgusting and immature. not that i'm mature, but i have my limits. and the 11th graders think they are SO hot. and the 12th grade guys are nto bad, but what the fuck would they hang out w. sophmores when they are about to graduate and get ready for college girls....so ya know. i dont have alot of guy friends, b.c. they are STUPID ASSES. now, there are a few acceptions. michael, chris, and ken and rodrigo most of the time. ian isn't really friend, but he would be so much more fun if he just admitted he was gay! come on. lol.  - brother, he's not really in my life anymore. when i do see him, its more like hes some old friend that i never talk to or see anymore and we just happe to meet everyonce in a while....again. i cannot wait to get out of here, finished w. college, and live. i'll see my brother all the time if i can get out, and if he lived here. but on the other hand. i PRAY TO GOD!!!! I AM STILL NOT LIVING HERE!!!!.... - i would die to live in england. no joke. i can;t stand it here. america has no culture, or kinship. its crap.i want to live there So bad i can;t stand it! everythhing. the weather, people, accents, culture, cities. sigh... thinking about it makes me sad.... - i need to pull up ALL my grades BEFORE the semester ends, or i am screwed harder than a bolt. - i'm bored. nothing excites me, there nothing i get up in the morning and WANT TO DO... is all been done. all been said.  - i dont want to sound like a spoiled selfish whore, and i will never belive what alanah says. b.c. its not true. but i wish at least one would. b.c. then you think about it, and your walking through the halls or ppl at stores, you think, ya know, there isn't anyone who's obsessed w. me like i am w. all these ppl... thats not a good thing. tho it is fun : P
