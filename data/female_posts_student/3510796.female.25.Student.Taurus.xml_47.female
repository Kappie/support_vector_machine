I just need to sort out some bills and stuff with you."  Okay, I think, wondering what it could be about, considering that I had just paid the rent and my half of the utilities that morning.  So, having had dinner at my parents' house, I come home.  "Sit down," he practically commands.  I know this isn't good already.  He's assuming his teaching posture, trying to coerce me into being the subservient student.  He then explains to me, calmly and rationally: I have to leave.  Oh, I haven't done anything wrong; I've pretty much been an ideal roommate, he explains.  But he's realized that over the past 11 months, which according to him, have been "terrible" (which is funny, because his aggravation never manifested itself outwardly,) he's realized that he is incapable of living someplace with another person.  I have until September 18th to completely remove myself from the premises.  Of course, he tells me that he's only doing this because living with me any longer would drive him nuts and seriously damage our friendship.  And I think to myself,  Gee pal, haven't you just totally screwed our friendship by kicking my ass to the curb for no good reason?   Completely blindsided by this (I mean there were no signs of any problems,  none ,) I'm dumbstruck and have to leave the house to collect my thoughts, to try and make some bit of sense out of this and figure out what in the hell I'm going to do.  See, what my roommate has just told me, in essence, is that since he has a problem which is his fault and his alone, I have to find a new place to live, find new furnishings and other essentials and fill it, and find a new job to pay for it all.  Meanwhile, he'll just stay where he is and not alter a single aspect of his existence, thank you very much.  Driving aimlessly, not exactly sure where I am, I get a call from my friend Brittney.  She's just calling to tell me that she's moved, and now lives only a mile away from me.  Clip and save that, folks.  There's true irony for you right there.    So we meet up, talk about stuff and things, and then head over to this really nice hall in my neck of the woods to shoot pool.  That Brittney, she's something else.  18, working full-time in a porn store, going to school, and smoking like a fiend, to the point where she's bought a digital watch with a built-in lighter on the face.  She's so sweet and so much fun to be around, though.  After we finish shooting pool for the night, she insists on playing  Dance Dance Revolution .  Not necessarily the best of ideas for a girl with a pack-a-day habit and an out-of-shape 25-year-old.  It was goofy as hell and fun though, and we gave eachother a big hug and went on our respective ways, sweaty and winded.  Tuesday night... ah, the joy of half-price night at Comiskey Park.  And no, I don't care who's sponsoring the stadium these days; the home of the White Sox will always be Comiskey to me.  Head over to my friend Nick's for some pre-game libations, meet up with B and his girlfriend, and drive up to the park.  Do a little tailgating in the parking lot, and then into the park, our $6 seats giving up a fine view of things from the remodeled upper deck.  People can piss and moan about that park all they want; It's still a first-class facility and a great place to catch a game.  Having had a few before the game and intending on a few more after, it's easy to pass by the $5.50 beers the vendors are pushing.  The all-beef jumbo Kosher dog, though, that's coming my way.  And for that matter, so is the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers and hot giardeniera.  Mmmm, that's good eatin'.  The Sox blow away Cleveland early, it's 8-0 by the end of 3.  But in true Sox fashion, next thing I know, it's Cleveland with a 9-8 edge.  That pitching staff makes me start looking around for a cyanide capsule every time I watch a game.  They tie it up, and it heads to extra innings.  Jose Valentin, a player so emblematic of all things White Sox (he's either saving the day like an all-star, or striking out 4 times and making 2 errors in the field, with no middle ground,) belts one out in the bottom of the 10th.  Fireworks pop like mad, Sox win 11-9, now 1 game in back of Minnesota for the division lead.  Being half price night as it was, the upper deck was pretty much like the lawn at a concert.  Heavy drinking and smoking all around, and certainly not just cigarettes by any means.  At one point a cloud rose up from the other side of the upper deck that looked like something out of a Cheech and Chong movie.  Ah, you can't beat fun at the old ballpark.  In front of us, there was a wide assortment, with one particularly loud jackass continually looking over at the out-of-town scores.  Finally, he let go with a "WOOOOOOOOO!  CUBBIES!" that was cheerfully met by far too many people in our section.  For all the bad publicity Sox fans have received in recent years, it should be noted that every drunken jackass who's run out onto the field and tried to attack someone has been, in fact, a Cubs fan.  Anyway, after the game, it's back to Nick's and it's time to get hot - in the hot tub!  Damn, so relaxing. the jets working up and down my back in the warm water while we all sip our ice-cold bottles of Miller Lite.  Probably spent way too long in there as we were all pruned up pretty badly by the time we got out around 2, but who cares?  I tfelt fantastic, and it'll probably be the thing to do come July 6, the next half-price Tuesday.  On the "homework assignment" front from flirty girl, I wrote one and kept it short and to the point, as she requested.  650 words, and it got me some positive feedback.  Grey just rolled with it, ended up with 5 pages, and oh my God.  Made me realize that i have to, and this isn't intentionally a bad pun, "flesh out" my story.  Add all the little details that I'd want to experience in real life.  So, yeah, I'll be writing the "director's cut" between now and tomorrow.  As for the roommate situation, I've been talking to a lot of friends (and I really am lucky to have so many good friends,) and there seems to be a consensus:  He's got a problem living with people, I've done nothing wrong, then it's all on him to move out and find his own place.  Can't wait to break the news to him that it's his responsibility to move, and I have no intentions of going everywhere.  That oughta make the living situation interesting.  Until next time...
