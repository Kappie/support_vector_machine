Don't talk about her   Don't talk about me   Don't talk about us.   But Don't stop confiding.   Don't preach.   Don't preach about love   Don't preach about trust   Don't preach about honesty.   But Don't stop believing.   Don't tell me.   Don't tell me you loved me   Don't tell me you tried   Don't tell me you're sorry.   But Don't stop remembering.   Don't speak.   Don't speak of hope   Don't speak of opportunity   Don't speak of life.   But Don't stop dreaming.   Get out.   Get out of my head   Get out of my heart   Get out of my life.   But Don't stop calling.   Please don't stop calling.   You of all people know   I am nothing but   A walking contradiction.      ~fin~
