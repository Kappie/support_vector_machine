Law-abiding citizens and all that jazz.  But once upon a time, a teacher of ours gave us the chance to see things in a different light.   It was one of those general course classes where a student was given three weeks in a subject outside their area of study. One week it would be Home Economics, another week would be Religious studies. Sometimes the subject would be a complete bore. But sometimes, like this one class in particular, it would prove to have an effect on us years after we've flown the nest, so to speak.   During the first of the three classes, ridiculous assignments were set. Some laughed, others shook their heads. But we did it nonetheless. And then, right before the bell went, she asked us one important question - Why did we do it?   In the next class, she opened by talking to us about how we are socially conditioned to obey instructions without question. She brought up the  urlLink study  done by  Stanley Milgram.  They set out to prove that people would follow instructions from a 'figure of authority' even if it conflicted with their own moral values. The following is a brief description of the test (taken from the site linked above)        "There were two subjects in the experiment, an actual subject and an actor pretending to be another subject. The experimenter informed the subjects that they were going to be participants in a study to examine how effective punishment was for learning particular behaviors. The subject was assigned the role of "teacher." The actor was also assigned the role of "teacher" but claimed that his role was that of a "learner" so that the subject would believe that his role had been randomly assigned to him. Both the subject and the actor were given a sample 45-volt electric shock administered by an apparatus strapped to the actor's chair. The "teacher" was told to present simple memory tasks to the "leaner" and to administer an electric shock each time the learner made a mistake with the task.
