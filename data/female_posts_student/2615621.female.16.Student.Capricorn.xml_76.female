IT WAS SOOO MUCH FUN!!! i wish hollis and zack didnt have to take the SAT today so we could have spent more time out. Not getting home at like 10:30ish-11 at nite is like..idk a good feeling when u walk in the door and i mean, you could have stayed out longer..maybe its just that the option is there. haha i have no clue  Katie is telling me how much she misses andrew and i tell her to back off and stop the crying and to end the knitting of a red scarf for him...how sad. I tell her that she needs to think of his feelings and how he cares about her and i dont think he wants to constantly be reminded of how much he hurt her...cuz i mean, andrew just doesnt hurt people like that...but he had to end things. (sounds like a good commerical for a soap opra..or the back of a love novel...)  MEAN GIRLS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE!! haha it made me want to be mean lol but then again nice to people at the same time. actually, i loved the mean ideas it had in it...like the burn book *evil laugh* haha  *much love* ...and i just thought of how lauren is going away...and how much im going to miss her...and how her last month in mt airy i'll be having surgry...but i'll be sure to recover for her FAST! and how..now in whats left of our "group" katie and i will be the only girls...but then theres now hollis and others...i guess....but i dont want to constantly diss on katie but turn around and she be the only one i have...at least in mt airy.
