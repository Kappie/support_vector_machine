He went on this academic trip thing for some math competition and he made out with this smart chick in the back of the bus on the way home.Ugh...it was awful. I woke up crying and thrashing at my pillow...kinda funny,lol. Geez,my dreams sure have changed a lot lately. They used to be about my flute...or this guy I used to be absolutely in love with(Not Josh).But...he kind of screwed me into the ground. I'll spare you the details...but I'm his friend now even though sometimes I wish I could just start screaming at him(again...I already have many times).I thought we were like...soul mates or something. He made me feel so incredible.,but it was all fake I guess.He likes this other girl now. It's his ex-girlfriend. She's also a flute player,and she plays violin too. So,guess they're perfect for each other. They'll go off and get married and have kids and be happy....all because of what he did to me. Guess it didn't work out too bad for him....me on the other hand,I'll be alone for the rest of my life. That is,unless Josh communicates with me soon. I think he may be mad at me,but I'm not sure why. I hope not. He's my baby and I need him. If he's mad at me about something...well...I'll die. Anyway,I'll get off my soapbox here. I just thought I'd tell ya about my horrible dream. Peace!
