       
      Just got back from the pathetic attempt of a street fair hosted by our very own Village Council. The beer garden was bigger than the fair itself-- including the rides, which I may add were also equally as embarassing. Marie and I had to sell tickets, and we got out of it a good 45 minutes early, thank Goodness. No hot guys though.  I really need to meet a new guy. The question is where... but the good ones come along when you aren't really looking (actively, I hope). So does that mean I am screwed because I am now keeping my eyes open because I'm single again?
