I am sitting here in front of my computer with petroleum jelly all over my lips (its chapping like hell)on a fine friday night. i cannot sleep and its killing me.. and.. I have no one to talk to.  Now I realize that I am really alone. That there is a part of me thats envious of other people for having someone in their arms. I guess, no matter how cynical this world may be, the people living in it are still hopeless romantics.   At the end of the day, what everybody wants is someone who'll ask them how their day went, if they're feeling alright, if they need a hug..someone who'll kiss them good night, and somehow make everything fine again.   butterflies,butterflies,butterflies.
