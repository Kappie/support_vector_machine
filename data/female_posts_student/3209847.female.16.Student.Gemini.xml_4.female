This is Taylor speaking at the moment... Sarah went to bed about 20 minutes or so ago. I'm about to. I'm quite tired. Tomorrow.. Ring and Pin ceremony.. we miss 10 minutes of 2nd and most of the tutorial.. oh well! At least I get to Sarah all dressy! She looks so pretty everytime she dresses up!   Okay, sorry. Anyways, May 7 (AP Euro test) for sophomores.. that's in... 9 days! wow! good luck you guys! you'll do fine! =D! he overprepares you *yawn* You guys all will get a minimum of a 3. You're all amazing!! I could never do what you all have been able to accomplish, I'm proud.  Right now.. Listening to Tatu- All the things she said except in Russian (Doesn't sound as repetitive) hehe. My CD player is on random song out of like 20 cd's so.. it'll change soon. Well I guess that is all for now. Have a great night and a great April 28! I'll update tomorrow. I love you sarah  bye bye!
