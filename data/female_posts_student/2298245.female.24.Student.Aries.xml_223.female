Any show that can fit vampires and  The Mikado  into the same episode (albeit different story lines) has got to have something going for it.  This, of course, immediately made me want to watch  Topsy-Turvy  - which is one great movie, for those of you who haven't seen it.  Anyway, after a long period of wandering in the dark, I have seen the light and am back on the "CSI" bandwagon.
