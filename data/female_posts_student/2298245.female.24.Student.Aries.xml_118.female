Well, I was watching The Game Show Network the other day (yes, I know – I have no life), and one of those game shows that cropped up after Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and was popular for about 2 seconds was on, called The Weakest Link.  Anyway, for those who don’t remember the premise of the show, it’s like a game show that meets reality television.  They start with a certain number of contestants who perform together as a team, answering questions and banking money that will carry over to the next round.  At the end of each round, however, this harmony is disrupted by allowing the players to vote one of their teammates off of the show.  When I was watching it the other day, the guy voted off first was selected by nearly everyone, even though he was the strongest link, meaning he answered the most questions right and banked the most money.  When the host asked why various members chose to eliminate him, even though he had performed well, the answer given unanimously was that they hated lawyers.
