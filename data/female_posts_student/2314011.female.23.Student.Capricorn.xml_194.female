"Even if relationships, work responsibilities, or your finances are causing sleepless nights, try to put your mind at rest.  Once you stop expecting the worst, your life will (eventually) fall into perfect place.  You're holding an astrological winner's ticket promising success and fulfillment, but it will take time and patience before you collect on it.  Don't lose heart--instead lose some of the weight on your shoulders."  We love you, Vogue!
