Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense." â€” Ralph Waldo Emerson    I just returned from Austin. Start work tomorrow in Mom's office.  Feeling crummy for the past few days. Just stressed out about so many things and i fear that not even a Zoloft, Paxil or other antidepressant would lift my spirits right now. Just some time and carefully thought out plans.   Thank you Lisa for the wonderful comfortable abode this weekend and more importantly for being a great friend with excellent listening skills. Sometimes I feel like I would never stop talking to you if I didn't have to stop and breathe every once in awhile.   Anyway, not much news to share - just here, back in Houston for awhile. Will be around if anyone needs anything.   Love, Shell
