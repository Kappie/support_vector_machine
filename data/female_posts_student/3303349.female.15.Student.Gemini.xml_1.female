So my excitement was paeked though I think I have some off the sugar high. I'm still hungry though. Food...food is good but sugar...sugar is better. Uhhh...there should be more to say....Oh yeah1 Got my schedual today. It was freaky I have the exact same schedual as Sarah Estes except that I am in Honors english and she is just in regular english. I found lots of people in my classes which amused me.
