Then just now Jared tells me that I'm a good person, but I need to acknowledge my faults... ow... that one hurts. Apparently it's annoying when people compliment you and you don't believe them. I guess I'm going to just have to start taking compliments without contradicting them. I think that's one of the reasons Lucas dumped me - because I wouldn't believe him when he said certain things. Anyway, enough about that. Talley's finally back in town, and raving about a band called  urlLink The Elms . I've never listened to them so I don't know that they're any good, but Talley's in love. She's going to marry the chubby one, Thomas. He amuses me because he's chubby. I'm gong to be the maid of honor. Even though she hasn't asked me yet... The garage sale is supposed to happen this weekend. I really wish it wouldn't. It's Independence Day weekend and I don't think we'll draw much of a crowd, so it'll be a waste of our time. Oh, and I've decided that either Monday or Tuesday is to be dedicated to Ocarina of Time. So one of those days I'll be missing in action until midnight that night when I either succeed or fail. For Hyrule! By the way, death to Trevor for telling me happy Canada Day. Watch oot, eh?
