DUH!. we've tried two virus protections but didn't work. so today he brought it to his work to fix, and now when he came home, well it was fixed. and i'm so happy. i was most feeling guilty because i was the one who stayed with this computer for a long time than my brother does. i may have no idea what this virus is called but i'm sure i'll be a lot careful than how i use to be.
