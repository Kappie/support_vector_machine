My tuner went jacky for a song, the battery was dead and it umm.. tuned my whole guitar a step sharp. Kinda make for an interesting sound. Like, suck.   My cold didn't affect my vocals much at all, suprisingly enough. Same problem with the vocals, none through the moniter. The girl who organized it (Danielle) offered me voice lessons, but ONLY because I mentioned I wanted them badly, not because she was incinuating that I sucked... wait... oh crap.   Stay tuned for further annoucements.
