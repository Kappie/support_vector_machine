My manager and I were looking over the list of workers, and I pointed out one in particular.  I asked if I was supposed to work tomorrow 5-10, and she said no.  She then explained that there was another Nichole, Nichole O.  "So what's your last name initial?"  "O."  So yea, I'm Nichole R. (the R.'s for Renee...although it might have been fun to be...I got nothin, bein NO is fun).  I had my first day of work, hence the title.  I worked salad bar and hostessing, in addition to making a few things, like part of my dinner.  I'm definitely gonna use my first paycheck to buy myself a pair of insoles.  I think I'm gonna die on Sunday - 3 until 9.  Such estacy.  At least I'll get more for my paycheck.  Sadly, however, after taxes,  $30 for car insurance, $15 to pay back Amber and Ashley for all the times I've gotten rides, and $8.20 for those "gellin like a felon" insoles, I've got about $17.  That will be enough to buy me...absolutely nothing I wanted to buy, except maybe developing fees for the cameras.  So much for blowing my first paycheck. Hope yall got a chance to look at those prom pics...I'll prolly add a few to the second album, if I can convince Brian A. to donate or make a copy of that pic of the three holdin the Vegas sign.  It's Cory, Alex and Russell holding it up for some reason, and Cory/Russell are holding it up on the sides, where it's at its highest.  Alex is in the middle, where the sign comes down the LOWEST, and he's almost at a 90 degree angle.  I laughed till I almost cried...not very photogenic when unposed, that one.  Like I said before, more will come from Kings Dominion, plus a few from the pancake breakfast, maybe some from my bday (11 days yay), and definitely a few from jus goofin off w/ a camera.  I rele want my sister to get me this sunset photo album from Old Navy thats rele cute (preferably two), for all my other pictures. I'm incredibly drained, and I still need to squeeze in some studying time for my Chemistry and History SOLs.  Later.
