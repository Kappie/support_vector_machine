Hearing Matchbox 20 cover "Where the Streets Have No Name" live right after watching Mark and the hotties from Sugar Ray rock out as an "opening" act!  Damn, that show was awesome.  Follow that by our 4th of July BBQ/Farewell to Gainesville party. TONS of food, TONS of friends and a good time had by all!   Last week was the week of insanity at work but we finally figured out who my replacement at work will be unless she lies on the polygraph or fails the drug test, which she won't because she's Sharemah and she ROCKS!  Then this weekend it was off to Orlando for UNPACKING and the Summer Sanitarium Tour. You're reading the blog of someone who touched Fred Durst on Sunday. The concert was awesome, although I was a little skeptical after Mudvein...We got rained on 4 different times and we were soaked to the bone...and then it got cold, but the concert was worth it. I still can't hear a thing.  So add going to awesome concerts more often to the list of things I'm looking forward to about leaving Gainesville.  For now it's off to Bruce's house for chicken and rice. He's turning 27 tomorrow...my boyfriend's an old fart!  Dannie
