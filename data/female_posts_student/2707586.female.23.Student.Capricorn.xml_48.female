At one point people were looking down my shirt as I made my shots but I didn't care. Later that evening I took a drink out of a random guys hand and took a drink. I don't know what I was thinking but we sure had a good time. The best part is we are planning to do it again in two weeks!  I have to say that there is a new email up on the homestarrunner website and now I am happy!  I am truly proud of you Tiff for watching a girly movie. I don't know what Michelle had to do to get you to do it but Good Job Michelle!
