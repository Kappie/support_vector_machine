First comes the juniors who have been messing with the lab stuff, memporak perandakan susunan yg sedia ada,asking way too many questions, I mean come on havent you guys been to a lab before??? Arghhhh!!!!  Then the Friendster or penaja utama as we call it buat hal, I cant view my new testimonials! Whats up with that?? Are they not gonna allow us to post/receive any more testimonials? Or is it just utk org2 tertentu aje *coughs* yours truly and gang *coughs* To Friendster: you totally lost it this time man!
