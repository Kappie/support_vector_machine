In a country that lives for and by entertainment, these shows go to abysmal lows to provide just what the audience wants.   We all want to be a part of the live TV shenanigans, and if we can't make it there, we root for people we think are reflections of ourselves. We watch them battle it out, face the limelight and dazzle in their moments of glory, because somewhere deep down, we want to be them. American Idol is one of the shows that draws you in stealthily with the promise of the rags-to-riches story - average people just like you and me with their one chance to shine. The catch is, the show lets you and me get them there. And when they are there basking in the limelight, in a way aren't we all?  On Americal Idol, voters feel that they will resurrect a sinking contestant but don't realize that a lack of that very vote is causing another contestant to sink. The voter base consists largely of the teenybopper category, the show having become an obsession with young teens throughout America. It's not the judges, the channel or the producers who choose the winner. We choose the winner. Beside the demographic voters, there are some other kinds of voters. The irrational voter votes for someone he doesn't like in an attempt to get rid of someone he hates. The identity voter votes for a contestant on the basis of with whom he or she connects the most on the basis of religion, race or looks. The cheap-thrill voter votes for who he or she thinks is the sexiest on screen based primarily on who is showing the most skin. The rational voter probably accounts for the least number of votes in the contest because he or she votes for real talent.    The show pulls you along and gives you the power to make a winner. Unplugged from the show you have no razzle-dazzle, no villainous judge and no fearful contestants. The drama diminishes, the melodrama dies and you are left with voices that seem far less captivating. It takes the show to make a diva but not to make a star. It sometimes feels like we all live in the Truman Show, for our reactions are all a consequence of someone else's actions. Reality TV is like that; it's all an act in the joy of entertainment. As long as it does not become an obsession with reality TV buffs and young impressionable teenagers, it's all good.  Reality on television is not real. It is distorted, sprinkled with controversy and moves further away from the real world with each atrocious show. How many William Hungs would make it big in the real world? The boy with a bad voice was transformed into a star and has a huge fan following and his own CD. Many people who audition for Idol think they can sing. They are let down and told to leave in the harshest manner possible. It's not possible in real life, but fine on reality TV.  The shows are everywhere, from transforming "ugly ducklings," as the advertisement puts it, into beauty queens to making marriage into a big joke. People are curious; they love the media, the dirty gossip it brings and they love the fact that it intrudes people's privacy. Reality TV is voyeurism at its best. It creeps into people's lives, their struggles and joys, and brings it all neatly packaged into our living rooms. The sanctity of marriage, the values of privacy and various other moral issues seem to have disappeared somewhere along the way. Like all other things that are fleeting, the success of reality TV will soon fade away, but for now we are in a real world dominated by the surrealism of reality TV.
