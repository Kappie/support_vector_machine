Oh, and Josh, I really need to talk to you.  I don't know why, there's just been something saying "call Josh" for the past couple of days and I've been ignoring it, so don't be surprised if you hear from me.  I hate those stupid sneaking suspicions or feeling that just make chills crawl up your spine cause your supposed to do something and you have no idea why.  Now I'm rambling.
