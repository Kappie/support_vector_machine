Nor will they ever find you spreading gossip, retelling wild adventure stories or calling attention to yourself. Drama Queen? Not a chance! You're secure enough with yourself, but feel most comfortable blending in with the crowd. If things don't go your way, you shrug it off and hope for better luck next time. Unfortunately, while this attitude works most of the time with ease and grace, your easygoing style may occasionally backfire if you fail to stick up for yourself when the situation calls for it. A little drama never hurt anyone, especially if you end up getting what you want in the end.
