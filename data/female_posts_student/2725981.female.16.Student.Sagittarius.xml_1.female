Me and Kim get together on most occasions, but it seems that Becca and I are always going against eachother.  At our house there are very specific rules. Move your feet lose your seat (unless dad tells you to do something or you go to the bathroom). You can't watch TV or talk on the phone while being in the computer. You can't use someones stuff without asking. You can't take public property into your room. No one else goes into your room without your permission.  Everyone in our family is worried about Becca. She talks on the phone constantly, she's always annoyed at you or just pissed off, she doesn't tell anyone whats going on, shes moody, she's secretive, she lies, she steals. I've been worried about her for the last year and a half, when she's really started to change. I check up on her every once in a while, look in her drawers and under her bed. Not all of it's in vain either, I've found a cigarette and a bottle of my dad's beer. I was afraid to ask her, but somehow the cigarette came up and she said that my dad's girlfriend hid it in there to see what she would do. I'm not sure I believe that one.  Tonight, she got mad because I wore a shirt I found in her room. She claimed that she was folding a load of darks, and my shirt just happened to be in there...I saw the shirt folded on the chair downstairs. She also took another shirt, which I wasn't aware of until she brought it up in the fight, which I know wasn't clean because it's a new shirt and I've been afraid to wash it because it might shrink.  She brought up a good point though, she's not allowed to go in my room, so why do I get the special treatment. I dont trust her, and truely I'm worried about her. She just strikes me as the type of person who's too stubborn to knwo when they need help, and I dont want her to need help...I want to be there for her. And she doens't talk to me, so how am I supposed to know? And I'm her big sister, I want to be able to help her if she ever needs it...going at this rate though, she'd call someones parents before she'd call me.  I found a knife sharpener under her bed. She has a knife in her room for protection, I dont know, I guess it helps her sleep at night. What am I supposed to think?  About the fight, she said she wished that I die, and that she'd be the one to kill me. I didn't let her know it...but god that really hurt me. After all, she had my stuff in her room...and all I was doing was getting it. I didn't tell dad about the beer or the cig, and I've yet to ask my dad's girlfriend about it all...but I will. Just wait.  The thing I hate about our fights, is that they never really end. It's always someone storms off, or someone hits someone...they cry, and the otherone pretty much runs away before my dad finds out. I'm a person who needs closure. I need to feel like I've accomplished something. I want to know that the fight wasn't something stupid, that something was resolved at the cost of all those tears. But thats never the case. Nothing happens and that just makes me cry more.  I have to go.
