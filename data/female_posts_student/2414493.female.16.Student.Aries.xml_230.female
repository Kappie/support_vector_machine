But there's nothing that really attracts me right now in terms of something to do. So I'm online. And blogging away again.  Transatlanticism is playing. I love it, but it just sounds so tinny on the computer and I almost feel some sort of guilt or embarrassment playing it. It's just so much better playing when you're driving home and nobody else is in the car so you can meditate on it alone.  I need to shower tonight.   Well, today's been a full day at least. Don't misread this and think in any way that I'm not happy with the way things are. It's really nice to get some fresh air away from home, to just do whatever pleases you and let your own judgment keep you out of trouble. Got up for breakfast, but I was the only one clad in pajama pants...the blue squares one. I didn't think beforehand how long of a walk it would be, so I ended up walking down Harvard St. and Mass. Ave. in pajamas. Certainly nobody shared my choice of attire. The good people of the world were already up and fed and ambulatory in normal clothing. Visited the science center for the hub, came back. Went to the Coop, where we meditated over buying magnetic poetry pieces and laughed over books before we actually got what we were looking for. Visited the CVS in the Square. Came back for lunch, headed to class.  Class! Intro to Psychology. I really don't know what to think of it now. I'm sure I didn't leave Boylston feeling like wow, this was going to be the best class ever, but how accurate are first impressions? I need an introductory psych course, yes. The professor is an oldish man who's interesting enough, but funnily I prefer the lectures of Dean Soutter; she's just so much more refreshing. We went over the basics today. It doesn't seem like the class will be unimaginably difficult, but I just wonder if it's going to be as inspiring as I hope lit will be tomorrow. You know the feeling when it makes you smile and everything. Psych today was just an "eh" kind of thing.  But I'm going to sit in on social anthropology tomorrow at 1 and go to lit at 3:30, so I'll have a full day and decide if psych is really for me. The great thing is that it's the first day of social anthropology too, so it's not like I'm going to be missing out if I do decide to change my mind. Lit is pretty much a definite, but probably only because I'm such a book nut.  And now it's time to go wake Matt up.
