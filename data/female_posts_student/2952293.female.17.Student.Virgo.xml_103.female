Well, just the boy. He kept touching me, I mean I know he's three and he is just a kid, but keep your disgusting paws off of me! Then he started rubbing my thigh, I grabbed his hand and knocked it off of me. We were watching that fucker Dora, by the way I really think there is something wrong with her eyes, anyways he was lying on the couch and putting his dirty feet on me- IT WAS SO OBNOXIOUS. And the little girl was screaming and constantly eating cheerios, which everyone knows I hate because that's what I think kids smell like - crusty old cheerios. They're gross. But I got $50 for yesterday and today. That's not too bad. Doug is working in the house. I came home and the garage and gate were shut. So I assumed he did it, even though his car wasn't around. I walked into the house and he had left all the lights on and the radio on. Doug, turn that stuff off! The radio, by the way, was from MY bedroom! Doug there is one sitting in the kitchen! Oh well. I saw he left a big beer can sitting on the table, I'm surprised he didn't take it with him when he went to go get whatever he was going to get. I'm really mean. Don't know why. I leave you with this odd moment from Texas, I don't believe I shared. When we were driving in Tennessee I saw a man in the next truck drinking from a bottle in a brown bag. Yes, he was drinking and driving. We tried to get around and past him, you know, cause we didn't want to die. Anyways, we were listening to Taking Back Sunday and it was on the part when he goes, "You're a lush" and we were pulling right alongside the car and I look over at the man drinking, and then the CD skips and it's going, "You're a lush-lush-lush-lush" It was classic!
