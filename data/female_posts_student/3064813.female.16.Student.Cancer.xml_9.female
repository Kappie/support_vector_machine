I sometimes wonder if I am one of those happy people that everyone else hates, and that thought frightens me.  It is during these times that I wonder whether I should decide to be depressed so that I can be fashionable, but then I remember how stupid and completely worthless being depressed is, and decide against it. Yes. Well. Anyways: as to my joy!  I HAVE JUST REALIZED SOMETHING!  Not only is my screen name (rockthesocks74) a clever devotion to Green Day, it is also a SUBLIMINAL message to tell you all to go read Return to Sender over there in my links.  Oh, crap.  Well, I guess it's not too subliminal anymore, but I am to EXCITED about this to GIVE A FUCK!  Because... because... look: R..ock T...the S...socks  OR!!!!  R...eturn T...o S...ender  I AM THRILLED.  Aaaaand obviously off of my medication....
