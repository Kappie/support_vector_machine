I thought it was so cool the first time I went on an international flight and now I'm just like...meh...sleep time. Actually...it is sleep time. This may be the last time I write in here before I go... :( That's sad. I'm going to miss writing in here. I think I'm bring a notebook to actually write in. Like... a real diary. Amazing, huh? Anyway, I'm off to sleep...
