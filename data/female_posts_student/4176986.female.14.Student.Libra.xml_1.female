The best part thou was after practice... I watched the Varsity Football players leave.   Jake and Poppy both were shirtless *sigh*   . Poppy is just... gourgus. I mean look at him lol.  I can't wait till the football games. I hope i can make most of them. Football is just the  best sport to watch .  Field hockey games will be good too thou. I can't wait for the real seasions to start so we can get game playin. Well thats all for now   ~*Jess*~
