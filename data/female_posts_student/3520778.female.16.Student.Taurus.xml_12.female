I got a new study bible last christmas I think...or was it at my birthday? i can't remember...but it was everything that I wanted...except the weight (it feels like I'm workin out when ever i carry it!) But I haven't used my old one...in months.   I feel sad for it.   Like it's not being loved enough...   I have notes from sermons by P. John, Jeremy, Colby and Darrel...I think there's one by James...I have notes that I wrote on my favorite verses, encouraging notes from my friends that have things to do with verses...I have my bullitin from Kathy's funeral and Rob's leaving party...the slip we got when the Church decided James and Heather were coming...Letters to God, songs that corrispond with verses...   But in my new one...I have drawings and a couple sermon notes...   It doesn't seem the same! James said that if you want to see what someone is really like and what their thoughts really are- look in their bible. It's like a journal!   Maybe i should just use my study bible for studing...and take my bible everywhere else...   Jeez...took me long enough to figure  that  out.
