I was sad to see that they had already torn half of it down, the gymnasium, science hallways, the music rooms, and the industrial tech rooms.  Supposedly there is a Target store going in there in the future.  Unfortunetely our school board feels that money is more important than education, and they use their positions for their own personal gain.  I have lost faith in a lot of people and "politicians" in this city.  Thats sad because these are the people we are supposed to rely on for help, they are elected to represent what is best for the citizens.  I don't think they have yet.  But it is no wonder that the school system here is one of the worst in the state.  Just another reason I won't be coming back here after I'm done with college...
