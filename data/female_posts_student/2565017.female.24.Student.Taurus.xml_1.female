By Mars I mean a figure of speech, any place that we know exists but we don't know it very well.... in this case, I'm going to make Finland less of a Mars to you.  Let's clear up a few clichés to begin with.... 1) Finland is no situated in the Arctic or the Antarctic 2) Therefore, we do not live in small no-electricity huts with polar bears walking in our streets. 3) The official home of Father Christmas / Santa Claus is Finland. 4) Nokia is (or was, now the actual owners are mostly foreign) a Finnish company, not Japanese. 4) As I had to tell a pen pal in USA a few years back: Finland isn't a part of England, somewhere near Scotland.  But those were only the stuff that is common knowledge, except to the majority of USA citizens. No offence intended.  I'm going to by category, sort of, the first one was the clichés, apparently...   urlLink Cities   The most well known city to those who know little of Finland is our capital Helsinki. I have to be really lame now, and confess that I don’t know much about Helsinki and I’ve only visited there properly once. A few other cities (or towns they might be if you think world-scale) are more familiar to me.  Well, the town I’ve lived close by for the most of my life is Turku, which is situated in the south-eastern coast, east from Helsinki. Turku Archipelago is very famous and I’m fortunate to have lived right inside it, in a small village, on a small island right next to mainland. Turku is a very nice town with a river crossing through it. Lots of student life there, because of the University and the few collages and many high schools. As any city in Finland, it is at its prime at summer.   urlLink Pics of Turku    urlLink Pics of my childhood village . That's how the Turku Archipelago looks like.  Then there’s a lovely, a lot smaller town Kajaani, in the northern Finland. I studied business and administration there for 2 years before I decided to change my field of studying. It’s a very nice small town too, with a lot of park area, a river, a big lake and rural area and forests surrounding it.    urlLink Pics of Kajaani   And finally, my current place of residence, Savonlinna, which is situated a little bit to east from Mikkeli. (You’re able to spot Mikkeli in the map of Finland, which was linked earlier in this entry) Savonlinna, like most, if not all, towns in Finland is closely tied with nature. It’s situated in eastern Finland, by the biggest lake in the country. Very beautiful place, I’ve liked it here very much, although the night life isn’t so great, but what the heck, I’m getting so old already... hah =)   urlLink Pics of Savonlinna   Last but not least I have to mention Tampere, a town in middle Finland about 2 hours drive from Helsinki or Turku. I don’t know the town very well, but I’ve visited the fun fair there since a little kid, every summer. It’s a total MUST!!!  Here’s the urlLink  link .  Seasons:  As you might, or might not know, Finland changes throughout the year with the 4 seasons that we have. Summer, autumn, winter and spring.  Traditionally calculated, each season would last 3 months each but the way people see it here, winter and summer are about equally long, but spring seems to be very short, whereas the autumn is longer. Maybe the expectation of summer and increasing sunlight makes the spring feel shorter, and the memories of summer and the winter ahead make autumn seem long and dark.  Something like this: Summer: June-August Fall: September-December Winter: January-March Spring: April-May  The funny thing is, that most people (foreigners) think that December is the big winter month, but at least southern Finland often lacks snow, and the coldest and snowiest winter is usually at January and February.  Also the strangest things happen here when seasons change. Let’s start with midsummer. Midsummer (which is around from June 20 to June 30, it varies yearly: in 2004 it’s June 26th) is the time of year when the day is longest and the night is shortest. The expression goes 'night of no night' and it means that in northern Finland the sun doesn’t go down at all, and even in southern Finland it doesn’t get dark, only a little dusky. But from that day on the days start to shorten, and closer to winter they’re pretty short, not much daylight except late in the morning and early in the afternoon. A little before Christmas, usually at December 22nd, the length of day is controversy to midsummer. The day is at its shortest, and daylight lasts only for a few hours. And from that day onwards, the days start to get gradually longer, a few minutes per day.  The last (short) part of this entry is about the national treasures, so to say, which in Finland most people consider to be our vast, untouched forests and our numerous unpolluted and deep blue lakes, so nature, in general. At winter, if we’re lucky, we also get the phenomenon of aurora borealis in northern and sometimes even in southern Finland. (they do show in other countries too!)  I just read up on that right now, and it seems that one can check the weather in space online to predict when and where it’s going to take place. But the best place for viewing is definitely away from city lights, in the countryside, in as dark place as possible. Town lights, I’ve noticed, makes you have to guess if it’s it or if it’s not it, especially if the aurora borealis is weak or mostly white. But they’re truly breathtaking when you really see them!
