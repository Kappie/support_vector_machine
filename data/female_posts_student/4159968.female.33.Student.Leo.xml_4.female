Funny I thought those of us in this lifestyle would be more tolerant of others... you have your kink I have mine and if they are the same cool, if not cool.  Lol guess that is one reason I did not get along so well with many I have met since I am tolerant of others.   She is a very very sweet lady... who uses her subs like paper... literally... she has never shown any concern for them at all.   She will only play with those who show great tolerance for pain and humilitaion.  The others she allows to clean her house, do her shopping, run errands, etc... with never even a word of praise or thanks.  And she is the one with 20+ subs lined up at any one time... I used to wonder what I was doing wrong.  Was I too nice to be a domme.  Should I learn to humiliate and do the intense CBT.  Should I change who I was? I decided NO.  I am not that person.  In a scene I can do the humilation (some) and I do enjoy light CBT.  But I decided much the same thing in my vanilla relationships as I did in these...  I have always believed that everything we have endured in our life makes us the person we are today.  If we do not like that person then we can change ourselves.  If we do... why change.  Others will like us or not... but what is important is that we like us.      I have been asked why I did not have more subs.  #1 I cannot devote my time and energy to more than 1 at a time.  And to me it would be doing a disservice to the sub (who is a person) to do any less than devoting myself to the relationship.  #2 The subs in the area have not been interested in service really.  They are only intersted in what I can do for them.  And the ones I talked to were into the rougher stuff than I am.  And #3 They wanted to play the very first time we met.  I have to meet someone and get to know them before I can even consider to play with them. lol ok enough fractured stuff atm =p lol more later
