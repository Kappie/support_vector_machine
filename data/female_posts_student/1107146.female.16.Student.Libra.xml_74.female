Just because of the whole "sick thing?" Coach King would get you for saying it's like a prison though.  Right Z? ;)  Oh, and I hope none of you drank after me in the past 50 days or so, otherwise, you're gonna be out with me.  I'm watching "The Diary of Anne Frank" on A  Yes, that is just how bored I really am.
