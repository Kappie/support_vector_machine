A.M HOMEROOM- channel one ..i fell asleep 1-3: Health- we did a skit, they thought it was cute, i hated it. i was the "ticket lady" ..how lame 4-6: Science- Notes, wrote sonny a letter which was pointless cause its soaked w/tears now.  7-8: Religion- forgot my book so i just sat there and thought 9: ate an early lunch w/cassie.. we talked about her stalker boyfriend that shows up at her house at 8 at night and i told her id rather have a stalker boyfriend who shows up at my house at 8 at night then have no boyfriend at all.  10-12: Algebra- quiz, worksheet? ..i dun really remember 13-14: Lunch- i didnt eat cause i ate at 9 but i got an icecream and we all thot of things to name robs dog.. and then i went into this like.. "out of it" mood where ppl tried to talk to me and i just stared at them and didnt say anything. 15-16: English Lab- spelling bee i won 2nd place.. mis-spelled the word calendar.. i spelled it er instead of ar.  17: i was off but i just stayed in my eng. class w/some ppl and my teacher asked what i wanted to be when i got older.. i told her psychologist and she said that she thinks that id make a very good psychologist.. that made me a lil happy... then this girl told me i looked like a dancer.. that made me really happy for all of 5 minutes then i went back into my depressiveness.. 18-20:Spanish- worksheet   you know how if someone hits you really hard your reflex is to say 'ouch'. well every single time your name suddenly popped into my head my reflex was 3 words followed along behind it and if i keep saying these 3 words it will either send me even deeper into depression or do as you say and "move on." incase you're wondering what those 3 words were they are 'he's not mine.' and i dont think that they were of much help today bc everytime the reflex happend i wanted to crawl into a cold corner and cry for a lifetime. one of the things that scares me is that you'll talk to one of your certain friends and take his advice, which will make you change your views and then i would have truly lost all of you and by the looks of last night i think hes been lecturing you on what to do. No matter what direction life takes you and no matter whats thrown at you i'm still goin to be here for you. i miss you so incredibly much than i ever have and i think its because i know those words "HES NOT MINE" are true and i dont want to face that bc its way to soon. i love you so much. and that will   never    change.
