I tried to sleep in this morning cause i new that i need the rest but that didnt work out to well, i woke up at about 7:30 then fell back asleep for another hour then had to get up to go pee... then i was like screw it i cant get back to sleep so i sat up in bed and watched spongebob for about 30min.... and now its Ed Edd N'Eddy lol and after thats over who knows what i'll do. my parents are outside digging up sod for the paving stones we're putting down to make a walk way to the house since there's not any room to walk by all the cars... so yay.. most likely i'll force myself to go help eventhough i feel like shit right now... and then eventually make myself more sore for monday joy.. lol We've been babysitting my uncles lil chihuahua (hes soo cute) he a tea cup breed.. so tiny... hes like a mirror image of Bambi :) but we've kept him since last Friday and hes comming back sometime today to get him  :( newho im gunna watch my cartoons for awhile then maybe post some more stuff later on...  *in the words of Ed " CHICKEN"!!!!!!
