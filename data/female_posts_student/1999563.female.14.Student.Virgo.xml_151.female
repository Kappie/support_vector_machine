We headed to Beaverton...It didn't take to long to get there.  On my way I saw a krispy kream..yum!  So first we went to this used clothes store. They didn't have anything good. So we went to Nordstrom rack, which is an awesome store. I tried on a few pairs on jeans and 2 winter formal dresses. Everything was ugly. :) It didn't really fit right. SO I went and looked at shoes.  They had so many good Pumas! But I can't buy pumas...so I steered away from the athletic asile and went to look for some pointy flats. I found on good pair.But then, suddenly my eyes caught a pair laying on the ground. HOLY MACARONI I screamed in my head, are those what I think they are. I picked them up  and felt the smooth black leather and the silver silleotte heel. I looked at the tag. Holy cow. These are the ones. My objects of affection first seen in Lucky magazine. I have wanted them for years. They were Marc Jacobs 400 dolar leather pointy high heels.  They were more than 80 percent off, only 60 bucks. They were stunning.  I ran over to my mom, LOOK AT THESE!!!   (Now heres the sad part)  They were size 10. I should have gotten them. They kind of fit, kinda.  *sigh* Those shoes are just a figment of my imagination now. They were too good for me.  Then, we went to Ross just in case they had a good dress for winter formal.  And boy oh boy, they did! Hhaha. I found this GORGEOUSSSS blue dress and I looked at the price tag, 20 bucks! I squealed with delight!  Its song and it has a low back with these criss crosy things. Its kind of hard to explain, but its pretty!   Then we went to Target and I got some earings to match.  Thennn...my dad took my mom and I to KRISPY KREAM! Yum!  Its mighty tasty.  Then we went back to CYT and got there right hwen the performance ended. I  found some friends and we walked around aimlessly for a bit.  Thenn...my friend  named..oh gosh. I don't even remember his name. Haha. Well he was all like"Hey, can I ask for a favor?" To me and Liz and we were like okkayyy... and the favor was TEE PEEING/ a SARAN WRAPPING BEKAH'S (the director) CAR! Hahhahah  It was the most fun ever. It was me, Liz, Elvis, and  Elvis's best friend- Malakai (I think I spelled it wrong)  First we put toilet paper alllll over it then we covered the toilet paper with SARAN!  It was soo much being,,ya know..being in the dark..with elvis. JOKING!  His best friend is almost as cool as  himself. He was wearing  a air1 sweatshirt and looked like matt theison.  While we were saran wrapping the car Malakai and Elvis were runnign around the car with the rolls so it would be coever (does that make sense? :) ) And I was standing there trying to get it stuck to the attenae and they wrapped the tiolet paper around me so I was stuck to the car. Hahha. It was quite amusing.  Then we ran away because Bekah paid these little kids to spy on us so she could make her revenge and Cody could only case them around the trees for so long.  :D  Then we were all soaking wet and cold so we ran back inside right intime for the party to start. First they gave out awards. Blah blah blah. Then they did the secret pal thing. More blah. Then we ate PIZZA!  Yumm yumm.  Then they did these little skit thigns called strikes. They were quite amusin. By then it was 10 so we al headed home and squirmed into our little beddies *cough SCOOBY DOO SHEETS! cough cough***   THE END!
