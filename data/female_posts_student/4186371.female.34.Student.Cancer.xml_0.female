Turns out I should have since I had to sleep with a light on for a week after reading it.  It was about these 3 witches (sisters) that come back to this town, only they're all deformed looking bat creatures now who feed on anyone.  And they're trying to possess these 3 people so they can come back to life.  One's a college student who also happens to be the daughter of the Dean; one isn't born yet and still in the womb, and another one is a little girl who is already possessed by one of the sisters and has the strange power to transform into a wolf.  The one in the womb is possessed too and is growing at a rapid speed and in fact practically comes out talking in the second book.  The college girl though is the one the leader wants because apparently this girl possesses a powerful magic in her that she's not even aware of yet.  Anyway, these witches wreak havoc, killing people left and right.  It's pretty graphic, not as graphic as others I've read where I couldn't even finish a sentence (my sister loves those books), but I've got an active imagination and I can fill in the blanks.        It was supposed to have been made into a movie, but apparently, and I found this out online, there's a conflict between the writer and producers.  Bummer.  Although I'm sure if it were made into a movie, I'd never see it.  Well, not right away.  I'd wait till it came out on DVD so I could rent it and watch it in broad daylight with plenty of time to fill my mind with other things before I went to sleep.  I know, I'm a strange one.  I just can't watch scary movies.  I saw the preview to "Dawn of the Dead" once and had a nightmare about it a week later; so apparently it was still percolating in my brain for a week.        It used to be that my nightmares were about evil, unseen things, then they switched to raptors and those strange chicken like dinosaurs that bite you to numb you and then eat you alive, sometimes the T-Rex, but come on, the raptors are much scarier than T-Rex.  They're smarter and faster.  Luckily, I only have nightmares when I get too hot (and not in a good way -- lol).  My dad's the same way.  Now when I'm having a dream and I can feel the tension building, as if there's a music soundtrack in my head like in the movies when the blood-thirsty creature is about to appear, I just kick off the covers and wa-la, the dream changes.        And on a completely unrelated topic, I'm actually cooking tomorrow.  Trust me, this is not what I do.  I'm doing it to pay back a friend.  It's not that I can't cook, I just don't like to because it takes forever and there's all that measuring, stirring, etc.  The kitchen is not my favorite place.  However, I do make a couple of things that I've been told are delicious.  Enchiladas (a recipe me and my best friend came up with over 10 years ago) and Spaghetti  Meatballs (Disney cookbook style).  This cookbook belonged to my sister and I commandered it.  So that's what I'm making on Saturday.  Spaghetti  meatballs (from scratch), grilled corn-on-the-cob, and a dessert called Englishman's Trifle (no cooking involved, well, unless you count the... no, I was right there's no cooking... just thawing).  Hopefully, everything turns out and my guests like it.  I don't know what I'll do for my next trick though.  Heaven forbid I should have to make something new!!!  Horrors of horrors!!!
