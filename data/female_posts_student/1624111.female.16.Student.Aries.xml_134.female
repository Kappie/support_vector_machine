That was the coolest thing ever! Spoken word poetry preformances...poetry slam kinda stuff. all his own work. it was amazing. moving, i should say. he was kinda cute too. i mean, he was like mid-twenties to early thirties or something in age, so obviously not right for me or anything. He still had a certain charm though. And he had long dark eyelashes. haha, maybe i have a thing for poets with long dark eyelashes (fiennes as Shakespeare). mmm, poets. :-) its like "Oh my God,  you think!  you speak so eloquently! you care so passionately about things! you have a heart! i think i love you!" *swoon* mmm...i want a boyfriend...  odyssey today was alright.   dia numero dos:  1. Tales Told True (Jessica and Casey)- pretty boring. im not really one for story tellers...unless...well i just wasn interested in his stories. i dunno. they didnt thrill me.  2. Neo-Futurists (Brittany?)- This was pretty cool. a little weird, but cool. too political at times, but very humorous at others. i respect the players.  3. Rhythm and Rhyme (uh...well...catia?)- This was amazing. so cool. especially his emphasis on love and hearts and souls and...all that good stuff. the real stuff. ill bet he understands my concept of real. and i decided im gonna hang out in poetry slam coffee houses when im in college. and im gonna date a poet. and were gonna live happily ever after. and im gonna drive up and visit emily every month or so and we will be awesome friends for the rest of our lives.  4. Lunch (*deep breath* kara, heather, lauren, emily, emily, monica, kelly, jessica, sara, olga, and some people i dont know)- lunch was okay... it was better yesterday though. when i had better emily talk.  5. Blues Brothers (Caitlin and Jessica and Kara and Brittany and Emily and...well, Eric)- the thing was pretty boring. had an okay time i guess. wish i could have actually talked to emily though. did mess with her guidebook, however, good fun in that. but...eric...  eric...garg. i cant take it when its hes with her and were all in a group or something. i guess...i guess its just a jealousy thing...im jealous because hes the one she wants to talk to...more than she wants to talk to me. and its...accepted and expected that they sit next to each other hold hands and talk and giggle and stuff. theyre going out, right? yeah, they are. she has a right to like him, doesnt she? yes, she does. but...i hate... its like being teased. Its like shes right...there...infrontof me...but i...just...cantquitetouch...her...no matter...how...close...always...just. out.of.reach. Here she is, heres this person who means the world to me, and i spend so much time waiting to talk to her, waiting to have these chances...and for what? so i can watch him put his head on her shoulder and know its not a good time to...know shes not in my world right now. But its so hard not to want so badly...       I cant ignore it. its like...theres Emily! my friend i love more than anything. and everything inside of me jumps towards her, begging me to talk to her, laugh with her, learn all i can about her. watch her heart beat. understand what invisible forces keep her together, keep her looking up and moving foward. memorize what color thread binds her heart to her mind, her mind to her body, and her body to her soul. I want to trace the contours of that soul like lines on the inside of her palm as she laughs and tells me to stop tickling her. *breath* And all of that, all of that complex, raw emotion and raging passion roars and riots insatiable inside me. and its everything i can do to calm and quiet the calmity of cacophony with a subtle, soothing "shh, now is not the time, nor the place for such things."....and i sigh. pushing it all back and telling it to wait...just wait... eventually there will be a time. but push enough of that back and you get this horrible build up of pressure and thats what gets to me sometimes. but sunday released a lot of that, so im not in danger of exploding any time soon. polaski day weekend is near, anyway...   i figured out what i should have said today. caitlin with "but ive known her the longest" eric with "but im her boyfriend" kara with "but im the reason youre going out" and me with...nothing... nothing but the most candid, sincere, devoted thought--or feeling, rather-- of "but i love you!" and i kinda laughed and said "uh...ive got nothing" but i shouldve said...i really should have said "but i love her the most" and gotten into whatever arguments would follow (even if we were semi-joking in the first place), because im pretty goddamn sure i love her more deeply than any of them do, even eric. i mean, i guess its different because its a crush kind of thing, but if you could somehow measure my love against erics, i think id still win. and maybe thats ignorance speaking, but oh well. let see which of us goes most crazy if you take her away. ill bet you anything its me.   well anyway...  Thats what i dont like about this boyfriend business. That she has less time for me because of him and that i dont feel like i can talk to her when hes around. And thats a big reason i didnt go to homecoming or turnabout. do i want to deal with that crap all night? hell no.  but dont get me wrong. eric is a good kid. and if he makes emily happy, so be it. she deserves to be happy.   ...and wow. i spent too long writing this. and its probably a little more personal than id like...but...oh well, i guess. i felt like ranting, i suppose. and in a bombastic, emotional sort of way. been a while since i had a good rant. unless you count that thing from sunday. but happiness rants dont count as much. theyre not...emotional/moral unrest rants. which i specialize in.  or something.  i dunno. i need to do my homework.
