But really...someone should make an etiquette book on this stuff. He probably doenst know i know. Do i email him? do i call? do i send him a bear and balloons? (hope not)....do I get in touch with him to say hi? I feel sick....I care about him, but what do you do when you arent a main fixture in each other's life? Ignore the fact?  -j
