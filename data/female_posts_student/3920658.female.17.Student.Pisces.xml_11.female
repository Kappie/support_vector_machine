Since both My and Nicole is away, it's only me and Ellen left of  urlLink  Th e Klick    in town, but we're handling it really good. We've been out biking, nightbathing, baking and tomorrow we'll go shopping. Oh, I forgot, I'm broke. Shit. During the rest of the year I live and shop with the study grant, but during the summer there's no school and no cash. It's a hard knock life...  Today was a bit more PMS:ish and not exactly as pleasant as usual, but I lived through it and even managed to get some things sorted out for my driving practise application which I'm supposed to mail tomorrow. I'm longing for the time when I'll start practising driving with my mum, i'm sure I'll learn fast. I wonder how fast I can get a license, though? My biggest dream right now is being able to buy an old  urlLink  VW-van   and go touring around Europe the next summer with my friends... Sigh, I guess I'll have to keep dreaming for a while... But if you happen to have an old but working VW-bus for sale, let me know. Right?  ~:~  Kisses!
