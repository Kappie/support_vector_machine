This is my sewing class that I took every Wednesday morning in June. From left, Jerry, my instructor Colleen, and Ryan. We had such a blast! Who knew that cool guys were interested in sewing?! Thanks Ry and Jerry for making my first sewing class so much fun!!!! Here we are showing off the shirts we made!
