I only had five hours of sleep, but when my alarm went off I was completely ready to go, it didn’t hurt at all!  I grabbed my ‘Jars of Clay’ cd, and went out into the cool morning.  I felt Gods peace about me, like he was saying   “I care even about the small things you want to do, and I am hear to help you.  And I love you.”  I have not giving him even close to what he deserves lately.  I have worried about the stupidest things, people, my future, how I was going to get my math done this summer, my stupid looks…and I was stressed.  I forgot how much peace he gives me, how much I can count on him.  Why do I forget? I want so much to always love him, always thank and honor him.  I pray I always will.
