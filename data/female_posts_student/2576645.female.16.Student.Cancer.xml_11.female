I know you don't mean to sound that way, but it just does. I still think your blog is funny tho... there is no denying that.  I totally agree with Jenna's vote for me as best liar, although I am mildly mad she has given away my well-kept secret. But....since its out in the open, I might as well tell everyone the excellent recipe for 'lying-and-to-your-parents-and-getting-away-with-it' soup.   The ingredients you will need:  500 pds of Trust (from your parents) ~ If your parents believe you tell the truth all the time, and set a good example, they will not question you decide not to tell the truth~  1 1/2 cup of Good Behavior ~Parents will basically excuse anything if they know you are a 'good kid', but might have 'taken awrong turn'~  3 ounces of Flattery ~It is hard to be mad at someone that is telling you how 'you are the gratest mom in the whole world' and how smart, slim, and talented you are~  4 cups of Bartering ~If chores can get done, maybe they will excuse the thought of groundage from their brains~  Of course, the recipe varies for evryone, but this what works for me!  Chow!
