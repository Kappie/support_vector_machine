But anyhow, it is really hard for me to type right now because me cat is sitting on my hands. EW and her butt is in my face! She likes to help me type. Good kitty *stab*.   So today Micah and I went to church with Matt. They had this big Extravaganza with singing and a comedian and all kinds of kids games(I didn't get to play though). I just got done coloring Micah's hair... but it's ok I think it's pretty. It's really red.. I hope her momma doesn't freak out.  I guess that's all, I need to go do some work on getting this blog set up.. hmm dangit!
