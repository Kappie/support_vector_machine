I sat around all day in my room trying to write the rest of the story, but I had a major stomahc ache, so I climbed a tree in my yard and sat there for a while. Then we had to take my sisters to my "Grammy's" work, so she can take them home for the weekend as planned. Then when we were driving home I asked my dad if we were doing anything tonight. He just sat in silence and didn't answer me for 5 minutes. Then he called mom on his cell phone and made plans. (Yay!)  So now when my mom gets home in an hour, we're gonna go out to eat, then we're gonna go see "The Village" at the new cinima's in New Hartford. I can't wait. My AIM is now working and it didn't get cancelled after-all. I have no doubt its gonna do this again, but I think it's gonna be one of those on and off deals. I gotta go do laundry now.
