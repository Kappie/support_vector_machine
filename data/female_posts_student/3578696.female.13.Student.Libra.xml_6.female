Yeah...it's been so long(oh) I find myself still thinkin' about you. Do you ever think about me?(ever think about me) Check this out girl  All those nights that we kissed  Are the nights that I miss  Holding hands as your man for sure  We were young but secure  What we had was so pure  Innocence ever since we spoke   Why do we fall in love  When love will only tear us apart  Back then world was ours Everything was so right(yeah)  But we were kissing with our eyes closed so tight  So young and feeling so right  Never thought that we could do wrong  Oh we were kissing with our eyes closed so tight  So young and feeling so right  I can't believe that those days are gone(Yeah,I miss you baby)  So much pride as my girl  Thought I showed you the world  Memories,you and me,so real(so real) Gave my heart and my soul  Made you sunshine from cold  All those days,far away from here  I still think about you,hear me out...  We danced so close, we held on tight(yeah)  I never knew that love could feel so right  We danced so slow, we danced all night(aah) Assuming that tomorrow would be bright  We kissed goodnight, you walked on by  The vision of your shadow caught my eye  My life stood still, you went inside  I never got the chance to say my last goodbye (say goodbye)   I still can't believe it(no no) After all this time(all this time)  I'm still missing you Damn, some things will never change...
