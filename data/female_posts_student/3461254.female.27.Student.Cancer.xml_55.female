If I plateaued after only six or seven weeks, I will be supremely pissed!   I've gotta start eating more greens, less Goldfish crackers, and maybe running or at least walking once a day. I wonder how many Points the cheeseburger I have planned for dinner tonight will add up to? Maybe I'll have prunes as a side dish...that should balance everything out!!! :)
