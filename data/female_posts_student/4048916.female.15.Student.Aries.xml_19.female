We don't leave until next Tuesday, but one of our task is a day when we self-cater, so we needed to know our groups to organise what we're going to take.  I'm actually not surprised about my group at all. I was expecting to have Ms Roberts as my teacher, just because of the complications that's sure to cause ... The one thing I wasn't expecting though, was to not be in Ella, Lizz and Ad√®le's group. I was really looking forward to being in a group with them ... and as for a certain other request which I made to Mrs Barden, which she didn't honour - I guess some things you have to live with!  Anyway, this is my group: Steph Alice Ingrid Lizzie L Amy Anna F Elise P Penny Anna P Gen A Mel L (I think...)  Anyway, the self catering is organised in groups of four, so for that I'm with Ingrid, Lizzie and Alice. It's actually quite fun organising a menu plan. I'm in charge of breakfast (my least favourite meal of the day - yet they say it's the most important). So we're going to have pancakes!!!
