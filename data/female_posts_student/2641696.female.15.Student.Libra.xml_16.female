And my darling parents (hopefully) will be buying me FFX, because I can't afford it right now, since I blew it all on the platform. But I am pleased. I didn't realize it only carried two controllers lol, which sucks, but I have N64 and it's not too hard to switch between the two systems. Not only that, we'll be fixing up a room upstairs with a TV and speakers, so I might just move one upstairs and leave the other in the living room. Wee!   B is going to tell me how to beat it :D   Other news... my hair is evil. I look like a fuzzball right now. It usually works pretty well if I just let it dry, but I'm afraid I'll have to curl it or something (gasp!). Damn hair...   Also, my posters will all be plaqued by this weekend! For all of you who don't understand... I have a few beautiful posters from Stratford (seeing Romeo and Juliet, a few years back), a hugely massive LotR poster (not a movie advertisement, a real work of art), and a little thing I got for Christmas with an essay I wrote on it, and a picture of a pixie. Anyways, they're all gonna be plaqued - meaning, all pretty and glassed up and heavy.   And, that guy who came in and sang songs was soo cool! Hehehe. I wanna do  that  when I grow up, mommy!   Anyways... buh-bye.
