I have used my remaining energy to hyperventilate about Motion City Soundtrack's Justin Pierre emailing me.  I think I'm right at the point of beginning to break down the protein in my muscles to use as energy.  My madre is making me go to bed an hour early (I must sound like a moron, but... one must not fight the all-powerful will of the competely terrifying Mother Figure, because... scary) which sucks floppy donkey dick, to use Liz's term.  I probably need it, though.  I slept through all of school today... EVEN LATIN!  That never happens, but the lights were off and we were watching this boring Latin thing and my headphones were beckoning and REALLY there was no reason to stay awake....  Blearg indeed. By the way... Modest Mouse fucking rocks.
