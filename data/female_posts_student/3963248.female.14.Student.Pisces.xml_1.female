It's sorta my fault. *messed up everything* >_  Well, I guess I can chat up with people on Sunday.    About public school...parents say "Keep myself occupied. Fill up with so many classes and activities that I'll be too busy to get into trouble." It's for the best, but I want a study hall to knock off a bit of homework. I hate doing homework at home, despite how weird it sounds, I really do...a house of seven people and three frisky cats is NO PLACE to do homework. Really.    But I think I know my back-to-school style...    Assorted black baby tees (warm/hot weather)  Black-collared shirts (cool/cold weather)  Long skirts (whenever)  And if at all possible...normal blue jeans (whenever).    That's my idea for a wardrobe. Appropriate, able-to-learn-in, comfortable without looking like a homeless bum...yeah, it's all good.    Now...    A List of Good Friends  Ashley - tall, but really cool  Tricia - understands me well  Dean - understands me perfectly  Jon - cool guy, barely notices me, as in, I have to yell to get his attention  Dan - FREAKS ME OUT!!!  Katie - she's nice, but I barely know her...I wish I did    And I need to get to know everyone else better.    The thing I'm looking forward to at public school is my old friend Dorothy. She's nicer than ever, and she's still in touch with Natalie! *is bursting with overjoy*
