Apparently, according to the newspaper on Wednesday, office staff need to behave more like children in order to reduce the ever increasingly levels of stress. Andit reported that one of the best ways to do this was to play pranks on folks!! So there you go.  I'm still working at the GPpractice at the moment. This week I've been on reception so have been face-to-face with some very miserable, hostile, aggressive and demanding patients. But some of them are lovely and they make my day. Today I felt so sad for this one lady that I wanted to take her home with me. She arrived from the Congo/Zaire in April and is living in this hotel where they shove all the assylum seekers. She speaks hardly any english and is having to fend for herself. She is pregnant, courtsey of the rebel army soldiers, and most of her family are still in the Congo. She came in with someone today who is possibly her daughter, who herself is pregnant and she also has a 2yr old daughter as well. She only arrived 2 days ago. Can you imagine how daunting, scary it would be? I sat down with them to try and explain how things worked and to register them, which was interesting with my EXTREMLEY basic school french. But we made it. The other staff at the practice were like 'why are you bothering? Just give them forms and tell them to come back when they've done them.' But I just wanted to help them. When I spoke a little french they just smiled like anything and were so thankful. I just wanted to bring them home and look after them.   Bought a canvas today to do a painting for my new room. My housemates (NOT roomies!) and I did some 'modern art' paintings for our living room with left over wall paint and stuff. They are really cool and everyone who comes round thinks that we've bought them for some extravagent price!!  anyway thats enough for now. kxx
