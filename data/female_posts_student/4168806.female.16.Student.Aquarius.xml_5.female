I'm not angry or lonely or distressed or in-over-my-head...everyone seems to believe that though.  I'm just not complete.  And I will never be complete. Being satisfied, to me, is the equivilant of quitting.  And therefore I am never satisfied.   What's on my mind today? Well, I just got back from band camp.  It was, well, it existed.  Stressful.  Not as fun as any other band camp I have ever been to.  Unfortunately, being a drum major is a much harder job than I imagined.  But maybe I'm wrong...something tells me being me is just a harder job than I imagined.  I got in trouble several times for relaying information from the three drum majors to the director.  He just thinks that I have an attitude problem now, when in fact I'm just this messenger. I'm the only one with the guts to go up and do anything about anything at all.  Whatever.  It's not worth being frustrated.  On tuesday night I went to ani difranco's concert.  It was almost a disaster, and was very upsetting even then.  I arrived at the door only to find out that the ticket master wouldn't let me in because apparently the tickets that had been reserved for me "had already been given to me."  Which of course, they hadn't.  Then they told me to wait for the road manager to come out and talk to me about my tickets (lack thereof).  I waited for an hour and finally told them that I wanted to wait inside and that I needed to get my job done as a reporter and photojournalist.  They told me that there was nothing they could do and basically that I was being silly.  So I pulled out my pad of paper and my pen and asked for their names.  Them: What are you taking our names for hahaha? Me:  Well, I was assigned to write a story about a show tonight several months ago.  And If I'm not going to get in, I still will be turning in a story about a show, even if seeing you is all I get to do.  Them: Oh calm down, we'll get you in, don't worry....(they were a little nervous) They wouldn't give me a VIP ticket though!  Even though I was supposed to have one.  they said VIP was out (liars) and that they were only allowed to give me a general admission anyway.  Whatever.  I was p*ssed.  So I go in, now i can't go backstage.  :(  Not that it mattered in the end because the VIP members were only allowed backstage before the show and I guess Ani didn't come out of her trailer until after the opening act was more than half way done.  So....I get stopped by every guard in there because of my cameras (no cameras were allowed) and so i have to keep showing my photo pass and apparently I was the ONLY photographer from ANY paper there because like 4 of them said, "oh you're the one" But..the show was incredible.  she is so amazing to watch . itw as just .....wow.  it was insane.  i was awestruck....  sadly, she refused to sign autographs and see the fans after the show.  I waited until like midnight, but the guards kept saying that there was no way she was going to see anyone, not even VIP.  It was a big let down.  I wanted an autograph so badly.  But I got a poster and some righteousbabe stickers.  well i'm sort of tired of writing.
