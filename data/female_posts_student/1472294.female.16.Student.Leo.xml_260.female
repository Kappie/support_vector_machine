And this means I can put in pictures I like and of course linking back to the owners' web site. I have included Dodo's Watermelon  urlLink   and Tifa's Strawberry  urlLink  . They are cute and kawaii! Oh, and before this, I have visited quite a few CHOBITS website. Mostly Anime. And gosh, how vast the difference between anime and manga. Anime version of CHOBITS is more conservative and funnier with many twists. While manga is more depressed where the male character wonders alot about Chii and all that. Weird huh? I will try to put in a small screen cap when I have the time and free. Off for dinner! Ciao!
