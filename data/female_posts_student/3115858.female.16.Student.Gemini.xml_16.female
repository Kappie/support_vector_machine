GAWD!  at least the only other people (2 guys i know--one is out-of-town boy) who have this shirt knows what it really means.  KOMPEWTURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  yeah.  my birthday is on saturday.  only my best friend will be around.  nobody else.  not j-pop girl, not koreastar...nobody.  i'm gonna have a wonderful day, with nobody around.   yep .  i don't feel like calling out-of-town boy.  he's an ass.
