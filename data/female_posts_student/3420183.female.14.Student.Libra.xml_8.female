Then the alarm clock beside me, i also didn't hear any rings and my sister came over to my room and woke me up.. =x When i woke up, i feel want to vomit.. Don't know why.. Maybe i slept very late last night then will feel want to vomit?      When i'm about to leave the house, i quick went to school because i thought i'm late for school. And when i reach school, only little people in hall.. -.-ll      Today at school.. Nothing really la.. Don't like to sit at hall.. Very sucks! Wong Min helped me bought two packets of biscuits..! Then I broke the class rule. =x I was eating in class and i don't care.. I shared my biscuits with Syafawati (who always sit beside me in class) and when the lessons over and i took my biscuits to Amanda they all and guess what? Almost all the chinese girls keep coming to me for the biscuits..! Then Amanda, Wong Min, Stella and Lydia came over and sat with me.. Not anything of me lehz! BECAUSE OF THE BISCUITS LEHZ! ZzZz.. When the biscuits bo liao, they went back and sat their own seat.. ZzZz.. What the..! Haha~ Then didn't went with Amanda they all to canteen to makan.. Because i was too full.
