I've done interracial dating, plagiarism, weight,  STARS  (more on that later), and countless other topics. I'm stumped! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Random facts about moi:  -I've been wearing glasses since I was 7.  -I'm part of STARS, which is an abstinence-based mentoring organization. We work with kids ages 12 to 14, spending time with them and educating them on the benefits of abstinence from sex, drugs, and alcohol.  -I am, in fact, committed to abstinence. It's not because of religion or anything. It's just what I believe.  -I'm currently between religions.  -I've never been kissed, or asked out, or even gone to homecoming with a date.  -I'm a democrat.  -I met John Glenn last week.  -I wear a size 9 1/2 shoe.  -I'm a video game junkie.   Ta-da. Now for the food...  Brunch    Ramen noodles with snow peas and a peanut garlic sauce.
