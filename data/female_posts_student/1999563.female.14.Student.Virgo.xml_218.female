So then when I got home I was like "mom, can you help me study spanish?" and she just BLEW UP She was like "You haven't studied yet?!" and I was like "Well, I know the meats and I studied these in the car" btu I guess she didn't hear me and she yelled and yelled.  She wsa like Doug, what should she do with her? Do you think no computer till monday is fair?  a dn I was like "NOOOOO" but I didn't say that...but then my dad goes "sounds good to me." Then my mom was like we might as well study these!  So I was like okkaayy.  So we studied but she left the book open so I could see all the answers and it made me lok like i knew everything.  So I went to bed then my dad came and he was like "We decided, since youknew all the spanish words, you can use the computer."   But I really don't.   I told my mom yesterday that the meats wont be on the quiz.  But they are.  Now I am a liar and a cheater.
