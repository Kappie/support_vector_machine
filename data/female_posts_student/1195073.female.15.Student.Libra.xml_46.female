That picture is about two years old. I don't have bangs anymore. I would try to put a better picture on here, but I don't have any recent pictures because I don't have a scanner anymore. I'll get one of those Kodak picture disk thingies when I get my pictures from Europe developed. Then you'll see what I look like now.          Yeah, I'm getting ready to go, so talk later.........
