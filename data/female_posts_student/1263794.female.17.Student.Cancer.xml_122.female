I used to be so good when I was little, I'd save up tons of money at a time, my mom was often confused as to how I had so much. Yes I would never spend money in excess...such a good little Jew I was. Ever Since I've started to drive I've gotten really bad with it. I think most of my money goes to Cold Stone...man that's pathetic. But it's summer, I need cash and there are so many things I want. I need get some good CD's for one.  I have concluded that this summer I must:   -Not eat out as much. (unless someone else pays) This includes Cold Stone, which will be the toughy. I'm addicted to that place, but I must get off of it.   -Be more crafty. So many people are making their own things now. Scarfs, (scarves?) jewlery, clothes, I need to learn how to do stuff like that. Hand made things are always cooler anyways. I made a necklace this morning, it turned out pretty well... definitely a start.  -Keep my room clean. Alright I don't know how much money this will save me, but it is definitely something I must do. It's so much more comfortable when it's clean, but by the look of it you could never tell I can't stand messes. (I'm considering huring a maid with all the extra money I'll be making)  -Not get in trouble. Again, this might not save me money, (besides the fact that it will lower my chances of getting my allowance taken away) but I always end up spending a good portion of summer grounded or in some sort of trouble. This will not happen this summer. Must be good.  -Save my allowance. I get a good allowance, I must save. It's hard though, it's almost like I have an obligation to myself to spend all the money I have in my wallet. Must get out of that. Maybe I should hide it from myself.   -Get a job. I basically have one waiting for me, I just have to get up and go. I will not sit around and do nothing all summer. Must be productive.    Other things I must do this summer:  -get up to Busch Gardens at least twice. Now that I have the awesome season pass I must make sure to utilize it.  -attend tae kwon do AT LEAST twice a week. I tend to get lazy and just decide not to go...can't do that. -make sure to take advantage of my neighbors pools -get my after nine -start early on the summer reading -not get lazy and not go to Rex every Thursday -be sure not to wake up in the afternoon -get lots of new CD's with all my acquired money -go through all my clothes and give away the stuff I don't wear -go to Winston-Salem and hang out with Melissa at Governer's school-have lots and lots and LOTS of fun without doing anything I regret. (that should cover the rest)
