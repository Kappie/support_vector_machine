But it's all about Freud, so there's a small degree of woot to it. *dances joyously*  Gotta love people who think they know a lot about psychology. I mean, hello, not only have I read on it extensively, I've BEEN to them! AND talked a lot about the craft, not just me..... so hearing someone be like, "Oh, I LOVE Sigmund Freud!" is just aggravating. It's so pretentious. The mind isn't something that can just be laid out and studied. I mean, yes, there are people with "issues" but that isn't how it works. It's complicated and emotional and there is most definitely a reason why you need training for it. There are bookoo pppl out there who are going to major in psychology. But they don't want to practice. And half of them shouldn't practice! Just go do studies, please don't walk in with someone thinking you can break downt heir mind into defined problems.....  But anyways. Freud was weird but quite a smart man. And so we're detailing how a traumatic experience caused a boy to repress the memory of rejection and transfer his love for a girl to a DDR machine.  Obviously, it's got a lot to do with DDR and dancing. So we're talking about how people will dance out their emotions or something in a comical fashion. And I ended up dancing around my room for like an hour. I was so hyper and happy and WOW, I feel optimistic.  In other news, I'M NOT TELLING. *raspberry*
