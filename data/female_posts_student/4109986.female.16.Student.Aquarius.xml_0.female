Fair and that was all going to good untill about two hours into the dance...my cuzin from washougal was down and she decided to run off with one of my friends that she didn't hardley know which was fine until her grandma called me and told me she was coming to get her and then we all ran around until midnight trying to find her. I'm glad we finally found her. Then Sunday I had another family get-togther and my crazy cuzin which I hadn't seen in five years was up from Texas. Yeah so we ended up getting into a chockolate cake fight and whipped cream fight and let me tell ya it was a load of fun. When Monday finally rolled around my cuzin's Mandy  Carlie spent the night at my house which was a lot of fun until my cuzin Mandy decided she wanted to get all but-hurt because someone that she likes found out and I sware I didn't tell him but he found out and she thought that I told him so she got all pissed off. But we some how worked things out which was really good.    Anyways to Today Tuesday...when my mom left the house this morning I didn't know that when she would be getting back I would have a really big mess to clean up because she tore appart her bathroom looking to the hairspray which I might add was on the bathroom sink!!! Oh-well but anyway she started telling me these stories about when I was young about how I liked this boy a lot and he ended up moving to New York because his mom was model and his dad was a very high payed business man. Anyways Alisha (his mom) called me today and told me that he was in town on a business trip and he wants to meet up with me! well I'm off for now I got a long day a head of me tommorow!! Ta Ta for now~  *"Dont Know What To Say Or Do"*
