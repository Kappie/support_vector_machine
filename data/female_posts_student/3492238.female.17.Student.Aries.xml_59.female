I am a human doodle.   I can't date you, or have a hot plate in my office.   Always no bunny at all!   You're Blursela!   You know what? If we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.   Monica bang.   We were on a break!   We can eat the wax, it's organic. Ew. Not the used stuff. Because  that  would be gross? The line is a dot to you!   Oh, cool boat..aghh! Dude, rearrange your bubbles. Honey, cover it up with the boat! Strip Happy Days Game!   No, I'll do something nice. I'll refill her ice trays.    Oh! Do you see any vaseline? Lotion, I have lotion. Will that work? Sure throw some of that on there. Okay hold on...sounds like it's working.. Joey, the lotion and the powder have made a PASTE!  Really, what colour is it?  What difference does that make?  Well, if the paste matches the pants, then you could make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!  Chandler's not there huh..  How cute is the on-call doctor? So cute I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye...  That's not how your dad used to do it..  I mean, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.  RED ROSS!
