I know I am focusing too much only on his age.  He's a nice guy.  He's loaded.  He likes the fine life of good wine and good opera.  But the age would be a barrier regardless.  How do I get myself into these situations?  AC1 touched down in Tokyo overnight.  I hope that M. had a good trip and if she is reading this, welcome! :-)   How is Kinta?   Box said he likes the new view but he misses you.  OK, I guess I have to go.  I'm like Maggie Simpson today, hanging onto the doorframe and internally screaming "NOOOOOOO!"   More to come later, I promise...
