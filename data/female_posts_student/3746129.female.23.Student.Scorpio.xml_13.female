Or so that’s what your parents want you to think.  Yeah right!  Like the world needs another clone of your parents.  I believe that what the world really wants is you!  What I mean by that is we don’t need exact clones running around, talking, walking, and dressing alike.  Stepford is not yet a reality, so let’s not encourage it.  You need to be your own person and speak your own mind, not someone else’s.    People seem to think that being exactly like everyone else is going to get you somewhere.  Yeah, it might if we lived in Gattaca, but thank god that was just a movie.    My philosophy has always been ‘what doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger’ and it is one that I try to live by everyday, even if there have been times when even I have doubted it.    I don’t know what it is but there is a great sense of pride that comes from being your own person and standing up for what you believe in, even if it might land you in the big house for the night.  You can’t just pretend to be active in your beliefs, you need to really get out there and attempt to spread the word and even the gospel.  If with four simple letters WWJD (What Would Jesus Do) teens around the world can find a renewed sense of faith, doesn’t that mean that by speaking out about let’s say… vegetarianism, you night be able to change the world for one or two cows?  If you only touch one or two people you’ve still made a difference in someone’s life have you not?    Life may throw you a lot of curveballs but you have to be prepared and always take them with a grain of salt.  Sure, sometimes I just want to be like ‘Mike’, but doesn’t everyone?  That guy has it all.  You know who else I envy? Bo, cause Bo seems to know everything.  I have tried to live my life to the fullest by expanding my horizons in anyway possible.  I think that others should follow this model too.  In the end you’ll find things out about your self that you never knew, you never knew.  Hey you never know; you might even surprise yourself.    So why sit around waiting for your ship sail without you, when you could be the captain on a luxurious cruise to your destiny!?  Maybe along the way you’ll even concur a country or two, I know I certainly have.    So no matter what you are into and what you believe you need to be your own person and not someone else!  Follow your dreams because, dreams are what life is made of.    “All of your dreams can come true if you have the courage to pursue them.” – Walt Disney
