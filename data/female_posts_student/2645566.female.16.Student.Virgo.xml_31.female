But the fact is she is infuriating. Yesterday she was trying to be all buddy buddy (because of something that happened earlier in the day that I don't think she realizes I know ALL about). Today she is being completely stand-offish. Not only that but when I try to   talk   to her she closes up and the only thing she says is "mmhmm" and "oh". Great conversation eh? And the last weekened that I was here she was being super nice. "Mother-daugher this" and "Mother-daughter that". Why can't she be NORMAL sometimes?? And it really bites because I always hear "your mom is so cool" and "your mom kicks ass" and all that junk because she   isn't   a conventional mother. But every once and awhile it might be nice to know that she is a tad bit more mature than I am.
