I should put the one up of me in my Martha Stewart costume at Halloween. ;)  Today, I got yelled at (BEFORE I even got up), then got woken up again, yelled at, got ready, got called by Andrew and had an extremely short conversation, then went shopping until around 3:00. Oh, fun. I cashed my check ($125.84), bought 2 books ($1.98  14.97), bought a headband ($4.00) and a new bag (mom insisted that I had one that could go over my shoulder- $10.00). Now I have somewhere around $90 left to take to South Carolina to buy useless crap with.   Ya know, 2 weeks ago if someone would've told me that I would have $125, I would have laughed at them. Then I would've freaked because of how much money that is.  ..I'm discovering that it really ISN'T that much, and this discovery depresses me greatly.  We're leaving at around 5:00 on Tuesday morning to go to South Carolina, then getting back in..around..a week..? South Carolina doesn't seem that exciting, but I get to see my brother, and our hotel doesn't have a time limit on the pool, so it's all good. Hopefully they'll have cool crap to buy at the Army Base (for those of you that don't know, my brother enlisted in the Army, and is graduating on July 15. That's why we're going down there).  Then the week after that, Andrew has county fair. 2 more weeks of no Andrew. Stupid summertime.   So my computer is really retarded..
