However, this is a fairly new genre of writing (the blog) so its always possible that there just inst that much out there.  I found two distinct discussions of blogs out there right now.  One is taking place in the journalism community around the influence of blogs on mainstream media.  In one  urlLink 2002 Wired article , Noah Shachtman wrote about the way blogs were able to influence the media during both the Trent Lott scandal.  In this case well known bloggs the  urlLink Instapundit   written by Glenn Reynolds and  urlLink Talking Point Memo  by Josh Marshall carried the story about Lott’s now infamous racist remarks.  The mainstream blithely ignored the utterances of Lott until these blogs got the attention of the online community, and the outpouring of requests for more information from the main stream eventually pushed the news into action.  This kind of phenomenon has of course gotten the attention of the news producing community.  Being able to have such a direct and widely circulated link to the news that people are talking about offers up important feedback to the journalism community.  It also acts as a safe guard against some strategically ignored stories in the news that ignore information that is potentially important to people.  This kind of approach to blogs already makes them fairly important.    However, the other discussion that I found, and find is closer to my addressing my own personal questions around blogging, is a discussion about this strange genre itself.  In  urlLink Information Today  Wallys Conhaim wrote an article talking about the usefulness of journals as a genre, and specifically addressed the move of journals online.  In this article Conhaim briefly addresses the ways that online diaries can be important additions to the journaling genre: blogs provide an instant medium where people can communicate about some of their most personal situations safely with a broad group of people (28).  This is the basic way that online journals are so different then your average ink on paper- they are a connection that has the potential to be utterly anonymous but also get you personal interaction.  People are building communities online through various links and posting boards that allows them to find readers and other authors whom they relate to.    In “ urlLink New Kids on the Blog ,” an article published in the April 4th edition of the Guardian newspaper, Simon Garfield wrote about the new community of bloggers in England today.  In this article he recounts the story of Lynn Gomm, a mother of a young man with Asperger’s syndrome.  Gomm blogs about her life, her trials, her triumphs; all the stuff that a journal is normally made of.  However, Gomm is also part of a web ring that has over 600 users.  This ring contains, as Garfield writes, “some of the most engaging, trivial, thoughtful, rambling, reactionary, self-obsessed and shamelessly disturbing material of the present day.”  Writers of all kinds, formal and other, are using this new medium to express themselves and begin to find an audience for their meaning.     In this same article Garfield recounts a story that has been played out online since the beginning of the Internet: false identities, persona, reinvention of self.  Garfield retells the story of a young man of thirteen who turned to blogging when his parents died and he had to move in with his grandfather.  At one point the young man was severely spanked and he wrote about it.  An outpouring of support came from the online community that had been keeping up with the young articulate author.  People wrote in outraged and threatened to call child well fair offices.  At this point the young boy came out as an adult woman using the blogging format for experimental creative writing.    This kind of thing happens all the time online to varying degrees.  The internet seems to create a space where people are free to create the persona that they want. While separate from the real world, it is similar.  Bloggs are about life that we can relate to.  The audience of the blog (and there is an audience) can relate to the material as being part of the real world, being experiences that have happened, but it comes in small bites.  A blog is creating an instant connection in a way.  However, it is also a place where your identity is created to the degree you want it to be.  You don’t have to put down your real name, location, age, color, favorite band, how much you weigh.  You are free to create as you wish.  Pretty cool.  This brings me to an article by Laurie McNeill and the meat of my paper.  This article, titled “Teaching an Old Genre New Tricks: The Diary on the Internet,” was the first that I ran into that provided a solid framework of ideas to compare my own blogging experiences to.  So, finally, what is my blog all about…
