Jessie complains because every time we watch it i always say "JESSIE! Wouldn't it be awesome if they pimped out a RAV4?" and she always says yes, jackie, that would be cool.  and then she says we'd ahve to trash my car.  and then i say maybe it wouldnt be so cool   haha i'm like autistic, i swear, i have to have the same conversations over and over...... i dont even know if i realise it. oh well.  let's see, i ate mexican freezer meals, and ooh! it was awesome  i was trying to make a list of songs that were beautiful  but then it resorted to being a list of songs that changed my life.   it was awesome.  aah memories tied to music.  I also went through like a million magazines trying to find pictures of italy.  all i got was pictures of the Godfather and the movie Troy.  which was i think in Greece?  No, i'm a dumb fuck- it was in troy.  not in greece.     urlLink    I wish I was beautiful and Italian like that. mmm. I can't wait.  She's in front of some Important statue I was trying to find a picture of.  But I liked this one better.    I called mike to apologise for my mom hanging up on him last night, so he talked to me while driving from one place to another.  he made fun of ted a good bit, its become a pastime of him even though he doesnt even know him.  its pathetic.  i told him so.  oh- how about my mom totally freaked out sidropolous ( i so spelled that wrong)  by saying "I've heard so much about you!"  when really she hasnt, but she thought she'd flatter him.  now he thinks i'm his secret admirer.  i told him i had a shrine to him.  alice backed my story up.     let's see....... this is easier to write than i thought it would be.     i made fun of alice today for making fun of me...... so i was making fun of myself?  teal and pearls.  its a classic ladies.  its all about the teal.  i'm really obsessed.  why isnt this blog teal?  what color is it? i dunno its new.  alright thats all.  I wanna see who makes it to this new blog of mine. so leave a comment.
