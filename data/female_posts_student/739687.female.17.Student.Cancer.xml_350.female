Oh boy, I have so much to look forward to.  Well, let's have a look shall we: My birthday is June 23rd. Warped Tour is June 26th. My parents are going out of town for a week some time this month. I've got many colleges to visit. I'm going to PA in July. The lake. Camping. Wakeboarding. Parties. Parties.   Parties. Parties. Parties. Parties...  You get the idea.  Well well well. No work tomorrow. Amen. I'll I've done since school's out is worked and cleaned. And slept some.  I wish I could control what people inhabited the earth. God that would be cool. Because they would all be stupid. And I would rule them. Bah hah. Those sorry sorry suckers. And I would let some of my friends be smart too. And I guess some old people could be smart as well. But the old people wouldn't be able to rule anyone, because they'd be crippled as punishment for have intelligence comparable to mine. Rofl. And I would have sex slaves. But none of them could be fertile (no worries, u know). And no people with STD's either. Rofl, WHAT A WORLD BABY!  Haha yeah, you can all start bowing down now.  G'night crazies, I'm out.
