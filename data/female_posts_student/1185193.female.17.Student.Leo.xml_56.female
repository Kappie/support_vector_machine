I've always planned on getting a new car when I graduate from college and trading in my little 1999 Honda Civic.  It's truly a great car, but in 6 years (senior in  urlLink high school  to 4 year  urlLink college  to graduate credential program) I think I will be tired of my little car.   Something about getting a new car seems symbolic to me--like a fresh start, a new begining.  So, I have my  urlLink dream car  and my  urlLink realistic car .  Most likely I would get another Honda because they are reliable and cute little machines.  But I'd get a new one.  When I rode in Frosty's  urlLink Hybrid , I really liked it.  Plus, it's  urlLink good  for the  urlLink environment .  It also has pretty good  urlLink reviews .    But for now, I truly love my Civic.  It is fun to drive, gets good gas mileage, is easy to park, and is just pretty darn cute.  I think I'm going to go give it a little shower right now.  Adios.
