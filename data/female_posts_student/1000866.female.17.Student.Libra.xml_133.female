Mr. Alstadt thought finals started yesterday haha. So, we just took our final. I just wanted to get it over with. Then, in Music Theory we had a study hall thing. I finally signed Chris' yearbook. That took me pretty much the whole period since we were listening to music, and I was talking to Kelly at the same time. Hmmm, Chemistry was the usual boring. We just did a bunch of pointless problems. Yikes. I'm glad we get to have an 8 1/2/11" sheet of paper with us for the final. Health was ok. We just talked about contraceptives. Haha. It's so funny, Kelly and I constantly talk in that class. I mean, we never stop, but Ms. Madden never says anything.   Speech was ok. They had the final speeches and whatnot. I'll miss my speech class definitely. Fun times, well...except for the whole giving the actual speech thing...  Lunch was ok. It was kind of funny, we went outside and inside like four times because it was sort of rainy and we couldn't decided where to sit. We ended up sitting inside on the floor for our last day of lunch together. It kind of made me sad. We've got this whole big group of people now, and it's so much fun and...I love lunch. Oh well. I think it was fitting that we sat on the floor. I actually like it. It makes me feel like it's our own space.   Math was boring boring boring. We just went over the review packet more. The people in my class are such meanies though. Grrr. Oh well. Then Government we played jeopardy and I got all the questions I was asked right! I was very happy. I actually knew most of the stuff he asked. It was amazing. So, then, after school, I decided to clean out my locker and stuff. So, Brandon and Katharine and Alex were there and we were just hanging out. It was so funny. We locker Brandon and Alex each in a locker, and Kelly came up, and we were just laughing so hard. We didn't let them out for a long time.   Then, Peter G. came in with this weird kid named Tyler. Wow, what a creeeptacular kid. Majorly creeptacular. And like, he'd go away and keep coming back. Yikes, scary. Kelly and I were really scared of him haha, and I was helping Kelly carry stuff out to her car, the kid's like, wow, I've fallen madly in love with you both. Oh, and Kelly and I were talking about how it's unfair that guys can take off their shirts when they get hot like during marching and stuff and he's like, "girls can do that too." And we're like..."ummm, no" And he goes, "I hang out with girls all the time who take off their shirts. At 9:00 when they're at my house they do it."   Wow, what a scary kid.  So, after I got home and away from the scary kid who invited Kelly and me over like...15 times...I ate a really quick dinner then went to see Finding Nemo with a whole big group. It was awesome. Me, Kelly, Jessi, Spike, Emily, Kathryn, and Mary Clare. It was the coolest EVER. Such a funny movie. I'm going back to see it tomorrow. Haha, I laughed, I cried, I came close to screaming. Truly. Kelly can testify to that one. Haha. Like, when a scary shark would come, I'd gasp and like, stand up in my seat. I bet Kelly thought it was funny. Haha. I think I would laugh too if I would have seen me. Then we went to Chilli's, but the wait was like, 45 minutes, so we went to Oberweis instead. I got a strawberry Banana smoothie. Mmmm. It was so very very tasty. I loved it. I didn't feel like ice cream so I got that and I'm glad I did. On our way in there these guys whistled at us, and when we were sitting outside eating, another group of guys in a car made provocative noises. It was so funny, because Kathryn, so out of character, just turns around and makes the noise they made right back at them. Then they honked as they were leaving. It was so funny. Good times. Then there was this car waiting in the lot, and this guy was trying to freak us out by making barfing noises, and it was...ew, gross. So, on his way out, Kelly, Kathryn, and I all waved to him at the exact same time. So fun. I'm going to get myself shot someday probably but I live in Naperville for now so...maybe not.   Anyway, my evening was quite fun and I actually woke up at a decent hour today. I finished my book, took a shower, and now I'm going to try, TRY being the operative word there, to study. :)
