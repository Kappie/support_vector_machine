Friday:  I came home from school, Vanessa bought me a cookie urlLink   for helping her get ready for the strokes concert.  I helped around the house, did homework and that was it. Saturday: I woke up at around 9:00,made myself breakfast and did homework.  Michele came over at around 2:15 and then left at 3:30 when she found out that I had plans for later that night.  Angela and I had planed something long ago and we decided to go to her house for a sleepover.  Her and her mom came to get me at 5:00.  From there, we got slurpees from 711 and then went to her house.  We spent the night watching cheaper by the dozen, whatchin the game and playing this NHL04 game that we rented from the tsawwassen videoland.  It was around 1 am when we finally went to sleep.   Sunday: We woke up early, had a hearty breakfast and walked over to the mall.  There, I bought a sweet ass ball, bought timbits and went to shoppers for the first time (Ain't that sad??!).  Now I'm here at home, I don't have any homework tonight so I think I'll just relax.                 -Julie PS-I'm going to call you Kevan,the tradition lives on!!!
