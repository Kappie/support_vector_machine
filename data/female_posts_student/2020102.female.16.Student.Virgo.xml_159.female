My blue eyes are sensitive and it hurts. Alex: You have blue eyes? I have brown eyes. And when I stare into the sun, they burn. (pause) Oh wait, that happens to everyone.  NCQG:  "You should be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such nonsense." -Samwise  "People who never get carried away should." -Malcolm Forbes  "Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal." -Albert Camus  "A weary, weak and helpless worm, On thy kind arms I fall Be thou my strength and righteousness My Jesus and my all." -I don't remember, it was William someone.  "When the melody touches your heart emotionally and the words hit your brain intellectually, more than likely you'll find you'll have an excellent song to sing." -Yip Harburg, songwriter  "When you are at a restaurant and someone asks the waiter, 'So, are the clams any good?' don't you just want, for one time in your life, the waiter to say, 'Ma'am, I have to be honest, the clams here suck.' I think that would make me really happy." -Aaron Karo  "I felt it shelter to speak to you." -Emily Dickenson   "Will I wait a lonely lifetime? If you want me to, I will." -The Beatles
