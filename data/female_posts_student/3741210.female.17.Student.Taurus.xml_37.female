We couldn't go in the indoor pool either because lightning might strike through the glass and into the pool.  What a joke.  My cousin just left after an hour and never came back. She's my age, and we used to be really good friends, like sleepovers every other week.  Since high school started though we've been drifting.  Even in 7th and 8th grade I could feel her starting to go.  She reached an all time low though today with the actual leaving.  Usually she just calls her friends on her cell phone when I'm over or goes on the computer and IM's them.  She also likes to leave early and go to her friends' house, but to actually leave for the entire day, that's really rude-even for her.  The funny thing is, she sees me twice a year and them everyday.  Ah well.  I've had time to get used it so its not a complete surprise.  Why do families always have to disappoint us so? Or at least my extended family always seems too.  Then again, maybe its normal for teenagers to ditch the families in search of friends.  Maybe she has it right and I'm messed up.  Anyway, I need to get away from it all.  Its muggy and rainy outside, the worst kind of weather possible so that's not improving my mood.  My hair frizzes and I get a little bit of a headache.   I said I would do something with Ben tomorrow but I don't know what.  Maybe I can drag him to   The Notebook  .  That's about all for now folks, yall come back now, ya hear?
