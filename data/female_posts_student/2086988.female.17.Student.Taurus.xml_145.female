But hey, I made it 3 nights away from home! I realized something at camp, I realized how much I wanted to dance. And though I really do like being manager I just want to be out there with the girls dancing. And since this is my senior year I won't get a chance. I have way too many extra-cirricular stuff going on, so I can't take classes outside of school. And the way my schedule SHOULD BE (MNHS will mess it up) I won't be able to take a dance class. If we had 8 classes, I could. I might get out of anatomy and physicology and take one, but if not, I'm out of luck. But I really want to dance on a team, it looks challenging and I want that. I want to be out on the field, or on a stage, or gym floor, dancing. I want people to go wow that looks so great, etc. I know I'm in theatre, but I've sort of lost the flare for that. Because I know that this year no matter what, I'm going to get all the crappy parts so what's the use in trying? So I feel lost right now :(      Swallowed up in the sound of my screaming   Cannot cease for the fear of silent nights   Oh how I long for the deep sleep dreaming
