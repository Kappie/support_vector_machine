He actually meant it for neopets' username lookup, but I managed to put it into the template without anybody's help. I AM SO HAPPY!!! (^-^) It's actually very easy to many computer expert but for me, a country girl, I am so happy. The only downside is that Cardcaptor sakura's face is cut and the font is not my desired font and I could not change it. Haizz.... anyway, I am so exhubilant (spelling maybe wrong again)... But please, I am not so girly that I have changed both my background and GB's background to Cardcaptor sakura. It just that I lke CCS a lot and cutie Issac's majority backgrounds are CCS... Happy reading!!!!
