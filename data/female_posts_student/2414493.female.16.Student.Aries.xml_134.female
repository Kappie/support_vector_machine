Within the past three days I've had duck and chicken, prepared in the Chinese way: cooked whole, chopped up at the table. It then follows that everything's still there: I've identified a pancreas, at least, and have been too afraid to go any further. I can see the connective tissue, the muscles running in beautiful arcs. And we eat this.  Maybe it's time to take a partial Steve approach. A drumstick is terrible enough: you can identify the types of bone at the top of the joint. You can find the femoral vein, I think. You see the filmy CT. Cut apart, you can see the marrow. Even a large chunk of flesh is appalling when you can imagine the different bundles running every which way, when you think of it as a disgusting cross section.   I remember an essay: humans as carnivores are ok as long as we take care to treat the livestock humanely. Free range chicken, etc. But I still don't understand how that helps. Maybe it just prevents Slaughterhouse 5 or The Jungle situations, but as an omnivore who is simply concerned that meat consumption means you eat the carcass of something similar to you, that's no comfort.  This is my twisted solution, as I see it. And it probably only applies to me. Either the meat has to be processed, prepared, or portioned so that I can't really notice the parts of it (hi! a ligament!) or I don't eat it at all for fear of gagging. Emotionally, a hot dog is ok as disgusting as that may sound. Eating one, I can't see where it came from. Chicken in small chunks. Luncheon meat. Pepperoni. Sausage. And I must stop now lest I list all the pizza toppings.  I really think that's why I stopped eating fish that's either steamed whole, as we are accustomed to doing in this house, or just a cross section somehow. After dissecting perch in Patenaude's freshman biology, I'm just not comfortable eating something where I can tell you that the kidney runs along the spine. I don't want to remember that I removed a whole entire egg sac from this stinking yellow fish--I remember on the first day my gloved hand reached into a bucket of yellow preserving fluid where these dead fish were floating and had to grasp one, pick one. And I really don't like the fact that it can stare at me back. After perch, I think I can only take fish in processed fillet form, or fish paste.   And now science aims to take away the majority of meat in my diet. I'm letting it, though. Fetal pig definitely exposed me to the internal structure of animals. I remembered that the pancreas looks like a pouch of marbles, and that haunted me until the day I saw it in the duck. And mink this year is probably the biggest factor. I really don't mind dissecting it, but it exposed me to the orientation of muscles. You could cut away one and find another band running in an opposite direction. It was all so structured. And now, in chicken, I am so much more conscious that you can peel away layers too, and see the CT ripping along as you go.  This is no vegetarianism, but maybe just selective meat-eating. In a backwards way, it's leading me to processed food, never appreciated as much as the original. When was the last time you heard anyone singing praises for a hot dog or a fish stick?  After dinner I thought, wow, I should really stop eating this stuff, especially if I'm going to take apart a human cadaver next year. And then I think, that's it, I need comfort food, let's do Jello.  And then I realize Jello's made out of gelatin--animal hooves.  Yum yum.
