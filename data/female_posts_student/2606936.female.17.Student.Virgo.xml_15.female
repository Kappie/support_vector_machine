We decided to have a Spirited Away party someday and dress up like characters. D is going to be the Radish Spirit, which is like this big walking white tuber with a red hat and loincloth. He rocks the cat spa. I wanted to be Lin, who is this cool lady who's all like, "You're in BIG trouble!" but i think i'll be Yubaba the witch, who has a big nose and hair.... too bad i can't put pics up here.... oh well.   They do have two cats, which was not so good for me. I have a cat phobia. Seriously, i looked it up, it's called Galeophobia. Napoleon had it. It must run rampant in the short gene or something.... but yeah, i came in the house and the first thing i say is, "CAT!" because it's all trying to crawl on me and stuff.... Why is it that whenever i babysit, and come over and they have a dog, they're like, "Oh, i forgot to ask if you were afraid of dogs" and i'm like, "No way, i love dogs!"..... yet, if they have a cat, they never think to ask if i'm afraid of cats.  This is just more proof that cats are slowly taking over the minds of AMerican suburbia, with the intent to  undermine and ultimately destroy my attempts to help the poor.  (They play with yarn while i'm making charity scarves. The n00bs.)  ....... getting back.......However, D actually brought her tarot cards, which she'd never used or anything, so i did tarot readings for everyone. I sure am talented... Lace was screaming and playing with, like, a talking book or something and we were like, "Don't disrupt the flow of positive energy!"  But i did myself, and i'm like "When am I going to actually love someone again?" and it's telling me the past is like, wealth and stuff; present - what was it? like, withdrawal; others think i can't move on; i should try not to make enemies; and, if i do all this, i will long for a lost love.  NO SHIZNAT.  aaaaahhhhh! That's it. I'm never dating again.
