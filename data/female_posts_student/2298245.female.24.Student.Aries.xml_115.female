For those of you who don't know me, this is indeed a rare occurence and something of a treat.  I'm only doing it now because I wasn't completely wrong, just somewhat.  And now, I hang my head in shame, as I admit that I saw Cold Mountain and I actually liked it.  Not all of it, but it definitely had some good qualities that I am perfectly willing to admit, and ultimately, it wasn't half bad.  At the very least, it wasn't boring, which was my biggest fear going in.  It was long, but it didn't seem interminable.  It's not destined to become one of my absolute favorites, but I didn't hate it, as I expected I would.  And the Southern accents, while annoying, were not unbearable.  I've heard much worse.  So that's my tentative approval of the film.  So I release you all to go see it if you feel you must.
