"tell me you don't love me," i said, "tell me the truth" "i still love you marlaina, i can't say that" "how can you love someone and not want to be with them?"  the truth is he doesn't love me the way i love him. other wise he wouldn't have broken my heart twice, otherwise i would be able to make him stay. to love him is to be hurt, and i know it. i just want it to go away. i don't want to love him anymore, but it won't go away, why won't it just go away? i don't want to hurt anymore.  so he needs to figure things out. i wish i could be angry at him. at least when he cheated on me i had my anger, and my pride, and i would not let myself go back to him, and tried for two years to forget him, trying guy after guy, ah i hate it. why do i have to fall in love with one who doesn't love me? im afriad that when he figures things out and is ready for a relationship, that i will just run back to him. just let myself be walked all over. i hate it. i hate how weak i am.  that was 3 days ago. we were fighting off and on since then. it was the saddest thing to watch how we had deteriorated, to see what we had become. and after that i thought for a long while, and i tried to figure things out and i realized "why am i being spiteful to him of all people?" i love him. and i think i always will, there will more than likely be more loves in my life ahead, but if you truely love someone it doesn't go away. life is a search for the person who will love you in return. i realized i don't want to add to his pain, to make it harder for him, i want him to be happy, whether it is with me or not. this new revelation has made things better, ive stopped crying now, it still hurts oh god it still hurts, i feel like i am hollowed out, he was my good thing, he filled me up. i still want him, hopelessly, devouringly, and irrationally.
