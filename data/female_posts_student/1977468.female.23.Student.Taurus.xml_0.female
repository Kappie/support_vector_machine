One thing it does well however is help your sleeping habits, if they are out of wack. If they are in wack, I imagine it would put them out of wack. Drugs can do that if youir not careful. I have to wake up at 6:30 on mondays and wedsdays this quarter for my Ti-Chi class... I find this interesting, since the only reason I signed up for the class was to exercise with Eric. I called Eric today after the class and asked him why he didn't show up... apparently he's not going to school this quarter, he decided that 3 weeks ago. Did he tell me this? No. Frankly, Eric, I don't know where this relationship is going.   Nevertheless I thank the Melantonin for correcting my "awake after 1pm" syndrom.  Music remains the cement between my sanity and reality.   Listening to: Loudermilk; Rock n Roll and the Teenage Desperation
