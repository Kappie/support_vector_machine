I can't get myself to let go of my perfect A's, and I have been thinking about this for quite some time, trying to organize my thoughts and feelings.  I've created this idea that if I don't get accepted to those 'top' schools, if I don't get in the top percentage of my class, and if I don't achieve an excellent score on my college entrance exams then I'll amount to nothing and I won't get anywhere in life or succeed. But at the same time I don't even think I have enough motivation to work as hard as I would need to be working to keep those A's and have a complete understanding of the material.  I've become one of those people who expects to be at the top without having to do the work, and I guess I've gotten away with that for a while because I've gotten away with slacking off a lot, I think I slack off more than people realize, and like a great percentage of people in this world I am a horrible procrastinator.  I've come to realize that nothing will really matter unless I have at least some happiness inside of me, so this stressing out thing is doing me no good.  I think I need to stop my procrastinating and get things done when they need to be done. That way I can work hard, understand more of the material, and do well in school, and if I don't get excellent grades after that I'll feel good anyways because I'll know I tried hard and I'll have earned the grade I received. Or I can just keep working the way I am and just try to get rid of the anxiety that is completely unnecessary...well uh, we'll just have to see how that turns out. But I've decided I'm going to try and focus on the brighter things in my day rather than keeping a hold of the shitty things.  What I really need to do is find some enjoyment in my days, because I'm never going to like anything I'm doing if I'm not happy, and as Erica told me, you can be happy anywhere you are. I think i've just wrapped myself up in this college thing too much.  Well...off to do my homework, maybe, I'll do it in a little while, no need to do it right away :)
