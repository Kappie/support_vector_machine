(Yum) I especially liked it when the movie pops into a scene with Will in the shower  with water drizzling over his steaming hot body  . I almost shouted to Will on screen... "Me want to touchie!"  Good thing I was slightly sobering up, slightly lol.            So the tally goes: Will Smith is hot, makes robots hot, I want to be a robot for halloween, hot, lol :) Bahama Mama's,hot, The waiter Big Boy's who (looks like a greek god) my friend  I decided to have as my pool boy, hot. Getting a cell phone  downloading  The Munster's  ringtone, hot :) Downloading a cell phone wallpaper with a grouchy, plump tiger, hot. Finding excellent deals at Penney's and then getting 15% more off, hot, buying more teacher clothes, hot. Buying bras and ending up getting two for free, hot. Posting your bra size online, hot. Ha! Gotcha going! hot. ;) Oh yes, and let's not forget, working saturday at McD's til closing and getting asked out by another 19 year-old, hot. Ha, yes and corny. No more under 23 year olds for me thank you!  And you want to know what the greatest part of my night was?!!! Seeing tall, thin, country-boys wearing plaid shirts tucked into belted tight-fitting blue jeans and wearing a cell phone, hot. No, no, not hot....very very weird. Thank god I could come home for the summer to see this. Now all I have to look forward to seeing in high school when I'm teaching is bean-pole country boys with cell phones and pre-teens with those horrible not growing in mustaches. Ack! Gag! OMG gag. Bleck. I'll take tight-jean wearing country boys any day over that. Wait, I just ruled out the younger crowd. Oh well, boys have to have their little fantasies right?
