Kind of chilled on the Computer for a while, then hit the Range with my Papa.  Hit um ok, I guess you could say!  After my rendezvous with the Western lakes crew, I headed on home to...well to do nothing for about 5 hours!    5 Hours Later:  I had done nothing but, sit ON my butt for 6 hours..to the point where I forgot to eat lunch!  So to curb my hunger pangs, I head to the store for some munchies.  Then retreated back to my humble abode, to get ready for my long atticipated "date."      6 o'clock rolled around, and Gams arrived to takes us out for the "classic" dinner and a movie!  We hit up Oscars- to which I've never been- and ate some "grub" as he would call it! haha  Then we had the sly idea of going to Tar-shay, and getting some candy to slip inside the movie theater!  Oh boy, the first attempt to be  Rebelious  all night!  headed on over to the Movie Theather, arriving a good half hour early!  oh well, more time to chit chat! So when the long awaited sequel began, and Matt Damon, aka: Jason  Bourne  appeared...I knew it was gonna be a great movie!  get my drift ladies?!  The movie all-in-all was really good!  Minus the bouncy camera shots!  That was a little nauseating!  So the movie definitely was up there with such greats as...The Notebook, Spiderman 2, The Village (in 2 days).  After our movie buzz, the kind gentleman, politely opened the car door for me (thats a first for me...finally a well mannered man in Waukesha!).  We decided that a cool way to end the evening would be to stroll along the river, in frame park.  Well...thanks to River Fest starting tomorrow, every entrance to ANY parking lot...was closed!  So we Exnayed that Idea!  So, of course, us being two golfers, we headed to Moor Downs.  We did a little trespassing, to get in, but it was worth it! haha, lets just say it was making my  rebelious  night more exhilerating! hahaha We walked around the course...of course, did cartwheels down the fairways, and played in the sand traps!  we raked when we were done of course!  Then headed on over to Mack's, that was some good chocolate malt!  haha  Then the night came to an end as we went on home!  Overall Rating of the night:  Damn Good First Date!    Tomorrow'a Plans:  Meet my Edgewood Golf Teammate, and play 9 with Kevin.  Then...Hell!  oh well, you know, working 2.5 hours is still $15 bucks you didn't have before!  OK...off to get some shut eye!
