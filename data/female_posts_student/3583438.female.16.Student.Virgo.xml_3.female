I rested my head on my desk and closed my eyes. I felt the cold wood on my skin. I breathed heavily. I could hear my classmate singing from somewhere near. “Nice.” I thought. He was such a good singer. I opened my eyes and watched the raindrops fall gracefully to the soft, muddy ground. The air smelled damp and wet. It made my tummy ache. I closed my eyes again and sighed.  I didn’t realize I was there, my eyes shut, for ten minutes. My desk already felt warm. I stood up and decided to take a walk around school. My gay friend noticed me and asked me where I’m going. “Just outside.” I answered absentmindedly. I took a strawberry candy, my favorite, out of my pocket and popped it in my mouth. Sweet and sour tastes mixed inside my mouth. Just perfect for my feelings that day.  I saw younger batches busily studying, flipping pages of their books. A few who saw me smiled and waved. I returned the smile halfheartedly. I just couldn’t smile and cheat myself. I continued to walk. I stopped at the school canteen and sat there for a while. From where I sat, I could smell the delicious aroma of the newly cooked beefsteak. Before I left, I bought five strawberry candies and kept them in my pocket.   I walked inside our classroom and sat beside a friend. I gave him a candy and he told me something about a song he’s crazy about. I smiled, but this time for real.
