We hardly talk but once we do it just goes on and on and on.   Me: Dude, do you have any girlfriends? It seems like you’ve been single for the longest.   Rory; hmm, I was seeing this chic last year and didn’t work out. That will be the last time I’ll try romance.  Me: So this is it? You’ve given up on girls? It hurts and love sucks huh?   Rory: I’m not giving up on it. I just hate the pressure I get from family and friends. I almost got engaged to a person I couldn’t see spending the rest of my life with. And I feel like I let everyone down when I broke up with her.   Me: Awww, I’m sorry to here this but your still young, there would be someone else along the way. Don’t be so hard on yourself. Don’t expect too much from a person because all that leads you to is heartache and disappointment.   Rory; Thanks. Although, I’d rather keep a optimistic view on it. Every heartache and disappointment is a benefit.  Me: do you agree that love is very short and forgetting is so long?  Rory; love is a lifetime. Even if you love someone and break up, that love feeling you felt or gave will always be there. And it will be passed along and it will only get better. Forgetting isn’t an option. Everything you did will be remembered if reminded of something. You seem to be drowning yourself in a love complication, have you gotten a way out yet?  Me; lol Rory, shit up.    Time waits for no one. Treasure every moment you have. You will treasure it even more when you can share it with someone special.   Now let’s get into my questions and answers  Q; why hasn’t he return my e mails? A; He’s not interested in you. Q; why did he take me for granted? A; you’re an easy gal to get by and you developed feelings too soon. Q; why doesn’t he chat with me anymore? A; his bored of your ass. Q; should I let go? A; yep. Don’t waste time on a person who isn’t willing to waste their time on you. Q; what is it that other gal have that I don’t have? A; degree, knowledge, skills, power and etc. Q; do you know what you want Sakdary? A; I see what I want and I intend to go for it. Q; do you even know yourself? A; I’m always true to myself.
