Suck. O_o It's like this dull pain in your mouth; I can barely chew. I get my braces next week. *cough cough*     Ah, there's the internet again.     I went to a soiree with Camilla and Racine yesterday. Honestly, at first, it was really boring. Then it became ok, then it got out of hand, then it got scary, then it was back to ok. Sorta. XD Somethings are better left unsaid. So ANYWAY! I'm glad I went. Hihihi. *rolls eyes* XD     After the soiree Racine and I slept over at Camilla's house. Talked about the soiree, and fell asleep. :P The next morning, I could barely get out of bed. XP But of course, Camilla was already up. Racine was still snoozing. Hihi. Then after a while, Camilla came up to tell us to eat, and yeah we ate. We also watched Animax, and critisized the dubbing. It was horrible. More horrible than the defense of the panty in RO. Then Racine and I watched Jiro and Matthew kill each other in Tekken, witnessed a half nekkid Din Din and Carl, and pondered the meaning of life on Camilla's bed. We finally got to the computer shortly after that, and we got one slide finished! :D :D :D Yay for progress.     Well, I'll be gone for three days; Monday to Wednesday. I'm going on a religious retreat with my classmates in Tagaytay.W00tness. 'Till then I guess! =P
