But I pretend I was just curious about my surroundings. When he smiles at me, my heart would flutter in silence. His sms messages and emails are treasures to me. I would read them over and over again, as they provide me strength and motivation for the days ahead. He might not know, but I do hold his happiness dear to my heart.
