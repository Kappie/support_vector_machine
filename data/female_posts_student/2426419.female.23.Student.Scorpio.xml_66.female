First, I would like to extend the somewhat blurred distinction between high and low art.  Low art is the art of commercials and consummerism.  It is used merely to appeal to aesthetic tastes in marketing culture (Little Caesar guy or Charmin commercails).  High art is the stuff of creativity.  This is the art that flows from individuals for the purpose of creating, which often receives little praise until the artist is long dead (oh, how we long to not be appriciated).  With this distinction in mind, I would like to comment on high art as it serves within God's narritive.  I beleive that art can be viewed  areligously .   What I mean is that an artist may create a picture of lillies on a pond (Monet) and it can be praise for those that see creation in a new way.  The artist does not have to be a "christian" to create a work that allows me to see something in a new way and worship God because of it. As it is with Monet, I do not know his religous disposition, but I like the subjects he dipicted.  So, I do not think that art changes much, if at all, because the artist already strives towards beauty and creativity.  But, I do think there is one exception to this and it is in regard to the journey an artist may use as the subject of his\her work.  The artist may create works that symbolize where they are in terms of a relationship with the divine (searching, relating, indifferent) and the emotions from this experience.  The art then serves as a reflection of the person and would change as they "work" things out.  Both types of art sweep others into a world that we would not see otherwise.
