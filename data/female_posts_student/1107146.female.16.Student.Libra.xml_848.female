I think Grant and Hamilton possibly Anthony, the rest seem to be fairly recognizible.  I also understand why Hamilton is on the bill, he was the father of the national bank. and Anthony is a concession to feminists, but grant is the weakest link there.  it makes no sense.  Though, it might be that he made bankers so rich they decided he should be on their money because he helped them get it.  Who knows?
