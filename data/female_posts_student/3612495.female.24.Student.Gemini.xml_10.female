So, he asked me to go to his house, so that he can cooked for me! The food he cooked were delicious, potato, spagetti, taco, all of them are taste very good, and also the the big breadfast.  I am happy these few days, because I can see him every day when I went to bed or when I woke up, but my examination is coming, so I also need to work hard on my studies, and you, you should work hard on your works. Also to all my friends, we work hard together to have a better resulf in the coming future.  在剛剛過了的週未，我去了Gavin屋企住左3日。因為他的家人去了旅行，所以得佢一個係屋企，因此他叫我去他屋企，那麼他便可以煮飯俾我食﹗他煮的東西好美味的，有薯塊，意粉，taco（唔知中文係咩，係有個皮包住一些洋蔥，肉碎，芝士，汁），全部都好好味，仲有一個好豐富的早餐。  係這三日，我真的好開心，可以日日都見到佢，尤其係一起身同訓覺之前，但我的考試好快便到，我要俾心機溫書，你都要俾心機做野呀。還有我再有的朋友，你們都要俾心機，我們大家一齊努力，等待美好的將多的來臨。
