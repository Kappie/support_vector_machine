I don't know if we ever formally called ourselves that but we were quite blob-ish. We entertained the masses (if masses are like 4 people who didn't even stay for the whole song) with our renditions of three blind mice, row row row your boat, my bonnie lies over the ocean and um...something else i don't remember. I decided that when I grow up I want to be a dog. All they do is lay around and eat and chase their tail. I wish I could be a dog but then again I probably wouldn't like the fur.
