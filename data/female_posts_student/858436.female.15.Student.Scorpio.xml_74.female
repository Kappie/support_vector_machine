Hm so today I went to my grandmother's house to finish up the physics extra credit and some other crap my parents felt like bitching about. My computer is a PIECE and is about to die, so I can't even open up Word. So I got that done so they'd be quiet.  So I've just chilled this weekend. That's alright. In a weird way, I don't want school to end. I don't want to be forgotten during the summer. I won't let that hapen. I still want people to call me and ask me to do stuff. I don't want to be one of those "school year" friends...  But yeah.. next weekend is 3 days so I'm thinkin I may have some people over. Not sure yet. The parentals are okay with it. They want to meet my friends or something like that. :-D
