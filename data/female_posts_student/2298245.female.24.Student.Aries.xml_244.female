I do not follow this show (or really any other show) that faithfully anymore, but it is still very sad news.  Though he has been doing the show for 12 years, so perhaps it is for the best that he is moving on, perhaps he will do other interesting things.  Though the show will not be the same without his character.    This does, however, make me mildly interested in seeing the rest of the season.  The show has not always been the best at giving its characters good exits, but after 12 years, Lennie deserves to go out with flair.  Dare I suggest a musical episode?  In other TV news, I watched  The West Wing  for the first time in a while this week, and it was actually pretty good.  No idea whether this was just a blip in an otherwise downward trajectory, or whether this is a signal of better things to come.  I hope it is the latter, but I am still a skeptic until proved otherwise.   Also,  Law  Order  season 2 is coming out on DVD soon, just in time for my birthday.  I may have to use a little bit of the money I am (hopefully) getting and pre-order it.  Since TNT barely ever shows these old episodes, it will be nice to have access to them.  In case you didn't notice from reading this, I'm trying to waste time.  I am very worn out from my week of heavy hitting, and can't work up much of a will to do anything other than stare at my computer or watch TV.  I need to be working on my Personal Statement for Journal elections, but as I'm not in the mood - and have no idea what I should or am going to say - I will perhaps put that off for a little bit longer.  My goal is to finish that before I go to bed.  If I can manage that, I'd say that today would be productive.
