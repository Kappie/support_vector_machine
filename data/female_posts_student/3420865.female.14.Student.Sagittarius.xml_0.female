(i had a part-ay.) and i'm pretty sure it rocked... i hope everyone else thinks that...  ok so my night:  first, vanessa came over at like 7, and she played with bob. (bob is my puppet thing... he's cool.) so that took place for like 5 minutes, and then we went downstairs to wait for all the guys to come. when mike, mark and evan finally got here, i took them on a tour of my house.. it was funny. cuz i kept trying to show them different things, and they'd get distracted by something else... yeah. it was funny. moving on... then tim got here, and then ray came and we went for a walk in the forest behind my house, cuz they wanted to see the tree house that was there... so then we got to the tree house, and hung out there a bit... and when i say hung, i mean ray got stuck and was kind of hanging there.. it was funny. yeah they got bored of that after about 5 minutes, and after we got ray down we went to the rope swing... and that is where all the fun began!  we were taking turns swinging on the rope swing, and we saw this guy in the bushes, like watching us. so mike, ray, and evan started making bird noises, and then guy in the bushes did it back... only his bird noises were pro. seriously, i was scared. but then he eventually came out of the bushes, and he hung out with us... he's a cool guy. his name's donovan... and i think he kind of likes mike.  so after our little trip to the rope swing, we went to the park, and ray again got stuck. after rescuing him  yet again , we walked back to my house, and waited for erin to arrive, and started to watch gothika... then erin came like just after i put the movie in, so we all watched it together... minus the fact that evan, ray and mike kept going into the kitchen and trying to scare us.  at one of the scary parts of the movie, ray and mike snuck outside, went to the back of my house (where the window of the living room is), and knocked on the window. of course, you can predict what happened next... people screamed and ran, there was mass confusion, and then we realized that it was them... and all the other guys were like "oh man i knew it was them! i wasn't scared at all."...liars.  so yeah. when the movie was done, we just chilled yo. it was coo. and then people started to leave... and then came the best part ever... i got to clean up. yeah, i know. amazing.  quotes from last night:  "wouldn't that be funny if we all turned into praying mantises?"-mike (so random.)  *Donovan makes loon sound.* "sorry, i don't speak loon."-evan  "hey ray you have to see the huge basement!"-evan, as he runs into the study. "...wrong way..."-me   *bollywood music*-evan, mike, ray... every 5 seconds.  wow they were so funny ahaha i laughed... here's how:  1. evan put a basket on his head, and an umbrella in his hand, and ran around my house. 2. mike, evan and ray poked their heads around a corner and made random noises. 3. evan tried to convince us that there was a little girl sitting in my background... he kind of failed miserably. 4. there's a that runs along the stairs, but he like goes straight across and it's really high up... and the three of them tried to go across it... again, they failed.  yes, that was saturday night... i'm so gonna do that again... and ray had an idea to watch a scary movie, and then go play manhunt at like 11 in the dark forest. sounds like a plan, stan.  ok so today was kind of cool... minus the fact that it rained, and i kind of had a seizure... but that's a story for another time, kids.  *during art class, when mr. olsen was trying to get people to evaluate a painting... it was of a woman and a chicken.* "so tell me guys, what are the shapes in this painting?"-mr. olsen "... chicken "-adam (grade 11 gangster guy... he's coo.) "no, adam, what are they types of shapes?"-mr. olsen "... chicken "-adam "no what types of shapes are they!? organic or geometric?"-mr. olsen "... chicken... "-adam wow it was hilarious.. cuz adam wouldn't stop saying chicken. so eventually mr. olsen wrote chicken on the board to make him happy. yeah, it=good times.
