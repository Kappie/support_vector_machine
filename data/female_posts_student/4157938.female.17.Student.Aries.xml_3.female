Let's start from the start:    Fri. 13th     around   7:45 am -- I got up, took a shower, and did my hair makeup ect. for the senior pictures at Whatchyamacallit (prom dress store).    10:00 am  -- We started by taking senior spirit ads. Someone decided it would be a great idea to take a picture in these bush type thingies outside and we ended up getting swarmed and eaten by ants while trying to take a picture against a tree outside.     10:15 am (-ish)  -- The psycho owner finally shows up at the store and takes 10 minutes unlocking the doors with her 4 inch long fake nails. We got dresses and looked all spiffy and took a hundred and one pictures while this extremely ditsy ex-cheerleader who works there tells us her life story and asks us if we know So-and-so from Blah-blah High School. NO. We d.o. n.o.t!    11:45 am (give or take)  -- We are finally set free from our prom dress prison and I go home.    3:15 pm  -- Get to Smith to get ready to go to McKinney to play our two games.    5:30 pm (-ish)  -- After tons of traffic and an uncomfortable nap in the bus we finally get to McKinney H.S. So, we watched Plano and McKinney play each other.  Notable hilariousness: apparently (I didn't see it) one girl "patted/grabbed" another girls butt in "encouragement" and Suzy saw it. Suzy then yells "That was more then just, like, and accident pat on the butt or whatevere their was some definite cuppage there." (cuppage *snicker* ... so funny).     6:34 pm  -- We finally start our game against Plano and get beat.    8:50 pm   (-ish... maybe)  -- We play McKinney and beat them in 3 games (woot!)    Nothing much more to say about the games... I didn't really have a very "critical" role in either... but I can say my voice is still gone today from yelling so much.     10:30 pm (ish)  -- Make it back home and start getting all my crap together for kidnapping:     air horn    bandana's / blindfolds    shaving cream    jar-o-pickles    fabric paint (for the bandana's)    anything with caffiene    anything with sugar    whipped cream    water balloons    water guns    black outfit    black eye-mark stuff (like the stuff the football players use... the black stuff on their faces... yea whatever)      11:50 pm  -- Head to Dani's. We then made the bandana's and concocted this stew of pickles, cold spaghetti, pickle juice, and apple sauce... for the bobbing for pickles event.     Sat. 14th     1:15 am (ish)  -- Go to Super WalMart for more supplies... and get stalked by the wierdos that hang out at WalMart at 1 am. We got some shaving cream and baby oil for the home-made garbage bag slip-n-slide. ( Suzy "I'm a little pony, clippity-clop, clippity-clop.")  We also bought some Koolaide so we could eat it as a powder to get some kind of sugar high. Oh, and some really good Hostess... I think they're called Ho-ho's.  (yum).   2:00 am (ish)  -- Continue preparing stuff: slip-n-slide, plates of whipped cream to throw in underclassman's faces, water balloons, nasty pickle spaghetti crap, and Reese's and Ho-Ho dog food. We ate the Koolaide... Dani and Amanda attempted to sniff it. Things didn't go to well with the Koolaide... apparently we got the kind that you have to add sugar to... so we were just eating/sniffing pure artificial flavouring with no sugar what so ever.  (bastards) .  3:50 am  -- Commence kidnapping. We squirted all 5 of our girls a ton with water guns and we used the horn on 2 of them.  4:45 am  -- IHOP!!!  6:00 am  -- Back to Dani's house for the torturing. We made them change into their bathing suits and crawl on their hand and knees commando style on the slip in slide, which was a huge garbage bag type thing covered in shaving cream, ice, water, and baby oil, ... they then had to go bobbing for pickles in nasty spaghetti/apple sauce/water/pickle juice thing and get a pickle without using their hands. All the while we were pegging them with water balloons. The losers or the race/relay got a nice big plate of whipped cream in their face. :)  6:45 am  -- Time to hose them all down and take them home.  7:20 am  -- Cleanup the yard (their was an kinda still is spaghetti everywhere).  7:50 am  -- We finally went back home ourselves and attempted to sleep. (all nighters blow)  9:15 am  -- Wake up again to go to volleyball practice (coaches are the devil)... volleyball practice consisted of a "wieghts and conditioning" today. We ran some, then we lifted, then we ran some, then we iced. (pretty pointless really... think we coulda done without that one)  11:20 am  -- Back home and into the shower.    So ends the kidnapping. Very fun, very funny, and extremely tiring. I will try to get some pictures and post them here... funny, funny stuff.
