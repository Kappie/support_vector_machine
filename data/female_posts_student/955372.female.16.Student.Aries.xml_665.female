My sister talked to Olivia, and Kristen talked to me, while her son stared at my crotch and said "THREE BUTTON PANTS" and hit his head against the wall. It was a bit disturbing. it was really funny a while ago when kristen and me were working she was talking to me about how she like took no classes in her senior year and just like screwed around the whole year. And i'm thinking "wow, that could be cool maybe i'll do that instead of taking all those ap courses and stuff, she turned out ok." but THEN i thought "wait a minute, no she didn't. She's like forty she works at a library. Her son is a maniac/has his mother WRAPPED, and her skin absolutely SCREAMS 'SUN DAMAGE! SMOKER!'" yeah. it was funny.
