I know, but I dont know the depths to which it goes, the depths to which I love him or the intensity that can be felt when we make love to each other. Theres so much we dont know, but I dont want to stop until I can at least feel the slight vibrations that truth and potential send off.

I have the one and only copy and I dont plan on losing it any time soon, especially to the likes of some skeletal bitch who thinks she can tell me what my life is about.
