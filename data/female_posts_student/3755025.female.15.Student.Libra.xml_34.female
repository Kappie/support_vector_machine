SHE'S MY CHEESEBOIGER! lol. anyway we were bored so we made a cult--and we are now randominians..and we study the ways of randomism with all the other random people.....[yes, it is screwed up, just dont ask questions] anyway.. we started to recruit people to be randominian and in order to convert, they have to stand in pudding..and drink mountain dew which is being poured off of a balcony into their mouths.  and to convert people me and heather (the leaders) fly to peoples windows and throw pudding cups at them-(as opposed to the mormons walking door to door giving out pamphlets and reading from their bibles). and we are still deciding on this.. but our "god" is going to be Tyson....(the lead singer of the All American Rejects-for anyone who is clueless about who that is) so far we have 3 people willing to convert..and one person who is a randominian in practice (R.I.P.)  not to mention the speedy bike ride (in the rain) to pauls house. and runnin around his giant house with him, pat and heather....for the record...this kid has the hugest house that i have even seen.....and that is ALOT of places to hide when you dont wanna get caught!!  ::wink wink cough cough nudge nudge:: u kno wat im talkin about! lol     mood: dorky, slutty music: pretty girl (the way)-sugarcult
