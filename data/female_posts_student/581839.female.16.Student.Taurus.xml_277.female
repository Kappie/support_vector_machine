THAT i am SO NOT excited for. i'm sorry, it's just... 545 ugh. so, i'm not obsessed with harry potter fan fiction anymore. thank goodness that is overwith. now i realize what a freak i was. am. was. and gosh what people must have thought of me. wonder how it wraps itself around people so much. summer can do weird stuff to a girl. weird stuff. like break their habits. and stuff.  ok, i'm getting tired of writing, so i'm just going to end with the fact that today i got to see a cinderella story and am officially totally jealous and wish my life could turn out that way. well, except for the dead dad and evil mom thing.
