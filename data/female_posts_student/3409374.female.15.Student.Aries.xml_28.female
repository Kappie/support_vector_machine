Then on tt day of class performance someone also cannot make it. So dumb. Wasted my afternoon but who am i to say that in front of him. Make him feel so paiseh. But he could at least treat me to ice-cream....lol....i so childish and super thick-skinned.    Just came back from the creation seminar thing...it was so so good. Wasted lar amoi and gang never come cos it was really really good. The speaker was super well-informed lor. He was rattling off with hard-core evidence about how the earth is actually not billions of years old but instead only a mere 6000 years ago. Everyone was convinced man. I would definitely go for next week's one. And of course, drag some ppl along too.  Haiz...long weekend ahead. Yay! but hw as usual piles up in heaps again. sigh. nvm...all play and no work makes jack a dull boy.
