I found out Tuesday it was that Tyler had cheated on me before he left for Canada...yea...definetly not something that made me all smiles. It was more of all tears. So that happened, but we've talked since then...and this is where it gets even more confusing. By Wednesday night we were pretty much fine, we'd talked about 3 hours, though he was drunk...which was scaring me because I didn't want him to pass out...at all...but now it's Thursday morning at about 4 o'clock. We talked about an hour ago, and the crazy "l word" was pulled out...by him...for the first time. Yea, weird time for it huh? That's what I was thinking. Oh well, I'm still pretty lost about it all. I guess only time will tell. But for now I'm going to try to sleep...because he got offline a bit ago...kicked off I'm hoping. Left without good-bye..and yea he was crazy drunk again. I guess I'll find out soon enough...good night!
