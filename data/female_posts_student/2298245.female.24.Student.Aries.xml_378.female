I just can't think of anything worth saying, and those things I can think of that are worth saying, I've already said before, and I do so hate to be repetitive.  I do not have the time to fully devote myself to this great blogging adventure in the manner in which I would like.  It's kind of funny, actually.  I started this out thinking that I would have a place to vent all of my frustrations with life.  And now, in typical me fashion, I'm blogging about my frustration with blogging.  I say typical me fashion because everything I add to my live, every decision I make which I think will make things all better, only tends to have the opposite impact eventually.  I mean, everything goes along all fine at first, and then something goes wrong.  I don't know what it is.  Perhaps I just like things that are new, and when they aren't new anymore they begin to irk me.  Or perhaps I'm just on a downslide at the moment, and things will pick up again soon enough.  I'm betting it is the latter, since I have been down this road before.  All of this is to say, is to explain why I have been absent these past few days.  I even have things that I want to blog about, e.g. my recent family visit, but I can't seem to find the right words.  I got so frustrated, I just wanted to destroy something, and since blogging is not really a tangible medium (I mean, I could have destroyed my computer, but that hardly seemed a good move), I ended up deleting a saved draft of a post I had about my anger.  I was saving it for a rainy day, when I could really devote the time I needed to it.  But now I'm not sure when that'll be, or even if I had the time to devote that it would do me any good.   But don't worry.  The anger itself is still there.  And one day, I know that a confluence of events will allow me to be able to tell my story, the story of my anger, often, to me, the only story that matters.  I can't watch the news for more than five minutes without getting angry or frustrated or scared.  This must be why I spent the day yesterday (when I wasn't doing work) watching bad movies, or the Yankees/Mets game.  Sorry, Mom, but GO METS!  Perhaps this present exercise will help me come out of the blogging doldrums.  Or perhaps it will lead me to commit blogging suicide.  Either way, I hope and fear that a resolution is on the way.
