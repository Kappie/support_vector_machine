So I had to set it back to Feb 28.  Anyway, it's March already?  Geez.  I leave in just over a month, and I have so much to do.  Kinda depressing, really. So, if I just finished Spring Break, why in the world didn't I blog?  Good question.  First, I kind of forgot I had a blog.  Silly but true.  Second, I spent a lot of frustrating time on the net trying to plan vacations, and I would generally be so annoyed by the time I was done that I just wanted to get offline.  The trip with Mr. Guarrera fell through, which sucks, as I was really looking forward to hitting southern Spain.  Sunny skies, warm temps- it would have been the life. Instead, I'm hitting Budapest, Eger, and Vienna with Calvin and El Chuck.  Should be a good time, and the planning was much easier.  A couple hours on the phone, a few hours searching for hostels/hotels, and we were set.  All that is left to plan is two train trips and a reservation for one night in Eger.  I'm a bit concerned about how I'm going to deal with all my plane transfers, as I bought tickets at all sorts of different times, and on different airlines.  I'm not sure where I'll be able to check bags through and where I'll have to be running around the airport (Heathrow, most likely) like a chicken with my head cut off, trying to figure out what to do next. Anyway, I'm off to do some reading and maybe take a walk, since it's actually kinda nice outside.  Well, it was nice, and it's still warmish, but no longer sunny.  I'll take what I can get, tho.
