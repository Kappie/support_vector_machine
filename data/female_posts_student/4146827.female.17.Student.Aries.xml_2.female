Anyway, went to my aunt's house and have a celebration fest... The usual, mine favourite salad is on the table, can't get enough of it, almost want to ta bao back home... Ha...ha... From my aunt's house can see the fireworks very clearly, and also the national flag flying across... Most important of course is the airplane... Ha...ha... After all, her house near Katong... Ha...ha... Just not at the national stadium... Ha...ha... Lame Lame Lame...  Well, spend the whole day with my family... Not bad a celebration... Even though most of time we are playing mahjong... I don't have the interest liao, so stick to the tv, and the bunch of lousy cousins... Ha...ha...  Erm... Went to the doc this morning, feel that I am not really improving... Instead getting worst... Don't know why... Hai~!!! Leave to fate...
