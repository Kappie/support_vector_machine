I had a professor last year who would always spell it wrong, even after I pointed it out to her (I still fear she spelled it wrong on my letters of rec, which must have looked bad); I emailed her last weekend looking for a copy of a syllabus from a course I took with her, and of course she sent her reply to good old Jaime.  I mean, the From: section of the email clearly says "Jamie" and I sign my emails "--Jamie".  I just don't know.  Noah's done the same thing on a couple emails, even though I know he's aware of the correct spelling as it was right with the CD he sent.  Could that just be a really easy typo to make?  If so, why don't I make that mistake now and then?  Ha.  I know it's nothing to be upset about but it is one of my biggest pet peeves.  I also had to deal with another one of Jamie's top pet peeves today, someone assuming I'm around 16 years old.  It happens far more often than it should.  I was buying a new dress (which is totally hot, if I must say so myself) and related accessories for Meghan's wedding, and the cashier asked if I wanted a Marshall Field charge card, but quickly stated, "Oh, but you have to be 18.  You aren't old enough, are you."  Listen you old biddy, I'm 23.  I was eighteen FIVE years ago...  And of course, the typical response "Oh, you'll really appreciate it when you're older."  Yeah, right.  I'm not so sure I will.  I'm not the type that will think it's cute to still be getting carded when I'm 35.  But who knows, maybe I'll age poorly.  Always possible, considering I live the archaeology lifestyle of lots of hard labor and time in the sun.  I heard today that I'll be digging with a pick ax this winter.  Nothing like that to build up the old biceps.  Sweet.
