I'm incredibly relieved because the entire time I was there counted as extra credit, which is wonderful in every aspect as all I needed were 65 minutes more, which was due tomorrow after school, and there was no way I could have done it what with Women's Ensemble rehearsal. So happy!!! Yay.  Otherwise, I will really miss Mrs. Smith. She is truly one of the best teachers I've ever had in the long run. She's certainly ticked me off many times and made me cry with her assignments, but, regardless of how well or badly I will do Tuesday on the AP test, I feel as though I've learned a fair share. Besides this, I've also acquired some life lessons from her; every now and then, while I'm thinking about stuff, I think about things she's pointed out about life, and it helps a lot.    Met Katherine's boyfriend- excuse me, best friend- (=-) ) from New York. He was really quiet and seemed nice. He was really hot, too, but that's besides the point.   I had too many brownies. I think I'm going to go do what I haven't done all weekend save for the last 3 hours and study some chemistry, mayhaps.   Adieu!!
