I DO have a lot of stories to tell, The problem is, if I tell half of them I'll probably get arrested. The other half would put me in a mental institution. I think I'll stick to one of the very few safe ones for now.  My class was in Boston, and I took the train there a lot because my mom wasn't always there waiting with her car and driver's liscense (God- two noun's I'd love to own...). Now, I know that roaming around downtown alone at night, roaming around Boston alone at night, taking the subway alone at night, and doing a whole bunch of other shit alone at night isnt exactly the safest way to go, but I definitely know how to handle myself. I was prepared for any fuckers who might try to screw with me (no sick, demented pun intended). But I never actually expected anything to really happen.  Well, it did.  So there I was sitting at the train station, waiting for the...um...train maybe. There was this blond-haired, bown-eyed, middle-aged, tall, scraggly looking guy who was probably kicked out of AA and issued a restraining order twice in the past six weeks. He was smoking a pack of Malboro Lite's. The guy can't even get a manly pack of cigarettes, let alone set of balls. Knowing my paranoia extremely well, I didn't believe myself when I thought it seemed wierd how often he would look over at me. I got on the train. He did too.   Still holding myself back from the panic attack I was sure to have seconds before I beat this guy's ass to the ground, I sat down and watched him take a seat two behind me. The conductor came to me and asked where I was getting off. Hesitantly, I said Back Bay, the first of two stops in Boston. When he asked the creepy guy, he also said Back Bay. It took a hell of a lot of convincing to make myself understand that it was NO BIG FUCKING DEAL. Lots of people were getting off at Back Bay.  Next, I did the stupidest and simultaneously most unconciously ingenious things ever. I fell asleep and missed my stop. I woke up at the next stop, South Station. As I stepped onto the platform, I was slapped out of my still-dreamy state. Creepy Guy was behind me. I was definitely nervous at this point. I started to walk around, making sure he was following me before trying to figure out what to do with him when I was finished. I turned and started to walk towards another train. Still behind me. I turned again and headed towards the subway. Yup, he was as fucked up as I imagined forty-five minutes earlier at the station I got on at. I turned one more time and ran right into this old guy who was on the train with me and Asshole.   "Excuse me miss, can I help you?"  I saw him glaring at Fuckface with the meanest and most disturbing look I have even seen a senior citizen give another human being. That look would make you picture Osama Bin Laden wearing a halo and singing an Amy Grant song. Dickwad walked away, and the guy's face softened.  "Was that man bothering you?"  "Not yet. Thanks."
