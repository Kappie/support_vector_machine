I couldn't have asked for a better morning.  Im not gettin excited though...He called today too and it wasn't anything special, but I was glad to talk to him.  He sounded A LOT better than I thought he would...Im so ready to get out of this freakin place....yeah, I couldn't leave at a more horrible time, but I need to go...I needa make sure I can stand on my own 2 feet without all you people here.  Nate kicked ass today at his game.  I wanted to spend some time with jess today, but she was busy.....yet again! oh well, what can I say.  Well, I guess Im gonna go, try to find something to do.  I haven't been home in days except for today and a little bit at night, and I like it that way...yall be good, ya hear?   Oh yeah, and my favorite movie for right now is Cruel Intentions.....Guess who I am??!?!
