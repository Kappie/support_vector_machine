Plus he and aunt carol ((his sister))((they live together)) and just plain old nice people with nothing but nice things to say. They remind me of Matthew and marilla cuthbert from Anne Of Green Gables.  Momma is in a super foul mood, luckily she's decided to take all of her premenstrual frustrations out on Devon, who has also been in a shitty mood all day.   Err I don't think I have anything else to talk about except to say that the distillers are a better band than I thought and velvet underground really sucks and violent femmes are nifty.  You know violent femmes, they sing that song that is like "why can't I get just one kiss, why can't I get just one screw..."  I tried to get a chatterbox and it was all screwed up. I'm gonna go try to find another one. ((yeah, I know, I have obsessive compulsive blog-renovating disorder))
