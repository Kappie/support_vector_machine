Be careful of how you treat others, for feelings are likely to be hurt if you are not sensitive in terms of where you point your stinger. Others may look tough, but deep down they are just as soft as you are. Think twice about using your aggressive nature at the expense of others.  Now I feel bad, but I'm always having a bad day. I feel that no one cares even if they say they do. I wish you could be more clearer about what you say. And if it's a joke, it's a sick joke...
