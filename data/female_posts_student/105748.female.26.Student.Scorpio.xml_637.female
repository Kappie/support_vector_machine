Net, you must be a super nerd cuz I have no clue what you are talking about: "QuarkXpress," "IPOD," etc. I feel like I need a lexicon. I feel like I'm in some weird alternate universe cuz really I believe the so-called "nerds" are really cool folk; I'm the one who feels like the super dork for not being in the loop about this stuff.
