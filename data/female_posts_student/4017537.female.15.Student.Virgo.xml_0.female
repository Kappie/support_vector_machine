I'm sitting here eating a vanilla pudding pop (which strangely looks something... you know what it is) and listening to my Launchcast Player. I love that freakin' thing right now I'm listening to Pearl Jam. I just went to our newspaper's website and found out that our new band director is going to be Mr. Bartz. Supposedly, he just graduated from college in March, 2004! He's a young one! Young ones are normally pretty strict (after a while), believe it or not. Hopefully, he'll be pretty cool. Yea. Keems just called me and we ended up talking for a few minutes. Wow! It would be awesome if I had some sour straws right now. I kinda don't mind going back to school now. Normally, I hate school. A lot. But this year, it's ok. I want to see my friends, yes, but I also feel more comfortable with things. I don't mind my classes (as of yet), I know the school inside and out, etc. I just hope that I have some classes with some of my friends. I know that a lot of them are having A lunch this year. Maybe I'll have some more lunches with Sara this year. I know that I don't have any classes with her. I know I have a few with Nate and possibly one with Courtney. Besides that, I don't know who I have my classes with. I just hope that not all of my classes are with people I don't know/don't like. Last year, I only had about two classes with friends. I just hope that next year will be better than last year. Last year was... blah. Not too good, not too bad. Just a lot of nothing. I'm going to go write an e-mail. Peace!
