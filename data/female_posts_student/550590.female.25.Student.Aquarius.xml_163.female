We need people to help man the hotline this weekend. (See, no one reading this will actually understand why this is funny because they weren't forced to attend AA meetings for a stupid substance abuse class last semester.)  I have spent over $100 on eBay in the past 7 days. It has been...2 minutes since my last bid. I have the unfortunate habit of winning nearly everything I bid on. I also have the unfortunate habit of collecting Harry Potter memorabilia. I've recently been quoted as saying "I can't wait to live in Russia so that I can buy Russian Harry Potter merchandise." The worst part about my addiction is that I have no desire to quit...Even though I know I should save my money for study abroad. (you're studying a broad? Why not study a guy?)  So anyway, the point is that I'm spending way too much time and money on eBay now that I'm on vacation. See, bad things happen when I'm neither overworked nor underpaid! Just goes to show, I NEED to be busy, stressed, and broke!
