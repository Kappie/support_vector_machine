One minute I am so exremely happy...I love my friends, I love my school; everyone and everything is just dandy...and the next minute I am so pissed off I think I want to punch someone. I never go to the side of being depressed...ok, well, rarely... I just get really synical and snippy. Little things annoy me when I am like that.  All teenagers should wear a warning label attached to our heads that changes like a mood ring:  "SAFE TO APPROACH"  "FOR AGES 13+"  "CAUTION: MOODS MAY HAVE SHIFTED DURING GYM CLASS"  "DANGER WILL ROBINSON....DANGER WILL ROBINSON"  This would be beneficial to everyone. No guess work involved.  On a different subject:  Please tell me I am not the only one who believes that the new movie 'The Passion of Christ' is some neo-republican-christian propaganda?  I don't care if people disagree with me... I can't change people's opinions and I don't believe any mortal can. People will think what they think and thats that. Case closed.  But it would be nice to know if anyone shares my opinions. E~mail me.   .....But hey..... enough rambling for today.    SONG OF THE DAY: 'Losing My Religion' R.E.M.
