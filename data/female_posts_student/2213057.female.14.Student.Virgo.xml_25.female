(that's more than two s's). ya, well, she's happy. i had an awesome day. it rocked. i went to the (ugh. kill me twice. mall) hmv was fun, skanking to pop/classical music. we pretended we were rockers. then heather shook her fist at an old man to hurry up. we covered brianne with this nasty coconut oil. now she stinks. i saw spencer (grr). by himself with his mom and i promptly ignored him. lana's house was awesome. andrea!!!!!!!!!! heather!!!!!!!!! lana!!!!!!!! love you guys! you rock. that was soooooooo much fun. ah, lots of pictures. and MANY inside jokes. but heather shaking her fist at an old man... that was crazy. was is she on? have a good night. don't die a virgin.
