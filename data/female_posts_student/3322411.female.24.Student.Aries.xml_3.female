It was fascinating because of the defense that she used--she said that the child's death, who was only 2 1/2 years old, inflicted injuries to himself that resulted in his death.  Apparently it was due to a syndrome called Reactive Detachment Disorder. After seeing the photographs by the prosecution, I don't see how any 2 1/2 year old can inflict such harsh injuries to him or herself. These injuries included excessive bruising to the entire body, red and swollen genitals, and spoon and spatula marks on the child. The paramedics were called to their house at 4 am because the child was choking on his vomit. Instead of calling 911 first, the mother called her mother and told her she had to come immediately. Then when she finally called 911, she was extremely calm. I mean, come on, if your child is choking, how can any mother not be hysterical?  The mother claimed that around other people, including the father, the child would be extremely jovial. However, when she was alone with him, he often attacked her and she would have to fight him off. I find it hard to believe that any 2 1/2 year old child can be that dangerous. She said there were numerous occasions when he supposedly hurt himself, but yet she never took him to see a physician. Her reasoning behind that was after he finished hurting himself, for instance--hitting his head against a pew, he just got up and acted normal like nothing had happened. She should have taken him to the hospital regardless just to make sure nothing was wrong. She even went to therapy sessions with him and he didn't show any outward signs of aggression. A psychologist noted that when the little boy started kissing all over the mother's face, she didn't show any emotion or reaction; she just sat their stone-faced.  A parent's ultimate responsibility is looking out for the well-being of their child(children). I know if I noticed anything wrong with my child, I would seek attention. She did not take the stand in her defense to explain what really happened. What does she have to hide if she claims he the injuries were self-inflicted? Other evidence against her was she never went to the hospital to say good-bye to her son and she immediately sought legal counsel. I know for a fact that I would be by my son or daughter's bedside regardless of the fact of what people may think. At one point, she even wanted to give him up for adoption because he was too much trouble for her. The father stated that if you have problems with your own child, you cannot just give them up. She didn't really make a strong case for me when she actually decided to grant the interview 2 1/2 years after her son died. Why did it take her so long to speak the apparent truth? She said she blocks out that night of his hurting himself because it hurts her so much. I would, too, if I knew that I had contributed to my child's death!!
