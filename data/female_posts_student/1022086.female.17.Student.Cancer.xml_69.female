I took an already made one and turned it inside out and upside-down. Yeah, I'm not going to be a computer engineer anytime soon.  So, I still have to write up half of the stupid, unfathomable lab. And I've yet to start problems.  I think I'll have to test Thursday morning at 7.30 am instead of in class on Tuesday, as Smith gave us that option... I do believe I'll have to take it.   Here's my favourite Chemistry song (and I relate more than you could imagine):   "Chem 6A" by Switchfoot    Nothing but a chemical in my head It's nothing but laziness Cause I don't wanna read the book I'll watch the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else my age  I think I'd rather play around And I think I'd rather watch TV Cause I don't wanna face my fears I'll watch the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else I'm just like everybody else  Because I don't wanna be here I don't wanna see this now It's all wrong but it's alright And I don't wanna be here And I don't wanna study now It's all wrong but it's alright  I don't know what love is I don't know who I am And if I ever want to find out I'll watch the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else my age  I don't wanna change the world And I don't wanna be someone I don't wanna write the book I'll make the movie Cause it's not me I'm just like everybody else I'm just like everybody else  I don't wanna be here I don't wanna see this now It's all wrong but it's alright And I don't wanna be here And I don't wanna study now It's all wrong but it's alright
