I got hit in the face with a softball on wednesday and thursday... now I have bruises on my nose and on my right cheek. x_x My parents are wondering what type of training I'm going through. n_n;; Anyway, I'm back home! :) The house was so humid that mildew was growing everywhere. Gah. Luckily, you just have to wipe it and it's gone. n_n
