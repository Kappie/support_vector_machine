When the dream is over, I always get out of bed and either shudder in terror or grin stupidly to myself, depending on what the dream was. Sometimes there are the warm fuzzy dreams where I have that perfect job or I'm sitting at a table surrounded by friends and we're all laughing. Those dreams make me want to stay in bed all day and dream the same dream over and over. Other times there are the scary dreams, like the ones where I yell in my dad's face all the things I ever wanted to say to him (something I never did before he died), and I'm glad when I finally wake up. Then there are the dreams that are so obvious in their meaning, so unoriginal and lacking in creativity or substance, that I can't help laughing at my subconscious. This morning I had one of those.  I am stuck on a deserted island, with some raggedy excuse for clothing. I am dirty and cold and sitting on the beach, staring at the waves, when along comes a canoe with a single paddle. It's just floating to the shore, right there in front of me. So I jump in the canoe and start paddling the one paddle with all I've got. But it's going up stream, and almost immediately it's proving to be an impossible task as after only a few minutes my arms are sore and aching. But I manage to go just a little farther, until I see in the distance a red fire truck. As I get closer, I can see the firemen have a ladder extended for me. When I get just close enough I grab the ladder and the firemen pull me in. Rescued!   The firemen were kind and gentle and wanted to know all about my perilous adventure upstream. They gave me grooming supplies: a brush, some clothes, soap to wash off the dirt, and told me they were taking me home. Then I woke up.   To me, this dream is so cliche that I had to write it down, lest I forget how unoriginal my mind can be.
