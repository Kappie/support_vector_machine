It ranks right up there with those trashy dating TV shows (Blind Date, EX-treme Dating, Elimidate - awful but so fun to watch, you know) or easy paperback reads (like anything by John Grisham or any book you can read cover to cover in 2 days or less) or "Saved by the Bell" re-runs (only the high school years - Zach  Kelly's Prom, Jessie's overdose, etc.) or classic 80s music (Devo, Flock of Seagulls, "Mickey," etc.)  Anyway, it is a Delaware political/gossip blog, authored by still unknown person(s).  It's like the  urlLink Delaware Grapevine  on crack.  All the juicy stuff that everyone knows and talks about - but that we know Celia wouldn't print - is on delatacit.  Of course, a lot of it is just crap, and the anonymous comments are cowardly at best, and mainly incoherent at worst.  Ron Williams likes it, which is also quite specious.  And I am probably not helping matters at all by mentioning it, except for the fact that there are only like 2 people out there actually reading this.      Oh well, everyone should be allowed a few guilty pleasures.  It can't all be the New York Times and Shakespeare all the time.
