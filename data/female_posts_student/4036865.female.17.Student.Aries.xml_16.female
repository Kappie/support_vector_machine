Of course they dragged me along shopping, but my stomach wasn't happy with me, and decided i shouldn't be there, so i went home feeling sick. From there on, i laid on the couch and watched tv. Then i decided to do my nails in a new color. Finally i felt good enough to actually get up, and i did my mom's hair for her. My parents left me to go out, so im feeling kinda lonely this evening, have had a lot of time to dwell on things. :( i moped around for a while, then decided to do a 30 minute work out, so now im tired, and somewhat more toned, but still feeling sick. Its not fair. i want someone to take care of me, and make me supper. hmph. So, all in all, its been an alright day, i just wish my tummy thought the same. :S Anywayz, i should get going.
