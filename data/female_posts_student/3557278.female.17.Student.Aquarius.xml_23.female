I couldn't do it last night, i was  too  tired. Yeah i fully don't want to go to school... i have society and culture first, then PDHPE then maths. i only like one of those 3 classes. Actually SAC hasnt been that bad lately, actually doing some work with a vague kind of meaning. Anywho, this essay is hella boring. "Stoppard effectively employs the crime fiction genre to explain the instability..." oh yeah aren't you jealous? mmm i thought so.  Yeah i should really think about doing some more of this essay. I'm listening to 'highway one' by the waifs. i like it :)  i wish i was camping again :(  i should go...
