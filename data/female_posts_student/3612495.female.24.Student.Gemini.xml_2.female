Before the driving, we needed to go and buy the drinks first, also got KFC for our dinner.  Then we drove to there at 20:45, it's cost us for 2 hours to get there, long driving. In the car, I slept for a while, so I missed out the dounut. :-( When we arrived, there are many starts in the sky, beautiful.  In Tim's house, there is a snooker table, cool, long time havent play that, its let me remember the club house of Austin Villa in China. My family holiday house.   On the next morning, I woke up and Gavin bought me to the beach, the water was cold, and I collected some shells from the beach and we saw the dolphins are far far away from us, near to the end of the other sides. So we just seee the small spot going out from the water and back to it. The fishs and chips for lunch are fresh, delicious. For our dinner at RSL, the oysters are cool, and chicken.   On sunday, my driving day. Firstly, drove to golf club to play golf for 9 holes, tired. Then drove around and then just Gavin and me went to RSL for dinner again. It cost me to drive for about 20 mins to get there, and also some cars follow me and opposite way to me. I can felt that how the feeling was when driving on the road, a little bit scare when driving through the roundabout, quite difficult.   On monday, my birthday, we went to Norwe for lunch, the meat pie and chocolate cake. Then on the way back to Sydney, many horse, cow and ostrich in the farm, cool. :-) Then back home to leave the bag. And went to Chinatown for diner, chinese food. I liked it very much. My birthday was happiest, unforgettable for the nice trip and its a good memory in my deep heart.  5月28日，當Gavin放工之後便來接我，去邊？去南邊的地方小遊幾天。我們會去Tim的渡假屋。但出發之前，我們要去買飲品先，同食晚餐，食左肯德雞。 跟著我們在晚上8:45出發，需時2個小時，好長的旅程。在旅途中，我睡著了，所以我錯過了dounut。:-( 但我們到達的時候，天上有萬千顆星星，好靚呀。 係Tim的屋裡面，有枱ball打，我很久没有打過了。這令我回想起我老豆係大陸的渡假屋，係在番禺名苑別墅，環境優美。  第二朝清早，Gavin帶我到沙灘漫步，海水十份冰冷，但海水清澈見底，我還拾了一些漂亮的貝殼，我仲可以見到有海豚在遠處跳出水面呢﹗跟著去買了一些海鮮作為午餐，好味。晚餐就去了一個會所吃，吃了生豪同雞。  星期日，係我的駕車日，Gavin話今日去邊都係我駕車，因為這裡比較少人，所以唔驚。首先，我要駕車去哥爾夫球場，我們在打裡打哥爾夫球，共打了9個洞，好疲倦呀。跟著周圍去下，晚上再駕出市鎮食晚飯，又係去會所食。今次係一個比較長的駕駛，用了大約20分鐘，而且係在公路上，我第一次感受到有車跟著我的感覺。有點驚慌，而且仲要過回旋處，有點難度。  星期一，5月31日係我的生日，我們去了南邊的一個小鎮食午餐，吃了好美味的肉餡餅及朱古力蛋糕。跟著再駕車返悉尼。途中經過很多的農場，有馬、牛同鴕鳥，好得意呀。 :-) 之後回家放低行李後便出了唐人街食晚飯。因為今晚我想食中餐。今年的生日，真的好開心，我永遠都不會忘記這個旅程，它會在我的深心處常常的浮現。
