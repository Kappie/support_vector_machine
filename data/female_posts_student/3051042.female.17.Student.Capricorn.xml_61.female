This is going to be really long, but do please, read on. It will explain a lot of the shit that went on in the past few entries...  Friday, I was obviously a raging lunatic. I got to the school late and bitched out everyone in my path. When I got to my locker, it wouldn't open (because I always get the ghetto locker) so I kicked the shit out of it then slammed my fist only to have it bounce back and open before my eyes. I should get pissed more often, seeing as it opens lockers on command (because I always get the ghetto locker). I flicked a few people off, Keith observed my presence by yelling "Hey, slut!" as I retorted with "FUCK OFF!!" Andrea listen to my ranting spree, and I felt a little better. I decided that I'd change in the hall in front of everyone because they don't care and I couldn't give a flying fuck. Cole walked by and started making weird noised then said, "Strip!!" As I told him, "GO TO HELL!" I then decided that I was going to do every drug in the world that night. "I'm getting SO fucked up tonight. E, Coke, Pot, Alcohol, hell... heroin too. Does anyone have any Oxy-Contin? How about Crack?" Isaac was even scared. He's like, "As long as I'm not the one you're pissed at... all is good, because I'd hate to see what you're going to do to the dude that's to blame." I laughed. At least someone made me smile. Keith's new girlfriend followed him around like a lost puppy, I laughed some more. The concert was fucking great, in my opinion. It was hilarious to see Brian singing. Jeanette was awesome. We won't talk about Sally's "solo." And the fuzzy amp. But Symphonic band was great, and Wind Symphony (this sounds cocky but) we were the SHIT. Plato's was just... Indescribable. It was just sweet. Someone (I can't really remember) told me that I looked upset the entire time. I was actually on the verge of tears. But I got my mind off of the people that were too busy (COUGH henk COUGH COUGH) to show up. He would have fallen asleep anyway.  Friday night was spent being a drunken fool. Josh and I did a shot of vodka, and I shared some Cranberry Vodka cocktail with Mike, I also had a beer or two or three. Woke up Saturday around 5 or 6am with Josh laying on me, decided I should go to my room because I didn't want to make people worried that we did anything.. which we didn't. And the rest is described in previous entries.  After yesterday's events had past I slept, a lot. I sat on my ass for around 16 hours or so. Maybe more. Watching VH1's top 50 worst songs ever. My mom was probably stoned when she stumbled into my room and decided to sleep in my "warm and soft bed." I tried not to kick her when I had my terrible dreams but I didn't really care. I woke up and she was gone... then I got an instant message from Donald about my weekend and how I needed to get him coffee. I decided a few more hours of ass-sitting laziness would be good. But then I got an instant message from Keehn. He basically apologized for the things said and done on Friday. No apology yet from my brother. I can't get a hold of him to know when Mike and April are coming home (her car is still outside my house). After the conversation I became active enough to stop being a depressed, lazy bastard; so I got off my ass and went for a drive. I couldn't stop smiling. I almost went to church, but they don't have a service at noon-thirty. Plus, I thought it would be best if I didn't listen to sermons for an hour or so. I drove to Penisular Park and wrote more to the script. I can't think of a name for it, but it's all good. It will come with time.  I randomly went to Michelle's house afterward, to see if she wanted to have some Starbucks for coffee talk of our evenings / mornings. She went to William's last night for a bit then went over to Chloe and Kevin's place for fun with alcohol. We went to Old Navy for shopping and then to Pinball Pete's for our DDR workout program. I think we played 14 games or something. Went to Middle Earth and Starbucks to finish off the "Nick Sushi  Starbucks Raincheck Project." Then went back to PP for pool. Lots of fun. Now I'm exhausted tho. I've got homework to do, and cleaning of room. I have to go through all of my clothing and figure out what I'm getting rid of and where everything needs to be.   Tomorrow I've got school and work as usual. I have to talk to my mom about changing my hours around. This summer is going to be strange. I think I might work two jobs, that or quit Provide.Net to work somewhere else. We'll see...  All is well, and I'm alright.
