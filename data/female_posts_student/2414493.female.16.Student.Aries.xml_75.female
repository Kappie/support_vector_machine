First made a detour onto the street with the "Sunnyhill" sign and ended up on Cresthaven. Drove down Westlake and followed the road until I decided it was stupid to go on. All the while, the fog was literally rolling in against the car and I could see it in waves. I even missed a stop sign at Kanan and I hoped to God a police car wasn't nearby. A funny mission, no less. I take these things too seriously, and it's probably better that I stop fueling my crazy reveries. Remember how all I wanted to do spring of freshman year was to round the back of the poolhouse...  Backing out of the parking lot, I feared I'd run something over. M said something about a knee. And the car wasn't going right. I was scared. And then I realized the rigidity wasn't a knee but the parking brake.  Worked the concession stand tonight at the game with Mr. and Mrs. M. My first taste of real, real suburbia. Or PTSA family, etc. I despise those ideals. I return at 5:45 from Wendy's, get N's message that J's not going to be in to toss salads until 6:15 because "dude, you don't need an hour to do a salad." Waiting for J, Mrs. M and Mrs. D take over. I try to make myself somewhat useful, but all I get around to doing is making like I don't know anything. They commandeer the booth and change the prices, at which I took offense. They were right in the end, though, so no hard feelings. I didn't like their stereotypical-ness at the beginning, but in the end, I'm a believer? (that QUESTION MARK was just for you, S). They talk about "OH! I met you at the gym!" Mrs. M sways and moves her feet in time to R They ask me where I want to go to college. "Harvard," I reply with my USD shirt on. "OH! like RM!" Softball girl.  But they are good people. Mr. M talked about college, mostly, when conversation didn't have to deal with "How much are the nachos?" Guarded the pizza from the Mob Squad, still showing off their garrulous championship rings. Kept the $20s in his back pocket. Meanwhile, J--concession booth chair--is sitting at the scorer table with N. But I did say that I didn't want to watch the game. Nacho cheese sauce, by the way, smells like something from a physio dissection lab.  Sometimes, I just wish I had parents like that. Parents who I wouldn't be ashamed to show off (would I send mom's anatomy letter to Mrs. B? not on my life). Parents who would want to get involved. PTA mommies. I was such a total misfit, and it was curious. Hi J, hi N, hi C, R, how's your grandma? And who are you? A virtual nobody. I like it though. But it also means having to prove yourself all over to someone new, having to keep a straight face and do whatever they say. Subservience works.  And maybe, underneath it all, T is right about C. "Did you want a ride home?" I hate it, though. I can't sustain such an annoying propensity for subscribing, shall we say, so easily. And it's embarrassing how quickly I can move, though thankfully it's mostly mental work and doesn't escape past my mind.  It's funny how this blog becomes allegorical once in a while.  And sometimes I wish that they would say that it was all ok, that they didn't mean it and they'd want to do something to make it up. There'd be more laughter to follow, more inexplicable, lovely things. Something to make me want to wake up every morning smiling and staying happy until I went to bed at night. But I don't know, is this really what I want? Or am I stronger the way I am now, reminded constantly that this is the way it's supposed to be? Did they really mean what they said? Or was it something else?  There are so many people so dear to me. Too many people. And it isn't right to starve for them.   Eat up on the independence, Lydia.
