I was invited to hang out with all of the boys, but my friend S was sort of "uninvited," and so I don't know if I should go. Hard to say, but I definitely don't want to sit around and pick my nose on the 4th of July (one of my favorite holidays, second to my birthday and New Year's). Anyway...I've been putting off getting ready for my move because I freakin' don't want to go. I'm not ready! I'm scared to go back East. My life is here. I can't believe I didn't have the foresight to understand that maybe I would love it here and want to stay. Ugh. Oh well, nothing wrong with change...but I wish I could stay where I like things. Well, a change will do me good! I'm just babbling now. Nothing to say. Just relaxing...thank you, Calendar God, for putting the 4th on a Thursday! Loooooong weekend!
