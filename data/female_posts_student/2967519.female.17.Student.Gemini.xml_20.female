Im not good with needles and machines and all that. my sisters birthday was saterday and my mom invited Tawnie and Christy who have hunter whos 2 and Siera whos 3. Well Bri and i were dubbed babysitters so the adults could smoke and talk without distractions and the other kids didnt have to be bothered by the little ones. Im so sore still from throwing those two on the trampoline over and over! lol it was fun tho,kids say the darndest things! Okay i need to go take a shower before Tawnie gets here to take me to my appointment, have a great day!
