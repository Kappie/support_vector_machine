I heard it was so ghetto and all but I actually liked it alot. Altho there wasnt many HOT looking guys. To me they were all HongKongnees boyz... Here and there I would get holla at but you know me, I dont dance with strangers @ clubs. I had to use stupid lame ass excuse  for the guys to get off my back. Such as my boyfriend is here or I am married. One dude was so disappointed he beg me to say goodbye to him three times before the left.   Partying with the girls was really awesome. The camera man kept taking pictures of us. God knows how many time but oh well. The photographer said that he loved our smiles and couldnt get enough and also enter me in a beauty pageant. Wow!!! ME? Beauty Pageant??? I dont know about that. Overall it was an amazing night. Oh not to mention we met E-A-SKI, a group of  rape singers from Oakland.   By two, none of us wanted to go home so we all decided to go to 1015, drop and I was so fuckin high. Dude I was farting like crazy, it was one hell of a stank bomb. Didnt get home until 4:30 am. I wasnt tired at all. Funny of me, I am still peeking but I am doing homework  watching music box. I must admit that I can study better while I'm still high... What a trip huh.  Gosh, I only drop half but i'm still feeling it right now. It feels so relaxing. Humm, what should I talk about? I know lets talk about college of cosmetology!!! My second week have just pasted, I'm having so much fun, so far I am doing really well. Practical and written. The boss really like my work alot. He's got a job offer for me already in Vacaville, $3000 a month and thats not including tips. That's not I'm interested in tho. What i'm interested in is Traveling. Yep, I want to travel to do people's nails. Sounds like fun huh? I'm looking forward into making "BIG MONEY". We have testes every week, so far I'm getting B's but B's isnt what I'm aiming for. I want an "A", I want everything 100%. B isnt so bad but I'm not satisfied, I have very high tolerance.   Every one of my friends tell me that I have a very high confident self esteem in me for doing what i've been wanting to do. Yeah, thats me. If I want it then I would go for it. If I dont want it you cant force me. Everything has to be my way or no way at all. That's SAKDARY. Better recognize fool... lol...  Six am and i'm still up not even tired fuck. Chewing gum like I never had gum before. Sucking on my finger like a fuckin baby sucking on a pacifier. Inhaling vicks vaporade like a dofin. Drinking water like I have never had water before.   A Cinderella Story= Hillary Duff is so fine, "Our lips are sealed" is such a great song. I love it.  Damn the sun is up and I havent gotten any sleep yet. Tho I am not tired hopefully later on I will be. Alrite ya, I'm going to return to studying and bobbing my head to the music and sniffing vaporade. Ha ha ha lol.. Sakdary is such a fucken E-Tard....
