Her father was there for the delivery, who would have guessed?    For those of you who know about Katie, she's doing well, recovering consciousness every so often, enough to open her eyes but not to speak.  If you don't know about Katie, I'll post it later, cause I'm in kind of a hurry now.  Megan is getting married to Blake in October.  It's official, and it officially sucks.  Baby's still doing well as far as we know, which isn't much, but she's told us she will not be returning home.
