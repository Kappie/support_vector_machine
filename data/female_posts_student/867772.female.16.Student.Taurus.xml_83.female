On the way there, I heared the song "Don't Want to Miss a Thing" by Arerosmith. The song just ended as we got to the office.  I heared the song again on the way home from the doctor's.  I returned home with a new peice of news; I had Leukemia, and had 10 months to live.  I told Joyce, Nina, and Cassie on the bus the next morning, but couldn't keep from laughing when I saw the looks on their faces. They didn't believe me, until I passed out in chorus and had to go home early from school. They went to my house to see me after they got off the bus, but i was lying in bed staring at the wall. I wouldn't talk to anyone. I stayed like this for about a week, until Someone I Wasn't Expecting came to visit me and talked to me. He got me to understand that I needed to spend the time I had left having fun, and spending time with the people who might actually miss me.  I was ready to die, that's the weird part. The reason I was so zoned out was not because I couldn't get over the fact that I was dying, but that I was O.K. with it, and ready to die. I felt it when I woke up from the dream, though. Not just in the dream.  I used this readiness and new advice to start my new, 10-month-long life.  I sold everything I owned and donated the money to some kind of charity.  I forgave anyone I was ever ever mad at.  I conviced someone to fuck with the NFL and made them let me in as wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys when they played a game against the New England Patriots, and we kicked Pat ass.  I apologized to every single everyone I ever did anything at all mean to in any way ever at all. There's a sentence for ya.  I told all my teachers that because I would be dying in 10 months anyway, I didn't see the point, so I stopped doing my homework (I like that part.)  I had a Halloween Party, something I think I've talked about all fifteen years of my life but never got around to following through with.  I spent time with a certain somebody I dislike not spending time with.  I visited my everyone. Anyone I loved and hadn't seen in more than a month.  I even let myself cry a few times.  The last thing I saw before I died was a Friends episode in the hospital, and I hate Friends.  I was happy when I died.  It makes me wonder.   Don't worry that doesn't mean I'm feeling especially suicidal (at this moment, anyway.)  But... I could feel what I was feeling in my dream. I knew I had a certain amount of time left; an exact limit on my life. And I spent it not worrying about a damn thing except having fun, and giving EVERYTHING I had to help people.  And I was happy when I died.
