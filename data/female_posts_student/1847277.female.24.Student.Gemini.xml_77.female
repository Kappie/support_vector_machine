I realized yesterday that I had only actually seen one of the Season 1 episodes, so they were all new to me, but I'm fairly sure I saw all the eps last season.  Ugh.  It's become my new obsession.  Since college football season is essentially over, I have no reason to check out ESPN.com in the morning, so instead I go to Alias message boards to look for spoilers.  So lame.    Hmm.
