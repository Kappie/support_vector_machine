And I'm not that worried about war anymore. Well I am, I'm worried for all those soliders out there who could get killed at any moment. You see I figure why worry about it if we can't do anything directly? Its gonna happen, just hope its over with asap. I wouldn't worry too much anyway, the Iraq army would fold under the British and American. I probbaly sound quite 'oh I don;t care' but I do, I do care alot about this situation but there isn't anything I can do!!!!!! I wnat to but there isn't anything.   How are you all?  Very well thanks!  Have you all got your stuff for the ball?  I have my dress but that's it.  And are you looking forward to Natalies and Darrens party?  I'm not going but I hope ya'll have a great time!  And is it just me or are you finding it hard to motivate yourself to do the work set and coursework and stuff, i find it soo boring and i just feel like: Whats the point ! But maybe thats just me being lazy ! LOL   I totally agree!!!!!!!!!
