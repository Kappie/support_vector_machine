My life isn't the most exciting thing in the world so don't plan to be glued to your seat reading. :D So I'll summarize what's going on with me. For lil more than 2 weeks I have to go to summer school. It started last Tuesday and ends next Wednesday. Its not that bad. The people are ok and it does get me up in the mornings. I usually sleep late during the summer and I don't like sleeping late sometimes. Miss too much during the day. Anyways lets see. Yesterday Me and my friends met at Shoprite cause our friend Cat(that's what we call her) just started working there and she wanted us to visit and see her bag our stuff lol. Yea she's a bagger. I might work there too I'll have to see. Two of my other friends are applying there too but that and my ex is working there sort of makes me not want to. Sometimes I don't like to go with the crowd. But I guess I'll put in an application and see what happens. So anyway we walked there and tried not to make a scence in the store. Me and Ange took some free cookies and Jamie and Sharon were like whaa? Lol, we acted like such good adults lol thatz hard for Jamie. :P Then went to the check out lane. I bought some cat food and batteries lol. My friend Ange bought some clips. Jamie and Sharon were there two but they broke lol. Sharon has a job at The Lake but she doesn't want to spend her money. When I was getting my bags from Cat and ange was paying for her stuff Jamie just like jumps up to cat and is like HEY GHETTOLICOUS! Lol I was like OMG and Cat looked all embrassed. Jamie is just like what? Lol, So after that we all went home (Ange had to get her hair cut) and then Ange came back over and left at like midnight. It was funny. Lots of fun with the friends even though it didnt seem it. One of those had to be there. :P So anyways went to summer school this morning, nothing too big happened. Now I'm just sitting here with it raining outside and my mix CD going. I'm getting tired lol. So Jamie might get her second holes done today and I might go. That should be fun. :P So, I think that's it for now. Check ya later.
