You see, in my dream, I was with this one guy, and we were both like really hating life..and it was just a really really dark dream. Very sad. So we ended up locking ourselves up in this one place...in this room that didnt have any windows. For a very long time. Like weeks and weeks. And the whole time i just sat there going through fits. I was just going crazy. I had no sunlight, and no one to help me. He left alot...he was quite into the drugs, and need his fix rather often. So it ended up mostly being just me. Completely alone in a small dark room going crazy. I was so hurt emotionally, so depressed that I couldn't even imagine living. After several weeks, I left. I came back out to the world, I guess you could say. But the sad thing was, I felt so lost. Life didn't just brighten up as I'd hoped it would. I felt just as helpless as I had all alone. And it ended kinda happy-like. Except for one thing.   I   wasn't happy. I mean, talk about a dark dream. It had this message that life is hopeless. Funny thing is, I woke up in a good mood this morning. But I think that's because my room was really warm, and it just felt so nice to wake up to.  Yeah, so...today will be good. Because if I wake up in a good mood, then it has to be good. It's the rules.  Well, not much else to say. Au revoir crazies.
