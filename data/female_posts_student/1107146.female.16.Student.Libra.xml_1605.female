I'm a junior, and I'm homeschooled. I think cats own dogs, I have two cats one of which is 20+ lbs and one that is a normal healthy size. We have one dog who is 14+ years old and it wasn't my decision to get him. He's a decent dog though :p  I have one sister, all my grandparents are alive except my dad's mom. Right now my dad's father has been in and out of the hospital, been diagnosed with allzheimers and has been moved to assisted living within the last two months. Someone has to go see him every day, but he's about 5 min away from us. Anywho, I guess that along with school is occupying most of my life at the moment. Oh yah my AIM is weezymidget and msn is weezymidget@hotmail.com for anyone that cares :p
