During the lunch, I more or less invited myself to join her on a shopping trip for business attire for her new job in Tokyo.  We had a great time; I was her "personal shopper" and as she tried on the clothes, I ran around the store picking out other items that I thought would be appropriate for her.   Many of them were.  When asked by the checkout girl which sales associate had helped her, M. responded, "My friend, L.!"  I asked for the commission on the spot. :-)  We ended up wrapping up the trip a mere 3 hours later.  I returned back to rez to find a letter from SMC.  They're giving me $3100 towards my tuition.  I'm a little surprised, to be honest.  I had been told it would cover my whole tuition but obviously we're just over 60% of the way there.  On further reflection, with this and the SSND bursary I have all but $98 covered.  OSAP will therefore deduct $5100 from my loan.  Tonight, I did some calculations; those generous folks gave me $200 for my food for eight months.   I am now reconsidering whether to apply to the other bursaries or not, though; I will only be eligible for the BSWD if I have OSAP.  The BSWD will cover 100% of my disability related equipment expenses.  If I don't have OSAP, I will need to apply to the ADP and they will cover only 75% of the expenses.  I sure as heck can't afford to pay 25% of those costs, so I might as well stop worrying about the other bursaries.  I'll do some more math with a fresh head tomorrow.  One more surprise: the CNIB called and want to set a date for my low vision assessment.  This is great; if it happens in August I will be much more enabled to tackle school in September.  Well, things move slowly; I might not have my equipment yet but at least the ball will be rolling.  More to come...
