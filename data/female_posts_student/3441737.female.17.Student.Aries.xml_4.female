My father came here for an education and stayed for my mother. I been to visit my family in Nigeria, and they've come to visit us. My father has made certain that his culture is a big part of his children's lives, and I'm grateful for that. So that's the abridged version of my Nigerian heritage, but the full out version is much more interesting.
