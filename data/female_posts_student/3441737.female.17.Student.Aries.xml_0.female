Crying, desperate, fighting questions scared to let go... but the days go by and things get better. I'm weary from the war, I'm losing half my soul...but the days go by and. Past the point of reasons I just want you to believe that it's not your fault... photographs, the close up, what we had come undone. Where did it all go wrong... but the days go by and things get better. You hardened like a stone to face the world alone...but the days go by and things get better. Exhausted of apologies, in search of something comforting...but the days go by and... JCC
