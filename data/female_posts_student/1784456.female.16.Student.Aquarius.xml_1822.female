I kinda like it like this. Uhh where'd the photo thing come from? Oh yeah... meaningful post meaningful post. Not one full of butterflies and strawberry flavoured apples? Oh. Shame. What about my 'long term relationship'? Nope, that would be too sweet and I would babble for aggeeees. Okay, point: Do you think people know who you are better than you know? Like when you're mean or something and it's completely unexpected to you but the pschoanalyist in the corner knows why you just released your angry rage on that person at that time? And habits, but I guess they're accepted by your brain as normal and not to be analysed. But how do they become habits in the first place? And psychiatrists... they seem to know some people better than they know themselves. Or is that just through learning and knowledge?   Ok pointless babble over. Now to find a picture of my room colour.
