We're talking the ref said he was going to walk off and let the two teams play the second half without a ref.   I played for the other team, whichI thought was a good decision...they needed a girl and I didn't want to get hurt playing against them.The teamwas an interesting mix, one other girl, and about a 50/50 split of white and jamaican guys. The other girls didn't want to go to the other team because the Jamaicans were notorious for not passing the ball to girls. I said I'd go though, I didn't really know anybody on either team, and I figured I'd get more exercise since they had no subs. I didn't realize that I would be in for such a treat!  I found it refreshing; There was only one person who refused to pass me the ball, and his teammates - all of them - kept yelling at him for it. All the rest of them recognized that I could play, and were comfortable giving me the ball and working with me. And they appreciated having another girl. The Jamaicans played a very different style, more like indoor, where you move in and out of your position freely. I enjoyed it, even if it did leave for lots of breakaways for the other team when everyone went up (the Americans on the team were pretty stuck in their spots).   Anyway,it was a beautiful day, andit isrefreshing to play on a big outdoor field and to be able to rely a little more on space than on footwork. I really hope I can find a team to play on in St Louis.
