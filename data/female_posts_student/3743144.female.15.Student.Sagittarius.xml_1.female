I was a bit colser to getting over u, but as soon as I think I many lose u more than I already have...especially to my best friend - the one I'm most jealous of cuz she had the best of u...my feelings for u begin to show their true colors and the tears begin to fall harder than before, hurting me more than they ever have I know u don't feel the same about me and u probably never will so why won't these feelings for u disappear?? I want them to leave me more than ever so I can finally go on with my life...so I can finally be happy w/out u or any guy making me feel that way...cuz it seems I'm only happy if I'm with the guy I may be in love with...and I don't want that b/c it hurts so much afterwards...  so why couldn't u just take her bak? why did u have to appeal to my heart? why did u have to feel the same about me as I did u? why did u have to be so great to me? cuz if none of this happened I'd be able live my life w/out shedding a tear in my heart whenever I think of you... omg...i'm just like you...which hurts more b/c it show that we could've been perfect for eachother....so let me ask u one more thing.... why couldn't u love me like u loved her?
