Nothing's ever what it seems. In ur life or in ur dreams. It doesnt make sense what can u do. So I wont try making sense of u."       I've came to the conclusion that life totally suCks.  I'm tiired of basically anything and everything in my life.    ok.. now that that's outta the way... heh      Lets see, what did i do today. Basically nothing. I went to KroGer to find out if i worked today. I coulda swore i was supposed too, but on my lil peice of paper that i write down my scheduale, it said i didn't. So i figured i would play it safe and go look. I came back home... did nothing for about another 2 hrs and then went over to my Maw's house. Hadn't been over there in a LONG time.  I took her a pic from my prom. Just felt like it i guess. I only stayed over there for like 45 minutes, it was quite boring and such.  So i came back home, and i've sat here ever since.       The Marion Star wrote me another email today. I guess i gotta set up this meetin pronto and see whats goin on. Hopefully they pay me good cause i kiinda need the money. Kinda? Hell, i need the money bad. I'm not gonna go into details cause its really no bodys business but mine...      Moms surgery is gettin closer and closer. Niice huh? She asked me today if i had told anybody about it.. i said no.. but i guess i coulda told her i told the whole internet. Eh well.       Ok, break down time... i miss Marcus like crazy. There i said it.      Have u ever had one of those days where u just wanna sit and cry.. and cry... and listen to music that wants to make u cry even more? Today is my day. Yea i kno "whine whine whine" but seriously, i hardly ever do this anymore or feel this way anymore.       Sitting here thinking    Not even blinking   Thinking blank ryhmes   Thinking bout time   Why'd u leave   Why do i plea   I miss you so much   i miss your touch   Think without reason   Its never the right season   i love my friiends   where will it end   i love you   What did u do   i begged you to stay   But u left anyway   I think...    i sink..   i live on.   -Me
