I know it may sound stupid, but it has already wasted 15 minutes of my life.. I need to find something to do. Maybe I should write a book. Hmm, but what would I write about....? Maybe I could write a book about my life.. or uhh.. Ok, forget that. I could... read.. something. nahhh.. OMG I just found out that Ronald Reagan (however you spell it) passed away. I can't believe it. :'(... He did a lot for this country.. Even tho i am not too sure what those things were. But he will be missed.  Now back to what I should do.. Oh and I need money, other than my mom's. Maybe I should get a job.. something that makes a lot of money.. fast. This may be more difficult than I thought. I may work the rest of this summer out at my graddad's restaurant. I have done that before.. when I was in 2nd grade. Wow, this may work out. ($$$) I still haven't thought of anything to do. I don't want to get out cause I still don't feel good and I don't think my mom would let me go anywhere. I guess I will just watch game 1 of the finals. It's the Pistons and Lakers. All I have say is.. Lakers suck big ones. So I guess I am not going for either teams.. but I want the Pistons to beat the Lakers. Oh crap.. I guess I am going for the Pistons... Ariana's birthday is in 4 days, so is Laurens.. And Uriah's birthday is Tuesday. Too many birthdays. I have written a lot. Woah and it has spent some of my time. This is brillant! lol
