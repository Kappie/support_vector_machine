This world itself has experienced many tragedies and joys since the beginning of Time.  This world itself is heaven and hell.  I do not believe in Paradise or Hell.  Who knows, perhaps we are here right now.  There is nothing to look forward to.  The cycle of Life.  Your soul leaves your body when you die.  It enter your body when you are born.  Thus, I quote Margaret Craven from I Heard The Owl Call My Name:  " Past the village flowed the river, like time, like life itslef, waiting for the swimmer to come again on his way to the climax of his adventurous life, and to the end for which he has been made."
