Yeah, I saw Pam and Dennis (for those of you who have NO idea who I'm talking about, Pam and Dennis Hickey were my Senior High Youth Group sponsors, and are like a second set of parents to me... though no one could replace the set I've got!)  They were incredibly shocked I was there.  Pam asked about the whole "Cam" situation, which I told her about.  Both took a good look at my tattoo, they asked about Jamey, and were shocked when I told them about how I quit working at Crestview Baptist Child Care.  Anyhow, so, the sermon was about the difficulty of giving love.  Um, well, anyhow, not much else happened, besides my getting to see Camryn Orr.  She is SUCH a cute baby.  She's about a year old, and she is such a social baby.  She loves to be passed around from person to person.  Very sweet, and loves singing (she was baby-singing with us anytime we'd sing during the service).  Okay, after church we all came home (my parents and I) and ate some food.  Then, we all crashed out for awhile.  This just proves that there's nothing better to do on a rainy day than nap.  :-)  So, now, I return to my slumber.
