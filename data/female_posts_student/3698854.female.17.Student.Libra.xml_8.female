Trials are over, however my ex2 eng piece is due in next week...as too is my drama group and IP... as i know drama will def count towards UAI i must work on it, also the fact that it is group and i dont wanna let them down. Ex2 probably wont count but i've put soo much time and thought into it... i WANT to do it, wells neways it was supposed 2 be due on Wednesday and i was thinking, maybe on Monday night after drama i could work on it, also mum said to take the day off on Tuesday to finish it./... now miss tells me it is DUE on Tuesday.. I want to do it, hella i feel like crying coz i love english and my teacher seemed really angry but worse, disappointed.... i mean i can handle anger, but not disappointment.       I am scared i will ruin our group piece for drama! I dont think i am up for it and i talk too fast and have a lisp and i dont want people to know that! I mean its really bad and i hate it. i dont even read aloud in public anymore it is that bad. its awful, just like the rest of me. i wish i didnt have to do this at all. I am so stressed out about it. We saw the de la ones tonight and they are really good, i dont know how ours will compare.     Worse of all...i finally had an opportunity i had been waiting for, and i botched it... twice today. TWICE, and i botched it. What a loser. The biggest loser in the world.       "remember when i was in the grocery store, now's my time, lost the words, lost the nerve, lost the girl, left the line, i would wish upon a star but that star it doesn't shine, so read my book with a boring ending, a short story of a lonely guy"    That is my destiny, to be a loser and a loner. I wait for that one moment, i wait and i miss it, gone. Lost the words, lost the nerve. I am so cranky at myself. i wish...     The stars dont shine for me, i am bathed in darkness all my life. Always and forever....eternity
