That's one of the insults we learned.  Hmmm, yeah, well, you're only taking me (Lindsey) and Abby tomorrow.  She has left over cookies in return for the ride.  They are VERY good.  Gaddis said Abby was his hero, and Romeo said she was the Messiah.  Yeah, like we didn't already know that.  Anyway, I'm sure Rosie appreciates the directions, given that she's NEVER on the blog anymore, nor is anyone else for that matter.  It's now the Lindsey-Josh-Abby website.  *Sigh*  Sadness (stolen from Abby, very sorry)
