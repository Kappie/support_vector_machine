I don't think I explained much about how me and him... "got together" I suppose.  urlLink E-Spin the Bottle  started it all. Last summer I was babysitting for my cousins and was terribly bored, being stuck in the house all-frigan-day I went to every site I possibly could to fill my time. And I think that's how I met him. Oooo... Lets see if I can find the first thing I sent him. *waits* Heh. I was basically wanting to scare him off... So anyway. Here it is:    Subject:  Date:  Message:      Hello hello!   Jun 25 2003 3:47PM  YAY! A Mutual Match! Happy happy! SING FOR THIS IS TRULY A JOYOUS DAY!   OK that's enuf of that.   Hi. My name is Sage and "greasewheel" is an anagram for my real name. If you don't know what anagram is, I don't either, so don't ask me. I'm going to my cousins for July in the summer and I'm running away from all my problems in Rural-Town-Canada. lol, it would be funny if it wasn't so true. lol. (I'm that annoying person who can't tell any good jokes and still has the nerve to laugh at all of mine) lol. See what I mean?   So.... I really have absolutly no way to start this conversation...   OH! I KNOW I KNOW! What is your favorite way to start a conversation?   Peace  Sage   PS: If I didn't scare you off with this one, you're one tough cookie.      And thus, his reply:      Subject:  Date:  Message:      Hello hello!   Jun 25 2003 10:02PM  YOU, My friend are the most interesting person i've met for a long time and i'd love to continue further conversations with you if you have it i'd suggest adding me to msn my adress is "(lalalala)" i'll talk to you there   later days   Erich   So anyway, that's how it all started, but I think it was awhile before we actually talked. I know we were talking by November... Probably late October is when we first started talking.  Anyway, that's about it.   Shit. This empty feeling sucks when he's not around. Well, as around as he can be. I get all worried and nervous and now just... I'm questioning everything.  Especially now. Why now anyway?   *smiles* But then, that has nothing to do with loving him. Only with him loving me back. Doesn't seem like such a happy thought. But it is. I can reaffirm that I am in love with the simple thought of being near him.   Sage
