Sure, there were ups, but there were far too many downs.  Some of those downs gave me pause to really think about life and where I'm heading, so they were not always pleasant but not always fruitless either.   I can't help but reflect on people who were with me a year ago and who are not here today.   urlLink Fr. Pat  is first and foremost in my mind.  S. Jeannette is there also.  I'm sad that I'll never again hear  urlLink Fr. Ed  "forget" my name but remember to call me "Miss Musicology" in his gravelly Indiana drawl.  I'm grateful for the friendships that I made this year and for those that were forged even more deeply.  I'm particularly thankful for the friends and family who stood by me in the rough times, and there were many of those this year.  So, knowing that I have a wonderful family and so many supportive friends behind me, I face this year with little trepidation and considerable excitement for what lies ahead, though I can see it not clearly from where I stand.  Happy Birthday wishes to others: Gloria Reuben is 40 today. Johnny Depp is 41.  Michael J. Fox is 43.  Blair Caddel is 27.  More to come...   Fifty years ago today, in one of the most dramatic confrontations of the Senate-Army Hearings, Army special counsel Joseph N. Welch denounced Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's attack on a member of Welch's law firm, Frederick G. Fisher. Said Welch to McCarthy: "Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?"    urlLink     urlLink
