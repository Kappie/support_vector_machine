I hav to buy my own dinner, which i didnt cuz im too lazy to go down again, so i cooked it.  It consists of normal noodles and ikan bilis. So i'll probably get hungry again. Well, too bad, i'd have to fill my stomach up with cereal. Blueberry.  Says on the box that it contains fibre so u'll feel fuller easily and that'll stop u from eating more [and making urself fat]  its over 7pm, so dont blame me for being lazy..  oh, and sumone reflected that my last post was not me, so i deleted it.
