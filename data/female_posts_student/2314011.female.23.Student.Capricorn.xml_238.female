And today, the unofficial first day of summer, finds us at the one year mark of a trip out of legends.  But first, a bit of backstory, as usual.    It's no secret that the Boy and I love Seattle.  It was our first city we fell in love with together and each trip to the end of I-5 has marked a very important and identifiable point in our lives.    The maiden trip at the end of May 2001 encapsulated life at that point perfectly.  We were finishing up our sophomore years of college, the Boy had made a life-changing and major-shifting decision to follow his heart to Graphic Design, I had hit a magnificent stride in my journalistic endeavors, and we were together in the big city, ready to gay it up like never before.  Well, as much as we could without being able to visit any bars, of course.     We thought we could channel some of that wonderfully sunny energy to our visit in January of 2002.  The world had changed while we'd been away and so had we.  I found myself still in the throws of self-doubt and confusion about my place in the universe, but hoped a 10-day stretch in the Emerald City with the Boy would help.  It did, and there were many an adventure had during our stay, but I appreciated them only after the Spring Semester began.    Six months later, the world was looking much brighter as we made our way back for our first ever Pride celebration.  It was also the first meeting of the two most important people in my life.  I spent the weeks leading up to the vacation worried, excited and in awe of the fact that Lorraine and Levi would be meeting.  I needn't have worried.  They got along famously and the trip was spectacularly epic in every way.    I reprised the winter visit again in December of 2002 for my first Tori concert, but since it was made sans the Boy, who was across the Atlantic at the time, it will only get a passing mention here.    And at last, we come to the famous visit of June 2003.  Freshly graduated and trying to avoid a fate at the UI Library, I made my way to the coast, armed with resumes and writing samples to see what I could see.  I'd been on the law school waiting list since April and had decided to stop thinking about that possibility and focus on what new opportunities may be staring me in the face.  What better place to start than the city I hope to eventually reside?  Had just started "The Artist's Way", morning pages were still in their infancy and yoga had not yet occurred to me.  This was also the first time I'd seen Levi since our farewell in a London train station in January.    Last year at this time found us at the Wild Rose, drinking (my first) beers and talking big talks.  The next four days were the most glorious we'd ever spent in the city, literally and metaphorically.  The sun was up at 8 every morning and Seattle's infamous clouds and drizzle were off playing somewhere else.  Managed to get the first tan of the summer on that trip.  As each day came and went, with more and more offices visited and left with my materials on desks, the signs mounted.  Every little thing was momentous.  Of course, I can only remember a scant few now, but I remember there being more than a handful at the time.    Like the clear skies all day every day.  Like people-watching and writing three long, lazy pages in our coffee shop on Broadway.  Like seeing God in that coffee shop, at our table, two days later.  Like buying the Michael Chabon-edited edition of McSweeney's at the Bailey Coy Bookstore.  Like meeting a girl named Josephine at the Rose (what else would her name be?).  Like driving around the city listening to the Summer Mix because it was the only CD player we could both listen to.  Like listening to the Boy gasp as he heard "Hollywood" for the first time.  Like reading this horoscope from the latest "Stranger" the morning of the last day:  "'History is made out of the failures and heroism of each insignificant moment.' This observation by the writer Franz Kafka has special significance for you right now, Capricorn.  Every little action you take will have unimaginable weight, and the cumulative effect of your many little actions may alter conditions you'd assumed were impervious to change.  Even your passing thoughts and idle fantasies will have more influence than usual to shape your future.  Until June 20, there will be no such thing as a trivial detail for you.  My advice?  Act as if each moment is a promise of the life you want to be living next October."      I still have yet to figure out how my traipsing off to Seattle to find a job promised a life in the law school basement, but I'll take it at its word.    And now that summer's here, I can't wait to get back and dive into whatever new adventure the city's holding for us.  It's the one thing I have no problem giving over to the universe to do with us what it will; there's just something in the air in Seattle.
