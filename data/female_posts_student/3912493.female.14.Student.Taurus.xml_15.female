But if I happen to suck, I promise that I'll suck in a whole new and exciting way. -me   So today was the first day of my high school life. Uh, not so bad, I guess. I got there and I talked to Sasha. When school started I saw Veronica-san and I followed her to Portable 1, 'cause that's where I had to go for my homeroom and get all the crap that they were gonna give me. How utterly annoying. So I went there. I only had a notebook, one pencil, one eraser, and a permanent marker. People were carrying around backpacks and other crap, but whatever. They're not gonna give us the books today, f00s. ;P  The teacher gave me my schedule and I quickly looked at it. Since I'm stuck here in my house instead of being at the marching band stuff, I'll post my block schedule:  1)  Freshman I Band ; Mr. Brandon  (hehe, might change...) 2) World Geography ; Ms. Dias-Schindle 3) Bussiness Computer I ; Mr. Williams (no, some other Mr. Williams) 4) Pre-Ap English 1 ; Ms. Smith 5) [1st Semester] Health ; Mr. Moore, B 5) [2nd Semester] Speech ; Mr. Duncan 6) Bioligy 1 ; ? Bentley 7) Geometry Pre-AP ; ? Hanes (oh no...where's Ms. Fritz?! ;_;) 8) French 2 ; Mr. Adam  I have like 4 classes with Sally-san, two classes with Michelle-chan, about three classes with Yaqui-chan and only one class with Michael-kun. (all of them counting Band except Mikey). Wait...someone's missing... Gasp, yes, indeed, So-Young's missing... ;_;! This majorly sucks... Sigh.  After that we had an assembly at the A Gym. Y'know, this highschool might look big, but it actually isn't. I even think Reed's even bigger than this stupid NGS (Ninth Grade School, for those ignorant folks out there). Oh well, can't complain. While in the assembly, I saw Ms. Adams. Holy crap! Ms. Adams used to teach 8th grade Math back in Reed Middle School (best school ever!). I saw another RMS teacher but I don't know his name, so whatever.  After the assembly we went to first block. Band. I was hoping that today I'd get a reply from Mr. Williams, but I didn't. Fug...how am I supposed to live like this?! I feel that my life is so unorganized because I'm not sure if I'm in band or not. Tomorrow I'll talk to Mr. Brandon about my situation, but I'm gonna feel a little uncomfortable since I don't know him. Oh whatever, it's time to step up and stop being a stupid coward. I need to take care of my darn bussiness. I can't change my schedule until next week, but I already e-mailed Mr. Williams, so that's taken care of. I wonder if he even read the stupid thing. Pfft...  Today at 6.15 the band folks were gonna have a practice until 8.45 PM. Guessed it, I didn't go. I don't wanna go to any marching crap until I receive an answer from SOMEONE. I feel so desperate. I'm scared to go because I'll feel out of place...not knowing what to do and stuff. Plus, this will be my  fourth  marching practice I've missed. Am I even in band any more? I sure don't think so. It feels so wrong not to go to marching practices and yet still have band. Heh, I'm an idiot. =D *stands tall and proud*  World Geography is full of troublemakers and idiots. This is what I get for choosing it as an academic class. The good thing is that the teacher seems really nice, so that's ok I guess. There was this Mexican guy that just came to the U.S. and didn't know any English, so I offered to help him. It reminded me when I got to Duncanville...all lost and stuff. But he won't have to feel like that as long as I have him for that class, I assure.  Bussiness Computer I is gonna be the best class of A Day, me thinks. I have Sharde "Taylor," Michael-kun, Sally-san, Yaqui-chan and Michelle-chan. I also have them all for my lunch, which is B Lunch. w00t! I didn't bring anything to eat so I didn't eat anything. Oh well, wasn't that hungry.  The first day of Pre-Ap English and we already have a project due Friday. It's about our ten most important virtues in order and crap. Gah. It has to be in 3-D and it has to reflect our culture or something like that. Boo. I have Sally-chan and Jessica-san [M] in there, along with Krasynthia-san and Reyna-san, so w00t w00t. Tomorrow I'm gonna go to my next four blocks, so that's B Day. The good thing is that I don't have my two Pre-Ap classes in one whole Day. Talk about lucky. =o  Now, about my Random Quote of the Day... It's true! Here's what IFM said:   ...I mean, who the [fug] stands in the middle of a ramp and plays with their friends? Welcome to high school, you incompetant turd. Chicks play with their friends in the hall, not guys. Perhaps these wads had some sort of sexual identity crisis, because they looked like any other dweeby grade 9.    What's that you say, ye of little faith? "I was once a grade 9 too"? Sure, I was a grade 9 too. But there's a difference: I DON'T SUCK. These kids are begging to be beaten up, and I like to see it happen to them. I didn't get beaten up because I was too smart to get beaten up by some nigger, which is the only person who would want to beat me up.   So please, don't suck.  As I was reading my e-mail today, I had gotten one from So-Young. I sent her an e-mail telling her everything about what happened with band and stuff, and explaining some other things. I also told her that  we  would never forget about her.Like I promised,  I'll never lose contact with her.  No matter if she's on the other side of the world, I don't care. I found out that Yaqui-chan and Michelle-chan haven't even bothered to at least e-mail her or tell her, "Hi." What the fudge? Weren't we all just so fuggin' sad that So-Young was gonna leave and crap? Well, I'm sure as heck still depressed that she isn't with us, so I don't know about these other losers. Here's a part of her e-mail:    nobody writes me from duncanville except of course you  and thank you very much...  This just...made me so sad... What's up with you losers that dare to call yourself "friends"?!? I don't  care  what's going on with you and your life, at  least  try to write to her! Just say hi and that's it. I bet she'd be so happy to hear from any of her D'ville friends. *coughyaquicoughmichellecoughimdyinghelp* Oh my goddess... I know what it feels like to not get mail from your friends, and it sucks, trust me. Crap, I'm so upset. I'm gonna talk to Yaqui-chan and Michelle-chan and ask them what the fug is going on with them. Weren't they almost crying because So-Young was moving? Fuggin' hypocrites.
