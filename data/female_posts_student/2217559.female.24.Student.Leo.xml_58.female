Things are still going great out here at sea. Mexico is getting alittle boring to be honest but only because we are here every week. I am looking forward to mid-March when we switch to 7 day cruises traveling to Cabo, Monterrey  Catalina islands.  Should be a great cruise itinerary for awhile. And then of course we will head to Alaska before I come home.  It's so hard to believe I have been here almost 3 months. The time has flown by although now things have slowed considerably.   I have found this life to be somewhat lonely at times. Especially since my friend Lisa has dicked out a bit - she's hanging with her boyfriend all the time and I really can't stand him very much so we have just kind of broken up. Hehehe. I rarely even go to dinner with her anymore. But her boyfriend leaves in a couple of weeks so I am sure she will want to start hanging out again - I hate being a convenient friend. So, I think I will just blow her off for awhile after he leaves. She can find her own friends.  I have been hanging with a lotof different people but still some of the same. Fotis is awesome. I went to the crew bar and had a few drinks with him last night. I actually hooked him up with a guest over new year's cruise and he's madly in love with her. I think they are actually going to get married - definitel a sign that love at first sight still exists. I am very happy for him. Saddened though as he will be leaving me soon - going on vacation and then of course he will come back to the Mercury after I am on vacation.  I will then be on the Century ship so I don't know -hopefully our paths will cross again at some point.   The new group coordinator came onboard- which is excellent for me. I will no longer be in charge of groups which I am very happy about. These people can be so demanding and I already have enough on my plate as is.  The new group coordinator is Uma - remember me talking about her when I first came on???  She's turned into kind of a biatch and so now she has been nicknamed on the ship as, "Viet-Cong."  Kind of funny. I just try to stay out of her way and say as little as possible to her. I hate crabby people. They suck.   Today was a great day.  I hung out with some guests all day and they showed me an excellent time. We went to this place called Mayan Palace and had lunch, some pina colodas and exchanged great conversation.  The husband, Mr. Peterson, is a pilot for Northwest airlines. He's flying the 747's and his wife a beautiful socialite. Just great people in general. I am thinking about going out tonight but still kind of weighing it out. I don't have anything to do in the office so I am just kind of hanging out looking like I am working. (What's new with that??)  Our chief conceirge is leaving soon - in fact in a few days. He's a great guy, I will miss him. But I will see him again on the Century. He's headed there now. Strange how we are all connected in some way.   I have sort of decided to just chill in Austin/houston for my vacation. Jen and I have been tlaking about taking a vacation somewhere chilly. Just for a rest and relaxation break. I told her I just want to go to some random cabin in Utah or Kansas and just be away from all people. After being surrounded by 3,000 people for six months, the last thing I want to do is go to some tourist area on my vacation. Heheehe, for real.   I found a kick ass surfing spot in Acapulco.  Recolverado Beach. Supposedly excellent waves and good surf.  I am going with art auctioneire and asistant next time we are in Acapulco.  I am sure it will be fun. I was planning to go today but I hung out with guests instead.   Well, i am off the line now. Gonna go change into my austin jeans and tshirt with flipflops. Damn, I miss wearing those clothes. These uniforms are choking me. Hehehe. Love you all so much and I hope everyone is doing well. I miss you like crazy and can't wait to get home for 2 months to visit with everyone.   Much love to my ECI alumni.....
