Something you may be interested in, i bumped into mr hogg today, he has put on order for next yr, 2 more cameras and 2 more e-macs. so thats good. I did, if you havent guessed already, pop into school today, to oversee a drama rehursal,  that was good, the tempest may actually be a good show! Other than that i have had all the social dilemas and problems you normally have in a month in one day, so thats not a good thing, and now everyone has gone to sleep before i could put things right, and i hate it when that happens. Lots of chatting to do in the morning i guess.  Hope you all well and revising hard. Dave
