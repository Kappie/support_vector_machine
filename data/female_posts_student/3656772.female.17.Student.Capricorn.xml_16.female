I'm so tired of school, I just want to leave.  I need to sleep too. I'm exhausted in my head, my body is slowing down, but it can get better with sleep. My head..I dont know what it needs to get engery, but I need it bad.  I'm excited about getting Smuass's pup with her tomorrow. I'll be sleeping over for two nights in a row, I'm really excited, but I'm just so tired its hard to be happy. You know its bad when its hard to feel joy.          Love and hope and sex and dreams        Are still surviving on the street        Look at me, I’m in tatters!        I’m a shattered        Shattered  I'm burning out....this year has been so long and so hard. Next year will be worse, I'm afraid, but I just keep hoping I'll recover over the summer.  I'm excited about going to Egypt too. It will be one of those memories I'll never forget....I'm sure. I've always wanted to go there, but, lol, its hot there too. Go figure. More heat.  I feel weak, drained. Mentally and physically. Each day is a struggle, and I'm getting more and more easily angered. I just snap at sam and smauss a lot, and my anger lasts so long I cant even appologize. I need to find a way to smudge or something to get this nastyness out of me.          Don’t question why she needs to be so free        She’ll tell you it’s the only way to be        She just can’t be chained        To a life where nothing’s gained        And nothing’s lost        At such a cost         There’s no time to lose, I heard her say        Catch your dreams before they slip away        Dying all the time        Lose your dreams        And you will lose your mind.        Ain’t life unkind?   What is the first thing you think of when I say the word:  Rain ?  ~I think of the old black and white movies, where everything is cliche, mysterious, and .....simpler? But are they really simpler? Or is it just our subconcious want of something more romantic, controlled, something where we can expect certain things to go certain ways? Something to rely on?
