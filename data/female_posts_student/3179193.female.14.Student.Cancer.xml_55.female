We played some music in the shade of the portables and Daniel joined us. Then we played music in the park while Dan and Ronen played basketball. Ronen, Moca, and I went to my house to drop off my guitar and I got Moca some water. Then we set out to Wal-Mart and sent Ronen in to get Moca a McFlurry and he got me a sundae. Yum! ^^ We played TRUTH OR DARE all the way there and all the way back. Then Ronen went to play basketball with Octi and Mark and people and Moca, Dan, and I played TRUTH OR DARE. We hung out there while we finished our desserts and then Dan walked us to my house and we hung out inside while Moca had some water. We joked around a lot. Little Benin is a hilarious guy... that little frigger. Haha! When we got into the house, Nima called. He had gotten home. So we talked on the phone while Moca and Dan joked around. Dan somehow got the idea that Moca liked him... yeaaah suuuuure. LmAozZ~! Roofles~   I missed Nima so much. I wanna see him and give him a hug. :( Blah... school tomorrow. Omg... I still haven't done my lab report or Outsider questions... or my math! I'm a bad bad girl! Hee hee!  Well, they're all gone now... just me at home... and my sister... and grandpa. Mommy's out at Asta's. *sighzZ* So freakin hot... My sunburn on my shoulder hurts a bit. You know what? I found out I had $5 in change and I'm gonna get my sister to pay for the other $5 for my cowboy hat! Hee hee~ I hope my mom lets me go back to the Promenade this coming weekend to get that cowboy hat for Sudbury! :D  Wish me luck y'all! Well, I'm a bit tired... gonna have some ice-cream, shower, and take a nap!   [Peek-a-boo!!! LMAO!!! MOCA/DAN]
