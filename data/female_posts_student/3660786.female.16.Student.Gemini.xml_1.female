Everywhere I go, something weird happens.  Today, I was Yard'n'garden. They sell plants and plant stuff, not really too many yard ornaments, but every once in awhile they will have some gnomes or a couple of those bird things that have the wings that spin in the wind, and those ceramic animals you fill with sand. Well, I was looking at some litte japanese maples to put in our yard next to our giant pillars by the front door, you know to make them less obvious, and this huge Harley Davison guy went to customer service. I was immediately drawn to take a closer look. (I was thinking 'Why would a biker want to go to yard'n'garden?) So I crouched down and pretended to be looking for a price tag on the tree. The biker asked the little old lady behind the desk if she had any of the little pink flamingos. She no, but they had some cute gnomes. The guy practically exploded! I thought he was going to kill the little woman! He yelled, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT HAVE THE FLAMINGOS! THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE A YARD STORE! HOW CAN YOU HAVE THE PINWHEELS, AND UGLY MEN, BUT NOT THE FLAMINGOS!" The lady calmly told the man that she thought the garden store down the road might have them. He slammed his fist down on the table, kicked over a coule of pots of flowers, and stormed out of the back fence. I stood up and took the maple over to the lady, and bought it cause I felt sorry for her (and I desperately wanted to draw less attention to the giant Greek pillars).  But yeah. That was really an interesting story, I dont know why that man was in dire need of pink flamingos, but i hope he wasn't upset because I happen to know that the Lil' garden store down the street only sells blue and purple flamingos.
