For those of you who weren't fortunate to catch this show in its heyday, the premise of the show was that there were a bunch of kids, who were brought together to solve crimes/be friends, by a "ghostwriter." And, when I mean "ghostwriter," I mean a ghost who writes to them and whose messages can only seen by these kids, also known as the "Ghostwriter Team."  So, anyways, once these kids bonded and realized that they shared such a "special" secret, they decided to team up. Each team member received a kickass black pen that they would use to write to "Ghostwriter." And this pen brings me to why I'm writing this random ass entry in the first place. I just picked up a pen to make my "to do" list for tomorrow. As I was writing a note to self about depositing a paycheck, it hit me that the pen I was using was exactly the same kind of pen that these kids used. Small freakin' world, no?
