First off she has berrys for brains, she tries to teach french but everything she says is completly different from the book. i trust the book over her anyday. Second i missed alot of school the past 2 weeks and  so on tuesday i went in and asked her what i had missed on Friday and Monday hers what she said, "we did the vocaulary and the grammer from chapter 6 so just do the workbook for that and study" so i did. Today i come into class and she starts talking about a skit. Now i like skits so i was like hell yea a skit i studied this week so i actually knew what the fuck she was talking about. but then she said "ok who wants to go first?" so i was floored, and in my mind i had thoughts running as if giant strawberrys were chasing them. "whatr!?! there is a skit due today?!" "Oh my fucking God, i dont have one!" "I don't have a partner." "She will blame me for not knowing." so slowly i inch out of my seat in between skits and make my way to her desk. When i get there i say "Excuse me Madame de Berry but i dont have a skit and i didnt know we even had one assigned seeing as i wasnt here on friday or monday." so guess what she says "Well I gave the class time to work on it friday and its your respondsibility to find out your assignments" hearing this i turn beet red fuming very very pissed off because the first thing i did upon my arrival in my fourth period french class on tuesday was to ask her what we had done, and this skit was NOT one of the things she told me. so i say "But Madame i came in on tuesday and u did not tell me about this skit." this is the part where she basically calls me a liar to my face. But luckily by this time the whole class is listening to our heated discussion in the corner of the room. Two of my french one buddies chime in "But Madame de Berry we didnt work on our skits at all on Monday or Thursday and you havent said a thing about it this week." Madame knowing she is caught in a lie  just sits there looking at me. Then two more of my friends Andy and Ali say "Madame if you gives us one more day we can rewrite our skit to include her." But this did not satisfy Madame de Berry. So now we are staring at each other with a look of pure hatred in our eyes. I'm sure she hates me almost as much as i hate her. What happens next was sort of a surprise but mostly it wasn't seeing as how i was right. "Allright" she said "This one time i will excuse you, But no more if you miss one day you can'y make up the work you missed and you won't be excused."  Ugh i know these past two weeks i've missed a lot of school but that is the most i have ever missed in my entire life. So i was very indignant at this point and sort of tearing up. But i did not let her see and just walked back to my seat where i could vent in peace. Needless to say i Hate her. so here is what i would like to say, Madame de Berry i hope you go to hell and i wish you would be fired because you are a terrible teacher and you are not a very good person. There i have gotten my angry out of me, and i want people to know that i am not a violent person and i dont normally hate but this is a very very special case. So leave me the fuck alone ok? Thanks its much appreciated.
