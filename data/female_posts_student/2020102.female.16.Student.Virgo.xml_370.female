Oh Lord, I will give you anything, I will do anything for you, I will go anywhere, I will give away anything... but that?' The answer to that question is the 'one thing' you need to give to the Lord, more than anything else. Often, when we surrender such a deep sense of ownership to the Lord, He in his loving grace will allow us to have that 'one thing' again, with the caution to remember we are only stewards of that 'one thing.' Oftentimes, He, in his wisdom, does not allow us to have that 'one thing' back. It is a step of submission and obedience; and a risk that is vitally important for the sake of our spiritual growth. God said, 'You shall have no other gods before me.' (Ex 20:3)"   -K Walden
