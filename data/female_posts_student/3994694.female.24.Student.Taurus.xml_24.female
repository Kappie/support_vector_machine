Some of the best blogs I read only register around 5,000 total, and they've been going for years.  I think this site meter is a scam.  You stick it on your site and it generates an exponential curve of vistor numbers to make you feel special.  I wish I could just go back to 73.  At least then I could see if I had 3 visitors a day or so, and felt like I was a little interesting.  But now that it was possibly all a scam, I feel totally rejected.
