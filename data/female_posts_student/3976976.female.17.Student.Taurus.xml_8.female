Stuff like that.. when someone tells you you aren't but yet every time you have the chance you're like.. No I'm not.. blah blah... Really how is that attractive.. if you want attention well that is just not the way to get it... If i like you for you.. be happy for that.. shit, you don't want to end up getting on my bad side.. I like people for being themselves.. being secure about the person they are and the person they are choosing to be.. faults, and "ugliness" and all... Sometimes i really don't understand, do you just like hearing other people compliment you to make you feel better?? I mean seriously.. if i tell you you are hot or you are just the greatest person to be around.. then take that and be happy... Guys can be so self conscious about everything.. girls are too.. but self confidence.. maybe just a little can be attractive to anyone.. well to me.. knowing a guy can hold their own.. well thats good! Well thats all i have to say.. Ill be on tonight to write somethin new.. hopefully inspiration will strike and I'll write a poem.
