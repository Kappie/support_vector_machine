Well, I have realized that the Good Kid gets allowed a few Bad Things without being held accountable. I.e. Me kicking a hole through Christopher's door. I was angry, blah. And best yet - HE got in trouble for it, not me. Heh. Am the Untouchable Flamingo of Lime Convertibles.      I got a job too :D guess who is working there...Diana! I haven't seen her since I was a likkle freshman. Bwah. She roxurz...her parents own the hotel. The manager is a little freaky but altogether nice. I folded some stuff and got paid for an hour's work 'cause I stayed after she hired me so she could show me around and do laundry. Mmhmm. $7.05 is mine!       Let's see, what else did I do...scoffed in horror and delight when my brother told me Michael mentioned me in his letter. I am so upset I missed talking to him before he left. My fondest memories will be of when we had Zoology  Marine Bio together, and when we went to the movies, and when he came over and played Yoshi's Island on my GBA.      Wherever you are now, Michael (presumably somewhere in Poland)...I will never forget you, and will cherish (so corny, but true) our times together. You are the nicest person I have ever met in my life, even if you do drink beer. In Poland.
