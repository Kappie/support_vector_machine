We were only there for about 2 hours, but it was still enyjoyable. :)  Afterwards I went over to Kelsey's house for the night and just hung out for a while, but Kelsey and I were starting to get restless and we both felt the need to get out of the house. Too bad her mom wouldn't give us a ride anywhere. It took quite a bit of convincing for her to even allow us to leave. -_- We were originally going to go see Stepford Wives with Trey, but his parents said the movie looked horrible and offered to just rent a movie and let us come over. We glady accepted. :P  We ended up renting The Others, which I had already seen, but I didn't mind seeing it again especially considering Trey and Kelsey hadn't seen it yet. Kelsey was really creeped out but the ending calmed her down a bit. XD We ended up leaving at about 11:30 and we just went back to Kelsey's.   We got back on the computer to talk with friends, but Kelsey ended up spilling her cranberry juice on the keyboard and messing it up. We tried draining it out, but it wouldn't work at all. >_  Today I just hung out with Kelsey until about 6. We just watched TV, swam, painted XD, and hung out. It was laidback, but still fun.   I feel like doing something exciting tomorrow. Tell me if you have any suggestions.    Edit: I feel like fucking shit. Great, just great.
