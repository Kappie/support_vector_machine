My parents are having a party...I was playing with the little kids. It's Friday, I'm going to VA tomorrow, gonna visit my niece, and my sister, and my brother-in-law, and his sisters, and his parents, and their dog. I have to leave at 5am tomorrow, so all you people that tell me I'm skipping school YOU'RE THE ONE who has it lucky. I feel like jumping on a bean-bag chair. Too bad I don't have one. Yeah this post isn't going anywhere.....
