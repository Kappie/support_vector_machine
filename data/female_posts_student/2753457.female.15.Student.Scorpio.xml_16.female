The last part was in traffic.  We went up to Morganton, NC (You might ask where that is.  I have no clue.) yesterday to visit my dad's friend since they were like 5 and his wife, and their dogs.  It was pretty fun--I like them.  Now my neck is sore.  Oh!  But the good news is that I discovered a band that I like, the Dandy Warhols.  My dad had the cd on in the car, and I liked it a lot.  I may have to make a copy. Oh, goodness.  I still have to do my homework tonight.  :(  Oh well, it won't be THAT bad.   I'm so watching the Grammys tonight.  I don't even care if you think I'm stupid.  I actually care about music.  I'll be rooting Coldplay and Outkast on.  And Sigur Ros, whoooo!  Maybe even the White Stripes.  What channel is this shit on anyway?  Ha, that might be good to know.  Because my mom might not get that channel.  I can just see myself three hours from now, all ready to watch, with my popcorn, and my pajamas on, and my homework all done.  And then I can't watch it, and I'm just like fuck.  I'm gonna find out which channel it's on right now. OK, it's reallly on CBS, and we really get that one.  So it's cool.
