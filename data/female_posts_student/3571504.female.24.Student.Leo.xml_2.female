Allen was sleeping peacefully and he had his arms wrapped protectively around my waist as if I am his teddy bear that might run away.  Puts a sweet image in your head doesn't it?  Well, think of it from my angle.  This position is my normal sleeping position; which most of the time I love.  His arms are all I want around me.  However, on this particular night his arms are squeezing farts out of me.  Now, farts come out of the butt; which at this point in time is malfunctioning....I will let you complete the rest of that thought.  So as I am running to the bathroom with my hand at my butt as if I am going to catch it falling out.  I make it to my porcelain easy chair, and I call it this because I have been sitting there more than my lazy boy.  It is an explosion of atomic magnitude.  If you looked out your window around 12:30am tonight you would have seen a brown mushroom cloud over the interlochen area.  If they could re-create what I just did and put it in a missile we could take out Iraq and leave just a skid mark.    Anyway, I went on that tangent because after my anal explosion I had some tortilla chips and a little On The Border salsa.  I didn't eat a lot, but I had around 15 chips.  So, I was feeling guilty.  Since my screaming butthole, or as Allen so delicately started calling it my firebutt, wouldn't permit any shut eye until it had it's explosion I had some time to write it.  Thanks for the patience in reading this tangent, for that's what it is ladies and ladies!  I hate the runs, the trots, Hershey squirts, or whatever other cute name you want to place on it!  How could you place a cute name like Hershey squirts on something that has massive amounts of doo coming out of your butthole all the time?  I think a cute name like that should be saved for something involving bunnies or something froo froo like that.  This hell on earth experience does not deserve a cute name.  So here are a few names I found on the internet that better describe this hell: * wash the walls (that one is for mom) * bottom barf * chorro (Mexican Spanish for "You got the flu in your hole"  * shitathlon (it most certainly is that) * shooting soup  * supersonic sewer sauce  * ten-twenties (10 seconds to shit, 20 minutes to wipe)  * toilet bowl stew  There you are my friends!  I am leaving you now.  My butt is settled and I think I might get some shut eye.  At least until I get another atomic demand.    Love,  Courtney
