I have noone to talk to on the phone, seeing as how everyone actually works at work. Not me. I come here to blog.   I wonder why girls can always conjure up the worst scenario possible. If your not one of these girls ~congrats. In my head right now I imagine that my lovely boy is in the arms of some ho'. Truth or not, its killing me. I also can picture him taking her to out to eat, I can even imagine his lips moving as he talks to her. What the fuck is up with that? Have I gone completly insane?  I'm serious, if it were'nt for blogging, I'd be dialing his number 100 times trying to figure out if any of my evil thoughts are true. So instead I can on here to type the words that are floating around in my head.   I also imagine that he has taken her to the house that we lived in together. She's walking around on MY hard wood floors. The ones I insisted we have installed. Shes sitting on my toliet. Eating from my kitchen. I know, I know, there no longer mine. I also fear that she is there with MY munchkins. Talking and playing with them. May she burn in  hell.    I think I smoked too much today already. I can't help it. Mostly it just gives me something to do as I pace around. I feel like my teeth are going to rot and fall out. I hate just about everyone.  Mostly I just hate myself. No use in blaming innocent people.   I miss my old life. I miss him.
