Well that is part of the reason why I didn't write for two days. The other being the Indo Pak match. The whole Sunday whisked away in attending Fiitjee and then coming back home to see India hopelessly trudge a losen war (Sehwag went for 1, what else could you expect).    Anyhow, coming back to the eye checkup. I had thought that it would be a 15 min affair.I would just have to sit in front of a machine, and pat I would get my power (like it happens in Samay- I dont expect any of you to have heard about the movie, but I kinda liked it.). But no, I was thoroughly mistaken. After doing the routine checkup, I had to sit through 2 hrs of torture (well, its bit of a torture, to sit with your eyes closed for 2 hrs). Yes, they were dilating my eyes.   I managed the 2 hrs, but after coming home I could not see anything which was near and therefore could not sit on the computer. The next day when I got up, I could see the near objects but could not see the far ones.  I mean it was pathetic . I wasn't supposed to, but I watched the match, so it became worse...   Anyhow, I think I will be getting my glass powers by next Saturday.   Whenever, I think I will bunk March Past, I see Damini aka Head Girl. And oh boy, isn' t sheangry with me for not attending March Past. So unwillingly we have to go andattendit with Mr. P.K. Sharma yelling out the goddamit commands.  Yes, I know some have been lucky but forothers...   There are a lot of birthdaysin these coming days, so look out .
