She has the best stories of when she was young.  Stories about her first husband, living next to a queer guy, and having a stroke when Terry (her son, my uncle) was one years old.  She just has a lot of wonderful life experiences to share.  Backing it up to before lunch, I discovered my favorite store in the whole wide world:  urlLink Cost Plus World Market .   You have to go there.  It is like a cheap Pottery Barn, but better because of the items they have from around the world.  I got a bunch of cool pictures for my room, one of which was a picture of an abbey in Ireland.  Soooo beautiful!  Just in case you'd like to visit:  Down Stevens Creek, past the mall aways.  It will be on your left.  It's by Circut City (not the one by Tony and Alba's).  If you've gone to the Toyota dealership, you've gone too far.  Happiness for the night:  Staying over with Bobby and Veronika at the house in Sunnyvale they are "sitting."  Happiness for Saturday morning:  Decorating my classroom for Vacation Bible Camp @ SMT.  Uneasiness for Sunday morning:  Having to go up in front of the alter at church for a special blessing for VBC.  Yuck.  PERPETUAL HAPPINESS:  For Veronika.  For buying her first car!!  A Honda Civic!  2004!  Silver!  Now we have sister cars :)....And Bobby with his Honda Accord can be our brother car!  Hooray for Hondas!
