I used to think being on the US International Mathematics Olypiad team would be the coolest thing ever, but know I realize that they're wayyyyy out of my league.  I didn't even understand what one of the example questions in the book was asking, let alone how to go about answering them.  That's okay, though... studies have shown that "child prodigies" usually aren't any more successful in their adult life than other resonably intelligent people.  Since my major goals are long term I don't need to get hung up on the abilities these kids have developed at such an early age.  On a lighter note, check out the  urlLink Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Problems .  Maybe I'll make one of these my life project.  Andrew Wiles, the Princeton professor who proved Fermat's Last Theorem, said he began thinking about the problem when he was only 10 years old.  If I get started soon maybe I'll have a chance.
