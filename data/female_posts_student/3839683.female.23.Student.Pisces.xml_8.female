The postal system has been so wacky this year after taking Reagans burial day off too. He was a great man but I'm sure good ole Ronnie would have wanted me to get my new US weekly magazine.. Cause life does go on don'tcha know? I don't know why so many postal employees go crazy working there anyways. What's so horrible about selling cat stamps to old ladies, driving on the wrong side of a car and having every holiday off?  I actually enjoy going to my mail box and finding letters that I never usually get! It's a sad story yet it's very true. My pathetic 23 year old life lives for the daily mail. But that part of joy in my life was taken away on July 5th 2004. It all started like any other day. Me walking out the door around noon and having to drop a few letters off in the mailbox expecting them to not be there when I got home. I was wrong like usual. This is when I realized that the postal system workers have a better life then I do. I had to work today and they didn't, it's as simple as that. Yet I'm sure they got paid today for it...And I get paid less then them... I am almost positive. That makes baby jesus and I cry....  The bank people make me mad too come to think about it. They also had this Non holiday day off too. Also they get to touch thousands of dollars a day and get paid for it. I think if I worked at a bank I would sit there all day and smell the money. That's just me though. I would get fired for holding on to it too long probably too. Maybe get caught in the bathroom  just "touching" the money all day long. I would be on your 6 and 11 o'clock news.. and you'd say.. "nothing wrong with that, I would touch money too." Yet the sad truth is that money doesn't stay long enough in my custody without saying byebye!  I believe the bank in my town already thinks that I am some sort of drug dealer. You see when Rob gets paid the only way I can get access to the money to pay bills is threw an ATM because the bank the army deposits our money into is a Texas bank. So the ATM likes to spit out 20 dollar bills only. Let me tell you sending $400 dollars in 20 dollar bills ($400 a day bank card limit) threw the drivethru bank window at a time is not my idea of fun. I could only imagine what those people are thinking. Perhaps one day the local Narcotics team will show up at my door and give me a much needed vacation away from my life. I've always wanted to learn how to pee standing up!
