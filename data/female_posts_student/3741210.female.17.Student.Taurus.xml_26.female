Friday was good for no reason just as today is bad.  I guess when you have some place to go for lunch and you know its Friday, you have a better day.  Talked to my cousin Cait for a bit, she works here too.  I have senior pics tomorrow at nine, so I'm getting my nails done at Marshall Fields tonight at 6.  Man I just want to go home and relax.  Last night we had book club at Emily's house.  It was so cute she had an English theme with triangle sandwiches, scones, tea, fruit in wine glasses and much more.  The food was absolutely delicious and it will be hard to outdo this one.  Not many people actually got through the book and even fewer liked it, but that was fine because there was definalty no lack of conversation the whole night.  We're still not sure what book we're going to read next month but we'll decide some time today.  My Mom suggested this fictional book called  Jane Austen's Book Club .  A book about a book club  for  book club.  I read a review in the paper for this other book which was a true story of a Jewish woman escaping the Nazi's as a kid. I forget the title, I'll have to look it up. Its kinda weird because our next meeting is two days before school starts.  We're so close to the end of summer.--And I still haven't looked at any colleges!  Man all my friends have at least looked at a few with Kelly looking at somewhere around 157.  Well, not really but you get the idea, I'm sure she's researched that many.  I think I kind of want to be a teacher.  I want to also study theology and philosophy but those majors leave me open for teaching.  I wonder if I have the patience to work with little kids.  Will I get burnt out like so many teachers I see?  Who knows.  1:37, I have to go back at 2 and I want to research that book.  Until next time folks
