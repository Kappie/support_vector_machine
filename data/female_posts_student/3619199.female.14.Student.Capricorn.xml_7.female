I've noticied that not a lot of people comment to people's blogs (or maybe they do, and they get trashed)! Well feel free to comment to my post, though i really don't care about your opinion!  But You HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES 1. They have to be stupid (that's not askin' much from you guys) 2. They have to be vulgar (i hate sweet comments! if you don't have anything nice to say, comment on my blog!) 3. They have to be in english (what can I say, i haven't takin' foriegn language classes yet) 4.  They have to be short (I have a short-attention span) And The Last Rule Is....................... 5. They HAVE to be vulgar (wait, i already said that, see i do have a short attetion span) Well chow for now
