I thought I would just write all the WonDerFullY wonderful things that happen in my boring days. haha. yeah, so today i had my second interview at LoneStar and i thought i was definitely gettin the job, BUT he said it went great and it was a shame i wasnt old enough to be a server but they didnt need a host right now but he was definitely gonna call me when one came open--so now i have to wait..and wait..and hopefully get the job. i dont want to work but i kinda have to. NOW, i have to decide if i want to go to 4H camp or not. its either--go to camp and be chief which i will never get to do again--or--stay home and wait on a call for a job which i need. i dont know what to do. i have two days to decide. it sucks ass. oh well. well i know this is really boring and its kinda makin me bored so, i think i'll stop about now. maybe i'll be back tomorrow--i dunno--oh well. Later.
