Kuronue:  What is Spanish?  Baka:  You don't really know jack about normal people, do you?  Kuronue:  Just tell me.  Baka:  It's a human language.  I'm a bit off track aren't I?  Kuronue:  *sarcastically* No Baka, you're right on.  Baka:  Shut it.  I think that peanut butter and chocolate are both good, especially when bonded together to form an awesome, unhealthy, fattening snacky.  Kuronue:  Is there s'pose to be some kind of hidden meaning in there?  Baka:  Do you even know what we are talking about?  Kuronue:  Only slightly.  Baka:  All the more reason to stay out of this.  Random voice from the abyss:  And so the argument went on.  It finally ended when Baka made a rude comment about Kuronue's past life and was thrown off a building only to be caught by the waiting arms of her boyfriend,...  Baka:  Hey, don't tell the public.  That's only between you and I.  Voice:  Sorry.  It's not easy being part of the Sanbutsushin.  Baka:  I'm not familiar with that particular term.  Voice:  I am one of the three parts of the Buddha.  Baka and Kuronue together:  You're a god?!!!  Voice:  I think there is a question you have yet to answer.  *abyss closes and Buddha disappears*  Baka:  Oh yeah, YYH is the acronym for Yu-Yu Hakusho (that means ghost files or poltergeist report).  Kuronue:  Are you done yammering?  Baka:  Don't be so rude.  Kuronue:  You should really be talking.  Baka:  Hey!  You wanna piece of me!  Fine, lets see you throw me off a building again!  Kuronue:  You want to land in...  Baka:  Don't say it!  Buddha:  *peeking out from a cloud of smoke**slaps forehead*  Not again.  I ought to strike them both down, but I can't take other creatures' lives.  This is worse than the behavior of Sanzo.
