Then it's off to Nova Scotia for a couple relaxing weeks at home. I'm looking forward to it, although I know I have so much work to do that I won't be doing, and that's stressing me out a little. Oh well. Summer is the time for vacations, right?  The past weekend was nice, except for a heat rash I developed while drinking outside on a patio Friday night. That's how hot it was! Unbelievable for Vancouver... Spending most of Saturday in the mall didn't help my situation any. Although the beach that evening was nice. And then Spiderman 2, which was very good. The X-alumni barbecue was on Sunday. Fun, as always. Then I watched Sean and his friends play soccer. Then we ordered pizza. And that was it.   I feel like none of my weekends this summer have been that exciting, although I'm rarely home for more than a few hours any weekend (not including time spent in bed). It's keeping me busy enough.
