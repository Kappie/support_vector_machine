I'm still annoyed that they dont have a section where you can put art on :(  Wow, i found this cool site called  urlLink  unladylike.net   ! Pretty cool.  Arghhh I am sooo tired from P.E toady. Miss Broom's such a... a... poo. Running AGAIN! And then we did javelin and I've just realised that I've never thrown a javelin properly in my life! I managed to throw mine perfectly away from the grass and into the paving slabs where it made a little round hole! Oops.
