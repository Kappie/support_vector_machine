But now I find I am allergic to Zantac, which is good to know.   Anyway.   Yeah, we have solo auditions for the Showcase at the end of the summer tomorrow. At least, for the Giovenette peice, the Peasant Song. I'm trying out for Zerlina's solo. Cause it's fun. But I won't be picked. Cause my voice sucks.   It does, too.  You know, I look at all these teenagers that have extraordinairy shit happen to them. Like Charlie. Charlie was blessed with a good voice.   I wasn't, damnit.   And even if I was, my stupid choir teacher refuses to give solos because they're 'unfair'.   Anyway. And then there's people who get famous just for their looks, no talent.   Britney Spears, being an example.  Yeah. My mum isn't helping, either. I keep trying to get realized or something, see if I do have any talent. But she's like 'lose fifty pounds and I'll get you an agent' and I'm like 'WTF!?! You don't even want to get me a gym membership and now you want me to lose fifty pounds?'  My mother is stuuuupid.   So yeah.  I see all these extraordinairy things happen to people. Like Hillary Duff, like Charlotte Church, like JoJo, people like that.  And I'm like, WTF?! I'm not supposed to be stuck in a fucking small town that's not even on the map! I'm supposed to be out there, with the world!  I'm supposed to be extraordinairy! Idolized!  -Special-!  But no, damnit. The world looks at me and tells me I'm not good enough.  Never have been. Always have been at the very most second best at everything.   -Everything-.  Damnit.  Anyway.   Whee, conversation.   Puck Eats You: *prod* Faerieblue Satu: ::is prodded:: Puck Eats You: Hio Faerieblue Satu: hoi. Faerieblue Satu: . . . no. Faerieblue Satu: hi. xD Puck Eats You: How are oyu?
