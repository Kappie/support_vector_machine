But with the whole grinding thing, you realize that was the week before I met Michael?  I met Michael instead of the other guy from Indiana who brought up that discussion.  Anyway, the real reason I came on here to post was because guess who got married tonight?  Yup, Megan.  Guess who wasn't invited.  My family!!!  w00t.  Yeah, so slightly...pissed, shall we say?  Yeah, not too happy over here.
