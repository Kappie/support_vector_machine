I liked Candlesticks. Bus 25 home from school=the best time of my life. Anywho... I went to the dentist the other day, it was FANTASTIC. Dr. Christ and I go wayyyy back. His hygienist, Phyllis, was a total beeyatch. He asked me what I was going to study in college, and I said business, and he said "Ohhh you could be on "The Apprentice" ahahhaha!" Then he was talking about my orthodontic treatment and he said, "Well it looks great. I mean could her teeth be any whiter Phyllis?" Phyllis was... absolutely silent. THANKS PHIL.  I took the ACT on Saturday, it was very hard. I took it at UA and I got really scared, cause they're attractive there. I walked in and saw Ann, we weren't in the same room but I told her I'd take her home. My room was boring. Kids were funny and it was crazy. Afterwards, Ann told me we had to find her friend Carrie. Turns out she was going to lunch with Carrie.. .and I don't know what my purpose was. But Ann said I could go with them. But then they ran into a third friend, and they kind of fought, and I wasn't sure if I should have left or stayed. But we ended up going to Panera, and we ran into EVERYBODY. It was exciting, as I've said, Unies can sniff each other out. So we ate lunch, and then we went back to Carrie's and she made me and Ann listen to this blue grass music. And she forced us to say we liked it. IT WAS REALLY FUNNY. Then I took Ann home and we were listening to this screaming song, and it was so different from the blue grass.  I babysat that night. I was a really good babysitter. But towards midnight, I could not stay awake, it was bad. I would nod off and then my head would fall. I came home and watched some Donald Trump on SNL. It wasn't that funny, so I went to bed. And then babysat again in the morning. Then I cleaned my room all day, and now I am not doing homework. Some other funny stuff has happened, but I don't want to write it, so you will all have to personally question me and my strange life. bye.
