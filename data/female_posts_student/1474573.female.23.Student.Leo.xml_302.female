I've been clenching my teeth more than ever too AND my back is so tight it feels like its about to go out. I'm tense.  TENSE, I SAY!   All of this is caused by stress.  My body is going into breakdown mode.  Someone give me valium, STAT!   Pretty please?  With sugar on top?   Seriously, I'm worried.  I worry so much about so many things.  Like, things I have no control over, like my friend's lives...I sooo would take care of business that much better, but it ain't my life, right?  I also stress about my Spanish class.  It's down to the wire now and I am freaking the fuck out, yo!  I mean, I know I'm going to pass the class in the end.  That's not really the issue.  I guess I'm just nervous about what's next.  Mainly because I don't KNOW what's next.    Do I need to know what's next?
