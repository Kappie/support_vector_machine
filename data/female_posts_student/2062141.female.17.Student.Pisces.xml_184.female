We were in a big dark house (that happened to be in the location of my house, but inside it wasn't at all like it, it was more like those big rooms that have all that machinery like in James Bond video games). It was Halloween night, and I can't remember now who it was exactly, but we were fighting something. After we beat them we ran out, making our way out of the neighborhood and there was all these crazy Halloween decorations, like holographic spiders and ghosts. Hm that's strange, I remember now that we were in a car when we first left the house, because I remember that Diddy Kong (yes, the monkey Diddy Kong was part of the team) didn't get in on time and had to jump through the door while it was moving. Lol! That was a cuhrazy dream. I wish I had finished it.   I'm not sure why I had that dream, usually I can pick out where each aspect of my dream came from (ie. if I had been playing Donkey Kong or even thinking about it that day then it would make sense that Diddy Kong would be there, but i hadn't). Totally random. Well, I guess I'm glad that I had an imaginative dream, cause lately they've been really boring.   I think I'm gonna start rating my days, too. We'll start with yesterday. I think my range will be from 5 to -5, counting 0. Yesterday was a 0. I'm tempted to give it a much lower number, but it all evened itself out I guess. No.. it was a -1. Yeah.
