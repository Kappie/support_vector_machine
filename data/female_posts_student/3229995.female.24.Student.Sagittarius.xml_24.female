She sparkles alongside renowned Swedish actress Bibbi Anderson in this intense drama about an actress who refuses to talk (Ullmann) and her relationship with the nurse (Anderson) who is looking after her.    ‘Persona’ (1968) is the   Greek word for mask and the film questions the differences between one’s outer and inner life. Bergman has never explained the film, saying it is up to the viewer to find the meaning of the film. Ullmann can convey a range of feelings without uttering one word, which is quite a task and she is just fantastic in this film. Want to see something different? Challenge yourself a bit? Then watch this Swedish masterpiece which is amongst the best films ever made.
