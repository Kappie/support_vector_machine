I have to turn my life around or Ill be headed for relapse. When I first went home I just lazed around. Now I have to pay attention to life. Its hard. I have school and meetings, I have to step up and take care of myself. I had a monster craving for some Subway last night. I wanted a chicken, Swiss cheese, tomato, and black olive on wheat bread sub. Then I wanted a cup with that southwest sauce in it. Mmmm... That sounds so good...   Last night I ate this Mexican dish. It had beans and rice, it was from that cafe I went to. It was pretty good, not better than the sub. Oh god I want a Subway sub. I've been eating crap food ever since I got here. We don't have regular meals here, so I make my meals myself. Usually I'm too hungry to make something good, so I end up eating something like Rice Soup. I should put some peas or chicken in it. I don't eat Ramen Noodles anymore. If you've heard how MSG fucks with your brain, you wouldn't eat it either. Soup sounds really nice too. I haven't had that Progresso canned stuff, but it sounds good. The picture on the can looks yummy. I'm usually too paranoid about raw meat, so I don't cook it. I'm fucking starving so I got to go. Life is good, and I'm still clean. 5 months! whoop whoop!
