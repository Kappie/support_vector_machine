"ooooh heeeey duuuude"-Erin, 3479472947 times everyday.  hey guys, frikin 6 days!!!!! aaah. i'm SO psyched. for those of you who don't know what i'm talking 'bout, me and Erin are going to the blink-182/the used/taking back sunday concert in the t dot on Friday. yeah, s'right. my parents are so awesome... they're going to go out for dinner in Toronto that night just so they can drive us there and back. i love.  "dad... someone i know is selling 2 tickets for a concert... $200 for both. but the thing is, i asked Erin if her parents would buy one, and she said probably not. so could you buy both?" "no. i'm going to have to put my foot down on this one. i'm not going to pay $100 for one of your friends to go to a concert... if it was me or your mum going with you, then i would buy both."-dad "but neither you or mum would want to go! it's screamo, and the singer of the used throws up when he's on stage."-me "i don't mind you going to a concert where people throw up. it's not that, i just think Erin should pay for her own ticket."-dad eventually, the guy selling the tickets lowered the price, Erin's mum said she could go, and my parents said i could go if she goes. sweet. my dad is so awesome.  ok so nothing else to tell.  oh wait... there was a dance on Thursday night. yeah i=didn't go. cuz i have no life and i did homework all night. but at 7:30, Vanessa called me from the dance. and she said i had to come because [bruce](not his real name, obviously) was there. and [ethel] (not her real name, obviously) was there too. [ethel] likes [bruce]. and so do i. so i cried... not really. so yeah i suck for not going... i totally regret it. not that [bruce] would have danced with me anyway.  k well i'm outtie yo. catch you on the flipside.  you had the best damn sunday dress at the end of the world. the wall of flames that consumed you and everything that was good, 'not with a band but a whimper'. kayte.
