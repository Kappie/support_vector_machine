I am really thirsty and I can't drink and I have to go to the bathroom REALLY REALLLLLLLYYYY BADDD!  School was kinda weird today. I don't know why..it was.  Emily,  Sara, and I played basketball during lunch! It was fun. We played Horse and I WON!!!!! Wahoooo.  Now I am waiting for the water to get  back on so I can takea  freako shower.  i think I am going to try to make myself look ugly for the stupid dance.  If I look pretty then Zane might try to do somehting...but if I look ugly maybe he will go away.  And its not like my friends wont like me because I am ugly.   Being ugly is fun...  I mean its not like the ugly girls get kidnapped a lot..   Lalal..i'm really tired..lalalalala
