Not that I watch t.v. much, but with the Dallas weather I'd like to know if I'm going to die because a tornado is coming my way.  I've actually really thought about this.   I'm on the 6th floor, what would I do?  Go down into the foyer on the 1st floor? I figure this place is all concrete, maybe I'll be okay.  I'm paying enough, it better protect me from a tornado.  I'm also apparantly paying for them to shoot an independent film here to be played at Sundance or something like that.  I was going down the elevator today and I got lucky enough to ride down with one of the actors.  Not that it was anyone famous.  The movie is called Hit something or actually it might not be called that at all.  I really don't remember now.  Oh well.
