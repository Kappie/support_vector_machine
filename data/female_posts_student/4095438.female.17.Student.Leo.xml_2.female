Before you ask, YES it makes me better than you! :P  I was feeling so bored and indifferent after Port got thrashed by Essendon that I called up 5AA and they bumped me to the front of the line because it was an international call! Mahaaa. I didn't talk about anything worth repeating but it was kinda cool to be connected to home, to something familiar, in that small way for a few minutes. What's even weirder is that about 5 calls later,  Alex Perilli  was on the line. I recognised his voice. I wondered if he had heard my call, if he'd recognised that there can't be that many 'Stefanie's from Adelaide living in Seattle that listen to the Port games on 5AA. In fact, I'd bet I'm the one and only. ;) So given that the odds are he did hear me and that the average idiot would have realised it was me, I wonder what went through his mind? When I heard him, I instinctively wanted to contact him somehow and laugh and let him know I heard him. His call was so passionate it made me laugh because he didn't give a shit about Port before he met my Dad and our family; I'm not the only one still affected by the saga that was those relationships. But you can't blame me for being bitter in the knowledge that I am affected in darker ways. Alex P is  Mary's  son. For those of you who still don't know who I'm talking about, don't ask. Just bask in my confused + cryptic comments.  At the moment Mum and I are launching out 3rd round of eBay sales and it's a huge one. We have a record 32 auctions up this week and at the moment we have 22 bids and 10 items that will sell. The most interesting sale? A pair of my brother's old Billabong jeans from Australia! The current high bidder is bidding $16.99 incl shipping all the way to Italy. :)
