I just hung out in Nordstrom the whole time. :) Then we went to 23rd street! I didn't get point flats...:( They didn't have my size. Oh well! But I did find THE Dress.  Gosh, its gorgeous. I found the most wonderful dress I will EVER lay my bright blue eys on.  It had a halter top and. Oh its to hard to explain. Its absolutely stunning.  To bad its 300 bucks  BUT I WANT IT SOOOOO BAD.  Really, I do.  Maybe I will buy it.  I mean 300 bucks isn't THAT bad for a designer dress. ;)   I better go to my bible study  Later gators.  Layra
