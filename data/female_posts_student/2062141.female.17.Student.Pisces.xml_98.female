We didn't get the thick tall bushy tree i liked. But it's okay. It's an okay little tree. We compromised.. Me and Josh went to Southcenter today, fun fun fun. We didn't really do anything, just walked around getting food samples and stalking hot guys... we followed this one guy for like 10 minutes.. he was gay and pretty like a girl. Good times. I bought earrings. Woo. I have other things to say but I'm not sure what they are. I'll keep you posted.
