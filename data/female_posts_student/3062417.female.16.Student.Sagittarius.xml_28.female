Well, I went and picked up my dress at Mimi's and then went to pick up groceries with my mom. It was boring. I love my dress though. It's the hottest.  Tonight I'm going to Battle of the Bands at Mt. Markham with Kim and Sarah. That's basically going to be the highlight of my whole weekend because my life, overall, sucks.  Song: Call me out You stayed inside One you love Is where you hide Shot me down as I flew by Crash and burn I think sometimes you forget where the heart is  Answer no to these questions Let her go, learn a lesson It's not me, you're not listening now Can't you see something's missing? You forget where the heart is  Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is  Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay    Waking up from this nightmare How's your life, what's it like there? Is it all what you want it to be? Does it hurt when you think about me? And how broken my heart is    Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is Someday if ever you love me you'd say it's okay   It's okay to be angry and never let go It only gets harder the more that you know When you get lonely if no one's around  You know that I'll catch you when you're falling down We came together but you left alone  And I know how it feels to walk out on your own Maybe someday I will see you again  And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend   Take you away from that empty apartment You stay and forget where the heart is  Someday if ever you love me you'd say its okay It's okay It's okay -Empty Apartment- Yellowcard
