So yeah, did my english final today, saw no major problems, probably not perfect but i see no need to fail...good times. I'm gonna go for lunch soon, and just to let you know Steph, i haven't eaten much yet and my stomach has recovered. Man, i must have gained 20 pounds over this weekend.   I'm getting my Bye Bye Birdie Video Tomorrow!!!! We HAVE to watch it!! Hey! Maybe at the all nighter!! Wow...the posibilities are endless. HAHAHA!! Man, Rick Mercer kills me...
