Why are people so damn annoying? It seems that I can't stand any of my old friends (except... 2 but that's not counting my friends from this year like Jessica and Savannah and Sammy) and those two I'm closer to than I have been for a while. One of my friends and I stopped talking for a while, and it was bliss and now were talking again and it's hell. I think Felicia knows what I'm going though. I seriously don't think I can stand the immaturity that is in our school for much longer. The freshman girls espessally. Speaking of freshman, PE today was hell. Mrs. Peterson really needs to be less stupid. Your holding the bat wrong. Swing once before I throw the ball to you. How friggen embarrasing can you get? It wasn't to me, but still. I felt bad for her. She also always favors girls like Sierra. Who I REALLY REALLY REALLY can't stand. I like Paige more than I like Sierra, which is saying something! Those girls really make me mad. Oh I'm so hot because I hang out with guys like Chris and Collin.. ooo look at me look at me. Damn.   New subject. Today I was in a good mood for most of it. I got invited to go swimming again this weekend! Which I'm rather excited for! We went last Sunday and oh I had so much fun. :D We got to hang out with some people that I haven't hung out with in a while. I got a little burnt but for the most part it was way worth it. Actually not for the most part for the full part. If I could do that everyday and have it be as nice as that. I so would! I can't wait until this summer! It'll be so great! Steve and Jeff are coming and staying with us in Maine for a couple of weeks. Steve John and I are going rock climbing next weekend, I'm looking forward to that! Steve is such a cutie! Which is kind of wrong for me to say. But I can say that I am totally totally totally over the two people that I've liked for a while (Cold soup and Jelly bean) So that's a good thing :) Makes me Happy and even when I hear Heya and I don't want to miss a thing I still don't like them :O wow ooo someones online :D That makes me happy! Well adios and I'll cya later
