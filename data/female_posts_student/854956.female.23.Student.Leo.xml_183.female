The only big difference between this and my UTSA webpage will be the UTSA one will include the midis that I've created.  OKay... so, you may go  urlLink here  if you'd like and check it out.  :-)  I also wanted to have all these pictures of friends and stuff uploaded so that I can access them to use them on my school page.  :-)  Enjoy!
