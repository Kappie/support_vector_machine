Then came the testing part...jeng..jeng..the filing was very yummy but then the "kulit" of the karipap was...MasyaAllah keras giler!!! tak der la keras sangat till tak leh nak makan but kalau compare ngan karipap org lain mmg ours waz the keras one aaa...my cousin was also there and she keep on comparing the karipap that we made with her mak tuk's...then again abang said cannot aa compare a spm level cook with a phd level cook...heheh what an xperience...overall i still think it was okay for novice cook like us but i wont try to make another karipap...not in 5 years time..ha..ha..ha the whole task was very tiring...  like i said before to cha and abang, beli jer la kalau nak makan sangat!!!
