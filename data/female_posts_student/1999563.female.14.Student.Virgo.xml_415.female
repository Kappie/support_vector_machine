Singing  "Yesterday" I danced and sung along and my mom looked at me like I was a freak. I have offically decided that cherry jolly ranchers are the best tasting things ever.  Somone needs to tell me a topic of something to ramble about. Whats the fun in rambeling when you know no one is listening. Any suggestions?!  Your friend,  Laura Fantora
