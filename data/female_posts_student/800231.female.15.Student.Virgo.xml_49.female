Anyway, I was getting out of the car when Steph and her current BF Wes walked pass. Steph said hello and told me to wait for her. Then she made out with Wes right in front of me. Great Steph, make me feel even crappier about being single. Oh well, I think she noticed how sad I was cause she threw her arms around me and said "Cheer up, babe. I love you too you know." LOL.   Today was pretty random. We had a sub in tech so it was pretty much free time. James came over and sprawled out on my desk. "Angela?" "Yeah?" "I love you." *Pause* "Can you break a five?"  Helen brought up something today that made me remember this lovely little embarrassing moment. A few months ago we had a huge statewide math contest. I suck at math but contestants were promised super extra credit for even showing up so of course Alice, Cece, Helen, Nagisa and I went. It was actually pretty advanced, hard for even the pre-calc students so we were pretty out of place. Alice, Nagisa, Cece and I shared a table. Anyway, halfway through the test I pulled a lollipop out of my bookbag and started eating it. Cece leaned over and said "Hey, no eating in the library." but I pretty much ignored her, she's a dweebus anyway. A few seconds later she said "Why the lollipop anyway?" I was in the middle of a problem so I was pretty distracted. So without thinking I said VERY loudly "Because sucking helps me think!" Everyone in the library turned around to look at me. Cue Helen from several tables away stating "Oh, so that's why you get so much thinking done in bed!". The entire library erupted into laughter and didn't stop until the instructor started screaming. Good Lord.  I think all the cold medicine I'm one is finally starting to affect my brain. I was reading a some local newspaper this afternoon and I must have read on title over 8 times before I figured out what it said. It was something like "Tension has risen over current accusations..." except I kept reading "tension" as "tomatoes". God knows why. I couldn't figure out what the hell tomatoes would be doing rising over anything though.   Well, Good Night.
