Having just gotten back from burying a family member, I was kind of numb to the whole ordeal, with the exception of making the comment to Kellie that "these things always happen in three's..."  Rebecca informed me a few minutes ago that Ryan Rimmer, a UF Parlimentary Debater I had the pleasure of coaching at a few tournaments last year, was killed the other day in a car accident.  I never knew Ryan well enough to really consider him a friend, but what I do know is that he was always a very pleasant person to be around, he was always kind and had a great sense of humor.  Ryan loved his teammates and his coaches and he had a huge heart.  My thoughts and prayers with Kellie and Rob and the rest of the UF team and Ryan's friends and family members during this time of tragedy.  I know Ryan exemplified the spirit of UF Debate and that he saw the team more as an extension of his family.  God bless you all and God speed, Ryan.
