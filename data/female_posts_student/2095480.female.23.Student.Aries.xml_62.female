Regretfully, your score on the written examination was not high enough for you to proceed to the next phase of the foreign service. We do encourage you to try again. Many successful Foreign Service Officers have taken the Written Examination several times.  We urge you to maintain your interest in Foreign Affairs and in pursuing a career with the Department of State.   Sincerely,  The Board of Examiners  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  There we go. I guess that's it for this year. I'll try again next year. I love taking extensive 7hr exams.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  At least I've now heard. I can now accept whatever comes my way. Still, lately I've been freaking out over graduation. I'm not freaking out in a bad way, but rather, an "Oh My God I actually am graduating and I must find a job" way. It usually results in my heart racing and a blank stare for a while into the vastness of the computer or TV screen.   I bought the robe and tassle today for the ceremony. Yayness.
