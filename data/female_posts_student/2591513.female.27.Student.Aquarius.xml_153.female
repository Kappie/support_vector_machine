Bailey's doctor noticed that he had some swelling in the scrotum area and says that it is highly probable that he will need surgery.  My head is punding from the latest news.  You all know how worried I get when Bailey has to go under.  I just hope everything will be okay.  Please keep him in your prayers.  I will be letting you guys know anything else as soon as the doctors tell me what the plan is.  Monday I have to contact Dr. Fleenor, his cardiologist, to let him know about what they found and if it is safe for Bailey to have the procedure done.  Just what the poor guy needs right before going to a new school.
