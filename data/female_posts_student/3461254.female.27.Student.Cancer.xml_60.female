I'm fairly crushed even though nothing is certain, but for the most part, I'm sure, even though my mind is probably twisted and all is still good for now.  I bet he never liked me in a serious way.  On Friday we went to see Fahrenheight 9/11 and hung out with his friends.  At dinner, we shared an appetizer sampler and we seemed like a beginning-dating couple.  After the movie we hung out with some of his friends and had coffee, then afterwards I hung out with him at his house and we talked about everything until 4:00 AM, even though I was in a really shitty mood.  Then I crashed on his couch.  Seriously, we talked about everything, even things he probably hadn't intended on sharing with me.  Then in the morning, he made me coffee and tea  As I was leaving, he didn't even want to kiss me goodbye.  Maybe it was the fear of coffee breath?    After seeing him for a month, he seems distant and not interested in seeing me.  Maybe that's just the way he is, who knows?  Maybe he's not a chit-chatty type of guy.  I plan on inviting him over to my place this Friday for dinner (I'll cook a turkey or something) and ask him where all this is going, or if he is interested in me at all.  After a month, I would like to know if I'm wasting my time.  Of course, maybe he's not sure, but I'd like to know if he is at all interested, even a little.  To be perfectly honest, he doesn't seem to mind paying for all my meals, drinks and movie tickets, so that's something.  Time is precious and I wasted more than my share on Luis--that's for sure.  I don't want that to happen again.  I'd like to know if I should put away my feelings for M. if they aren't based on a mutual attraction type of thing.  Even if he doesn't want to be anything more than friends, maybe that's just what I need--a friend.  I have way too few friends these days and my life is wasting away spent being lonely.
