So here's one that I really liked re-reading even though I'm not 100% sure what sparked me to write it.     Masks  Every time you pass by We avoid each other’s eyes I continue to walk and wonder why? If you failed to mention something is it still a lie?  Pretending I don’t know  Is a lie I started sometime ago The bitterness is strongly beginning to show I scream inside my head for you to leave to just leave me alone and go  But you don’t know what I do I’m forced to put on my happy mask and say nice things to you My fake smile and cheerful hello seems to have fooled you too If only I could believe it were true  Some time has passed since the last time we met You said you needed to talk and tell me about some things you regret I want to talk but am too upset How could you not tell me?  How can I forget?
