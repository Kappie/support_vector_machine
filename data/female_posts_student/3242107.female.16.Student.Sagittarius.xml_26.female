OH YEA! ok so the guys at school are still in state playoffs for basball. its great. baseball hasnt gotten that far since like 1977 or something. softball is like the only team that usually is in playoffs. but this week theyre playing at texas a university on teh baseball field there. last night they played rockwall and won 8-0 and then tomorrow at 2pm they play them again in the series. YEA BUDDY!
