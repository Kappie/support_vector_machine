We spent about an hour and a half there and I have to say I really was reluctant to leave. It is still al little weird going over there and not seeing my Nana but I feel her all around me when I am there. I miss her a lot but I know that she is an angel now and she is watching over Jesse and making sure he stays safe.   When we got to my Nanu’s house we found him behind the house in his vegetable garden watering his squash. It was very nice to see him outside enjoying the cool summer day and getting some healthy exercise in. He gave us a few tomatoes and green bell pepper from his garden. I could smell the freshness of the tomatoes as I placed them in a bag to take home. I always loved the smell of fresh grown produce, not like the stuff you buy at a grocery store that has no smell. Anyway, you can understand then why I was reluctant to leave and come to work today. I remember when I was little how I would spend many hours and sometimes even days roaming around their property, looking at the livestock of rabbits, hunting dogs, chickens and several other types of birds. One time when I was in elementary school for show in tell I brought in a rooster from my Nanu’s farm. I was so happy that I brought it in because I was showing my classmates something they probably never even seen before, but all I could remember about the experience was how some kids would joke about letting it out and making fried chicken out of it. I remember taking the chicken home and telling it not to listen to the mean kids in my class, no one was going to eat him. Not more than a month or two later I came to find out that a coyote got onto his farm and killed a bunch of the chickens, mine was one of them. I know now that I should have never expected any animal that could be eaten that lived on my Nanu’s farm, wouldn’t eventually get eaten, be it by coyote or by one of my relatives.   Just thinking about this story makes me laugh.   In other news, communications have been slim with Jesse. Jesse has been kept fairly busy which I am glad but at the same time I do miss our chats. All I really want is him home or just time away from the computer, that way I don’t think about how much I really do miss him.   I wish I could travel back in time to when I was a kid on that farm… chasing chickens and petting rabbits… just for a little while.
