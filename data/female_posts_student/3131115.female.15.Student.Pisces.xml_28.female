William just left and he looked pretty upset that he had to leave. Now I'm scared...extremely scared. *sigh*..I'll make it. Anyhow..I have nothing else to say. :'(...I love her so much I dont want her to leave:( She's not coming up next summer either so this sucks..It's going to be two years until I see her again, and maybe even longer. leaving now..
