Rather we sang rap songs and listened to music out loud for the first time in days. It was great. Then we all came back and ate lunch, and went and hiked 3 miles in the Bad Lands  While we were there, Me, Kansas, Joel, Kirby, Celeste, and some other people I don't know climbed up a hill/mound thing. It was so cool. Then Bertha fell down like 15 feet from thsi perch thing so now she's all scratched up. Then we ate at a food place. It was Indian Taco's again, and they were pretty good. Then once we got back we got to listen to Will Peters.  Will Peters (his white man name) is an amazing man. He was so cool and inspiring. He talked about how Christopher Columbus was a rapist, molestor, and how he used to cut off the breasts of women so they couldn't feed their babies and watch them die. He also used to give the elderly and young Indians blankets that had the small pox virus in it, without telling them so they would die. He would order indians to bring him gold, and when they brought him the gold, he thought they had more even though they didn't, so he cut their hands off. He molested children, and raped women.  Then he talked about Wounded Knee. Our soilders surrounded the camp site, and killed everyone. Men, Women, Children, you name it, they killed it. The little indian boys would be hiding in a bush, and the soilders would call them out and say "hey little boys, we won't hut you" and would then shoot them. They took babies, threw them up in the air and shot them. After everyone was dead, they left them in the snow to rot. One little baby who survived (lost bird) went onto become a prostitute and died in her 20's. It was so sad to hear the story.   He also talked about being a bonefide man, and how women are the greatest. He was basically male bashing, but since I'm a girl, I thought it was really cool. Then he talked about how everyone becomes alcoholics, and how they'res no where for them to go. There are no rehab centers, no place to work. The unemployment rate is 87%, and they can't get a job, so they have no food, so they drink because they have no self-esteem and they're depressed, and then they beat their wives, and molest their kids. It's a cycle, and there's no quick fix.   Then he talked about how we are all related, the red people, black people, white people, and yellow people. He also talked about the turtle and how it represents fertility. At the end of his speech, we all bought turtle necklaces. Mine is black and white and I think it's the best 20 dollars I've ever spent.   That night, we were all gonna' sleep outside together, but Barbara wouldn't let the poeple who had already slept outside sleep outside again. How gay is that? And we have no free time, so it's hard to get to know everyone. We have people here from SC (us), Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Conneticut. It's awsome. Then after that, Me, Kirby, Steven, Joel, Celeste, and Diana listened to Kirbys sex talk. It wasn't as good as the original one but it was pretty cool. Oh yeh, Bertha's a liar. Period. The End. ANd by the way, I HATE liars. Buenos Noches.  Liz
