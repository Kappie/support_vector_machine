In addition to washing two cars last night, I washed my car this afternoon. Not only did I wash it, but I waxed the finish, as well. Not only did I wax it; I shined the tires and rims. Not only did I shine the tires and rims; I cleaned all of the windows inside. So yes. I tried for perfection today, and I suppose it paid off. Tonight, I went to play tennis at BHS... That was interesting. I guess the quality of the courts has declined. Yeah, that's all.      Last song I listened to:   Magic  by Ben Folds Five.   Last album I listened to:   The Unauthorized Biography Of Reinhold Messner .   Last meal I ate:  Hot dogs and fries.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  Band camp is tomorrow! Rooooaaaar!   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I glanced at my periodic table placemat lying in my closet, saw "Ga," and immediately thought of none other than gallium.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   Don't Change Your Plans  by Ben Folds Five.   Favorite food today:  I don't know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Cleaned the car and played tennis.   Funniest thing that happened today:  My brother was operating his IRC chat server and he changed some poor guy's name to "imanidiot" without any warning. And of course this guy burst out laughing. It was pretty amusing... I guess you had to be there.
