What the fuck? I mean, holy shit, Kiddo. It's over. That means "Drop It." It's horrible, just utterly horrible. Especially because the day after he started that again, I responded equally with it as well...        Oh. Sara likes him even more now. Something about carrying her. It's horrible, just all so horrible. And it pisses me off so much.        I'm far too jealous...                I wish it had been me instead of Sara.        But it wasn't, and it never will be.                                Not ever.
