After skl.. wenta'  JP  with  jess  and  amily  meis.. :)) hahaa.. walked and walked..silly amily spent like $40 on pressies.. lol.. then she kept complaining and askin herself why she ended up spending so much.. lol.. then i saw my nokia 2100 cover.. i asked about 5 ppl oredi.. all 5 said  pink  suits me best.. so i'm prolly gonna save up and buy the pink cover.. then ate the snow ice thingy with hersheys chocolate syrup  YUUUUMMmmmm .. hahaa. kkies ;) betta' go find my physics file now.. i lost it =\ .. tc lovers (:
