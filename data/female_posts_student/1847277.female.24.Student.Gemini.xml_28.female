I bet not that many.  This is the first year that I've broken a number of first day traditions, including buying/wearing a brand new pair of sneakers and/or new clothes.  Ah well.  My Tues/Thurs. class kind of sucked, and I think it's going to be a great deal of pain.  Not as bad as Traditions was last year, though.    Oh!  Exciting news.  I ordered a laptop today, although the model I wanted is on backorder.  So it may be Christmas before I actually see it.  It's a 1Ghz Powerbook G4.  It's sweet ass sweet.  And I got a great deal.  So I'm happy that's over with.  Of course, knowing my luck thus far, it probably will never come in and I'll be forced to start the search all over again.
