As Matt put it : "Oh Thank Goodness, its a necessity! lol" which is cool. Its so funny, I start shaking when I see him come online! Its so weird!! But Matt is a really cool person. I am really happy, and thankful that I know him. But everytime I talk to him, I'm shy and nervous.. Really not me, lol.So now, I'm bored, lol. OMG, I cannot believe that I am 16 now... My golden birthday!! This is really awesome. I can't wait to get my presents!! lol. Bryan told me that while him and dad were talking, dad said that he was going to get me a FERRET!! WTF?! lol. But Bryan said that he talked him into something else.. heeheehee, that's my favorite song! LMAO!! Cool, now Something Else is gonna be stuck in my head.. No complaints there! Wow.. Im goofy...er... Now I have nothing to talk about! lol. I'm listening to Austin by Blake Shelton, it's one of the sweetest songs ever. I really like it. I can't remember if I wrote about Matt's new song, it's really good too, He told me just now that he is writing new stuff..YAY!! He is amazing like that. Well, I'll write more tomorrow with what all I got :D            ~~Breena            I wonder what you're thinking      When you look in my direction      Are you even noticing me?      Am I alive to you at all?      A shiver runs up my spine      WhenI hear your words      Do you know that you have that affect?      My mind clutters up all spaces      Images of us, that will never be      But I am comforted by these thoughts      So I will let them be, forever      As you get older, wiser      Always know that someone,      Miles and Years apart      Will always love you      Will always feel your pain      And will always know who you really are
