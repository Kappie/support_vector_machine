He kind of made me mad,   so I quit talking,   but he wouldn't talk because I wasn't,   and I don't think he quite knew why I was mad,   but anyways I hung up cause nobody was talking,   but asked first, "What are you doing?"   So I thought he might had fallen asleep.   Then he called back,   after like 5 minutes,   he said I'll call ya back in a few minutes.   So yeeeah, he hasn't called back yet,      and I don't think he is,    which is pissin' me off.   But I'm sure he has a good reason.   Anyways I really want to see him  ...*sigh* I hate to love,    really I do.
