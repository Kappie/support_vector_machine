I changed the whole layout four Paul's gallery and fixed a few errors on Paris'. I also deleted all of the junk that was uploaded on the site. So now, after all my hard work, I'm back at square one, and must restart everything! Our gallery has gone through many fazes. First it was like 12 pics on one page... then 3 catagories on one page, then it was 10 pages of random pictures, and now... now we havean extensive selection of pictures to add. So after I fixed all the layouts, I started grouping up all of Paris' pics, which didn't take longcause I had started yesterday, but when it cametime to do Paul's it tookALL day! I took a small break to eat, and hang out with my niece Jordan who came by today. She is such a hottie, I love her to death. (She's 1 year old now and has the blondest hair and the bluest eyes!) I was glad to see her cause it had been two weeks since I saw her or my sister, seeing as I just came back from camp. This also explains why I've been on the computer so much, I missed that too! I also had to catch up with my friends, so mydays have been pretty full, except for today... So I'm finally done gathering all the pictures of Paul I can get although I still need kid pictures of him, which I can't find anywhere...but whatever... I QUIT!! Anywho, I gotta go...
