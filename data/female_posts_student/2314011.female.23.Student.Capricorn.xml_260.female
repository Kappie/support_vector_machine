The Burley Independence Day Parade, that's what!  Picked up Grandma around 1030 and crammed our way to our spots just before 11.  Secured my grape cotton candy shortly thereafter and the fun was underway.  Couldn't help but think about the very different parade I found myself at last week, but I don't think Seattle-ites could pull off the major pieces of farm equipment and old men on mopeds quite like this humble town on the plain.  Mom slapped me when I accidentally called the female forest rangers hot, but she was also laughing, which makes me smile.  We're recovering from the whole experience by searching the (empty) air waves for entertainment.  Maybe we should break out the White Russians and invite some black ones over for a game of pool.
