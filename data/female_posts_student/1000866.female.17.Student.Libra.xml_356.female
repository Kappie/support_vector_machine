We went to Noodles, and played the penis game in the bathroom, and ummm, I sort of yelled it loudly and this lady opens the bathroom door and gives us the WEIRDEST look ever. Seriously. It was SO funny. I couldn't stop laughing. I STILL can't stop laughing. Oh well. Then we went to Starbucks and ran into Chris and his friend Sundeev. It was funny. We stalked them to their car then went to TCBY. I saw Diane finally at work!!! I'd never been to TCBY. It was nice. Then we went around looking for Chris' house for half an hour and ran into them and stalked them.   I don't know. I have mixed feelings about tonight. I guess it was fun, but in ways it wasn't. I don't know. My mind is playing tricks on me. I swear.  Why am I in such a rotton mood? Tonight was fun. It really was but I am in just an absolutely foul mood. Argh. I think I'll just go sleep.
