I'm not taking any today, b/c of the party and b/c I don't want to fall asleep at 7pm...  But anyway... not much is going on today.  Lainie's going to drop off Nick sometime, and I have to call K-dogg sometime after 5ish.  After Ken gets off work he's coming over here, and we're going to Robert's around 10ish, when he gets off work.   So yeah, that's my day.  fun fun...
