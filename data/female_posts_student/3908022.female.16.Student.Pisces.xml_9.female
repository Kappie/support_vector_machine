I'm celebrating her birthday with Amanda, Matilda, Filippa and maybe a girl named Ida on Saturday. That's going to be fun. Her mom always cooks for a thousand. :)  But anyways... As Yorda and I were walking down the streets of our city, I spot the guy that I have a major crush on. And he's smoking!!!!!!!!!!! That's so fucking repulsive!!!! GOD!!!! I can't even begin to describe how turned off I was by that! Geeez!  I can't even talk about this anymore.
