Yes I sat at my oldest daughter's small (very small) desk and learned about "New Math" so that I can actually stop fighting with Valerie when she does her homework.  One question to all the teachers out there..... WHY....  Yes I know, you read from the left to the right and you should calculate the same way...  It is so stupid and longer..  I know, it shows the kids the WHY of calculating.  It is just longer.  Anyways, tomorrow, my girls have no school.  So in the morning, they will do their homework  and I will do my stuff for  urlLink   ~Sandee's, A Breast Cancer Walk to Remember 2003 , this Sunday ~    I am so happy to help her this year. What a women. Missy is getting interviewed tomorrow for CFCF 12.  Cool... I am so proud of her.  In the afternoon, we are watching, ~ Daddy DayCare ~,  I am looking forward to it. And to finish our day, we are picking up my mom at the airport... CAN'T WAIT.  So have a great night and please..............Be Good
