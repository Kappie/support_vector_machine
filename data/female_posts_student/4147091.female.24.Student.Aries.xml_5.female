But I'm just happy I remembered the word. Especially since its the womens cycling today.  Today is my youngests counsins Christening. I was in Ireland at the last Christening to take place in this family. And the one before that was Katie, the girl I"m 'babysitting'. I remember the party after Katies Christening very clearly, which I find surprising because I was only 9 at the time. However, I won't be attending Isabellas Christening today. I knew about it, yes, but I"m house bound, with my parents with my car and Katies parents with her car. I received a call at 9:30am from my cousin to ask if we were still going. Appearently plans had been made without me to have me and Katie picked up for this little shindig. But its 9:30am! the Christening is at 11am. I"m just waking up, Katies still in REM sleep. Two girls, somewhat concerned with their appearence will take longer than one hour to get ready, its a law of nature........especially since I have NO appropriate clothing to attend. People should really fill me in on things that concern me.
