But I had skipped dinner, and when Lisa started heating up ramen noodles, it was like a siren song. So I whipped up a couple of baking potatoes into skins-on mashed potatoes at 11:30. Scrummy.  I went to the Hut for lunch today ($4.00 buffet to go w/coupon- they should call it "a fuck-ton of food for real cheap"). I brought home a huge salad to eat for dinner... and left it sitting in the back of a co-worker's car, along with a couple of moving boxes. Damn. Luckily, Lisa and her new school pal ordered the Hut for dinner, and I can nosh. Bonus: the girls at work and I have been going to Pizza Hut for lunch at least once a week for the past couple of weeks, and today we earned a free visit. So I'll be eating there again one day this week. :)  I am working my ass off (literally) on that Gazelle.  I registered for my classes online today. I'll be taking three English classes:  Advanced Composition  (which is required, otherwise I would avoid it like the plague-  so  glad I A.P.ed out of freshman comp),  English Lit of the Early 19th Century  (Romantic poets!!!! Yippee!!!!), and  Adolescent/Children's Lit  (which I hope will be as fun as it sounds- plus it's 400 level, like the English lit, so it counts towards my major). I'll also be taking  Elementary French , which is four mornings a week and is taught by the same scary woman who taught Latin my freshman year (I really, really hope she does not remember me because I used to skip her classes all the time and I got C's both semesters). And finally, I'll be taking  General Psychology , which is also required. Groan.  The way my schedule is set up, my first class on Mon-Thurs is at 9, and on Friday is at 11. I can handle this. My mistake freshman year was 8:00 classes on Monday mornings. I will NEVER make that mistake again. Give me the extra hour to sleep.  Plus, I'll get at least an hour, in some cases two, between each class to do whatever, which is nice. And I'll be out by 3 every day. Which makes plenty of work time, and plenty of study time. I intend to be a Time Nazi and make sure I have enough to do everything. Another mistake of my past.  I got my own parking space at work. Shame I only get to use it for two weeks, especially when my car is broken down right now, but hell. I earned it. And the sign is, as Jefe was quick to mention, "Hello-Kitty-pink." Awww. How cute. :)  Work rant:  Some woman claims I said "fuck" to her on the phone today. Funny thing is, Jefe and Posh were standing next to my desk having a conversation at the time she said it said it, and they didn't hear a word. But as I told Jefe, I was upset not that she accused me of saying "fuck", but that I didn't have the pleasure of saying it to her for real.  I have slipped up twice on the phone before. Once, I was really trying to sell this guy and he was being really difficult and rude and all of a sudden, some woman broke into the conversation and "Just who the hell are you?" burst out of my mouth. Got sent home for that one. Got yelled at, too.  A couple of years after that incident, a guy told me on the phone that I just "didn't give a shit" about his problems. And without thinking, I said, "Well, it's not that I don't give a shit about your problems; I just don't think you do, or you'd have started with us by now." The customer thought it was funny and laughed (and did end up opening his account), but Jefe's Little Snitch (a.k.a. Chili Dog) was passing by and heard me say it, and ran into his office to tattle. Jefe was cool about it, and just told me not to cuss on the phones again. And I haven't. Although I've really, really wanted to at times.  I do have  some  restraint. I just don't always choose to exercise it.
