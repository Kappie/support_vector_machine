I suppose it's like building a habit...Or an addiction (for lack of the use of a better, descriptive word). They do call it "eating habits", I suppose this is why I also believe eating meat lifestyles or vegetable lifestyles is just habit...Anyone can train themselves to one or the other. You need determination and you need some wallpaper and reason for action....It's not that hard..:P   I enjoy my eating habits now. I enjoy being a vegetarian and discovering all the interesting snacks and foods that are friendly to me.    I love how I started talking about this...I was told in a writing workshop that sitting down and just letting your mind flow where ever it likes is very good practice. Even if you start thinking about thinking nothing...They even said to write that down.    So here I am, mumbling on...Sporadically interrupted by the consistent blinking of boxes at the bottom of my screen. Demanding my attention at once. At this very instant. I suppose it's the price you pay for having a live, instant message conversation with your friend, while trying to type in your blog. Hah.   Well, to be quite honest, there is not conversation. We're just sending random emoticon symbols back and forth, oh, and we still are. I just choose the one that looks the most appealing at that moment. But I suppose I was complaining more about the blinking flash that turns into a constant, lit up box. Piercing me and hanging over me like a dark, microsoft blue cloud, urging me to raise my hand and click it free. But some how I'm lost in the rhythm of my keys. It's keeping me focused on this flow...This breath.   Ahh, but here we go again, another one has messaged me, so urgently, it seems. Summoning my attention and typing skills. Which usually come in at full in intervals.   So I'm back. I was just speaking with John, from 3 Guys.   We went to the Purple Pig today for lunch, in Bracebridge. I drove them (the parents) down there, so we could go to home depot to buy some supplies for my room. :D It was pretty enjoyable...I got to drive and we picked up this cool laminate hardwood floor for my room, a night light, a plant (i love it)...And some other stuffff...but anyways, to get back on topic...   We stopped there for lunch, it sounds like quite the meaty restaurant and it is, but they did have a veggie corner. So I got a veggier burger, with really good fries. It was cool...when we sat down there was a table of kids behind us and a table of four in front of us. Its strange how I remember those details. I think it's cause I'm use to doing table checks and seeing how many chairs, people, plates, kids, high chairs, etc. Hey, it's what being a busser turns you into, I'm a table hawk.   So ANYWAY...The table in front of us got up to leave and this weird, bleach blonde, scrawny coke addict came up and asked if we mided if she joined us. We were all so startled and shocked that my dad and I didn't say anything, and my mom just barely squeezed out a "no"...then she started rambling on how she had a rough night and that she just needs someone to harass...I don't know...It was very strange. She was obviously piss drunk and screwed up....she told us her boyfriend beat up her dog. I don't know, she was pitiful and rude, but I still felt bad for her, cause she was drunk. It gives me a ha  rd feeling, one I can't quite describe. I feel awkward, I'm put in an awkward position to choose either side...And I suppose I decided upon, "I'm going to ignore you and distance myself from you". But what did she expect us, complete strangers just sitting down to enjoy a lunch to do about her, the sympathy, drunk, stranger cause, invading our personal table.   Anyways...Moving on   I went to WARPED TOUR! Wow! WOW!!!   Fuck man...it was so awesome...I really enjoyed it..so worth it.   I met this guy, I moshed in the pits, felt the wrath of it's depths, became dehydrated, inhaled dust, had to pee badly, got all burnt, got bruised, was cold, hungry, filthy...Everything..it was what I needed...to let lose in those pits and just give Everything up. I lost a bracelet, She lost my aldo shoe. I dunnoo....it was just overall crazy and awesome. Saw lots of Huntsville folk "punkers" from HHS there.   It was a sweet time...I'd go back next year for sure...It's just such a crazy, different type of atmosphere and party, essentially. It's insane, you feel so connected to everyone and so alive, the excitement and the crowd drives me nuts.   Stef and Danielle. Fuck em'...yeah fuck Jamie's girlfriend too, while your at it. That's really I'll I have to say about that situation now. I know I had quite a lot to say about Stef early..but whatever. I don't spell his name right either...shit.   Anyways...what else..   My room is almost done (finally)...I suppose it's my own fault it wasn't done earlier, but it's coming along and looking good.   MIKE COMES HOME ON WEDNESDAY (which I could get the day off for)...oh well we'll still party hard, for sure. I love that guy!!!!!   But I suppose i'll be off to slumber...   it's about that time. I did I fair amount of catch-up...      Until we meet again, invisible friend, who so jauntily dances this sidewalk with me. So close, you peer through this dancing fools' own typed words.   Goodnight.
