We went to Sam Moon and we bought some things I got a new purse and some toe rings and my sister got some cheer stuff.     After that we went to Target to get some candy for Kendyls cheer group and we also ate some NaChO's! lol.     When I got home I saw some really rude messages on the computer that Liz left me while I was away. Yeah she had no right to say what she said to me...She thought I was talking behind her back (Like she did to me and Ryan) But I wasnt I was writing in MY journal so if she doesent want to read it then she doesent have to. She is prolly reading it now so...Liz if you are reading this you are prolly getting mad but Iam not talking behind your back... But anyways...atleast now I know who my true friends are...Ashley where are you?! Come home form Chicago I miss you!     But anyways I wont let HER ruin my day. I havnt talked to Ryan today but IAm sure I will later! Well that is about all...
