Freedom is cool and all, and I'm so thankful that I have it, but there's other things I would want to sing other than the National Athem...(jeez I need a spell checker)...But maybe..I'm just lazy.  I enjoy seeing fireworks, but I would rather do other things than watch a bunch of fire and chemicals expolde in the air.    Maybe I'm being Cynical.  But is it such a crime to not enjoy your country's Independence Day?
