I was planning on writing more tonight, filling in with stories, details, and the like, but I find myself feeling uncomfortable again for some stupid reasons.  I know that I have neither right nor reason to feel the way I do, and yet here I am.  Nerves frayed, acid rising, throat burning.  I need to figure out how to get a hold of myself, calm myself down, and stop thinking in this ridiculous and unproductive manner.  It's not doing me any good to be this way about things, and I know it - I just need to figure out within myself how to fix it.  There are too many important and pressing concerns for me right now to be thinking this way.  Gotta keep plowing forward.
