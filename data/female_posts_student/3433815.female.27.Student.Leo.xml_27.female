I really hate it when it seems that it is only REALLY nice beautiful weather outside, when you have to go to work or when you have the day off, but no one else is free! whats with that!!! It's crazy I tell ya!  I think this is gonna be a great month thats what I feel! Anyone that I won't see (KZ and fam, EFT  Teflon (mom too), BITR) have a great fourth of July, if you crave any of my famous jello come on by! Be safe and have fun! Love ya!! Wish me luck! :)
