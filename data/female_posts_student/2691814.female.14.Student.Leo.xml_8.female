Don't get me wrong he IS cute but...one thing...he's gay. Yes he's gay and there's nothing wrong with it. He'll be at the party on Saturday with his boyfriend Luis. I haven't met Luis yet but lookin forward to it:) Anyway,other than that i was so happy to hear from Brittney and Chrissie today! Our conversation was quite funny but im not gonna get into that now lol. For enlish class we have to write poetry. I love writing and all but I just don't like what we're doin right now. I had to write about 5 cheezy poems that really aren't any good cuz I didn't have any fun with it or have emotion with me. To me its just a school assignment right now. But it doesn't matter. So far...ppl who I know who are going to the party:Gabby me matt luis cindy(maybe) carlos of course there's gonna be family and other ppl that i don't know..but thats okay.
