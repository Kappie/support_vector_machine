The next big chapter of my life will be starting and it will finally be setting in that I am no longer a child. Tonight's entry is going to be filled with a couple of allusions to my shift at Pazzo Cucina tonight. For instance, "Tiempo y Silencio" is the name that a waiter, Matt, at the restaurant will give his next horse. For those, like myself, who need to seek out their Spanish speaking friends to decipher this not-so-foreign language, it means "Time and Silence". Its actually quite a beautiful name for a horse and arouses some interesting thoughts about life.  Another memory of this evening that I keep returning to is one of Angelo, the owner. We were discussing how I was having a hard time believing how short three weeks really are. (I don't know about you, but my past three weeks have gone by faster than it takes to count the days, maybe because its been so quiet.) In response to my amazement about how quickly sand falls through the hourglass, Angelo tells me that before I realize it I will be his age (a ripe old 33) and I will probably be pregnant ("out to here" he says, making the appropriate gesture about a foot away from his stomach) with a wonderful family to boast. I know he speaks the truth. I know that when that day comes, I will remember his prediction, and I know that those 16 years will feel like a day. My only hope is that when I sit back and really think about all that time, I don't remember silence.  Silence, while experiencing it, lasts forever. One minute of silence can feel like an eternity. But when remembering that minute at some later day, it holds as much value as a nanosecond. When I am 33 with a belly "out to here", I hope that I can look back on 16 years of adventure, happiness, accomplishment, maybe even a little failure (who learns anything without a little bit of mishaps?). I want to remember everyone who has touched my life, all the places I will have touched, and be ready for many more 16 years. Because really, who wants to remember life when they are old and about to die? Then you just get depressed about all the things you planned to do, and don't get the opportunity to actually accomplish them. Its funny how time works. Just when you have it figured out (which obviously, I don't), you've miraculously ran out of it.  Maybe its my nostalgia for everyone I've missed out on this summer. Maybe its my nostalgia for everyone I've missed out on all my life. Its not like I've purposefully missed out, it's actually exactly as Tyler put so perfectly: "It's not that my desire is false, but rather that my intention is optimistic at best and ultimately vapid", and that's rather sad. Things may pick up in the next few weeks as everyone realizes how close we are to saying goodbye. I sure as hell am going to miss all of them (even my very close family at Pazzo) but I don't want that loneliness to remind me of silence. Even more, I don't want my life to resemble my memories of this summer.       Per adesso, Buonanotte. Para ahora, Buenas noches. For now, Goodnight.
