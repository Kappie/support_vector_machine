UCAS, what do you all think of that? I feel that Tuseday was quite a waste as there were no art students and I really need to sort out how to aply to art colleges. I am sure it was helpful for people thinking of doing law and stuff, and for those who don't know what university is like. It was allright but I felt that it didn't help me that much.  I'm still at school at the moment, doing my english lit presentation with Jenna. We're doing 'Anthem For Doomed Youth' by Sassoon and Owen. Its all very interesting and fun filled. I'm looking forward to the English Literature trip next week. I have to take LOTS of photos and do sketches as I am doing war in art and looking at the death side of things. Oh that reminds me I need to purchase some pollyfiller to use in art... Right noted. But also one of my artists I am researching has created the metal (or wood I am not sure) images that are in the Ypres memorial. All very interesting. Someone said they didn't want to go to France for two days and walk around graves, it isn't their thing. But its not walking around graves. Its walking around history. Each grave, each man who has died has a story, each man has their place in history. Even the cemeteries have their own small story to tell about why they are there. Everything there has a reason. Even the ones who have no name. Thats like a instand story of sadness because they are lost and no one knows where.   Yea so should be good. A sad trip, but still good.  If you could could everyone do a blog please? Just a quick one at least...
