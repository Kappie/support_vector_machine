I thought I got up at quarter to two, but I guess it was quarter to three. Not that it matters, as I generally have nothing worth getting up any earlier for anyway. And, y'know what, that statement was just as true today as it has been most others. I got up, got online. No sign of Taylor, same as last night. Well, that's not entirely true. By doing some creepy stalker reconnaissance, I found out he was online from around 10 this morning until at least quarter to one. Just like how, after getting home from a wedding reception around 9:45 last night and wanting to do nothing more than collapse and talk to him, I found out he was on at around 1:40 PM long enough to discuss an av edit order with someone on Gaia, and then left. For where, I don't know. He wasn't on yetwhenI gave up and went to bed at about 2:30 this morning. And, yes, still no indication of life from him yet today, not since noon, apparently.   I know part of why this bugs me so much. Usually, he tells me when he's going somewhere, and for how long he'll be gone. Given, I wasn't online when he was, but he knows how I worry when he's not around. God, does he know. Given that, one would think he'd know enough to maybe leave me a PM on Gaia, or post at the shop, or something, to save me from getting in an anxious mood like I'm in now, and have been in every time I've checked MSN and seen that he's still not on.   Fuck. I know that he has a right to go places without informing me. Equally, he has a right to be out with friends, which is where I'm assuming he has been. But I can't help getting frustrated and anxious when he does go out. Part of it is the drinking issue. The other part is that he's been out more and more frequently recently, and with my ingrained sense of paranoia, I'm wondering if "friends" are just one female friend. Especially when he doesn't want to tell me when/where he's going. Which he also has a right to have. FUCK! but I hate this.   It's not his fault that I feel like this. It's not my fault, either, I guess, but that doesn't stop me from blaming myself for it, and feeling guilty. It's not his fault I don't have a life, and can't get a job, can't find local friends to go out with, can't convince myself to do enough driving to be ready for my G2 test. Not his fault that I have this fucking disorder which makes me look pretty much only to the negative side of things, especially when he's not around. Hell, I don't even really know why he puts up with me. I don't know how he can actually love me. Especially not if he has an actual girlfriend again that he hasn't the heart to tell me about. I can see where a preference would lie between having someone he can treat like a queen and see on a daily basis-- go places with, have fun with --and me, who's the equivalent of a nagging wife, butin text. He deserves better, but I can'tconvince myself to let him have better. Which is probably why if, he does have another girlfriend, or never broke up with his other one, he hasn't told me. I mean, aside from adding another crack to my heart, he knows I'm so fucking clingy I wouldn't want to let him go.   Anna's been trying so hard to get me to look at the other good things in life, aside from him. But at this point, there's not much elseto look at. Not when you're me, and having to light match after match to see any light when the shadows are closing in. Heh. I'm being melodramatic now, but it's still pretty true. I spend almost every day in front of the computer, or the TV, usually a combination of both. More often am I in front of the TV on days like today when he's not around. I'll talk to Anna for a little while, if she's around when I first sign on. Then usually our conversation dwindles off as she hints at RPing and I, not feeling up to it, don't respond. I might talk to a few others off and on over the hours, pending on who shows up. People I RP with. Sometimes Amy or Bethy or DL. As Ifail horribly at holding a conversation unless it has something to do with me or the person needs help, the conversations usually end within an hour. Taylor's usually the only one who'll take interest enough to keep talking to me even after I fall quiet and run out of things to say. That's if he's not busy talking to the swarm of others who IM him, that is, usually.   And there I go again, being unfair to him. *sighs* I never thought I'd say this, but I'm looking forward to therapy. If it can get me out of this crushing way of thinking, then, for the love of everything, strap me to a leather couch and teach me how to change this. I need to start seeing some good in everything, not just Taylor, so that when he's not around, I'm not reduced to this.. this.. whining, angst-ridden, useless lump of flesh, hair, and black clothing. I need to learn how to trust people enough to be the one to initiate being friends with them. I need to stop living this shut-in life style that's making me so bloody miserable. I can't do anything about a job, at least not any more than I have. Part of me feels like I could do something about not having any local friends, though. Maybe they're not all the crack-smoking asshats that I've witnessed so far, because I really haven't made that much of an effort to find out. I've done pretty much all I can to repel them, though. *sighs again*   As for my username on MSN, DL who will be reading this-- that was in reference to my cousin, who's been like my older sister, who told my mom at a wedding shower today not to tell me she's smoking like a chimney again. Given what I've said about today already, that just pushed me over the edge. I don't ask people I care about not to smoke (or drink, for that matter) because I'm trying to ruin their "fun". I ask them notto because I fucking care and don't need or want something terrible happening to them because of it. As I've said in past entries, it's just so bloody senseless.   *sighs* All right. I'm spent. Maybe I'll think of more to edit and add on later, but this seems to pretty well summarize my thoughts today.
