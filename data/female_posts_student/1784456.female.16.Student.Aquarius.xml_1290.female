Ask me on again about any news story and I will be happy to talk, in the mean time just bug off.  That is if your going to ask me about the news.  I have also decided that Champain is yucky, and insted of having that at my wedding, WHEN i get married, I'll have Ribena, or orange squash.  A little thing to think about;  why when u visit a friends shud u take ur own cup, and always make  your own drink?  All will be reavelled on monday! (I learnt this off a television programe, and no it was not Look around u!) Toodles xx
