"let he who is without sin cast the first stone" or something like that.  sorry i'm not perfect with my bible quotes.    but anyway, that's pretty much all i wanted to say.  i just wish i could live my life free of harrassment from other people.  these aren't the dark ages anymore.  we don't burn gays at the stake.  *kiss* to taylor -- whether you like it or not.
