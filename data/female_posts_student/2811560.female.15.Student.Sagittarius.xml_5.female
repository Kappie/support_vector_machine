Besides, I had no idea that sitting in between parallel bars was a sin that would damn me to eternal hell fire. Speaking of hell fire, Kelly Kennedy wrote this awesome article on religious extremists in the LP Perspective. Jeff and Cory got all pissed off because of what she said, and they said they were going to go to the Dean. Yeah, right. I say go Kelly. If you can piss anyone off that much with an article in your school newspaper, then you must really be talented! Lol, but really it was a great article. Anyways, I had east ensemble after school. Its really not that bad as long as we're not learning new choreography. Otherwise, its fine. I told Ms. Gibson that I wasn't going to play piano for one of the songs we're doing, and much to my surprise, she was really nice about it. She even told me I could come in early and practice on the piano in the chorus room, which I can't do anyway because I have wind ensemble in the morning, but I thought it was nice of her to offer. This is Ms. Gibson I'm talking about, too. Interesting.
