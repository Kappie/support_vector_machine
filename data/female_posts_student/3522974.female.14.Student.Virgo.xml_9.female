Dam it was bad. But, when we got to the courts the team we were supposebly playing for the second time, weren't those pplz (or so we thought) we didnt recognise any of them. Not even Miss. I-don't-brush-my-teeth. Neway, we played them scoring two goals in the first couple of minutes which kind of held a margin of 4 points between them and us the whole game. So at the end the score was Roseville 12 Kambala 6. Great game. Yay for us. But no more bball unfortunately. I wish it went for two seasons. Well i g2g steal crunchie chocolate from my dad. Ciao, CM.
