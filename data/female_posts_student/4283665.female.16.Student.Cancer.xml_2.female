But i didnt want to hang around...so i left. saw evan at the video store, where i encountered kookie, then later michelle, then i left. watched reservoir dogs with my brother. and now im here. lame day. FUCK I JUST REMEMBER ITS MY DADS BIRTHDAY TOMMOROW. JEUS FUCKING CHRIST I DIDNT GET ANYTHING. i feel bad.
