I was thinking...if i hadnt' taken that first step and called her that fateful day, we might never have met, and had this wonderful relationship....but honestly I love my Cassie, and do miss her.  She's depressed right now, and I wish I could help, but my problems are different.  I think it's terrible that I can't find a decent guy (isnt' that the neverending problem), seriously, just when I think I find one, they turn out to be a-holes...the one i want moves all the time, so I never get to see him, I have one now, and I don't know where that is going to go, but I decided that I am going to take it easy, and just see what happens, I worry myself over things like that.  I saw one of the OLD ones at Fat Tuesday's last night with his girlfriend, that always makes you feel good, ESPECIALLY since (not to be conceited) I looked WAY better than she did, sigh, o well, I guess the nice girls are not supposed to find good guys, we're destined to date douche bags...Evie is upset, Cassie is depressed, Heather is struggling with herself at this particular moment, and my girls Candace and Sara are swimming in the single pool with me.  What is WRONG with us, I swear, If i knew that i'd be a millionaire.
