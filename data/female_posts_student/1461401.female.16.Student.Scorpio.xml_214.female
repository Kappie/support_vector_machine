It was pretty fun, we were singing christmas carols and Ian stopped by and acted like a hobo. It was very cold though. Then we went back over to his house and hung out. Right now I'm in the middle of trying to organize us geting together tomorrow to see Lord Of The Rings again. I'm a little worried, as I'm starting to question weither or not it's going to work, but we have time...  I think...  Oh well. It will work. Mom's working on my costume right now, and I'm very grateful for it. My hands are very numb... Good music is nice. I'm thirsty. I'm also talking very randomly, and without much purpose, but oh well. It happens sometimes.  MEOW!
