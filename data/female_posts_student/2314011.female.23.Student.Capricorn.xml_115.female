Tonight, I asked a bag of runes a not-at-all-specific question about where I am, where I'm going, who I'll meet.  It told me to start (and/or continue) letting go of my old ways, worn habits, usual modes of operation.  The Jesus-fish-looking symbol was good for a round of laughs, but the rune's description made me smile.  It was the perfect reminder and the best encouragement.    I looked at the people around me, my friends, and saw the truth and reality of its entreaty.
