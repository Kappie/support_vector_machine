We just got our report cards back and I didn't do very well on my math exam. In fact I failed.   I'm smart, though, I really am. I know when my best friend is upset, and I know exactly what to say and how to help him. I know when to keep my mouth shut, or else my sister will go off on me.   I know how to dance, and can do it very well, no matter what Zoe Vonder Haar thinks.   I can sing, I can dance, and I can act. I have an A in chorus.  But in real life, that makes me a nothing. Why couldn't I be good at the important things? Like my sister. She is tall blond,blue eyed, she'll have great boobs when she's older and her skin tans in the most amazing color of peach and brown.   I am short, not fat, but not skinny, I am very pale with freckles on my face and arms. My boobs are okay. My skin isn't great. Yeah. Acne is a pain in the ass. I'm tryin to take care of it. It's working, so far. My hair, well,it's sort of a dirty brownish reddish color that you can't really describe, and my eyes tend to change color from grey to green. I had to put grey on my id because i didn't know what else to say.  No matter what, she will always be the pretty one. She will always be the one they notice first.  Signed The one with the freckles.
