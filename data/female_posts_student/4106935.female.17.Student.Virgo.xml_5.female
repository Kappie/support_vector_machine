They have never once sat me down to talk to me, find out what I do, find out how much I love their son but ook. I'm certainly not going to bend over backwards for people who act nice when I'm around and then talk shitty about me when I'm not. There is no point, and I'm not going to cry about it again. Fuck them. Anyways, I just got off of work from the fabulous Pretzel Time and I feel like shit. It was so hot and I pretty much walked home in 100 degree weather. Bloody bastards.
