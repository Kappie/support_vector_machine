But see I was going to go, I decided to tan like around 11:30~12:15 so I could actually have enough time and be ready by 1:15 so I'd get there at 1:30. Sometime around 12:30, while watching 2 Fast 2 Furious (wut wut) Katie, a girl from dance texts me and asks if I can pick her up for practice. Well that's when I decided yeah I don't want to go. So I lied and I said I had to go to physical therapy. And now I feel bad for that. In a way I really didn't want to pick her up, even though she lives right by the high school. I forgot where she lived and that whole subdivison is one big maze. Which is why I feel bad now. I'm sure if she hadn't wanted me to pick her up, I'd be at practice right now. I was just scared about going out of my way. But the good thing is, since it's fixing to storm, I would of have to left Jenny outside in the storm, so at least that's a good positive for staying her. And my back has been bothering me since last night, so I rather just lounge in bed or take a hot bath then going to practice. And there is always next Monday, so missing one won't be so bad. And I did go last Monday, but no one told me there wasn't practice, so there =P  Only 8 more days and I get to be with my Davey! :) I'm so excited! It's going to be so great, being together...We'll make it!   Go to bed Dream of you That’s what I’m doing these days
