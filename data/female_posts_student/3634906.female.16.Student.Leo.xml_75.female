And so he thought that I didnt want to be there last night and that I wanted Max there. That was not the case at all... Amanda and I were just bored at that moment and we decided that we would send Max a message... We were just being stupid and having fun. But I guess it was a bad move on our part because we hurt his feelings. Now I feel really bad about it. I didnt mean to. If I would have known that it was going to make him mad I wouldnt have done it. Oh well, I told him that I am sorry, because I am. But still his day should be good. He gets to go and pick Britt up from the airport tonight. She gets in at 6:30pm and he is super pumped. I am too but I'm not sure that I will even see her until wednesday so... well whatever that means.    I might have to watch my little sister tonight because she is sick and my mom doesnt want to take her to karate if she isnt feeling well... but I think that she might go. I dont know for sure until 4:30 but if Dannylin goes then I will call Mandy and maybe she and I will call Max??? I dont know... Maybe we wont... My older sister Nicole is all bummed because she has to go back to work tonight but you know she only has this week and next week and then shes on leave!! But the doctor says he doesnt expect her anytime soon... Poor pickle... shes got to be wishing she would just have the kid now... (by the way... Nicole's nickname is Pickle, just so you know who I'm talking about when I say Pickle)    Is it weird that I miss Veronica so much?? I mean I dont really know her and at the same time I love her to pieces. I think she is such a sweet sweet lady and I really do adore her. I cant wait to see her this weekend. And now I kind of think that saturday the 14th I am going to do something with my daddy because I cant really on my birthday. Even if I am just another thing to get scheduled into my mother's life I have to spend the day with her. But I think that I might also go out with friends. Probably Brittany. And maybe Josh or someone like that. We'll see what kind of mood I am in when that roles around... These next few days starting friday are going to be busy... actually thursday will too because I am going shopping for Britt's present. Well they should be fun even if all of it is a little overwhelming. Once my birthday is over everything will settle down and I will try to enjoy my last 2 weeks of no school. AHHH... school starts in a month... thats so freakin' soon... I just wont think about it. There we go thats a plan... I'm not going to even remember that school is going to start. Although I do have to go to registration. But even so... I'm not going to think about it.   Well I have to go and shower still because I have been super lazy so I still smell... Hopefully tonight will be worthwhile. We'll see, maybe I'll just sit home and read and clean my room. Or maybe I'll go out. I dont know. I dont even know what I want to do let alone what I am going to do...   Adios   -gabby
