Now my part time job is fairly part time. I work one nigth a year. Oh and it's a fun job. Every year my dad holds what's called a plot tour, where he invites his customers to come and see new kinds of grain and other crops available, and after they do that they get a free meal. So my sister and I have been serving rootbeer floats at this for probably 6 or 7 years. Last year my brother joined the team. And more than serving floats our job is to laugh at the farmers aweful jokes. My little brother on the other hand rolled his eyes at all the farmers, and gave them funny looks. I hope he did better this year. But I wasn't allowed to work this year, because I'm sick and for some reason my paretns don't want to contaminate all my dad's customers. What is that?  Oh well. I got to spend some quality time with my wardrobe, sorting out my clothes. I haven't done that in a while. I was amzed at some of the stuff I found. I haven't found my Korczack shirt yet though, so I should really get back to it. Have a wonderful evening.
