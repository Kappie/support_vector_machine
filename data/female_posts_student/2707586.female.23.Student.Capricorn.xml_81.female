She is another filipina and I thought I would like her until my family called tonight. Roomie was on the phone so she answered it and without even asking who it was or if it was important said "could you call back later, I am on the phone." Now I am sitting right next to her and I thought it was one of her friends because she didn't even ask who it was or if I could call them later or anything. So I was pretty surprised when my cell rang and my little sis asked "is she always that rude?" So now I have a decision to make and being that I am apparently not a good person and I like getting people back especially when they do rude things to my family, I have to decide what action to take, if any. Now my first thought is how much I am going to miss drying my hair in my room because its really a pain to have to go to the bathroom every morning just to dry my hair and I never take everything I need so I always end up taking a few trips so I think I will be drying my hair in my room regardless of who is here with me. This usually happens at 8 MWF and around 7 TTH mornings. I know it isn't nice and I can think of a hundred reasons why not to but I just can't tolerate rude behavior, especially when she didn't even ask if it was important or who it was. Maybe its the lack of alcohol that is making me mean but if you have any suggestions about things I can do, I am all ears.
