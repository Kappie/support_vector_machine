Dear Brownie,           Hmm...went to watch The Day After Tomorrow with mummy,wow it was WONDERFUL! It can be counted as one of the best movies i ever watched.The effects are certainly better than what i was anticipating!Hehe...long time never went to take a break le...went to Orchard Road Shaw House ...the night view is certainly pleasant and sort of romantic yar.Now then i know the journey is not that long! So perhaps mummy shall take me to Orchard Road occasionally? Then with my friends we go Shopping too!          Then just came back from Science Centre from the LORD OF THE RINGS EXHIBITION,it was marvellous too.Wow,these few days are sure  MOVIE days.The exhibition showed the unique clothes and the weapons as seen in the movie,although i don't really like the movie,i still give thumbs up because i also learned some effects of how they do the movie!Today was a fruitful and learning day!         Yeah...just now went to play soccer with my siter,it was tiring!Cux that idiot sis kept on scaring me with the dog and seems that the cat and the dog became so good friends and trying to make me jump at my own shadow!HAHA..lalala...well that's all Brownie! :D
