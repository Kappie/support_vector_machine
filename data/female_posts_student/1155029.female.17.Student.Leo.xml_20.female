I'm feeling sort of stressed, lots to do before I leave for Japan on sunday. Two weeks off.   I was dragged into doing makeup for a production of The Tempest this weekend.  There was loads of faerie make-up, which was really a blast.  All swirls and flames and such, it reminds me of my Tempest.   I missed a violin lesson, My father can most un-understanding at times, I could see him holding himself back from strangling my already grounded throat.
