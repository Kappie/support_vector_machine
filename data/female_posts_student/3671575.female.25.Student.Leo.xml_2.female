I figured that I’d have some time to do all the updates that my poor old Mac needed, and this morning as I was trying to load in the most current operating system, it just stopped working. Honestly I was just looking for an excuse to get a new computer, but I was hoping economically it would be feasible for me to purchase another Mac. Not the case. I am concerned at the prices of the Apples compared to the PCs. So, I did it, I bought a PC. OH MY! I am typing on it now. At least it is cute and kind of “Macish” so I don’t feel like I am cheating too badly. You know the reality of it all, is that it was just not practical. Like the Microsoft hating person I was, I had nothing Microsoft on my Mac at first, and then every time I would download something it would bog the poor little thing down. I’ve put my beloved Mac to rest this evening, and I am not an official PC user…OH MY!
