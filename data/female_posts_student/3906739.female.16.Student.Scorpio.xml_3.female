You get to know people from different schools and you also get to learn about the country they're from. The classes here are really interesting, we don't have to do homework becuase all we do is work in groups to get to know each other. The teachers are really nice and they always are smiling .One of the best part of this program is that we get to go on field trips every thursday, this lasttwo thursday we went to the park and the zoo we're also going to six flags. I feel that this program is going to help to find the right college for me because the teachers are helping us to look for the college that is right for us. The questions that I alwaysask myself is how would I be able to afford college or the universy?and would I be able to go to college or university?are the teachers going to be like in high school ? how am I going to get there?how much do I have to   pay  ?.
