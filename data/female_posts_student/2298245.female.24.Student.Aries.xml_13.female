As a straight person, it continues to embarrass me that there is any question as to the right of homosexuals to marry.  As a Christian, it shocks me that so many others of my faith are willing not only to verbally condemn what they feel (however erroneously) is a sin, but are desirous of passing judgment on their fellow man here on earth by restricting their rights, even though it is God's place to judge and not man's.  And as a conservative, it angers me that so many so-called conservatives are willing to intrude on people's private lives and private decisions and are willing to  urlLink expand the power of the federal government  in the process, to achieve what is essentially a non-libertarian end with what is essentially a liberal means.    It's a world gone mad.  But I guess none of it should surprise me in the least.
