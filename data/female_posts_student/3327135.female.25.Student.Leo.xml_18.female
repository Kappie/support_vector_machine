Anyway, I had already told some friends about this.   Guess what? I had managed to collect all three of Flora's album!!!   Hehehe.. All thanks to having a great and lucky roommate!!! She found the CD in a shop near Sim Lim. I was so happy and excited when she gave it to me.        Picture is taken by Sony Ericsson T610 phone camera   To think of it, I think I was the lucky one! Why? It's because when she got home (on the night she had bought the CD), I was busy watching Flora's series (A Taste Of Love) and I didn't care much about her, even when she asked me questions regarding Flora's first album. Then, all of a sudden, she gave me the CD and said that it is my early birthday present!!   Luckily, she wasn't angry with me for not paying attention to her.
