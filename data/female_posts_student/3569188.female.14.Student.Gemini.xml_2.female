I figure I am just not gonna bring it up, so she will eventually realized it's passed, and feel awful. I don't know, aren't I mean? I don't care. So anyway, tonight I am going to completely organize my closet and room and get rid of everything I don't need. Yikes..I am such a packrat that this is gonna be hard. I'll get it done somebow. Once that is accomplished, I plan on designing a new blog or site layout. I don't know which one I want to do right now, but most likely it'll be the site. I am going to do a black/red/pink theme- you know, eventual color fading and stuff. It should be cool.   I need to start working on the violin. I had so many summer goals, I just need to start breaking up the time of summer and start planning everything out. I am going to bed early tonight so that I can get up early and go running. It's gonna be a good summer if I can keep myself busy. I admit- I am still hung up on Corey. I feel bad about Nate. I mean, I used him in a way to try to distrat myself. But I don't know..it's just that I have this wierd spot for Corey in my heart as a friend and that seems to be affecting the way I still feel about him. One of the most dragged out crushes ever. I'll get over it. Just need to keep distracted. Grr, I am so angry at myself for becoming attatched at all. I mean, it was one year and I've already let 2 people in. THat's two more than I would prefer. I don't like it..I have good reason too. What's the point of letting people get close to you if you are only gonna get hurt. That's why it's casual dating and superficial teenage relationships for me next year, thanks. Whatever. I need to have more of an open heart. I mean, the problem I have is that it's so big and gullible. I hope nobody ever finds out how to work me. If they can get that close :-P. Not gonna happen.  So anyway, I need to drink more water, I am totally dehydrated. Still mad at Erika a little. I don't know why I get so annoyed with this, but I don't know. Wish me luck with running in the morning...it'll be torture. ;-)
