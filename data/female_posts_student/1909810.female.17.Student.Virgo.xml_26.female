I really enjoyed it.   But I was ignored today, and I have never been so...obviously ignored as I was today. It was strange. Oh but it made me feel good don't worry.  We were trying to figure out rides from theatrikos to the mall because some people didn't have a ride, someone said they had room for like...4 and I said I had room for 3, and the person with room for 4 got 3 to go with her and then someone was asking for a ride and I said right to her face I had room and she kind of just paused..and then turned around asking for a ride from someone. Hmm...it's nice when you can't even fit in with peace members, that's alright though, my goal shouldn't be to 'fit in' with people, I guess I don't...mind being a loner.  AP chem is a fucking hard class...and Mrs. Flaccus taught us something we needed to know for a lab  after  we turned it in. It was like 'oh ok thanks a lot' so I bet I failed that, woo. That's alright though, I tried.
