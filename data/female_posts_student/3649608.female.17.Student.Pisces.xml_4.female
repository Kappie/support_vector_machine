I suppose I'll just have to do double posts. :)   I don't really mind. It's summer and I have loads of time.  I think I'll make this my absolutely true, very boring non-embelished blog. If some I know actually finds it then they're too obsessed and stalking me.   I'm off to see if there's a profile thingy or a friends list.
