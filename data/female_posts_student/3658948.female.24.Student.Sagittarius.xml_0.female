My boss was (and still is) a snotty, manipulative bitch with atrocious spelling and grammar in addition to a massive inferiority complex. My first day off the job I was a little stunned, kinda pissed because I forgot my favorite pen in the office, but otherwise thrilled at my new block of free time. And the freedom has only gotten sweeter.  However, I'm being careful to remain occupied and active despite my unemployment, and not to fall into my old pre-employment "ER" addiction. (No, Noah Wyle or the Croatian guy didn't do it for me; oddly enough, it was "Rocket" Romano, the little snide bald guy that turned my crank. I know, he's old, short, bald, and not even remotely attractive -- or at least, that's what everyone tells ME. I liked him because he was the only non-schmaltzy character on the show, he had those hot little forearms, the best lines ("What's the matter? Is Prince Harry in rehab again?"), and a lovely bald head. To be bald with a gorgeous skull is really something, especially with his bone structure. But hey, I'm over it.) Killing Romano with that stupid helicopter ruined that series forever, even though it was already swirling in the crapper by the time he kicked it.   On Friday I'm supposed to finally get my Desserts for Democracy bake sale off the ground. The proceeds are supposed to go to the John Kerry campaign, but honestly, I don't like him. I don't care how many medals he's won in what situation that I most likely couldn't have done were I in Vietnam; politically, he's a big wuss. The only thing I like about him is his wife -- apparently she's got enough backbone for the both of them. Yes, Howard Dean was too politically inexperienced to maintain frontrunner status, but I don't think Edwards should have dropped out. After Dean, I liked him best. The idea of Dick Gephardt becoming Veep irks me, because then it'll be TWO wussy Democrats in the running, and I am sick to death of seeing my party bend over for the Republicans. I'm thinking long and hard about emigrating to Canada, but I figure, hell, THEY'RE the ones that suck, why should I leave? Also, their version of the neocons may win prime minister elections, thereby ruining that option as well. Hmmmm.
