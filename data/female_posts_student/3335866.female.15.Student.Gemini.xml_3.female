Good entry- 'Wonder Killer'; that was the first one I really liked. As the title says, blah blah blah. This is all miscellanous nonsense. It's going to be that sort of entry, I think. I've just read an interview with  urlLink this young author  and am now feeling completely inadequate. I mean, who am I to think I could ever be a writer? How pretentious and forward and assuming is that? I'm not upset- the 'TGIF' description of my mood is much more accurate- I'm just succumbing to the doubtful side of my personality. Young writers are people like Zoe Trope. Cool people. People who like to write all the time. Well-spoken people who are bored with high school. I love high school. I'm loving all my classes. I have a zit-scab on the tip of my nose. I ramble on and on about nothing. I'm pathetic. I start every single sentence I write with 'I'. Okay... will update when mood changes and weather clears.   Today was an unusual day. Field trip. Last night I wanted to watch  Monty Python and the Holy Grail . I'd never seen it before. It was 10 PM. I was only going to watch for a few minutes, but it was fuh-nee as hell. You know those parts in movies/TV where two characters are having a conversation and it's kind of pointless and you zone out? Like when Lana tells Clark to stop with the 'sekrith and lies'. (TM  urlLink TWoP)  Yeah, so when something like that came up in THG I started zoning out. It wasn't until ten minutes into it that I started realizing that there were actually jokes being cracked during those straight-faced exchanges. Okay. All of this will actually relate to my field trip at some point in this narrative.   So, it was 10, and then it was 11, and I was still watching, and by this time I've made some canned raviolis and settled in. I mean, it's just a Friday field trip where we're going to do stupid pointless Biology-class things like seeing how much salt is in the water and looking at starfish and listening to long-winded tour guides. My mom always lets me stay home from things like that, and I was having too much Saturday-type fun (this is what my Saturdays are always like; yep, it's mad fun to be me) to go have Tuesday sleep. Okay, this is turning into 'My Monolauge On My Boring Thursday Night In Which I Didn't Even Watch The  Frasier  Finale'. Long winded much Poire? Did I even have a point with this? I guess this whole thing basically started out because I... I dunno, 'cause I wanted to explain how I almost didn't go on the field trip. This is starting to bore even me, and by now it should be obvious that I just lurve to talk about myself.   Long story short, I was having fun, I didn't want to go to today's (I thought at the time) stupid field trip, I asked my mom if I could just not go, she said yes, my sis got pissed, my mom took it back but then winked at me behind my sister's back (I love my mom), I then got into bed so as not to alert my sister to the deception, I started feeling guilty that my Dad's $14 field trip deposit would go to waste, I started feeling guilty that I was going to ditch my BF (best friend) and Bio teach (after she gave me an extra day to get in my permish slip) and I wasn't even getting to watch the movie though I was getting to catch up on much-needed sleep because I've gotten 6 hrs for three nights in a row, the guilt overwhelmed me, I resolved to go to school, I went to sleep, I got up at 5:30 to go to the gym and I felt like Utter Shit so I had to drink much toffee-flavored coffee, I came home singing 'YMCA' at the top of my lungs and woke sis/dad/my mom's friend who's staying with us and is the one who got THG in the first place, I went on the field trip and had a kick-ass time.   And the award for the longest run-on sentence in the history of ever goes to... Do you even have to ask? Apparently I am incapable of making a long story short. Or maybe I'm just still hyper from the coffee. Or maybe I'm just insane. You tell me.   Okay. TODAY WAS AN UNUSUAL DAY BECAUSE I WENT ON A FIELD TRIP!!! I now resolve to stay on topic. God, I've drained myself. I have like nothing more to say. Crap. This blog thing isn't exactly going great; I mean, I'm writing tons, but it's also draining tons of time. Maybe I'm not doing it right. I don't want to not record this field trip though. The few diary entries I do have are kind of precious to me. They reveal lots of stuff that I'd completely forgotten about. Okay... focusing. Right. Usually I'm really quiet. Once when my best friend revealed that she was friends with me to this kid she was asked if we had been introduced through sign language. Jerkwad.   Today was completely not your garden-variety no-words boring-Bio field trip. I mean, there were long-winded tour guides, but the stuff they were saying was completely fascinating. Like, about marine biology and the tectonic plates and how sedimentary rock was formed by dirt being smushed. I'm an ignorant geek and I love it. Also we saw jellyfish and starfish and crabs. I held one of the latter and just thinking about it now makes me giggle. I'm extremely ticklish, so when I was holding it the little legs were scrabbling all over my hand and I was completely cracking up. I tried to pass it off to this other boy, and I think he thought I was holding a vibrate-y sex toy or something, I was laughing so much. So that was good. Have you ever seen a jellyfish swim? It's extremely cool. It's like this clear sack full of water ripples and contracts and it's very pretty in a creepy way. Also we played volleyball and I  didn't suck!  If you knew me you'd know how unusual an occurance this is. I am the original klutz. (Seriously, look up 'uncoordinated' in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of me.) It was fun and I laughed and snarked and ran after the ball and hit it pretty well. If I don't over-analyze the experience I think I'll come away from it with a good memory. My lunch sucked (a made-in-5-mins PB plus a Coke plus half a donut), but the company was good. This whole thing took place at this rocky beach in Jamestown. I totally established myself as the class's rock-climbing champion. I went further and faster than anyone else.   At one point most of the prep-type boys in the class stripped down to swim shorts and got in the water. I averted my eyes for most of it, though; I knew if I looked I'd have to stare, and that'd be way uncool. One more thing- I came away from this with a new crush. I now have two/three unserious ones and this new official one. It kinda helps that there's a tiny tiny chance that he might have a crush on me, though I mostly doubt it. You know what I love? When you make eye contact with a boy, and he was looking at you first. That sends shivers down my spine. When I'm looking at a boy and then he looks at me I just feel uncomfortable. Last great thing about this trip: this was like the first time I actually felt that I could actually go up to a boy and start a conversation. I didn't, but I felt like if I'd wanted to I was comfortable enough to actually do it.   There was only one other notable event today. On my way home from school (I walked again) I was mistaken for a prostitute. Consequence of being a white girl in a black neighborhood. It was  three o'clock  for Chrissake though. Whatever. I need to go read recaps now. I'm tired. I don't want to write anymore. Hopefully over time on the blog I'll be cured of long-windedness.   Currently Reading:  Second Helpings  by Megan McCafferty. I'm reading it for like the sixteenth time. Literally. I love that book. I've given up on Jack Kerouac for now.  Cat's Cradle  will just have to suffice as this year's Beat book.   Goodbye anonymous web-surfers.
