And I'd rather some different things to be goin wrong but you know I can't really decide on all of it.....but ok well Austin Cato and I are in this fight and I mean I've told him I'm sry and everything and I have NO clue what else to do to make it better...I mean I love him to death as a friend! and just I don't know it bothers me that he and I aren't talkin....and then twice I've really messed up..I don't want to go into detail about those but they're getting better slowly but it's not going quick enough!!!.....then I got some pictures back last night I was just kinda goin through em over and over and couldn't get enough of em....I love em! aha but they were of mainly me and Jenni Lynn....gah she's SUCH a great friend! I mean she's ALWAYS been there for me and then I got to thinking...where would I be now if she hadn't come into my life?? I mean honestly she's like the only girl-friend that I have that I would trust with anything and would just tell my entire life to! I mean I was sittin there thinkin about like the future ahha and I was takin this quiz and I sent it to just her and well alot of my answers were based towards her...and I mean she's like a sister to me...I can tell her anything and everything... I love her soooo much! and I mean when she and I are together....we are SOOO weird!! ahha It's really funny! aha I mean we can just be ourselves and can let everything out! I mean the true me...only Jenni knows that girl....I wish everyone did but it's hard to always just be yourself but I've set a new goal for myself...."I am my own hero and I'm reachin for the stars"....so I mean I don't know life is great and I'm hopin it'll stay this way although I know there will be some hard times along hte way but hey I have Jenni and with Jenni and God I can get through anything.....I love you so much Jenni Lynn Tabb!! You're the bestest!!! Here comes Elroy!! ahhah Love you!! BFF!!!!
