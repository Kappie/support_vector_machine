They tell me to take anything i can get.....and i will with in reason, i have got a brain so i believe i can do better than some places like picking up the litter on the road and other stuff id just rather not do thanx. I have also realised my blog isnt the most intresting of blogs, far from it actually, but then again i use it just a s a diary for me and if other people choose to read it then that is fine but if they say it isnt intresting i already know so please keep them kind of comments to yourself but any others with mere revalence are welcome. I still believe i am spending to much time on msn and have began to limit myself to a few hours each day, hopefully in theese few hours each night i can update my blog with my random thoughts or aims for the day but again i am signing off for tonight. Farewell and God bless.......believe me if i had a good quote to put here i wud....so at least you now know it was in my thoughts.
