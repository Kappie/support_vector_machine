Lincoln, our rivals, are able to score 2 goals in the 4 remaining minutes!!!  Damn Mr. Smare and his subbing incapeablitlites!  We tied Lincoln, and they are shit.  Shit I tell you, SHIT!!!!  Grrr...arg! Well on another note, I hope your guyes finals went okay.  I'm sure I failed Chem and Bio, but there's nothing new on that note.  Also, what are we doing after school tomorrow.  I have practice 1-3, but after that I'm free as a bird (have you ever seen that Daria where she gets grounded for staying out late so she plays the harmonica and her dad asks her to stop so she's like, "When I play this old harp, my soul flies..free as a bird."  I love that episoad!)  On another-nother note, I might be able to get the truck, but Jason, don't get your hopes up. I'll try to set up a Marissa taking the car, but its not a guarentee.  Oh, if you are shopping, (this might sound a little concieted) but you don't have to wait for me, my presents have already been purchased.  While on the other-other-other note about the party, I don't think I am going to spend the night.  No offense to anyone, but I don't really like spending the night at peoples houses unless I get to sleep in a bed (if you know what I mean).  So anyways, if my damn computer will reconnect to the network, therefore the internet, I will send this charming compostion.
