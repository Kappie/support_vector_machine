He's tall and skinny, and when he's either in a good mood or really really sadistic (sometimes both) he's really beautiful... There's only two problems I can see that might keep us from getting closer. 1) He's a homicidal manic 2) He's a character in a comic called Johnny the Homicidal Manic.  Oh well, there's nothing about that that I can't get past...   mmmm, johnny...
