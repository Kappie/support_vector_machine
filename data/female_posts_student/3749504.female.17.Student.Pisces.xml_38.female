They tax food, clothes, gas, income...parking...anything they can. And where do their taxes go? IT'S A DAMN MYSTERY. Because their interstate system is run-down, you have to pay for everything (WTF? Since when does PARKING A CAR need to be paid for? IT'S NOT LIKE I'M DAMAGING THE FUCKING CURB! There is no rehabilitation needed! Why do they make you pay to park a car???) and then some...it's so sad. Here in Oregon we are one of the few states without an income AND sales tax. We can buy our damn .99 cent sodas and not worry about having to dig out an extra 7-8 cents for TAX. And we can buy our $20,000 Camrys and not pay $2000 in TAX. It's the OREGON WAY. Plus we have legal abortion, euthanasia, and gas-pumpers. YEA! GAS PUMPERS! I DON'T HAVE TO PUMP MY OWN GAS HERE! I CAN JUST SIT ON MY FAT, LAZY ASS AND NOT WORRY ABOUT IT!  I love Oregon. It's the place to be. And this trip made me realize it. Oregon's an untapped treasure trove of liberal politics mixed with small town America.  And I absolutely adore Berkeley. Four years there would be fine for me...as long as I didn't have to drive a car. Because parking is unseemly down there - I'd rather take PT and deal with the filth than the traffic + parking fees. Although...the shopping is nice - very original - but Ashland and Portland are better for it. And cheaper. Plus there's Reed...I have to decide whether I want....well, let's make a list. Pro/con for each school.  Shall post it later. After I make it. And Grant, thanks very much :D apparently Blogger sends you an e-mail asking you to join the blog. So I'll get on that right away. Soon. Maybe tomorrow morning. 'Cause my eyes burn.  Tomorrow...more political rants in Civilitas. Probably...the immigrant/president issue. That's going to be a hotspot in the future.
