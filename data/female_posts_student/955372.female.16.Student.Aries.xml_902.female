Well actually it doesn't hurt that badly but when i try and... walk it like won't let me so I end up like limping unless I'm going like negative 2 miles an hour. And if I try to run like I was a few seconds ago I end up doing this like crazy hunchback of Notre Dame thing. It's really weird looking.
