Then I went to guitar and he gave me some lead stuff to play with, which I picked up rather easily, and I think I will enjoy learning. It's very cool and professional sounding.   I spent a good part of my day writing an email to heather, my new, Canadian/Scottish, lovely friend. ((her blog is stinkstankstunk)). Should I post our emails up here? They are pretty interesting. I'll have to ask her if she minds.  Mom was totally crocked when she came in from pappaw's house tonight. mammaw wondered why she was so upset and she didn't want to tell her, but mammaw thought it had something to do with pappaw's health so she kept pestering and my mom kept yelling to the top of her freaking lungs "close the goddam door!" and mammaw kept saying "if you say GD one more time, I'll stand here all night" so they continued in this pattern for a while, but eventually gave up. I'm sick of my mom's bullshit. Being crocked all the time and then taking it out on us. fcuk a dcuk.  I've been so resilient lately, numbing myself to everything because it seems so bad I don't think I'll be able to keep it together... It all seems like a bad dream now. But then, this whole "happy" thing, doesn't feel right, like maybe there is something I should be upset about, I just don't remember what it is.  I had a dream last night where I went to a bank and saw nikki working there. i told her about it today and she said she doesn't work at a bank, but there is one next door. See! I'm telling you! i can atrally project, just very poorly. i looked it up today, and apparently falling halfway asleep and then doing whatever i want to in my head is not the proper way of going about it. So tonight I've got a little experiment to do as far as that goes.  I also read up about wiccans, extremely interesting. Would i make a good wicca? i bet i would. i believe in all the stuff I've found on the internet so far, channeling, atral projection, being in touch with nature, it's good stuff.  But at this point, the majority of my beliefs change as often as my underwear. ((and i change underwear as much as everyone else does))  Ok I'm pooped out and i still have a research paper to correct and reprint. i think I'll turn it in late, either that or do it in the morning.
