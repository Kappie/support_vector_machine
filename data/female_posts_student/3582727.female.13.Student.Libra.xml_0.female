But I'm just not sure what they are. I know that they exist, just beyond the realm of my consciousness, and that all I have to do is seek them and I can pull them from the corners of my brain out into the open. I just haven't done it yet. I know there are things I want to do with my life, and I have a vague idea what they are, but I haven't put in the simple effort necessary to organize my thoughts and dreams and actually begin to realize them. Each day I think,  I should write something today , but then I find myself spending another day and night sitting at the computer and accomplishing nothing. I think of it, but I tell myself, "No, wait 'til tomorrow. It's too late now; you can spend all day tomorrow on this." But I never get to it. I want to make something of my life, I want to change the world, but...but I'm afraid that I'll never actually  start  anything, and I'll end up just like my parents: holding boring jobs in office buildings, working a standard eight hour day, hating my job but lacking another option. Lacking the discipline to build another option.   But what the hell is the point of sitting here  blogging  about this? Why not just get off the computer and actually  start?  See, that's why I mean. I'm just so messed up right now. I'm such a procrastinator, that I almost will myself to continue putting everything off until the last minute. But when you don't have a deadline for something, there  is  no last minute, so you just never accomplish it. You end up achieving only the minimum. I don't want to live the bare minimum.  Ahh! Help me! I'm losing my mind!
