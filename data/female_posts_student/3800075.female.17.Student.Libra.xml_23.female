Well today was jacqueline's birthday- Happy Birthday Jacklie (even though you dont read this ha)  I love Jacklie!  I love lots of people though!  I love Emilie- shes such a badass, she even sits through our boring politcal talks,  and Adam- hes the coolest nephew i have (hahaha who i might have gotten a little to close to back in the day)  and Amanda- defintely the coolest niece i have!   Leslie- well i wrote a whole blog on why leslie is the coolest girl...in the world :)  and Michelle- our talks are the best, she helps me out a lot  and Jessie- shes a youngin too but she sure knows how to party(been awhile though)  Jon- what a sweetheart (he smells the best!!!!!!!) Sammy-  he is a funny kid and very caring i hope he doesnt move away and leave me id be sad.  ohh and theres more.  The extended fam.  Whom i dont know as well but are still the coolest people Nathan, Stetz, Zacher.  hmm theres probably more.  i forgot and im sorry.  ill get them in here later though.  like casey- the real family so he doesnt really count, but a cool kid anyhoo. I dont know what i would do without these people.  My life would be empty.  and next year when we all leave i think im gonna have a tough time at first.  ehh we will see.  Bush is an idiot Aww jesus sorry i dont know where that came from just popped out.  Its true though. Last night we had a party at me cabin.  It was pretty sweet.  casey was fucking toasted  after drinkin 13 beers and bonging one last one he was pretty much a goner.   It was funny though Sam passed out at like 10 30 ..pff pussy :)   so it was me jacklie and nathan watchin casey jackassing around  Then casey dropped off and soon jacklie did and it was just nathan and i... nothing happened godamnit!  we just sat by the fire till like 4 30 then talked awhile in the kitchen...  He's cool.   DAMN ME.  why cant i just be more guylikeable.  there was Erik but hes a little mental so... doesnt count.  Well i know my problem, and i hate myself for it.  Anyway.  jacklie is off to tijuanna and michelle and leslie are in idaho with their men and i dont think ill be goin out for awhile so there will probably be a few more entries before the weeks over.   Tomorrow i actually have to clean monaghans damnit!  ive said it forever but tomorrow is the day.  have to do it.  well i dont know what else to say really so i guess im just gonna head- going off for a promising tomorrow.  -I'm thankful for cocoa pebble beach at night with the stars- Until Time Next
