" "Never look back until you can no longer see forward" "There`s a light at the end of every tunnel, just pray it`s not a train." "The only time success comes before work is in the dictionary" "Anyone who thinks sunshine is pure happiness, has never danced in the rain" "Life is like a beautiful melody only the lyrics are messed up"
