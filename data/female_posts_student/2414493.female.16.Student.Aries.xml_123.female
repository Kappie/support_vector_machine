At any rate, when I found out that it didn't work at 8, I promptly retreated to the backup plan, Bailey. Fun. And now I'm here, yapping away when I'm not supposed to be.   Harvard plans(, Charles): I'm leaving on the 22nd and flying to Newark. I'll get to Boston by the 26th, but my parents are coming along and we're flying American. I think that was just the highlight of my day, talking to Dad about Harvard. It's going to be awesome. The rest of Friday, April 23 was simply mediocre.   And it's quiet. I like it. And then Steve IMs me. Thanks, Steve.
