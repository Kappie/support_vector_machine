Pretty soon I'll step into the bathroom and take out those contacts...  Am I allowed to say that I'm pleased? It's like last summer all over again, except in reverse. I listened to him practice today, he just put his cell phone on the stand and you could hear him breathe in for one last breath before he started playing, etc. We both sent out letters today. I wonder what this card is supposed to say, for from what he tells me it's supposed to be witty or have some other sort of kick in it. And I ask myself, what is this?! Is it even right, after all the stupid little things that happened in between? How is it even possible that this is so much more the situation I would have preferred a long time ago, and it's happening now, after everything's done? But I can't complain. It just has to make you wonder, what's a friend? For I can honestly say that he's the one person outside of my family (or even including my family, sometimes) that knows the most about me. Granted, not all those parts are pleasant, and sometimes that holds me back a bit. He'll say random details that I swear I didn't tell him but apparently I did. It's just some sort of weird connection, a pattern we accidentally fall into. He actually shredded the journal. I can't believe it.  Put in alumni names at the Crimson today. I met one girl from Beverly High (I think her name's Brittany?) in the Mail Center (where I received a lovely postcard from Peter) and we walked to 14 Plympton together. It's just menial work, yes, but it's the Crimson! I kind of spoke to the president, Erica, for a minute or two. I must have seemed like another passive, timid Asian who wanted to go to Harvard, etc. but the more I go into the Crimson offices the more I realize that I honestly love journalism and the environment and the cameraderie and everything that comes along with it. I'll try to go help out some other time, but I have papers due.  On page 519 of Proust. Out of 606. I want to finish as soon as possible so I can take care of this anthropology paper.  I guess you could say it often takes unexpected circumstances to make you happy. But how long does it last? And how real is this?   "Yours is a farce, which I merely laugh at." I like that line. I forget where it's from, though.  Anyways, good night. Back to Proust!
