I am also very sentimental, ya know.... In the end, two vampire hunters became three.... One is a half- vampire, the other is a sentimental vampire, and the other is the sentimental vampire's lover. You try to guess it yourself. I can't reveal too much. It is only the first day.... Oh, halfway through the movie, I rushed to the loo A.K.A the toilet. I can't tahan, bladder was swelling and bloated. So I missed a small part where Jackie Chan fought the vampires. I am so sorry to the audience that I had stepped on their feet. *blushed* I was seated at the back and in the middle, a little difficult and tedious. Sorry again to those audience who read this blog. I was at J8 watching the 4.40pm show. Haiz... A- maths never do and heck it. I am so confused with v-t and x- t graphs and the word problems. And I HATE  sketching  graphs. I mean, you draw will be better, why sketch when the results and answers are easily shown by drawing graphs? Jeezz... Hate A- Maths. Hate 'O' Levels. Hate Life.
