But tonight I couldn't resist. I just spent over an hour with my favorite Chopin and Debussy pieces.  On most sleepless nights these days I daydream about my adventures in Europe last summer. I saw some amazing places. Lake Lugano in Switzerland topped them all I think. The water was blue blue blue. I'll share a picture here and say goodnight.           More European train stories to come... you've got to hear about my Amsterdam blackmarket drug story and late night escape to Paris.        Cherio!      Mariposa
