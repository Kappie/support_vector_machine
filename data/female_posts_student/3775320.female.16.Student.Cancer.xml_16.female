However, it made me tired and content, so now I feel like I have a  right  to waste a bit of time.  Sad eh?  Actually, my life is sad.  Everyone my age seems to be ambitious and know what they want to do when they grow up.  I don't really feel like I have a passion for anything.  Even people who are like:  "What are you thinking!? Of course you'll find something.  You're smart.  I can't though ...blah blah..."  are more likely to find  something  to do.  When I say I can't do anything, I really can't.  I'm interested in a lot, sure, but it's only passive interest.  Everyone else I know has at least ONE thing they  want  to do.  I just  want  to do nothing.  Not that I'm lazy [though I am], but because 'nothing makes me want to do it'.  Every single day, I don't have things that I want to do.  I just have loads of things I should do, or could do, or might be interested in doing, but don't really want to.  And I settle for the one I don't want to do the least.  It's very sad.  Someone help me.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I like to watch TV, or play computer games.  I actually  want  to do those things.  But lately, most of the computer games have lost their charm.  And our TV busted.  We'll get a new one soon though.  Arriving this Sunday or Monday.  Then I'll have at least one thing to do.  My future career - Watching TV ?  huh.
