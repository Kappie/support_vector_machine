I stopped for a snack in Gilroy, and then stopped again at the rest stop south of King City, and made it to Melissa's house by 4pm. 101 really is a pretty drive. I even enjoy the Salinas Valley. It makes me feel all Grapes of Wrath. Of course, Tuesday was a beautiful day, and getting to Pismo Beach and seeing the ocean was stunningly distracting. I had trouble focusing on the road the water was so dazzling. When I arrived at Melissa's we chatted for a bit then went over to her mom's place to enjoy the view. That neighborhood reminds me of a more beachy Oakland hills--everything is really nice, but still a little bit funky. I finally met Melissa's mom, sister and stepdad, who were all super nice and charming. Melissa's mom, Kathryn, treated us to dinner at this sushi/fancy chef japanese place in downtown Santa Barbara. That town is a little too trendy for me, and I understand why Melissa identifies more with Goleta after the visit. Melissa showed me around, and I even saw IV, which seems like an odd place to live. I like Davis better as college towns go.  Melissa and I got up early to go to Disneyland, and it was a pleasant drive despite LA traffic. We analyzed issues in our lives and with our families, which was interesting. Disneyland was somewhat more crowded than I'd expected, but it is July, so I probably shouldn't have been surprized. We went on most of the big rides, had a tasty lunch in Frontierland, and had a very pleasant morning and early afternoon. Then it started to get very hot, and I started to feel more woozy and out of it. I was having trouble focusing so we decided to "rest" in the enchanted Tiki room. That probably wasn't the best idea, because by the end of the show I could only see half the room. Yes, a migraine hit. The rest of the evening was a blur, but I can't thank Melissa enough for being so understanding about my discomfort. I still feel bad about cutting the evening short. I think I might need to go to a doctor about my migraines, because this is ridiculous. It really kills the rest of my day.  So after sleeping the whole way home in the car and then passing out soon after we got home, I woke up kind of early, shower, and read my Us weekly I'd bought in case. I wanted Melissa to sleep in since she stayed up late driving me home. My drive home was fine, and I stopped at the factory stores in Gilroy to avoid some of the San Jose traffic, where I bought some undies at the Jockey store. I also got back to the bay area at the same time as Jerm left work, and we ended up driving together on the freeway home. It was very funny. We had dinner at Dave and Alexa's so Jerm could help them put up their new ceiling fan, and I took the old one--I'm starting a project to modify it and put it up in the bedroom because it gets so hot. I'm going to paint the front bedroom next week, and then I'll attack the back bedroom.
