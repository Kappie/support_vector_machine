I felt it was about time it was read.  I don't know why, but....     I can't write love poems.  The love, the hate, the joy, the pain, I just can't seem to put them into words.  Give me eight words and I'll write you a masterpiece, Recall a childhood memory and I'll tell you the most poetic of stories, But ask me of my first love and you'll probably end up reading a story about apple sauce or a sassy shade of pink nailpolish.  I want to tell you how happy he makes me, how absurdly sweet he is, and how when he fights his cuteness he only becomes more so.  I wish I could write down my pain and frustration, Turn my tears into ink and write an epic poem for the ages.  I wish I could write you a poem on how I care about him so much it's stupid, but unfortunatly, I can't write love poems.
