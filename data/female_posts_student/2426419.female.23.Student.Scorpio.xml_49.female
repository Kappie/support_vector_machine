Jesus was different in every aspect of who he was, but he offered the kingdom in ways that could be understood because he talked about things people understood (lost sons, wheat, bridegrooms) i think the other part of our "language" is the church. we provide opportunity to see that our story is real and that it works. i said the other night, the greatest presentation of the gospel is the redeemed community being what it ought. what do you think? j
