Armstrong's  urlLink WEAR YELLOW   campaign to raise awareness of cancer has launched the latest item - the very visible yellow wristband. Bearing his signature mantra LIVE STRONG , the yellow circle is a poignant reminder of those whose lives have been affected by this plague. Available  urlLink online  or at  urlLink Nike  stores for $ 1.00, they're best bought in batches to hand out to friends and family. Help raise money for the battle and look fabulous in the mean time!
