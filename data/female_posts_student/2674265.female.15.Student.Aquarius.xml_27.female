Ok can you say insane?the diffreant color jelly braclets. So i got home and looked into it. On the internet. There is a game called SNAP. "One person attempts to break or "snap" a sex bracelet off of another person. The broken bracelet then becomes a "sex coupon" that the snapper can exchange for the sex act signified by the bracelet's color. It is cheating if you simply pull the bracelet off the arm without breaking it, or use a knife or scissors to cut it. The game is rumored to have first been played at college fraternity parties." The meaninggs of the diffrent colors. "Black: sexual intercourse  Blue: blow job (alternate meaning: lap dance)  Green: cunnilingus  (alternate meaning: outdoor sex, hug)  Clear: whatever you want  (alternate meaning: hug)  Orange: kiss  Yellow: hug (alternate meaning: analingus)  Red: lap dance (alternate meaning: French kiss, oral sex)  Purple: anal sex  (alternate meaning: holding hands, doggy style)  Silver: fisting  White: flash your tits (alternate meaning: gay kiss, French kiss)  Pink: flashing  Gold glitter: make out  Brown: toss my salad, i.e., analingus  Glow in the dark: using sex toys, e.g. vibrators, dildos, etc. " Its sadning. From what ive seen nothign has come of  it but in some schools they have had them baned. Although it could just be the idea. But i think tah it is really sad that sex is know as it is as such a young age.(some websites i looked at called it a media myth) Its supposed to be something really special between two married adults and this takes away what is specail about it. The fact that its with one person whom you truly love. this is not the only thing taht does this but it did really catch my attention. its even been noticed as recognized by 3rd graders suposadly. How the youth today is so ammune to seeing a sex scene in a movie  compared to are parents and there parents who would never have seen it on TV because it was not aloud. eyah anyways its stupid. There bracelets!!! People need to grow up just a bit.
