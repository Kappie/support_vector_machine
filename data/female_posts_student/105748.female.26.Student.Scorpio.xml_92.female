Wait for him to what? Wait for him to grow up? He does not have the right to make you feel low. Why be miserable when you have the opportunity to be happy?    By the way, I don't know if you guys have noticed but I've moved the blog. It's no longer at  chingay.net/groupblog  because  chingay.net  seems to have disappeared off the face of the web.. The new URL, should you feel the urge to see the actual page, is  geocities.com/chingsnotes/groupblog .. It's longer, I know.. but we don't have a choice ~~ we're internet squatters !     And since noone wants to go for the blurb thing.. I've decided on a series of questions that everyone can answer and we can put it in the right-hand column.  ALIAS: [nickname]  SIGN: [zodiac sign]  BDAY: [year is optional]  HBBS: [list your hobbies]  LCTN: [location.. city, state]  How's that?
