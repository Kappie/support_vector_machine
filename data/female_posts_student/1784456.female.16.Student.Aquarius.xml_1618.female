Mostly: get fit, but I guess I'll actually stick to that one when I get nearer to going to Kygrystan! *i think that's how it's spelt...* I didn't tell you I was going? Well it's in 2005, but it costs £3000! Eek! That's a lot of money! So I've been bag packing like crazy!!! Ahhh! Haa it's going to be soooo fun though! Who cares if we don't wash for a month! We'll all stink so nobody's gonna notice! Well actually... I think the people on the plane back might notice! Oh well, their loss. Oh I'm having people staying over the night New Years Eve... err sorry peeps but I invited so many people that I don't know if there's gonna be room for everyone! I guess I'll just sleep in the rabbit run, Lynne can have the rabbit hutch and Laura can go in the garage.
