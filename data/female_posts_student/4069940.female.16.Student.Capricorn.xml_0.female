Don't get me wrong, I am like any other American, and I don't have any problems spending $100 on shoes, but I never really thought about exactley how much we do, until now.  Take camping for instance (being that it is the inspration for this post).  I'm going to be in the wilderness for a week.  Ok, the only people around me are going to be doing the same thing, and I'm sure that the people I am going with have seen me at worse anyway, so why am I packing my make-up?  I'll tell you why.  Because our society says it is the thing to do.  In fact, it not only seems wierd to pack everything I usually use to get ready in the morning, it's wierd NOT to.  We work all week, (well I don't, but SOME people do) just to pack up our trailors and tents and pretend we are homeless??  Except now, camping isn't cool.  Staying in a huge trailor as big as your house is though.  Becuase again, society says so.  So you know what?!?!!?!?!?!  I'm freakin rebeling.  I'm not going to get ready and do my hair and put on layers of make-up, just to walk to my campsite and play cards.  And I am sleeping in a good old fashioned tent with out a toaster or cable TV.  Wish me luck America, I'm ruffing it....
