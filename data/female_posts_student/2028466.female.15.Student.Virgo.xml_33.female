I went to the Halloween dance...It wasn't the best, but I guess it beats sitting at home alone, or actually with my annoying sister, for around three hours, or more. Dang...I danced with Bucky....haha, I'm so surprised...then there was this other dude there, named Gage I think, who like, suddenly liked me or something, and I just met him at the dance, so yeah. It's all messed up, lol.  Woo Hoo! My best bud got his new computer! I missed him so much :D lolz, even tho he goes to school, I don't usually see him, but anways, I'm so happy! I cried last night b/c I realized how lucky I was to have him as a friend, as well as other people.  Oh yeah, it was Tamara, Chris, and bucky, who talked me into going to the dance...but guess what, my mom was a chaperone...so yeah, besides that minor detail it was ok  oh darn, bells about to ring, gotta go
