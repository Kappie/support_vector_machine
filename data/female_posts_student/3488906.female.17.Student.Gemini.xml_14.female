Then we somehow ended the conversation because there was a sms coming in. ( She called to my handphone ) Ahah, Siew chien is still the top.. we talked for almost 2 hours ( my god ) 2nd , Bluewhale ( 1 hour ) 3rd, Janet ( 40 minutes non-stop ) and 4th, Danny ( he called over from n9 and the duration is about 20 minutes or a lil bit more ). Danny's ranking was once the first but after siew chien came back, whoa ! LoL~ girls usually talk much than guys do, isnt it?  Hmm, i'm looking forward to kee tzuen's reply from friendster. It's always fun.. fun to wait for one's reply ... i'm quite eager, and i dont know why? i guess i hafta train myself with patience one day.. else i'm really gonna get crazy because of my stupid character. Well, not to deny, i get nervous easily, at times, and this is a bad thing to do since i cant even handle myself, how am i suppose to handle things i am supposed to handle? LoL~  Something fun went on today. Pigzi, aloha, lico, sky , and some strangers (keigo, joeytee ).. a few of us went on yahoo messenger and had some voice chat. I was actually facing problems on how to use my mic, and i somehow got it right ! LoL~ it was fun ..pigzi's voice sounded "man" comparing to aloha's , lico is really good in singing but aloha teased her that she cant "tarik" when she sang the song ( forgot which ) ..duh, that stupid aloha never changed his habit ( teasin others ), and sky is very very friendly. Both lico and sky cant stop chatting when both of them are holding the mic.. LoL~ they call the 2 women, pasar malam -__-'' ( which is sooo true ! ) Aloha did something.. weird, i supposeD?  he asked weird questions and proved it himself, which is, are we able to hear one's voice from the phone if the mic is put next to it? the answer is YES. Everything wasnt right and sky can even sense it ! we cant seem to hear aloha's voice cause lico put the mic at the wrong place...( yeah, the talkin part ) and everyone was laughing.. She looks like a happy-go-lucky person to me, which makes my mood even betta , i would say ! But the bad thing would be.. since i'm using the older version of yahoo messenger, my ym kept on hang and i missed the aloha's voice part !! and it's just not fair ( acting like a mad cow.. ahahhaa )  I went to Siew chien's house. For the first time, i was being so punctual and i arrived earlier !  We first worked on the card i wanna make for him.. it didnt turn out that nice but i've done my best ( at least that's what i think ) Then she taught me alot of things i hafta do.. and i feel so "spirited" to do it.. i must do my best and not disappoint her , don wanna let myself down at d same time.. i cant bear the shame. She's helped me alot in everything.. MAybe i know i just needed a guiding friend, who's willing to teach me things. And I know i'm some type of person who is never keen in learning, lazy always... duh -___-''  Okay, i MUST study at all times... i lost to tht kim in some "fields" so i must win her in studies !!!!! ( i know this sentence looks stupid to anyone who's reading.. but who cares? )
