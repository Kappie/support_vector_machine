Altho it does give you REM rebound cuz I had a dream that I got a truck for Christmas and my dad dislodged the house from the ground. And then I was trying to finish both English projects and the Psy paper in one night, and I was talking to someone about the consequences of not doing one of them, and how they would effect my grade. The house one was scarier, tho. It had a lot to do with open machinery...I  HATE  open machinery, almost as much as much, if not more than, I hate clowns.  And everyone needs to watch the Scary Movie series...best movies ever made.  Whurr r u goin shopng?
