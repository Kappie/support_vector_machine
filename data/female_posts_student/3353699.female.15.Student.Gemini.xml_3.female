Don't you just wish you were me? and to add to all this crap, I have a D- in geometry and i didn't get my homework down on monday and i can't ask anyone for it cuz no one's online. so yeah there's another 0 for math. oh well i hate math anyway. Well tomorrow's monday and a kinda start to an all new week. except for today of course. gotta remind myself not to eat any sweets. ive been trying that for a while, but those darn brownies just keep poppin up at ya from no where! gosh! ok well time to go sit in my bed and wait for tomorrow to come. Hope you had a good weekend. buh bye for now. -hey you
