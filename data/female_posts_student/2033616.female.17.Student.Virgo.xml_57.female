AAA anyone?  So i get out my card and make a phone call in my parents car on the way back to the house  AAA: Triple A how can we help? Me:  Hi, we have locked the keys in the car, and it's running. we're gonna need a locksmith. AAA: Membership Number? Me:  12345ect ect whatever AAA: Name Me:  Elizabeth Leslie AAA: and what is the, make and model of your car? Me: uuhh....   At this point i remove the phone and turn to... someone... "what's the make and model ?" " Pontiac Grand Am"  Me: It's a Pontiac Grand Am AAA: and the color? Me: Uhhh....   Once again, i turn to unknown driver... "color?" "silver... gray?" "right, i knew that"  Me: It's silver AAA: Is it your car? Me: No, but i'm riding in it AAA:  And you don't know the color Me: it's silver AAA: And you had to ask the color of the car? Me: I havn't actually seen the color yet AAA: You havn't seen the Car? (He sounds very put-out by now... and may i say i did NOT like the tone of his voice) Me: It's a brand new car, this is the first time i've seen it... AND IT'S DARK OUTSIDE AAA: okay thank you miss someone will be with you shortly  Needless to say the AAA guy thinks i'm trying to rip off their service and he thinks i'm an idiot... of couse i don't think much more highly of him.
