His hair dark, butt-length hair is streaked with gold highlights and pulled back into a ponytail of sorts with the use of a claw clip. In the front he has two shorter pieces of hair that fall just under his chin and partially cover his head protector. His torso is bound in several yards of tough, white fabric that acts as a support brace and is moderately resilient against blunt attacks. He also has much smaller strips wrapped around a segment of his upper right arm and lower left arm. Also, on his upper left arm he has the Anbu tattoo from his years among their ranks. On his bottom half he wears dark blue hakama and matching sandals.   Personality: Satu is a hard-working nin. His disposition is normally chipper and friendly, though when in one of his rare bad moods all shall feel his wrath (/bitchiness). Nearly always rational and levelheaded, he often finds himself in the negotiator role should a problem arise along with being the stopper of fights and brawls. Not that he hasn't been known to begin a few himself when he's feeling particularly foul. He's a perfectionist and has a slight obsessive compulsive disorder problem when it comes to cleanliness and organization. For Satu, they are both an absolute must. He would also much rather have one large obstactle to tackle than several smaller ones. Multiple problems springing up tend to grate on his nerves. He's loving and devoted to his friends, and he counts almost everyone in Konohagakure as one until proven otherwise. This spawns mostly from his childhood when his family moved so much that he never had time to make and keep relationships.  History: Satu's parents were both involved in the brutal civil wars of the Hidden Mist Country that were constant until a little over a decade ago. His father, Koji, was unwillingly called to battle due to the fact that he possessed the Myagi bloodline. Chihira, his mother, on the other hand was a nurse at a hospital that was commandeered to be used strictly to heal wounded soldiers. Koji was wounded in a fight at one point and underwent a rather lengthy hospital stay - It was there that he met Chihira. Shortly after the wars finally reached a conclusion the couple married and bore Satu. As a child he and his family spent a good deal of time traveling from one village to the next. Though Satu was never fond of packing up and moving as soon as he'd begun to make friends they didn't have much of a choice: if people were to find out about Koji and Satu being what they were murder would more than likely ensue. It was during Satu's 10th year that they moved by Koji's sister. Not only was she a relative but she even had a son, Haku. Though he was several years younger than Satu they spent nearly every waking hour together. Within a few months they had developed a tight, brotherly relationship. Unfortunately after a little under a year Satu's parents decided to make one final move: they would head for Hidden Leaf Country where he could enroll in the their ninja academy and make a name for himself. Both Haku and Satu were heartbroken despite both of their parents promises that they would meet up again in the future. Afterall both had lived much of their lives alone beforehand, and though Satu was moving to a village Haku was stuck in his families secluded cottage, alone again. Satu's time in Konoha, however, was relatively happy and in time he grew to forget Haku. He had a knack for ninja skills and rapidly devoured all of the information presented to him. He was able to graduate after only two years, and passed the chuunin exams that summer. By the time he was 15 he'd become a jounin and only one year later was he given the opportunity to become an Anbu. He stayed with the Anbu for a little over two years before the stress of it all began to wear away at him and he turned in his resignation. From then on he a jounin sensei for the young genins. It was only recently that he heard news of Haku's death, however. And he took the news rather harshly. He'd rarely thought of his cousin in ages, he'd just assumed he was living happily. Then, after doing a bit of research and learning the circumstances of his death and all that had happened previously he began to blame himself. He felt that if he had kept his word and visited him, had reminded him that he cared, Haku wouldn't have been driven to such a sad life and consequently death.
