I want to do something fun and exciting... anyway, I don't think I'll be writing much today, and I won't be continuing my story on my recent breakup... writing about it makes me feel worse. What's done is done right? I just want to forget about everything and start a new life.  Yesterday the whole family sat down together and watched Akademi Fantasia like we always do... yeah, Saturday nights-8.30 pm. :) Linda was voted out yesterday, it's so sad coz she really does have a great voice... If she stays, there is a chance she could win the competition... but I want Zahid to win coz I love Zahid!! haha... If the good ones are voted out, the chances for Zahid to win is pretty high-not that he's not good. Zahid could win even if there's a great competition... coz he's one of the talented ones. He's funny too... Love him, love him.  Okay okay, enough about Akademi Fantasia.... I have a test tomorrow... haven't studied that much...hope I do well!  I guess that's all for today... I'll write more soon... :)
