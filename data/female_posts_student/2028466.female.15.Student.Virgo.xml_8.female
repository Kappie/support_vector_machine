I can only hope, even though I have tried, To see if I can find someone to heal my pain inside. All of my friends seem to have someone. All my hope is killing me, I just want to be set free, From my aching heart. It’s tearing me apart when I’m with you, When I see you, I wish it were true. Why cant we be the ones holding hands? My tears fall freely, like the rain outside My emotions I do hide. No one knows the pain I feel inside, It makes me want to cry, These dark feelings inside. Please, don’t let my heart die! The sight of you keeps me alive. My emotions spin around like a beehive  Guide me, tell me what to do. My mind if full of hope, I don’t think ill be able to cope. I only survive because of you, But it would be better if my dreams could come true. Guide me, tell me what to do, Because I’m nothing without you!
