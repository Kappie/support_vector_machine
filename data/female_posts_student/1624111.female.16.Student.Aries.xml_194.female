(i prefer "old people house" to nursing home or... retirement home...or...whatever...) she seemed very happy to see us though. which is good. cause sometimes my mom and grandma talk about how she's kind of losing her... with-it-ness. times like these make me kind of sad i dont know much about her, though. about her life, i mean. she lived to 9...5? shes like 95 or 94 now or something and thats pretty impressive. she must've seen some cool things in life and had some awesome experiences. but i dont know much about any of that. cause when it was convenient to ask her i was too young to care. ah well... maybe someday my grandpa will tell me. or something.  my dad talks funny when he talks to his parents. with his ugly, uneducated southern accent. makes him sound dumb. i dislike it. i also dislike that he has been bugging me all day because i accidentially got him regular dr. pepper yesterday instead of diet. i know, i forgot. i realized it when i got home. im sorry. but hes been yelling at me all day..."gee, i wish i had some DIET pop to go with these pretzles". one thing i hate about my dad is it seems like if you screw up one little thing he'll be mad at you for a week for it, but if he ever screws up anything for you, you're not allowed to be mad, because, hey, that would be making a big deal out of it. and he screws up my sandwich every f**king time at subway. every time. grrrr. and the tripod business. thats just anal. im mad at him. for the time being. hes being an ass.  so anyway. thats what i did today. went to talk to my grandparents. and quinn. quinn talked a lot. that kid...ha. and aiden was amusing himself in a way that was hillarious to onlookers. ah, little kids... theyre so cute. emily would have laughed.   yesterday i filmed some movie stuff with caitlin and vicki and jessica and pang and rita. good times. especially with the behind the scenes goofing off that went on. hehe. tapes for conan! can't wait for that... and then afterwards cait and i went to ckp for dinner and then to barnes and noble so i could buy chocolate and then back to my house to play her game cube games since joey needed some quiet time. and then eventually i drove her home. yay.   day before yesterday...friday... i had that meeting at ritas. that was okay. we made crazy shirts for python. and i showed off my fancy swords. then i drove kara back to work and i got free cookies and had a hard time finding my way back to ritas...to find everyone had left... so then iw ent home. and watched a lot of history channel. and got bored. and called caitlin. and then went to go help her babysit joey with pang. good times, that.  and... hmm...didnt really do much any other day this week. called emily a lot. but shes beenin indiana since friday andtill tomorrow morning. so..yay. emily comes back tomorrow! and jenna comes tuesday. yay for jenna.  im excited. ...to meet my best friends cousin? apparently, yes. my life is just  that  boring.  and i really really hope we can go to great america. though im getting the feeling like either 1) we wont be able to go or 2) even if we can go, it wont be a ton of fun because not everyone can go. but i dont want to wait till like 2 days before school because then everybody's busy! and im busy! and i gotta come home and do homework. whereas, now, i can just come home...and sleep. yay for sleep. (which i need to do in a few minutes)  also... fencing buddy andrew just got his license. so now hes gonna get more serious about wanting to meet with me sometime. and this weeks the only week i got left till those few precious days after vacation. should i try to coax my parents into letting me meet with him? hmm... i do have lots of other stuff to do this week as tehres filming left on the python movie and jenna and emily are gonna be around...  this troubles me because i dunno what my parents will say. and because emily seems to think andrew is creepy. is he creepy? i dunno. hes a nice guy, he really is. i should talk to pang. see what she thinks. shes an inside man on all this andrew business.  anyway, im very tired. and i want not to get up at 12 tomorrow. so im off.  ps other people seem not to like this summer because they miss their friends and never get to see them. hahahahahahahaha. i love being able to see emily. i love it sooooooooooooooo much. i dont have a way to indicate the level of my happiness due to the emily seeing ness...but trust me...its high. higher than its been in a looong time. at least since last summer. a year? its been a year? i went a year without being really happy? thats like a 16th of my life. no fair. anyway, i shouldnt get twisted pleasure out of other peoples sadness in missing their friends. but... anywyay. party on. summers not over yet. :-D
