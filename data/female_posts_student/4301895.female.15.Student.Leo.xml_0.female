A car, for me, a 15-year-old stranger. She was really nice to me. I didn't exactly know why, but we became fairly close. As close as one could get for knowing a person for such a short time. We were so alike, even though we didn't really know each other. We liked the same things, same cars, we had oekaki in common, and the funniest part was that we had the same bra size. When I think of that it makes me happy that I at least got to know one person on the Earth, who was kind, sweet, and an all around good person before I didn't have the chance to meet anyone like that. I don't think anyone will ever be as nice as she was.  ~A memorial to Danielle~
