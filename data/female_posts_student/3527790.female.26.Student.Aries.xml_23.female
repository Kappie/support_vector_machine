It is very frustrating. I'm getting nothing done here at work so I'm going home and going to bed. Hopefully that will improve things!  Other than being sick. I had a great weekend. Spent alot of time outside in the sun!! Went for a nice long bike ride. and long swim on sunday. And then I got sick and I've benn whining eversince! :P
