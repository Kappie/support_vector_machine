Woke up to screaming little children in my bed (no, i hadnt spontaneously given birth overnight, they are my kids im nannying for.) Then the boy went to...gymnastics or something? and the girl sat at home. Then i had to drop the boy off at a birthday party, but i was supposed to stay with him or something according to the mom so i ended up being a sucker and babysitting for like, 10 kids at a little kid pool party. And i hung out with Jaclyn Rosania cause someone she was babysitting was there too or something, i dont know and i dont care. And i had to listen to some old lady tell me all these stories about when she was young, when her kids were young, back in the day... blah blah. Thats what old people do. They sit around and pretend they are still youthful by rambling on and on about when they were youthful. And it doesnt work. They just sound older. Oh well. And then the violent little shit was being a violent little shit and fighting with his sister, and suddenly she grabbed him by the back of the head and smashed his head into the table all wrestling-style. it was hilarious. but yet so horrible.   oh, and yesterday i went to see shrek 2 with them. Let me tell you. They are the brattiest, most violent and irritating little shits ever. I really feel sorry for the human race and i want to never have children and rip out my uterus and stab it to death if i ever get pregnant.  ugh. enough of that rant.   and then i went to gamelan and sat around and i was really sad at first, and i was just thinking a lot, and what travis said popped into my head and i just thought about that for a really long time. And i thought about love, and the world, and people in it, and a bunch of other, less corny shit. And i thought just about... stuff. But for some reason during all this i felt really sad... maybe cause of my day? i dont know. I figured out that my plane ticket to santa cruz is gonna be $358, and i only have made like $250 so far, but im almost there. I hope dylan helps me pay for my ticket, even though hes payed for a lot of stuff. But $358 is a lot, and i think my mom is going to make me pay all of it, even though she said originally i would only have to pay for $200 of it. Poop on that.   i'm really sleep-deprived, and really insane. I'm leaving for london on wednesday.  why cant i just die? and come back to life when i have money and im all better?  the world is a stupid place.  Sorry for the long post everyone, ill make it even longer by adding a picture.   smoke is way cool.  thats all, i guess.  i think i have bad self-esteem.  ~abby
