I seem to get so caught up in all the things that are in my face, like work and school, that I sometimes forget some of the things that I am passionate about. Like politics. Most everyone has confronted me about how I feel about Kerry.  I have no solid answer. My only thought at this point is that when I voted for him when I lived in Boston, I felt good about him, but most importantly we CANNOT have Bush in office for yet another moment. Are these good enough reasons to vote for him? I’ve never been so unaware of a candidate, I’d normally have many reasons why to vote for someone, health care; taxes, social security; abortion, however, I’ve lost so much of my interest, and frankly, I am worried. I realize this election is probably more important than the last. Why am I so hesitant to get involved? Did the last election make me loss my faith in the system? Have I become numb to the political malfunction? Lies, low blows, cheating and stealing. What have our politicians come to?  I know this is not what this country was founded on. What happened to the honorable men? What happened to our pride in our country and our President? I am too young to remember when this country loved their President. Although I can see it in my parents eyes. They remember a time where they cried when their President was assassinated. They’d gather as a family and watch with pride and admiration as their President would address them. They weren’t ashamed to declare the President their President. They felt part of it all. Now, I sit here, unaware, partially because of my own fault, and partially because I am not made aware. My views potentially skewed by a slanderous media. My choices made by Supreme Court judges whom should be disbarred.  My vote unacknowledged. The peoples vote quieted by a man who was merely given the Office instead of earning it. I feel betrayed and sickened. Should this stop me from making an educated vote? NO! That would make me just as ignorant as these people hope we get. This betrayal should force us all to rise, rise up and conquer our foe. We must make sure that we do not allow Bush to win this battle (not that he did the first time anyways), we must fight, in all ways possible, we must make sure we win this time. We, the people…our voice needs desperately to be heard. Heard above the media clowns looking for their Pulitzer, above the scoundrels squashing our rights, above the man…we must win!!
