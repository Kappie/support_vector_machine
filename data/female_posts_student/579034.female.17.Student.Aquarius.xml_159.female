It just hit so close to home, I mean, Joey's death didn't really effect me, then Lenny was bad because I knew people close to him, but this was like.. I saw this kid every Saturday track, I've cheered him on... him and Roc... Christen said that just before he died, she was talkin to him sayin she was gonna marry him and she loved him and he was crying in his coma... God I just don't know what I would do if this happend to anyone I personally know... I mean, track brought me and Rob together and stuff ya no... but... if Erica or Debra, Danielle, Christen, Melissa, Morgan, Roc, Carolin, Jessie, Trish, Vin, Vin, John, Rob, Dave, Rubin, or any of the trackies, Mick, James, Shawn, Dave, Randy, Greg or anyone I know ever got hurt God I don't know what I would do with myself... and at the vigil tonight, we walked the course that Rob won frist place on and like.. every year we say we will run it better, every year we just expect to be on that course running and stuff and he'll never get the chance to get frist place again... he'll never run that course again, and poor Roc... his poor family... God.. just say a prayer for him.. many of them God Bless Rob Breen   Tomorrow isn't a given, it's a gift   x0x
