When we were in Europe we took the opportunity to visit some places from Spain to Switzerland and many more. I enjoy traveling because it's like going somewhere new, imagining that you will never come back. I have learnt a lot from my trips around the globe, not that I have been everywhere but being on your own in a completely different country makes you think and teaches you so much about the others and yourself. I wish I could do an around the world tour but I don't have the time and my wallet is too empty...:-(   Anyway, I hope I will do it one day with my Prince, but while waiting for the opportunity to come, we are looking forward to go to Sydney!!
