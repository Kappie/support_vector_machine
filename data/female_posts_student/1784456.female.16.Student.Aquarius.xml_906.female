Yeah, that's right! I revised my swear dictionary in French! (Another test... zzz) It was a listening one and it was like aaaargh! I got 24 out of 32! AAARGH! Seriously needing help with actually speaking/learning French! Oh, what else... oh yeah... POTATO TASTING! You wouldn't believe how complicated it is to cook potatoes and have them coming out tasting like crap (potato) AAARGH! If I have one more potato I'm gonna flip!!! I was saved on the way home by a lemon lollypop I found! Thank god! Ahh... Reel Big Fish... thank youuuu! (Just put them on, and they're saving me from sanity) I didn't mean to put that... did I? Any way life's getting more fun! Yeahooo! Better go do some thing boring to counteract it! Oh, Izzy I will bring in the second of the sacred books! (Fushigi Yuugi!) Soooo good!
