M: Ummm...Maybe you should ask your mom that question.  (I didn't know what to say!?) N: What's dicks? M: Umm...What do you mean? N: You know, dicks. M: You mean, like male anatomy? N: Eww!  No, you're so gross!  What's Dick's Center, that place we just passed?  Okay, so I've been thoroughly embarrassed by a nine year old.  But hey, what's new?
