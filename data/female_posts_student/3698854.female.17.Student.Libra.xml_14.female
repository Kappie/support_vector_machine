She sits in a void of life as the world continues outside her door. Hands creep up to be placed over her eyes which overflow with tears. Tears that should be cleansing but only bring more suffering. The child of the shadows, a daughter of painâ€¦"    Its an image i've had for a while... I really dont know right now... i feel like the girl on the cliff, the one with the sorrowful eyes...       My ideas evolved further:    "even this broken, destroyed child of the shadows can learn to love....were only her love returned."    Stuck in this void where i dont know if i am coming or going. A limbo that pulls at my heart. A sorrow, so deep within him, i wonder.... what if i only bring him sorrow... i know he will never learn of my love, i have nothing to offer him. Oh but to warm his heart to mine, to take away his pain, to show him the kind-hearted man he could become if only he would let himself...       Ah, it is true...  you donot choose who the heart yearns for.    ~Aine
