I saved our conversation and took out our real screen name's though you could easily find out my screen name by looking into my user look up. He was originally posing as Kate, but I guess he just broke...  EBGF: back Me: Okie dokie. EBGF: stfu biatch aaaaaahahahahahahahaha okie dokie biatch? Me: Yup. EBGF: ur outdated, nobodys says that shit anymore Me: And I care because? EBGF: ur a fag, u should care Me: That's nice. Too bad, I don't. EBGF: because number 1.. u have no friends... number 2.. by using words from 1995 you will never get any friends besides the shemales on aol chat room Me: 1. I do have friends. 2. I don't care how old the words I use are... 3. I don't talk to people in aol chat rooms, thankyou very much EBGF: sure Me: Yep. EBGF: living double life is hard Me: What is that supposed to mean? EBGF: ur trans sexual Me: I am not. EBGF: sure Me: Where did you get that idea? EBGF: lol Me: Okay...?? My EBGF signed off at 8:15:10 PM.  And that is how things work with him and I... Isn't it lovely? See, I try to be nice... I am nice to him... Well, most of the time. I've let go of our past and all but he just won't quit, will he? Oh, well, there's a jerk for you.
