The sets and costuming definatley. And also the little kid who played little Simba was sooo cute. Same 4 Narla. He even did a handspring, sure not a very good one, but i don't think ne1 else noticed, and he was cute so I 4give him. :D I think I'm sleeping ova at her place. Eh'xcelent. Rite now Gemma is strumming a VERY off-tune guitar. I was hoping to play it, but it's so off-tune, it's beyond hope. Shame really. I have an ortho appointment tomorrow at 10.00. Yay. I'm gettin mi braces off soon. 2 and half months. Gosh. Can't wait. I'm totally ova braces now. They're such a hassle man. Mmmm....lifes good, ay? I'm glad u don't hate me nemore Hannah. Yay. Life's very very good. Thanks God. U rule. Thats all 4 now. Just mi thoughts. Beth
