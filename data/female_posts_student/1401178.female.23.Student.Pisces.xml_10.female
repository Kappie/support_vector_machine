After a few days missing, John Vause finally reported again. Still from Nasiriya, he reported about the Iraqi doctors that help one the POWs, Jessica Lynch. Looked good in blue shirts and (maybe) a grey pants, he talked with the doctors and was shown the room where Jessica Lynch was found. He listened very carefully to the resident doctor. Hmmm, very thoughtful of him. Makes him even more...aw, I won't even write it. *blush*  Good news (for me). I have bought The Forsyte Saga VHS set from the  urlLink Amazon . Bought through the used  new feature. Got meself a new one for only $42, while the one at  urlLink Amazon  is $71. Quite a bargain, eh?  Gosh, I am still sleepy. I had to wake up at 5.30 this morning, because I gotta do Mom a favor. I'll take a nap after this.  I just finished a book called "Confession of A Shopaholic". It tells a story about a shopaholic, who has trouble keeping her money or credit cards to stay in her wallet. While I was reading it, I keep thinking 'this woman is stupid', or 'can anybody be this stupid?', or 'oh my gosh, this woman is totally obsessed'. I just can't believe that anyone actually can get fired because she was hooked with a zebra-textured jeans (which I think definetely not worth the ordeal) and wouldn't let a costumer in the store she worked in to buy it (she hid it behind a curtain). As I read through the chapters, I kept feeling really annoyed by her. At that time, I wished I could just jump into the book, shook her, slap her, or do whatever it takes to get her mind work. But as I told my sister the story in the morning, she said "But that's how all shopaholic are". Oooooooooooh. Big 'round of applause for my sis. She's 5 years younger than me, but she can be wiser sometimes. Cheers sis!  Now, after reading that book, I moved on to "Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps". This books is very interesting, as it stated that men and women are different, not better or worse - just different. One simple and logical answer to all the unsolved questions about men and women, and the relationship between them. I just finished one chapter, and now reading the second one. I found some interesting things in the first chapter. They say men dominate the remote control. Well, I like to dominate the remote, but I'm 100% a woman. They also say that women has a short-range spatial skill, which makes them a bad map-reader. Well, I can read map and I don't have a problem telling right from left. But as I questioned that statements, I moved on the the 2nd chapter and find my answer there. But I won't tell you the answer untill I read the whole chapter. I really recommend this book. It has a lot of scientific explaination on those things that ticked you about both sexes. I'll put it on my list, on the left.  Aaaaaah, that's it for now. I need my nap therapy...cheers!
