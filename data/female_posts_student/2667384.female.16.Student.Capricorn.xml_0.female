When I pick her up from after-school care I actually pay attention after asking her "How was your day?" and I "play" with her. Well, to an extent- I don't mean Barbies and stuff ( I have a Rep to keep up)- just board games or I help her pick out a sweet outfit. I even went as far as taking her out with me today. We went into town for two hours. We ended up at the GoMa, at the kids play area where two guys of about 18 were sitting drawing cartoons. I wasn't too impressed with them but I guess some people are easily amused! After that we took a trip around the Art Store across the road then got the bus home. She was satisfied at her little outing. Who can say fairer than that?! Sounds like a good attempt at sister bonding. Doesn't it?
