"I don't want to talk to you anymore I'm afraid of what I might say I bite my tongue every time you come around Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground"   judge me all you want but keep the verdict to yourself.   That's Rock Bottom - when this life makes you mad enough to kill That's Rock Bottom - when you want somethin’ bad enough to steal That's Rock Bottom - when you feel like you've had it up to here Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear   One lonely raindrop falls from the sky. One lonely tear falls from my eye. There's a snake in the grass, And a wolf at my door. Love, or hate, Which one hurts more? Lonely is the road of life, It twines you like a polished knife. Values and virtues only to hurt,  Because it comes back always as curt. Friends, or lovers, is it for real?  They never give, but your love, they'll steal.  What do you look for in this world of strife, When all you feel is a miserable life?  One heart has stopped, the other one black, Everything for both, but still stabbed in the back. What can you do when it all seems downhill?  Happiness is the feeling farthest from real.  Sealed in a fortress is where love should be,  But some trust too much and let it go free.  What is this hatred, this thing called love?  Is it the heat of a fire, or the heart of a dove?  Or could it just be some stupid emotion,  That some just cannot feel?  That, I think, is the answer, for real.  It is something that some just cannot contain.  Like flames of a fire, put out by the rain.  One lonely raindrop falls from the sky.  One lonely tear falls from my eye.    or maybe love is..  Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast... its is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. it always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.  But this is how i feel around you..  A reflection in calm waters Something so simple and true One can see their feelings mirrored In the deep pools of blue Through the distortion of the breeze And the interference of reality Happiness and sadness reveal their true nature Untouched in a world of insanity The darkness in my eyes and my heart Was washed away with a glance The beautiful light of friendship and love Has filled the shadows; I’ve taken the chance The outcome is certain Even as the next day is not You've given me more than words can say; Before you saved me I was lost Truth be told, the day will come When in some way we must part By death or life's troubles Still, you'll hold my heart As a friend you've been the best As my love, you've proved true And I’ll try my very hardest to ensure That you know how much I love you.   now: my head hurts cuz my heart aches cuz im not near you cuz im not with you cuz im not there to hug you cuz im not there to see your pretty face cuz im not there to take you in my arms cuz im not there..just not there baby and it hurts..it really really hurts.     Staring at the wastelands, Watch my life fly by, The hands of Fate have gripped me, I do naught but cry. Pain, my last companion, Has taken hold of me, Alone I trudge these mountains, My philosophy. I brave these constant dangers, Hoping that I'll find, The only thing I know of, That can free my mind. I search for the answers, To questions never asked, Freedom's thirst does hold me, But I can't find the flask. Voices always haunting, Showing my mistakes, Laughing at my peril, The choices that Fate makes. I am left to wonder, About the life I lead, I wander at Fate's forcing, Will my heart be freed? Still I find more questions, Than answers in my head, And yet this will continue, 'Till the day I'm dead.    well..im leaving now. "out like my emotions"  nightfall...the stars shine...the scene before me captures my gaze as i stare out my window observing the twinkles hoping to become lost in their hypnotizing dance.  The moon guides my eyes towards it as they are engulfed in its beauty......no...I snap out of my episode having my eyes glossed with emotions...emotions that slowly form a web, which grows as time passes.  The web holding in thoughts of happines, excitment, vexation, hurt, sorrow.  Everyday this maze we are held in, this maze which has no escape, no exit, grows thornier.  Only death is its exit....death is the exit to life, nothing else.  Bliss and purity are handed to u...with its imprisonment...taking all who are good for eternity..    peace.   oh and yea..blogs shouldnt be love letters now should they. i mean...fuck that..right..i mean no reason for that at all..shit..what were they thinking..  some people just dont know what the fuck they are doing  wow, what a day.   whenever some shit goes down like this bullshit..i always try to get away myself from it but in the end it always ends up soundin like im the one who fucked up reall bad.  so..with that..imma say this now: i fucked up.
