Score, reading for days straight!  Today in Spanish Aden confirmed for me that my english book is incredibly boring, and he read the ineresting part.  Go great American literature?  My book on Marylin Monroe is much more intersting, but it is much longer.  Sigh.       I was actually semi-productive tonight, and I'm scared.  I finished my math, spanish, and found a part of a movie I need for my presentation.  Now all I have left is Chemistry, finish my books, and one more movie.        Oh the frustration, the two people I need to talk to aren't on, but I don't need to talk to them so desperately that I should call them.  What I really should do is get off here, and do some more productive things. So I'll write later. Oh shoot my candle!
