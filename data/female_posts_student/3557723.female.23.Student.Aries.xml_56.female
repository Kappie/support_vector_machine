There were a few Freudian slips from her before I even asked. It was amusing so I did let it drag on for a couple of days before officially asking her. Sure, I asked her to be bridesmaid, but she'll be Maid of Honour. She is married after all. But then Maid sounds old, so maybe Chief Bridesmaid instead.  The role of Best Man goes to Tim. The only slight little problem is that someone, namely the groom-to-be hasn't gotten around to asking him. We can't see him saying no. And he'd be great to have around on the day.
