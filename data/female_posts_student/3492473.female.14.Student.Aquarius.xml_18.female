I hate how my emotions always go from one extreme to the next. And it seems that whenever I'm happy, something gets screwed up and I get really upset so it's like I don't even benefit from being happy. Josh calls me crazy, I know I have problems but who doesn't? I admitted I wanna go to therapy to several people and that's one of my reasons for wanting to be a psychologist. So I can help teens who have problems like me and need help or just someone to talk to. I can't write and I dunno why. It sucks because I have so much to write about but nothing comes out. I really wanna try writing a song but it always turns into a poem. I wanna write a book, I have it all in my head, but when I try to put it on paper it's  not good enough.  I've always had that problem... you have the perfect image of something in your head and when you try to make it real, it just looks like  shit . God, and I try soo hard to have a good and close relationship with my mom but I can't. I can't tell her anything because she's always has some "mom" crap to say. She doesn't back up her word and she's way too protective of me. She thinks I only like things because my sister likes them. But if she knew me, then she'd know how different Margaret and I are. Sure, we have things in common but it's not because I wanna be like Margaret so I like it, M's made her fair share of mistakes that I feel I'll never make. The piercings, tattoos, and dyed hair I want have nothing to do with M's piercing, tattoos, or dyed hair. It's all because that's who I am and that's what I want. I want my mom to let me experiment now so that when I go off to college and she only sees me at Christmas, she won't be surprised when I come home with red hair, a pierced nose, and a tattoo.  I guess I just wanna make sure she'll still love me even with the "changes" I'll do to myself.  I don't feel like my mom really listens, ya know?  I mean she listens but doesn't LISTENS...  Like when I'm walking around the house miserable and saying I'm fine whenever someone asks me if I'm okay, she should know I'm not fine and ask me if I wanna talk about it or try to find out what's up, ya know? I've never really been best friends with my mom. And I get so jealous when I hear people say their mom is their best friend or when I see my friends treat their moms like crap. If my mom tried to be half as involved in my life as my friends moms did, I'd be so happy. Don't get me wrong, she's a good mom and all that...it's just I want more. I guess that's why I feel soo alone in life because despite the few good friends I have and the family, I still don't feel like I can tell them everything so I guess that's why I write so much poetry and why I write so much in here. (Chris if you're reading this, this should explain some things) I was never good with speaking words. I'm  very  emotional. I cry like three times a day. Sometimes over fights or friends or ex-boyfriends...sometimes over  nothing . Written words are something I'm good at. I can write something and post it and not know people's instant reaction. Not knowing is good for me. When I say things aloud to a person I can see the sorrow or pain or anger, and I'm sure as hell not good at that. Because I'm not good with face to face conflict. So writing in this blog and writing my poems is like a real conversation with myself. I am telling myself what's wrong, what happened, how I feel, and all that. And when other people read it, they can sorta see how my brain works and why I feel a certain way. I'm not sure if I'm making sense but I hope someone understands. I dunno if this is true but I feel like I'm saying the things you guys all feel but are afraid to say. That's what I want this to do. Make you guys know that you're not the only one who feels like this and talking about it is okay. Sure, it can cause problems and cause people to get mad at you but this is a risk I'm willing to take. I have soo much built up anger and pain and fears that I'm sick of holding in it. I feel like most of you hate me anyways so why keep it locked inside much longer? Like my sister told me in May, " at the end of the day, you only have yourself ...but you also have me, so make  yourself  happy!" Chris got mad at me for putting our exact convo in one of my old posts and I truly feel bad but I lost him anyways so why should it matter? I thought about editing that post and changing what it said but I thought to myself,  "why? you've always changed yourself to please people, you've always hid how you felt to make sure people didn't think differently of you, you've always made sure to be like everyone else."  And I'm sick of that. There are a zillion things I could tell you guys right now that I bet none of you could ever imagine me doing or thinking. I guess this is a good time for those... I've tried starving myself *didn't work* I've tried making myself throw up *didn't worked* I tried cutting myself. And this worked. Yup, that's right, I  was  a cutter. But luckily I told the right two people and they were there for me the whole damn way. Cutting helped me deal with the pain I felt on the outside. I don't know what made me do it that first night but I did it and it helped the pain. So I just kept doing it. Like I say below, the last two times hurt like hell, I had the scabs for a few weeks and had to hide under sweatshirts for the first few days of it.  I've been clean for 6 weeks and one day.  It's so strange, the whole time of me cutting myself, Chris was the only one who ever noticed the cuts. I never told the rest of you because I knew how you'd react and I was scared that those reactions would lead to you not wanting to be around me because I was "weird" or something but I guess this is the time for you to know. Sorry guys...
