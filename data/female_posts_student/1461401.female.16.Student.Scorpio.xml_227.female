It was a tree unlike any other tree. It was a muffin tree. The girl was delighted. She climbed its branches, she ate its muffins, she rested in it's shade. Day after day, she returned to climb and play and eat, by the old muffin tree. The muffin tree was generous in it's bounty, and soon she grew very fat. She could no longer climb the tree's branches. All she could do was sit in the shade and eat more tasty muffins. After many days of this, she became bored. "Oh muffin tree, why do you only grow blueberry muffins? Please make me another kind." The muffin tree said nothing, as it was a tree. And trees don't talk. But, just because tree don't talk doesn't mean they're aren't listening. The next day, a new kind of muffin was growing on the tree. "mm" And it was the best muffin she had ever tasted. However, three minutes later she fell down dead. The end. The moral is, never talk to muffin trees.   www.muffinfilms.com
