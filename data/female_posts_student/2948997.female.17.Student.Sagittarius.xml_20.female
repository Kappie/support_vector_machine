As I sit at my desk at work trying to assist a person, others decide that they are more important and barge into the converstation which is none of their business. The reason: Because they do not want to wait their turn.  How about when I am shopping in the grocery store and women push me out of their way because there is a sale on beef for .90 cents per pound (don't these people know it's bad to eat meat and even worse to be rude?)   What about the school hallways where I am always shoved out of the way. Have we not heard of muttering a phrase...something like...excuse me?  Our society is so violence, in such a rush and so complusively careless. We don't care about the person beside you because it's simply not you. Its the whole idea of you being the most important person in the world...I believe you need to value yourself, but not at the cost of degrading a person to make yourself feel better. Girls are the worst for this. I speak from person experience, we are catty creatures that thrive on the kill...a savage instinct that is imbred in all of us along with the desire to spite and the motivation to hurt.   If anyone realized the potential girls have to be lethal weapons, nuclear war would not be the popular method of killing a group of people. I figure, you could just send in a population of females who would degrade you, this is worse than capital punishment because with c.p at least you know you are going to die. Not with girls, they attack you using your weaknesses, and they know exactly which ones are the ones that will cause the biggest reaction.   We are compulsively careless, we spend money at every turn and are unaware of people's feelings and thoughts.   We are a rude thoughtless society full of rage, hate and blood...and nuclear women.   I do not like people...I feel that everyone is only out for themselves...show me a normal person who does things for the sole purpose of kindness and I will point out their humanist flaw...their hope.  What is a cynic? A man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing.
