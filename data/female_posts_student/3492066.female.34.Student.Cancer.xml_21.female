I'm trying desperately to stay awake until 10 or so, and then get a full night's sleep.  Mondays, until university starts back up, are my 5 a.m. days over at work...opening the building, etc. for our members to start coming in at 5:30 am. Thankfully, it was a blessedly calm (for a Monday!) day with a few smiles and a few successes interspersed.  For starters, I've been trying for the past month to convince my body that it really should loose weight, shed the fat, lighten up, and generally be treated well in a healthy way. The good news is, I haven't gained any weight, and I think I've droppedfour pounds this past week. The bad news is, my body is apparently being quite stubborn, and I'm not doing what it needs to get a proverbial kick in the pants. Then again, it may be just trying to wait me out and seeing if I'm really serious this time. Either that or it's trying to see how frustrated I can get.  Then again, maybe it's just trying to tell me that it's not going to shed the weight until I get things right and treat it properly. Really, I'm hoping it's just that.  So, my list of things to eventually get to all at once (goals) 6-8 8 oz. glasses of water per day 5servings of fruits and vegetables per day 1/2 an hour of exercise per day (alternate between cardio and stregnth) 2 servings of milk product And perhaps taking up again the Weight Watchers "diet" program  For some this might not seem like a big deal, for me and how busy I get, it's like trying to herd cats, or kids as the case may be.  Honestly, I'm starting to share Lloyd's concern about my eating habits. No, I don't go binging on ice-cream or chocolate chip cookies, I do just about the exact opposite, I won't eatanything most of the time and then have a sizable meal. I may, emphasis on  may  have a bowl of cereal in the morning before I head off to work, but take nothing with me. So, for eight hours I don't eat. I come home hungry and end up having 5 crab rangoon, an egg roll, a half patty of egg foo young, and a cup or two of chicken fried rice with beansprouts.   This is not a good thing, and besides, I'm not a stick figure, at 245 pounds I'm far from being a stick figure! My body's probably gone into famine mode, trying to reserve every ounce of energy it gets like gold.  Okay, now that I seemed to have wined enough, I'll go get my cheese, parse this out in the morning, but meanwhile I can leave with a bit of a chuckle. Or at least a smile and then a chuckle.  I've tickled one of the members of the Y pink today, an older lady from Korea who was dropping off her grandkids for daycamp. I noticed she was a Korean-emigree when I saw the lunch bag that one of the boys was carrying, and waited until she came out to say anything.  "Yobosayo," I said after her as she was leaving, having been told by someone that it meant "goodbye."  She paused for a moment and turned around, so I said it again and asked if I got the word correct. She smiled broadly with her great wrinkled face and came up to the desk. She told me she spoke little English, but she taught me easily enough. "Yobosayo" meant "hello," while "Ameeyoekaseo" meant "good-bye" in Korean. I said "khamsa-hamneedah" which means "thank-you" in Korean, and we both smiled broadly like kids. I was so happy to learn, and she was more than happy to teach before she headed out the door.  I told Lloyd about it later in the day. His comment was that it was apparent that I was spreading out in the neighborhood of job opportunities. He knows I have a love for learning languages. While some folks complain about how people need to learn to speak English before they move to the U.S., for me I want to learn at least some of the languages to make their transition easier. I mean I know what it feels like just to visit a foreign country and not speak more than a few words of the language. It's frustrating! Communication is the life-blood of connecting with other people.  And here's the laugh...  Yesterday I went out to my mother's new home to go mow the lawn as I promised. Note here that what I meant to mow was the 10 acres of lawn that she has. After giving a reverse mohawk to the field in the back and stalling out, I decided to try to cut the front field by trimming around the edges and working inwards.   Okay, first of all aside from this being 10 acres of grass, it's 10 acres of tall, wet grass, and although I'm on the riding lawnmower, it's been a good 14 years since I last cut grass. Needless to say, I stalled out repeatedly and thought it was the grass getting caught under the blades until I started smelling smoke. So, rushing back to the house in hopes of smothering the fire I feared with fast wind, I called to Lloyd for water. All the while, in the back of my mind, I was imaginging little flames underneith the blades, and the thought that I might catch the field afire, but also burn up the lawnmower.  Well, it wasn't quite what I feared...it was just the engine overheating due to the mower trying to cut wet grass, as my mother informed me later when she finally returned home.  So, my co-workers got a chuckle today with my story of nearly setting the riding lawnmower on fire.   Oh, yes, and my mother did put Lloyd and I to work when she got home, moving furniture and wiring up her television. We're supposed to go back on Wednesday afternoon to help out some more.  Well, it's finally 10 p.m. and I think I shall carry myself off to bed. Lloyd's brother is out, his mother is upstairs playing Mah-Jong on her computer (she's addicted), and Lloyd himself is either watching  X-Files  on DVD, or playing  Abe's Odessey  on my old Sony Playstation.  Oh, yeah, and I started reading Aldous Huxley's  Brave New World , and although I'm only a couple of chapters in, the fact that he first published the novel in 1932 just absolutely blows my mind. In other words, he's got his science down pat even for the year 2004 to some degree, and thus far it's been a great and frightening read.
