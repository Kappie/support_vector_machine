Geese...I really don't know what to say because well...because so much has happened. I've met too many people and seen too much stuff and done way too much to explain it all here.  But, I have been feeling lately like I left some things unsettled in NB, and well it's true. I left some things iffy and messed up and just not right, but I don't care. I'm sorry, but I left for fun and experience, not to dwell upon our shaky parting terms. I'd rather not go into that, but guys...let's just say you have major issues. So yes, I left things in a bad way, but I'm not coming back for a while and then after I do come back, I'm leaving very soon after, so don't expect me to be around.   I'm not mad at you, really, I'm not. I'd just rather have a good time this summer and ignore our goodbyes. They weren't pretty, but I guess they never really are. Things end the way they're fated to end and maybe that night was our ending.   So yeah, just had to get some NB thoughts off my chest so I could get back to focusing on fun times. Talk to you all as soon as I can.  Mwah...I miss you!!!
