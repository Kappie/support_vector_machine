Although... challenge has by far become the worst and most torturous class there is.  Band is... there constantly and sometimes becomes just not..  A#$U* but its alright because i really dont care about it anymore other than little things like state and solo..  but im really not making much effort so whatever, id just like to relax.  that reminds me.  one of my favorite things is : relax.  so awesome... just think of it.  there are so many times when that is the best thing there is.  that and pie.  also, friends etc are pretty good... i have the best girlfriend in the world... shes so wonderful in every way.  i love you melissa!  now the randomness paragraph:::: (colon) OK  so i was thinking, people seem to categorize things mostly in two categories: (colon) "good" and "bad" things that are good are usually money food, essential things for life or extra wants that please us asthetically, physically, emotionally, etc.  and bad things are things that prevent "good" things or are detrimental to our physical, emotional, fiskal, etc. well-being.  but, with the proper mindset in our new age technological world, theres really no logical reason to think of "bad" things as... something to be feared or avoided.  such things as pain.... when something bad happens, yes pain is there to help and to make things more apparent that the prime objective for that individual is to stop the pain by rectifying whatever has gone wrong, but i see that perhaps there is a lower need for pain and actually a point where pain greatly gets in the way of things.  ex: (colon) if you get your leg blown off, you would most likely-flop around on the ground screaming in agony as the blood leaked out of your body leaving you helpless to any other offense, and ridiculously inactive in the correction of your injury.  with our technology, people can live without a leg or in some cases reattach the leg.  so... wouldnt it be better if instead of flopping around screaming until you die or force someone else to help you, you could acknowledge the fact that your leg has been blown off calmly, and proceed to crawl over, get it, and promptly seek medical attention????  perhaps saving your leg and at least your life...?  well i know there are other arguments such as "your body is rigged that way so you dont harm yourself... and... the physics of it are simply that your neural pathways and nerve cells operate to an extent individually in their production of "pain" so theres no self-enclosed way to stop or greatly reduce the pain save the addition of heavy meds... but im just looking at one hypothetical situation in which something "bad" would really be much better to be considered as something... "different" so that there isnt that panic and anxiety about the thing...  so that we can better administer care to whatever it is that is bothering the norm.  in a more practical use, people who work out could lessen greatly their pain in weightlifting etc.  by consciously letting the brain know that it is unnecessary to blare the alarm in this situation because the pain is unavoidable and not truly harmful to the life of the individual. i guess all im really wanting is a better control of the conscious over the subconscious, the voluntary actions over the involuntary and inhereted humanisms we all need as babies and have formed our culture by.... eh, its good in theory anyways.  *END ramblation* : (colon)  ok so theres that.  wow a lot has changed in these past 4 months, they feel a lot longer.  i am a little worried about the future and college, but i think things will be ok in the long run... hm so yeah.  i guess life goes on and little things dont matter as much as i or (we) make them seem.  its sort of fun to think of the danger of the future... if anything ive grown better at making seriously afflicting poor turns of events into a joke that i can laugh about, and make almost any situation comical... to myself at least, which greatly lessens stress sometimes. dododododododo so i think i should go cause i need sleep so badly... i was hoping for a great end, a grand finale, but i guess not... everyone go to www.engrish.com www.deviantart.com and i cant think of anything else for now but stick with the old www.homestarrunner.com so ill try to update this again sooner than 4 months or so, i think i can do it.  whoever reads this rocks. talk to you later! out.
