Well thats basical the story of my life,.....yea i have good times and great days, but its at the end of thouse great days when u realize you have nothing to gradhold to. I just feel like somethings missing. Today was one of thouse great days, but here i am writeing this and its almost the end of my day. I think this time i may have something to grab hold to. Today i was online and a person imed me that i would never think in a million years would. it was the day befor the last day of school and me and her had gotten into a huge fight. The fight was about me and how she thought i betraid my ex by telling Jason ( one of her former friends ex ) that i like him. why shouldn't i have told her i liked him? Heck i told Jason i liked him, and only to find out that he liked me back. the next day i didn't go to school and left the problem unfinished. but heres to show that she wanted to talk tome. we both talked online and later on the phone she apoligized and so did I. Today i gained an old friend and still notice i can grasp Jason's heart. ........funny .....she tells me jason caled her and told her that he would like to go out with me sometime. .....funny how things seem to work out. ....funny how a day can start like a train reak and work its way out into one of thouse great days......well my day is over and i truly have something to grab hold of and thats my life.
