Like when the guy you like smiles at you and you just know that he's not looking at the girl behind you and that there's no strange pimple on your forehead. Or when you sit around with your friends listening to music and you suddenly know why the band Soundtrack of Our Lives chose the name and they did and you're aware that you've been subconcsiuosly creating the soundtrack to your life for years. Or when the guy you like talks to you when he doesn't have to and he stares right into your eyes and you run home and dance around in your room listening to Hit Or Miss by NFG. And you sing along like no one's listening cuz even if they are U could care less.  And I've had those moments. I wish they were just a little less rare, because looking forward to them would seem more reasonable. But I don't know...I never do.
