Diaryland.com sucked ass actually. It seemed really hard for other people to end up reading your posts and posting back in reply their thoughts. I hope this one is a little better. Also, I don't really see how other people get hooked on these things. I mean its writing down meaningless thoughts, (at least mine are meaningless)... But i have to admit sometimes I actually like reading what other people are thinking about.. Even if it is pointless.  Soo, my first post is pretty weak and I have absolutely nothing to say. But I'm finding that I am typing really funny and this is not how i speak in person at all. My writing hardly shows what kind of person I am. I'll write more later.. This is kinda tiring.
