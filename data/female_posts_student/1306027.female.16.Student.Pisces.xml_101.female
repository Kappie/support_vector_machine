They are all right here, nested nicely in this new template compliments of the new, bubbly, and awesome Blogger.  Enough of the crap speel. Onward ho! Yes, I am now going to explain my blogger absence:  You see, it all started back in march. One day, my parents decided that they were going to buy a house. So we looked and looked and looked and yet, we couldn't find the house that fit the family just right. Until one shiny friday morning when we went looking in a nearby neighborhood with our trusty realtor. We had seen several other houses already that day, including "The House From Green Hell". I am not exaggerating in the least.. This house really was a pain on the eyes. You could even take a blind dog in there and he would yelp out in pain. Needless to say we all were feeing the lost hopelessness of a wandering child. And then,   There it was   The most awesome house anyone could have ever laid eyes on. Well.. awesome for us anyways. We walked through, oo'd and ahh'd, then decided that we were going to bid. We went back and forth for about 3 days with the owner. Now, if you have ever witnessed the house buying process, than you can appreciate the fact that I didn't blog about it. Our whole family was on needles for about 3 months during this whole process. Eventually though, it came out good. Because now, I am sitting in the first house I have ever lived in. It has a beautiful backyard, awesome amounts of space, and, it's ours.  Sure, it's had it's drawbacks. Like moving. That was fun. We had to hire some family friends to help us get everything here. (Thanks Aaron  Zeph! Hummer's aren't bulletproof!) We prolly would have jumped off a cliff if we hadn't had the help. I have battle scars too... I slashed open my palm. I have this magnificent scar there now. Just a note that things as big as houses don't come without a price.   I haven't met any of the neighbors yet, But I'm sure that they are cool people. Right now, I think I'll just focus on settling in.   Note to Carmen: I am sorry that I did not post, but now I am back, so I shall post, and remind you to post :-P.    I leave you with this: I am back!!!
