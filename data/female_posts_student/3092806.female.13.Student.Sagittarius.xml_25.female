I think I have never felt this hurt in my entire life. It's not about death, illnesses, or anything like that. No, it is about something that most people would consider trivial. This is about my  EBGF.  Hard to believe, huh? Well, you better believe it, 'cause it is all about him and this time it is not his fault, no, this time, and every time before that was entirely    MY   fault, and there is  NO  way to fix what I have done... No, nothing actually happened... No, nothing important occurred... Well, yes, something important did occur. I just happened to realize why my  EBGF  is so angry with me... I was so stupid beforehand... God, I'll never be able to fix this.      Just today, I learned that his favorite band is Linkin Park. I know about four or five of their songs, and love them all, but I decided that I'd check out some of their other songs. Well, I searched for Linkin Park lyrics on the Google search engine and eventually found all of their songs that they have. After reading several of the ones I hadn't ever heard of, I realized something, and what I realized made me almost want to cry. Almost every single one of their songs pertains to what is going on between  us ... I'm being totally serious here. Oh, and that's not even the worse thing about this situation. No, the majority of the songs are angry, angry at a someone who has created lies in a relationship, doesn't understand why someone could bemad at her or him, expects the other one to beg for forgiveness,etc... Well, honestly, that is  EVERYTHING  that I have been doing to my  EBGF . I've been wondering for months on how he's been feeling towards me... Well, now I know, don't I? He doesn't put his feelings into regularspeech or facial expressions but drowns them in music. I hurt him more then I ever thought. The songs are simply wonderful, I will say that... Yet to me, they hold much more meaning. They're my only way into his heart, his feelings, his everything, everything that I lost. Once I lost his trust, I lost everything.What's a girl to do after this situation? Oh, I've got that figured out now... Yes, I've been wondering on how I'm supposed to act around him for monthsand finally I've found it. Though it totally and completely breaks my heart, I have to let him go. I have to walk away. I can't torture him. I've got to let him live. I've been hurting him for so long. God, I feel like such an idiot... Why didn't I see this before? How could I have not seen his pain? I'm walking away now. He doesn't need me. He doesn't want me. He  HATES  me. He'll always  HATE  me... I'll always love him though. He was the first  real  friend that I've ever had and I'll forever be grateful for all of the good times he brought into my life... Unfortunately, the good times have ended and it is time that I let go of him. He deserves to be happy. I've been holding onto him for way too long.    I was so selfish before. I was stupid, insane, pathetic, etc...I feel incredibly terrible and hurt. What do I mean by hurt, you may ask me. Well, IguessI should replace it with the word hateful. Ihate myself completely, right now.I'm "hurt" that I could have letthis happen.None of thisshould have ever happened.  Nicole , my  EBGF , and  I  should have all grown up as best friends... I can imagine what things would be like if we were still best friends. First of all, we'd call  Nicole, Cole,  my  EBGF, Al,  and  me, Kel or Kels . Honestly, I believe that we'd be inseparable. There are just so many memories... There are justtoo many times that we'ved shared together... Things would be SO different now if I hadn't hurted him. Yes, everything wouldn't be the same.  My life, his life, my sister's life,  they'd all be different... I often think of the times that  we've  shared together. They're just so great. I can remember the pranks we pulled, the places we explored, the games we made up, etc., as if they were only yesterday. It's wonderful, looking back at them. It makes me feel like singing, I enjoyed them very much... Rather regretfully they also cause pain.I've feltit, and I imagine he's felt it. It's time to letgo. He'll hate me until the end of time itself and maybe long after that, but I'll always love him. He was my first best friend. He was the onlybest friend that I ever got the chance toactually be myself with. Nowadays, I'm actually afraid of showing myself to even myvery best friends. Well, at least I'll die having the pride of at leastone true friendship that occured in my life, even if it was in my childhood. It's too bad that it ended horribly, but, hey, that's life.    Goodbye  Alex.  Thanks for the ride but now it's time for me to go. Maybe one day we'll meet and become friendsagain, but until that day,   au revoir   .    You were an awesome friend. You knew every trick of the trade. You were always there for me, through thick and thin. You were terrific. I'm sorry thatI wasn't that great of a friend to you. I'll see you in the next life... Bye...    Yes, I'm probably dramatizing this situation, but I seriously don't care. I feel like I've walked through hell, for the fiftieth time. You know what, this isn't the end. One day, we'll be friends again. It may not be in this life, but it will be someday...    Do you know what I'm imagining right now? It'll sound silly, but I've sort ofgot a version of  heaven  that I like to believe that I go to after I die.My heaven isCamp, basically. It's full of the booming  thunderstorms , the crackling bonfires ,thesame twinkling  stars , the unknown  mystery , the feeling of sheer joy, the everything... However, it's not just my   Camp   that's in my  heaven . No, it's WAY more then that. It's my  Camp  and the muddle of my favorite memories. In my  heaven , you can revisit your favorite memories... It's like a scrap book ina way. I've already got a few memories saved for my  heaven . Now, I'm officially adding another one. This one concerns  Alex . The one I'm savingis on the Fourth of July in the last summer that we spent together as friends I believe. It's the moment in which I'm laying right next to him (after  Nicole  moved to lay next to  Kate )on thetop of his roof top.  We're  not really talking,  we're  just lost in the moment. You see,   we're   watching the fireworks going off in the night timesky. The sky is star studded so it makes the entertainment level increase greatly. It was postivelybeautiful, it was  magical . Call me insane but it was probably one of the best moments that I've ever had with him. So, I'll save it for my  heaven . He'll never be officially gone then. Even if I grow old and forget about him, he'llnever be forgotten. He'll always be in my heaven .    Always.
