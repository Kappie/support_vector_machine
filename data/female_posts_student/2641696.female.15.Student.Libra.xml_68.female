Now it's like someone's put a boom box blasting AVRIL LAVIGNE in my ear ^^; Not that I mind, of course... hee! Ok, onto the Planned Tirade.   So many of my friends are boy-crazy. I go along with it, but I'm really not that interested in anything even remotely resembling a love life. I mean sure, I guess it'd be nice and all, but it seems like the more guys (ie, Frodo) I 'get over,' the more I really don't want to be 'involved' at all. I suppose this is a blessing, seeing as it's fairly unlikely I'll go out with anyone before the end of high school, but it's also just a bit worrying -- everyone  else  I hang out with is obsessed with it! I mean jeez, just look at Murdles and J. Holy macaroni, do those two talk about anything  except  boys?? You know I love 'em, but soon as those guys start talking about Strawberry and Bruno and Cupcake and whoever... like wtf! They've got more nicknames for boys than I have for me! ^^;; I'm just not interested in that sort of thing, and you'd think, what with the raging horomones and all, I  would  be!   And it's not so much that I'm just a cold fish -- I can appreciate a bishie just as much as the next girl. I'm just not... anxious, I guess, or expectant that I'll get married or even meet 'someone special.' Because I can almost guarantee you, if it's not 'someone special' I won't get involved. I'm a Libra. We are lookin' for lifetime partners here, not a quick fix or a maybe-shmaybe.   Maybe that's the thing. It's not that I don't wanna have a boyfriend, it's that this boyfriend has to be 'the one,' or 'my soulmate,' or the 'Real McCoy.' You could call it high expectations. But you could also call it unwilling to throw away any real emotion on someone I don't really care about. Maybe I'm too protective of myself? I always thought that I was almost frighteningly uncaring of what happened to me; that I was more concerned about my friends. That I was either somehow worse/better than everyone else (depending on how you look at it) -- I could take more 'emotional pain' or something. But this really opens up a whole new window, don't it?   Or, it could just be that I don't like getting close to people. God knows that's true *g* I guess I'm expecting some sort of fairy-tale romance; a real partner, not just a boyfriend. Someone that, if the rest of the world just up and left, I'd still be happy with. Somebody who, like me to them, doesn't need anybody else except for me. Very loyal, I guess. And not so much overly dependent -- that's not what I mean -- but that we'd be two sides to the same coin or something. 1 + 1 = 3, you know?   So anyway. If that ever happens (again, I think this unlikely, due to my slightly (slightly? HAH!) bi-polar nature and onionness), I don't mind waiting for it. This, I think, is why I'm so... disgusted isn't the right word... impatient, maybe? with people who are boy-crazy. Or girl-crazy. Your choice. But aren't there more important things? Yes, I know I just spent an entire blog on boys, so maybe I'm a bit of a hypocrite. But after a few days of this nonstop nattering from various people concerning B O Y S, well. A girl gets tired, ne? And we really don't need to discuss, giggle and whisper conspiratorially about the various 75 positions to 'impress my man' from Cosmo. C'mon, do you really think that namby-pamby vanilla mag'll know  anything  about kink?? *BIG g* Please. Cosmo wouldn't be nearly so popular if it put the juicy stuff in there, and if you don't know  that , maybe your mommy should get you a subscription to Chickadee.
