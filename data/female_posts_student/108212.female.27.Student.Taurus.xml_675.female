A new month is beginning. "Jaba" took a breather from his vacation to talk to the Territory Sales Representative that I hired.  He sat with Michael for a whole hour.  I was wondering if Jaba ate him.  When they both came out of the meeting room I was relieved.  Anyway, my boss likes the new recruit.  He expects me to train him on the capabilities of the store and its team members.  Funny, how he didnt even bleeped a sound about my "success".   Pia... if you look at the last 15 posts.  the movie titles we post at the beginning of each blog was Ching's idea.  Everytime someone posts at GS you have to think of a movie title that starts with the last letter of the title that the previous blogger poster.  IE.. i posterd Highlande(R).... so now the next GS post has to start with the letter R.  Any takers?    more to come....  NET
