We only saw 2 sea lions but the scenery was stunning - we could see really clearly the Olympics mountains in Washington, USA.  we were kayacking alongside the seaplanes! A very strange site.  Met some cool guys - 2 christians from Toronto!  There were only 6 of us in the group so it was great. Plus we got it half price because we are staying at the hostel.  This morning I went to the RBC musuem and also to a session at Parliament! But will blog later about that.  Everyone here is SO friendly.  take care guys
