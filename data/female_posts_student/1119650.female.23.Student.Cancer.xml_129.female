Why is it called a decorator penis?  Whats so particularly decorative about this penis that other penises are lacking?  Do we really need ejaculating dildos?  Futhermore, do we really need a recipe for cum?  With all that said lets not forget the most obvious question here: are women really stupid enough to shove condensed milk up thier cooch.  Do the words "yeast infection" mean nothing to anyone anymore?    This whole aparatus seems like entirely too much work.  Give me the  urlLink hello kitty vibrator  any day.  Its even an officially licensed sanrio product.  Cute  satisfying...gotta love Japanese ingenuity.
