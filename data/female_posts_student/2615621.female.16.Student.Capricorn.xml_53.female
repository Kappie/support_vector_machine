(skaters skating on the steps at our church when we were driving by)" Mom: "ugh julia, u need to get better taste.." Me: "omg whatever!!! HOTTNESS!!! OMG!!" Mom:"are there any guys at school you would like to go out with, like to a movie or something?" Me:"no one at my school is worth going for and if they are they're taken..." Mom:"im just worried you dont know how to act around the opposite sex u know, i dont want you to be one of those girls who just gets a boyfriend because she'll have sex..." (refering to getting my chest signed by hot guys..aka- hot vegas)  Me:"umm i know how to act, i have guy friends..ive been out with guys...and im sorry but hot guys make u do weird things, and umm..yeah...and who cares what i do anyways, its not like ur doing them, i am, and if i want some HOT dude to write on me with an expo dry erase marker then i damn will please have him do it" Mom:"oh"  Me:"hahaha whatever"   HAHAHA SAYING IM ONE OF THOSE GIRLS WHO IS JUST GOING TO GET SOMEONE CUZ I PUT OUT?! HELLO UMM NO, i just like hot guys.   i do want a dude though...for real...haha i still kinda have a thing for the guy who does my nails, but i took my nails off so i dont go as offen *he talks to my MOM when she goes...* and i guess i would be all CRAZY for him if i talked to him more...but i dont talk to him a ton so u know how that goes...haha i do like looking at him when i go to the mall cuz hes HOT. he's really "pretty" though, not like gay pretty girly, but like "abercrombie" pretty. like muscles and tight shirts...and faded jeans...lol okay hes freakin hot, but right this second i want a skater! haha i always go back and forth..just no rednecks or cowboys please...*barf*  i was thinking about something...im really gonna miss lauren if (and i hope she does) go to NCSSM...i just started thinkin about everything like...idk...life, she i started thinkin about her, and omg im gonna miss the hell outta that girl, but hey, im looking forward to weekends and stuff where we can go wild and ill be driving and hot guys...(that are smart, always a plus) and stuff like that!! lol im excited for her totally, but the closer it gets to the end of the year, 5 weeks, the more i realize how much im going to miss her. i love u lauren!  i hate mrs diamont...especially at times when she moves lauren away from me while we watch a band..thingie..u know 4 mexicans get up and shake their hips and play their guitars...mirachi or whatever. i hate laura greene for telling on lauren too. bitches.  awesome new quote (and yes..here i go again) : "lose all your inhabitions and come get down with me" --"By the Pool", Hot Vegas   i think andrew palmer (the vocalist/song/music writter/guitar) is very talented. his talent is unlike any other i've seen...his songs, theres something about them i really like. when i listen to the lyrics its like.."dude...what is going through his mind?" lol i mean, in "By the Pool" i dont think it even mentions a pool!!! haha hello?!what are u thinking? lol maybe he wrote it by the pool... hmm..and the song called "Many Thanks" it goes like "your so beautiful so perfect im never gonna let you go" something along those lines and no where in the song does it have anything to do with "many thanks" ...weird...haha but my point is that, he writes these songs that have actual meaning, meaning to him, at least i think thats right...who knows, but ive always wanted the talent to write music...and i respect him for his talent, oh and i wanna bang him. lmao   i want to write a book...what kinda book? idk yet...just a book...maybe a book about my life? naw...too unorginal...a book about hot guys...no, too "stupid" ...i want a book that shows thought and meaning that im proud of. i know!! a book of random wonders. stuff i think about, stuff i wonder about...my theories and philosphies. wow..thats deep. but im gonna do it! im gonna write a real book..called...(subject to change) "Self-Portrait".  *much love*
