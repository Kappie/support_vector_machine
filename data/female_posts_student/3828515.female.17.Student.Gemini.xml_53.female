Namely, I played the piano and scanned some old band photos. Then my mom and I went out to a few random stores, and I bought a new Chicago album and some Altoids. Woo hoo. Tonight I went through a bunch of old pictures of me and my family and friends and stuff. That was interesting. So yeah. It's back to band camp starting tomorrow... Fun, fun, fun. I'd better get some sleep soon. Good night.      Last song I listened to:   Tuesday's Gone  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Last album I listened to:   Prounounced Leh-nerd Skin-nerd .   Last meal I ate:  Slyders and fries.   Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .   Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .   Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I found some more old band pics.   Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  I do not know.   Last person I talked to:  Melissa.   Favorite song today:   I Ain't The One  by Lynyrd Skynyrd.   Favorite food today:  I do not know.   Most interesting thing I did today:  Got a new Chicago album.   Funniest thing that happened today:  David found a program that runs in DOS and purposefully crashes and makes random beeping noises and writes random green text all over the screen.
