It made me uneasy, to think I would laugh at such a thing.  maniacal laughter.  So, today. Feeling better about myself, randomly. Much better. Everyone else around me? falling apart. It's terribly tragic that right when i'm feeling good everyone else needs to feel down. Tragic, yet expected.  Things are okay(?) rar?  tommorow i find out for sure if I'm going to Hawaii this summer. I want to be happy, but that fact that my dad's fake ass girlfriend and her equally fake daughters need to come with us somewhat puts a damper on my vision of paradise.  Convo.  Dad- I just want to know if you're okay with us going to Hawaii with Stef and her kids, It'll be uncomfortable, but I want you and danielle and I to go somewhere together.  Me- Okay, so when do we need Stef and her kids to hang out as a family? If this is uncomfortable for you too, why invite them?  Dad- *mumbles* *walks out of room*  You know, when I grow up I want atleast 3 kids. I want them all to grow up being friends with each other, a tight knit family that drives each other crazy but all love each other so much, because we'll all know everything about one other. I feel deprived of family, I would never do that to someone else, least of all my kids. They'll have a loveing mother who cares to ask how her kids day at school went, and what happened with that girl they liked, and what they got on their math test.  ...I hate not having a family.  good mood just went down a notch.
