I feel like it's Sunday, I always feel like it is a differnet day to what it actually is. Mel started being a Russian ballerina  like she'd promised at 2.30am in the morning, 'cept her name was Adolf Hitler and she kept doing the salute Hitler sign, so it was more like German ballet. Haha, it was funny. Helen was laughing so much she was practically falling off the couch!  Well, neway, I jsut decided I'd tell u 'bout Luke's b'day party, which was...hmmm...let me think, last Saturday, yeh that's it. And Pip M-H couldn;t come because she onyl got the e-mail invitaion the day AFTER the party. haha. Poor Pip. Well neway, the party was in his warheouse thingo, and we had these two little fire things which were really nice and warm, 'cept all the guys kept on blowing the embers so I got burnt!! *sniff sniff* And Monty was kicking around the coals on the ground, and now I've got little holes in the bottoms of mi thongs from stepping on fire embers! :p But we got to toast marshamllows, and we put a disgusting banana  in  the fire, and charred and cooked it it was sooo disgutsing, and Mel threw cornchips in the fire because it amused her to see all the sparks come off it! Haha, and they all melted, it was so funny.  We watched 'Love Actually' which was good, cuz come on, who desn't love love actually!? It's great! And during the movie all the girls were like "Awwwwww....." every 2 secs and the guys just sat there laughing at us because we found it sweet, especially Pete Banning, man he found it hilarious! And during the movie (because beforehand a massive peiece of that yellow insulating stuff fell on Luke's head, and then we saw a possum in a hole in the roof where the stuff had jsut fallen) the possum shat on Bec's shoulder, it was sooo disgusing, then it slid off her shoulder onto the ground and she stepped on it!! Yuck!  Now moving on to a different topic, the other night, last Friday i think, Ernie people went to the beach because of the Ethiopian people who came to our church. And the becah was really fun, we mainly just mucked around on the beach and played touch footy and frisbee and talked and stuff. On the way to the beach Gem and KC and I went in a car with T1 (Tim McCloud)and Rob, and I was telling them about the "Church Gossip Tree" and it was really funny, cuz I'm just like, "I know a secret about you, and you, and you...." 'cept of course I wouldnt' tell them because I'm good at keeping secrets! :D And I tried to sell 'Speedo Joel' T-shirts on Hannah W's behalf. Hehe. She's actually gonna seriouly make them. And after the beach we went to the park for dinner and played games there and stuff, and every1 ATTACKED the BBQ Meatlovers Pizza! And on the way back in the car we were with T2 (Tim Buckley) and we had 'Tim Time' where he had to tell us about himself. Man, it was a fun night.  Well neway, bi bi Beth
