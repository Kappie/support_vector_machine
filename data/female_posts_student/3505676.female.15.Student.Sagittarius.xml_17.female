[[great  fun!!]] Went to yearbook @ 12, learned how to use the elaborate program for making spreads, [[Ali is the STAR of the volleyball team and the soccer team won the national championship!!]], and thinking of ideas for the student life pages.  Got to leave an hour early and got dropped off w/ Christine @ Casey's!  Good thing he came home right after maggie, jen, and alyson left.  Oooh! Look at the little mini chair in Casey's room! I fit on it perfectly! Want a juicy juice juice box? Changed into our bathingsuits [[sorry casey, not all together]] and headed over to optimist to go swimming! Got nice tans, bobbled in the water, and saw old men in speedos! Along with clint..haha, joke in it of itself. Great convo between me and casey about guys staring at girls while theyre w/ another guy. Trip to get snackies, thanks for the food guys! and nice biceps.  Then out to panera to get my mom's birthday cake/brownie and then i came home and WOW! i spent an hour w/o her and shes BACK! Chris and Al are 2gether AGAIN!
