Anyway, I won't go into people's business because that is their business.  I do however have some feelings towards the entire situation.  First of all, I know a few people with a lot of hate in their hearts.  I know a lot of people hate others because of heresy.  That to me is sad.  If you are going to dislike someone, dislike them for what you know they stand for...meaning hate someone after you have met them with no preconceptions...don't hate because others hate.  That is so high school and I have been on the receiving side of that hate and it is not a pleasant feeling.  I guess that is why I empathize.  Second of all, people make mistakes.  Don't get mad because someone you confided with confided with someone they love.  If I tell something to my friend, I won't be surprised if it is told to someone else...I mean that is the risk you take when you speak about someone.  It is just a lesson you learn.  So if you really don't want something to get back to another person, keep it to yourself or know that there is always a chance it can bite you in the butt, but most importantly know that in the end you can't shoot the messenger.  Hell, if I say something to someone, I know I should only say something I can tell that person to their face.  Lastly, carrying hate is a sad trait.  You become a very acrimonious person and well you end up pushing away the people who care about you.  I think about the distance and gaps in relationship and well it is because people are unable to accept their wrongs and move on.  Life is all about moving on and not carrying baggage with you.  It is about forgiving those who fault you, not just some people.  You cannot say you can forgive if there are people you cannot forgive.  You cannot be a whole person if you cannot accept that no one is perfect, everyone faults another person, and that hate shows ignorance, lack of compassion, and selfishness.  I am not some perfect person preaching here...these are all lessons I am learning...but I am a mother now and it is my great hope they do not live with hate.  I hope that the things I talked about above carries through to them and that they don't' learn the lessons I have learned the hard way.  It is hard to be judged on a couple of situations in your life because it is only a small fraction of who you truly are.  I have been judged so many times and many times the depth of my character is forgotten.  That is sad because people don't see how hard I strive, the amount of love I carry...WHO I AM...and it is all because people don't move forward.  Anyway, sorry for the ramble.
