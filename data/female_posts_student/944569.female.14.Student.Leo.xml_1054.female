It was the WORST movie I've EVER seen (might have something to do with the fact that I never saw the first 2 and couldn't tell any of the characters apart)!!   Laura and I walked out and went to Indigo.  Apparently we missed the 'final battle'.  Too bad, so sad. And if we wanna see a movie lets go thrusday or friday or saturday just not between 5 and 7:30 on thursday or friday.
