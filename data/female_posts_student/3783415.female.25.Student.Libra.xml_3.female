How about we (i) each post a message on the main page here, and (ii) try to post a comment to this post, I'll delete them when we all make sure we can do it.  Can post: Matt Rinn Andrew  *i'll edit this as people post **and by 'post a msg on the main page,' I mean, try to make a post similar to this one.  On the frontpage.
