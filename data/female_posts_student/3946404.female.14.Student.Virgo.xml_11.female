It's adorable, lolz. Later, His mom and 2 brothers joined us to get the A/C's and we went around looking for more stuff. Looking.... Looking...Looking... Couldn't find anything, so we went to the trailer park behind us (Forgot what it's called, grr) and hit the jackpot. It looked like either somone got evicted, or hit the lottery and just left alotta junk behind. I got like, 7 stuffed animals for myself (gave one to Cameron), and got 2 dolls for Kimberly. Thank God we went then, cuz it just POURED...and harshly poured. It rained so hard, it hailed. Not a normal thing for Florida residents..at least not down in South Florida...Well, anyway, I found out today that I don't think I could possibly call Cindy my best friend again. Heard some things that I didn't ever think she'd say about me. Wow. Best friends for life... Angel ~N~ Sexi.....RIP, Forever.I wonder what it'll be next. Maybe nothing.Look at what Shawn wrote me:   lilzonex187: your life would make a good movie   krazednkonfuzled: lolz, shut up    lilzonex187: dont stop its like a movie and i know whats about to happen   lilzonex187: next    Well, that's Shawn for ya. Big Teddybear Bodyguard. I got Renee' to sign up for livejournal too. Awesomeness... That should make a good one.I'm gonna go outside...I think. And see if Jojo's out there..TTYL, Peash Ouzz!!!!
