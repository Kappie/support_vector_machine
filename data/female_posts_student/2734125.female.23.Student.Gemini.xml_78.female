And it might be the early hour, or it may be the compilation of too many nights spent wandering in a thin veil of distraction woven of lust and non committence,  but suddenly the longest day reminds me, that we are marked to return towards the dark- tomorrow will be slightly shorter than this day was, the day after that as well. A slow decent into the black and cold.  It began with the clouds stained pink, and I knelt in the street, trying to cut in front of the rays filtered under clouds,  leaking through another rainy day, kneeling while an apple burned in my stomach. I prayed then, trying to claw my body memory to the cycles. I prayed with the grit of cars digging through my pants, into my knees, and while I want to say I felt pain, I didn't.  I was composing a poem in praise of everything, reaching for the lines that could describe my awe of it all. I was trying to say how I cant speak of it. All yesterday I felt the hollow drumming-  I know the symptoms of this sickness. I recognize it early these days. Its an empty ache,  one that reads like sand paper attempting to polish rotting fruit. One day you'll reach the pit of me and I will gleam, till then its just soft and sad.  While I waited for your blessing, getting oiled and pitted, I received its rind bitter taste in my heart, a shuddering spasm of the other side of knowledge. I remembered that I have lost another comforting pad of innocence. I remembered that I am new born, and that those suprises I spoke so highly of, only days ago, are the searing off of another layer of blind love. The ache moved fast then, having been brought to the surface, and moved to an itching behind my eyes I cant scratch. Even as I write this the day has grown darker.  While I was questing connection, I found the surgical removing of emotion. While I was looking into a myriad of eyes, attempting to know the soul under, I was hiding. I wanted to berate one soul for its fear,  another for its subtle lies,  another for its hand in my hair, another for its lips brushing mine and not meaning it. All those faults, and a thousand more that I had pushed on them, those are mine.  Can I ask myself for forgiveness? Even as I think forgiveness it is done. There was a humbling that gave me honor, and then there is the bowing in my own self centered shame. I can still give you answers, but there is a layer of meaning, an ingredient of acid, that may now make it taste harder to you. I want to cry and sleep, but I am breathing through it, riding it, watching it, this chronic ailment.  And this, the longest day; the longest grey struggling, the lengthiest hot iron marring of pink flesh, the day where there is no escape but constant movement, and that is no escape at all because the inner stillness is lacking, the day when all I want is to fall back to oblivion, just for a moment of rest before the storm, but its upon me, and I am ready, but weary, and this day is now.
