Things were basically the same You didn't once talk to me Yet it seemed you were playing a game  The third time I met you... I wished you'd talk to me I wondered deep inside, Just what you thought of me  The fourth time I met you... You came to me and talked I listened quite intently You asked me to take a walk  The fifth time I met you.. We were walking down the hall My heart was beating rapidly You told me you would call  The sixth time I met you... You asked me on a date You said tomorrow at 9:30 Although that was pretty late  The seventh time I met you... You seemed to be a sweet guy You made me feel comfortable You made sure I wasn't shy  The eighth time I met you You seemed to have lost interest You were sweet talking the next girl You'd found dating at its simplest  The ninth time I met you... You tried to apologize You acted like Mr. Innocent You acted like you hated my size.  The tenth time I met you... I wouldn't look you in the eye You repulsed me to my limit You were another typical guy.
