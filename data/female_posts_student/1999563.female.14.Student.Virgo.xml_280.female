I doubt I will get picked though, I suck at improv!!!   AUDITIONS ARE ON FRIDAY!! AHHHH!!!!  They are scary!  I wanna be in Annie SOOO sitnkin' bad.  i will die if I don't get in.  I am singing Impossible from Cinderella, I was gonna sing In My Own Little Corner but I...oh I dunno. It just sounded weird with my voice.  The problem is, I wasn't going to audition but I just decided todayt I would so I am memorizing this song at the last minute. I almost have it alll memorized but now I am loosing my voice! Ah!   Hahaha  This is FUNN
