His first lap time trial was  16.200  and second lap time trial not as fast  16.254  that currently put him in the 4th fastest time spot but we still had 55 time trials left and after all of them he was 11th fastest Skip  was in 410 Heat # 3. He started in the second row on the outside which put him starting 4th out of 12. He came in 7th. He then started in the 410 B-Main. He was in the third row inside which put him starting 5th out of 21. He came in 5th and that ended his nite. Only the top 4 would transfer to the A-Main.  The fastest time trial of the nite was made by Chad Kemenah with the first lap time trial being 15.832 and second time trial lap being 15.851.  There were some crashes and my second favorite driver  ricky logan  crashed in the B-Main. i saw the whole thing from the moment its happened to the end. i saw that it was going to happen he got over the cushion and collided w/ the wall then he flipped like literally at least 5 times before landing on the ground. he was ok. another crash was erin crocker she hit the wall too but was fine. Jeff Mitrisin also had a pretty bad crash his was i think the first or second one of the nite and he's pretty good. Skip also hit the wall but it was nothing serious. they just had to push him away from the wall and he was off again only he had to start in the back of the pack. we didnt get home til a little after  5am . but it was worth it the racing was incrediable. also i forgot in the 360's there were a lot of first timers and there was this 16 year old kid who it was his first time ever in a sprint and he'd never raced anythig not even a go-kart and he made it to the 360 A-Main. he hit the wall but was fine and there were 2 laps left and he had to start at the back of the pack but he passed two cars in those two laps so im guessing that he'll be pretty good.
