The bad thing was, they were pretty much sold out because it was over Thanksgiving. I was bummed out, but my mom said we would figure something out. So I went home and started looking over the schedule at school and all the possibilities. The table was literally filled with crap about the cruises. So then my mom found this promotion in her Sam's Club brochure for really cheap tickets aboard the Oosterdam, the exact same ship as last time!!! So she called about it and they were going to give us this room with a window, but by the time they went to reserve it, someone else all ready had. So the lady said she would find us something and give us a call back soon. Well about five minutes later we got a call and she told us there was an even better room available and it wasn't even that much more. So my mom put it on hold and she is going to call back tomorrow and confirm it. The lady said that if they don't still have that room available they will have to automatically give us a better room for the same price!!! How freaking cool is that?! So I just checked my mom's e-mail and the confirmation came about our flight tickets, so now all that is left to do is to book the cruise, which all my mom has to do is call. I can't believe it. We are going on another cruise, and it is the week right before Christmas break, so I will get three weeks off.  Yay!    So then I was so excited that I went into work at five and realized I didn't have to be there until seven, so now I have to go and get ready AGAIN! Oh well, I don't care. I am going on a cruise, WITHOUT BEN! What could be better? Tough question, huh?!  Okay, so I am still mad about the whole deal last night, but this just made it seem so much better. But don't think I will forget about it. I will never forget about it. Moron!   Pssh...In your face buttmunch.    k-  P.S.: I am SOOOOOOOOO HAPPY!!!!!!!!!! YAY!!!!!!       k-
