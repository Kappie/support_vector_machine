I think it's my friends. I don't feel as close with them as I'd like to, you know? Like they all talk on the phone for hours and then there's me who might have a five minute convo with them online. I don't know... I guess before, when I was always with greg they all had the chance to hang out and get close and stuff. It just feels like, if they had a problem they wouldn't come to me, like they would feel weird talking to me or wouldn't want me to know things. I don't know, it's probably just my own paranoya (sp?) or something. Maybe now I'll have more time to spend with them and stuff. I hope so... oh well... I'll talk to you after Ashley's peace XOXOX
