And then after the course, a group of four of us went to Bishan J8. I went and ate the hot and spicy noodle in the food court. The more you eat, the hotter you get. But I think it is alright. I could ''tahan''. Seiyu Bishan now has MUJI. Yeah! I went there. Very interesting. It is combined with clothing, stationery sets and food. Quite expensive but cool. The colours are not very flashy and are all on the cool side. Ya know, brown, silver, white and blue.... I actually wanted to buy some stuff but a friend of mine was rushing for time... Too bad, I will try my luck tomorrow. OH, Dragon Boat Festival is next week and my mother had already made the dumplings AND I am having it for dinner...
