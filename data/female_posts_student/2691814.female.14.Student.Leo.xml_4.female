Anyway, alla the other groups get songs that actually have great harmonies and sound cool but our song is more classical and not fun atall to sing. 'Oh its just so beautiful'mrs brown would say to us. Bull crap, first of all its in a different language that no one in the group knows and 2ndly I just hate the song lol. And on friday i have to wear my frikkin dress the whole day! I really don't want to plus I have to miss 6th which would be alright if it weren't my favorite class! I so do not want to go to this thing.     Anyway nothing has really been going on. Just the usual Jeremy being a complete Dumba** and Francesca got back from California today. She said she got grounded or something but she wont tell me why>i really don't care anyway. I've been kinda down lately..not quite sure why, just something feels wrong. I felt like I was going crazy last night cuz i kept waking up with my eyes WIDE open. I didn't understand lol.     Grandparents are coming on Friday which yes, is my SAA day. Ijust hope they wont talk about PaPaw the whole time....i feel so uncomfortable around my family when they talk about him. I'm still sad about last year and him dying.(it just really made me crappy feeling) still does when i think of him. Man, now i feel like cryin.
