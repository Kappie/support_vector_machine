I sAw ThE "PaSt" haViNg Ft HiS aV.   aba hindi ko inakala na mabubuhay pa siya ulit sa oz. naiimbyerna ako't nakita ko pa siya... i was kinda nervous when i saw his NEW avatar moving... he stopped right in front of me... good thing i was talking with rainbow_val during that time... good thing i was good in faking my laughters sometimes... good thing... i never did such reactions upon seeing him like that... now i realized that his things were not really given to all people at oz... he transferred it... goddamn... such lies... lies, lies, lies... i'm sick and tired of it... oh i wish i never saw him that time... i wish i hoped that he will never come near me during that time... damn...      i was very sure... that some part of me still missing him... after all his lies... damn i think i was starting to cry... everytime i post here in my blog... it's just always make me cry... argh.   last night (i guess), i saw kuya pao at the bus stop... we exchanged "how are you"s etc. until he asked me what happened to us... "Naku kuya, wag mo nang paalala...Wala na kami pakshet na tae yan" someone reacted... it was the girl i saw shouting one time at v/r, yummyhotchiq/phaubie, "marc? poor_marc?" argh... bat pa natanong un ni kuya? nakakainis e... ayan tuloy i have to fake it all over again...
