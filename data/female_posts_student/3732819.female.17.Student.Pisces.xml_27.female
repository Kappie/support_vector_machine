Techincally today is Saturday, July 17...which means that me and bren's 6 month was yesterday, 6 months, that half a year, i didn't get a call, or even an e-mail....i'm pissed...he didn't even remember...once again if he's going to say something to me like "i was busy" then i'm going to assume taht he was even too busy to pick up the phone and say a sentence....and if he doesn't even have time to pick up the phone and say something for 2 mintues then don't have a fucking girlfriend. for fuck sake.
