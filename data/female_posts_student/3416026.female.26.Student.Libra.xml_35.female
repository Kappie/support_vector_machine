I love horse racing for a few reasons, mainly the adrenaline and the stunning beauty of the horses' bodies when they run.    But then I realized that Smarty Jones is the epitome-- the absolute personification-- of the god-damned American dream.  No wonder people are all over it.  Lately (in the last few days) the story has not been all about  urlLink his 11 1/2-length win at the Preakness  but about his humble horse background.    This morning, the Washington Post ran a story about how  urlLink Smarty Jones is the ultimate underdog , having come from modest origins (read: not California), has a (formerly) no-name trainer and a jockey who not only used to be "fat" and an alcoholic, but who had also never ridden in the Kentucky Derby.  This is the ultimate American Dream story!  Can't you just picture Smarty pulling himself up by his little horse bootstraps, bucking the odds and emerging into the limelight in a blaze of glory?    I think this is a real testament to my own American-ness, and that of all Smarty Jones' fans, that we LOVE this story.  Unwittingly, probably, but we do.  I guess it's just how it is in the United States.  I still love Smarty Jones, but I am always glad to acknowledge when I'm being suckered in by the ideology.  You know.
