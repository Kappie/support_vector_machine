First off i never said your life revolves around me nor have a ithought that or even implied it. know something i am not trying to make my blog becoming. it is my thoughts always has been always will be. and i dont care if you hate me. and you are doing the same thing you are writing all that on your blog but saying you hate it when people do that to you?!? who do i think i am?! that has NOTHING to do with anything. i dont like to be threatend. you've been a good friend of mine for awhile. and i dont talk to alot of people anymore because i dont get online to chat normally i have a purpose or im bored and dont wan to talk to anyone. i dont talk to you about my problems and what not. and about the movie. you stated in your blog "but most likely it will never be finished" so dont even try to lie about that. i did suck it up and move on thank you very much. how do i lie to you? tell me once when i have lied to you and been a crappy friend. and writing my thoughts on the blog isnt talking behind your back. when you talk behind someones back you dont want them to know . if i wanted to talk behind ytour back i wouldnt have posted it on a PUBLIC BLOG. and since when did i not have a soul? you make no sense what so ever davis.
