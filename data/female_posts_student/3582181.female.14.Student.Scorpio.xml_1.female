I wish you would unclench your fists, And unpack your suitcase lately theres been to much of this but don’t think its too late  nothings wrong just as long as you know that someday I will someday some how gonna make it alright, but not right now I know you’re wondering when     *sniff* video clips so sad   You know, I've put an effort into posting as many random comments on random blogs as possible. Quite amusing, but noone seems to post to me. What is wrong with me that I can't make friends on the internet? the  INTERNET !! This is the place where 50 year old men plot to meet girls sporting the prime of the adolescence in parks, disguised as a pre pubescent boys.  Not that thats what I do......  Some people who HAVE NOT POSTED on my blog have been asking me what 'cirkus bear' represents. Well, for all my vigilant fans out there, it was originally 'dancing circus bear', as I once had a halucination of a brown bear, wearing a green and pink polka dotted party hat with a bright pink pom-pom on the end. He was dancing in an odd fashion, hopping from foot to foot to the tune that goes 'doo doo do do do do doo doo doooo doo'. Great description there.  Anyhoo, I'm to bored to write about myself anymore, I'll go write about other people in their blogs.
