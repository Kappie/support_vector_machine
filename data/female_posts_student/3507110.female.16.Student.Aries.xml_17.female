I'm blown away by the sight a hose emptying water onto a dirty cement floor and I wonder if this isn't what makes me so damn different. I've just drank the last of my soda but it's not like it's the end. But how am I to know that? Six months..Half a year..what is going to seem like half a lifetime. This issue seems to be popping up lately. I don't want to let go but my fingers are slipping and as I close my eyes to go to sleep I can't help but see you god damn face. I can't help but be tortured by you, every night when I supposed to be dead to the world. Tonight I will see you in those lighted corridors and you will pass me like the wind brushes against the flame of a candle. And I will turn to follow you and find you gone. I will hurt, I will cry, I will run until I find you again. And you will hold me and comfort me. It's like there are two of you in my dreams, two of you in my head, two of your haunting souls that never cease to chase me. You don't want to leave anymore than I want you to and doesn't that fit the description of the fate, star-crossed lovers. I've always wanted a fairy tale romance and though you're more like a ghost tale told around a campfire I can't help but want that more than anything else I could have ever imagined. Time will tell me the tale of a dead man. I am sure I'll be captivated by it's morbid words and I will become a slave to the calendars plastering my walls. The number of days will turn into the number of weeks and they will turn into the number of months and I will be here. Listening to words paired with music, smiling at water hoses spilling their blood onto the hard crust layering the earth, marred with pink scars. I am like a damaged toy, one you always handle with care, one you always hold and take pity on. I don't want pity...I don't want your sympathy..I want you to see me for what I am..An angry bitch, a ranting, raving lunatic, a crazy mother fucker with no hopes of recovery. I'm sick, I'm never going to get better so don't fucking lie to me! Don't treat me like a doll! Smash me around, kick me when I'm done, Hurt me like no one else has ever hurt me! You know you want to, so just do it. Throw me on the floor and make me eat dirt because everybody wants to take a swing at me sometime or another. Just tear me in half, tear me apart, reach down my throat and grab my heart and then smile and kiss me and tell me you love me. Cause you know I die to hear you say it and when you do I have to stop and tell myself that it isn't real. You're not really there, You're not really saying it..It's a good dream, that one, and I can't help but play along. Because I want to believe it so much but somehow something won't let me. There isn't much time left, I can't let you go without seeing your face again, I can't sit here knowing that every day we grow farther and farther apart and that we're getting older and older, one more step closer to death's door, five minutes away from too late. If you could just hold me and let me fall alseep in your arms to the tune of your heartbeat, the last words I hear being I love you and I'll come back to you, I could go on with a sense of hope...I could be happy for just that one instant in time....
