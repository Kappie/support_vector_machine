Well.. yesterday (friday) amanda, me, jr,chris, and amanda's youth group @ her church, went to hurricane harbor! It was SO fun!! We left amanda's church @ about 10:30 and got back around 7:30! WOW.. that was one fun day. Anyway, last night amanda got mad @ me *tear*. Well.. this morning (saturday)my mom, my brother, and me went to my sister's  car  wash, then took gracie to the vet(if you dont know who gracie is, she's the dog we found and we're keeping her). then we went to the pet store and got her a water bowl and a chew rope thing. Now i'm sitting @ home, and i think i'm going to leigha's when she gets back from shopping! fun fun! well.. dont have much more to say! lata!
