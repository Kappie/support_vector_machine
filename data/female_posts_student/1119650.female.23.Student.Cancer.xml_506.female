Why is it that in order for me to ever get space/quiet/peace/serenity/alone time in my life I have to come out swinging and acting like an insensitve bitch?  Do I really speak that unclearly to friends and co-workers that it always has to result in me flipping out about stuff?  Its definitley my problem, but now how to fix it?  On an unrelated note:  please know that I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you today as there was no way I could get out of work, but know that you were in my thoughts all day and I think you're a brave, strong and amazing person and I'm here for you no matter what the hour.  3
