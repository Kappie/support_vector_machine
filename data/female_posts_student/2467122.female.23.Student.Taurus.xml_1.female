The time went by so fast- 5 hours, that's an easy extra $60 bucks in my paycheck.    I've got two finals tomorrow... The first at 8am... That is way too early for my brain to function!!!  Gotta finish up the studying and then hit the sack.  Eh, who am I kidding... Watching the Nanny and then passing out.    Wish me luck!!!  ttfn,   *me*
