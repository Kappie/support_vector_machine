To be honest, we are kind of lazy.  We both appreciate pants with elastic and sleeping until the afternoon.  So often life is anti-climactic but comfortable, with more excitement taking place in thoughts and conversations than in my mundane existence.  But we talked about going to Brazil, driving there, and that is a dream I will cling to.  Haven't I concocted similar schemes with every close friend and lover?  My friends I moved here with wanted to caravan to San Francisco in a beat up van named Annemarie.  My first boyfriend and I were empty as pockets, thank god, because if we could have paid gas, we, too, would have landed somewhere below the equator.  My only cirteria was that we had to be somewhere where oranges could be picked right off the tree.  My husband and I almost jumped a train on several occasions.  We talked about how the "world" seemed like the killing grounds of love.  (What a crock.)  And then my good time friend, over every glass of bad blush wine we share, tells me that one day we will move to Spain to become waitresses and live like The Sun Also Rises.    These are not the sixties, and I can't hitchhike across the desert like my dad did.  I can't roll into New Orleans and sleep on a feather tick mattress in the trunk of my car.  This is not the Jack Kerouac generation, and I'd get ruined for sure if I tried to make it to the coast on the back of a produce truck.  But in spite of this modern age, with its celly-phones and guns and mass media inspired mistrust, I'm going to have an adventure.  One of these days, when I realize that I have nothing much to lose and a world of stories to gain...I will hit the ground running.  He's leaving today, going down South.  He thought I was upset about it, but more than anything, I just wish I were going somewhere, too.  Which is irrational.  Military deployment is nothing to get jealous about.  I will miss him something terrible, but already my list of obligations has grown so that I'll be busy enough not to feel it too much.  Last night we went downtown and he got a little lit up.  I gave him a piggy back ride.  We went to a nice Irish pup and made fools of ourselves for a bit, then we walked to the park that's been the scene of many a nighttime drama.  But it was smooth and easy, and we laughed at jokes I no longer remember and climbed a tree.  I think he knows how hard I feel for him, which is very good, as dangerous as it might be.  I found myself telling him all sorts of deep dark secrets, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him everything.  Just a vague outline of a rather torrid past.  I can't help but keep one card in particular close to my chest.  Something hardwired in me, the self preservation instinct, makes me withhold it.  But I suppose it will never matter one way or the other if he knows or not--At times, I am able to forget it happened at all.  But sometimes I feel guilt bearing down, and a shadow of the life I could be leading right now passes over me.  I could say I feel bad, but honestly, I end up thanking my lucky goddamn stars for the life I'm living instead.
