I went to the 24th floor when I was finished.  Ani told me to just come up, he'd leave the door unlocked, because he was getting in the shower (!!!).  I dawdled, because I wasn't really sure that showing up when he was running around in a towel would be conducive to keeping my distance and my guard up.  Didn't matter, actually.  When I got up there, he was already dressed and smelling like somebody's gooooood time!   My  good time.  It's weird how Ani and I are able to be so comfortable together.  I feel almost embarassed at getting naked in front of him, and yet more embarassed  because  I'm embarassed.  It just feels as if being naked with him is the most natural thing.  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear that.  I don't think I'll give him the satisfaction.  Besides, he already got some.  Afterwards, he challenged me to an in-bed game of chess.  Last week he whooped my ass three times in a row, and don't think he didn't gloat his head off.  Okay, in my own defense, I'm no stellar chess player, but I've never been scared to play a game or two.  But he figured out how to get check-mate in four moves (bastard) so he killed me right off the bat in the first game.  In the second game, I was just really stoned and making some bad decisions.  By the third game I was less stoned, but feeling totally defeated and just let the game get away from me.  But today, well sir, today was quite a different story.  I didn't just beat him at chess, I beat him at his own game!  He thought he had me on the run, and I just came out of nowhere with all sorts of threatening pieces and strategies.  It was awesome, almost as good as the sex!  And he was such a poor loser!  He was absolutely confounded--how could he possibly lose to someone he's beaten three times???  He wanted to play again, but that was it, I was tapped.  Even though he still couldn't believe his loss, Ani still made me dinner.  And for a single guy, with barely anything in the fridge, it was actually pretty good.  He's a cheese-man, as in, he dresses up every meal with cheese.  Or at least that's the impression he gave me.  Sometimes, that hot, hairy bastard really confuses me.  Like, he offered to drive me home tonight, and I told him that he should stay at home and get work done.  He pressed, and I said ok.  "And I get to stay over, right?"  He asked.  Excuse me?  Stay over, is that what you said?  It sucks, I can't tell my parents about him, because I don't know what's going on with B, and what if things aren't really over?  He and I are really such a good match, but getting into something like this right now is a bad idea.   (If it's such a bad idea, how come I'm already doing it?  Good question...)   And while he seemed rather distant once I told him he couldn't stay over (what did he really expect???) he told me to call him when I got home.  Instead, he called me.  So I called him back, and had just started chatting when...  Perfect segway:  when I got home tonight, I saw that B had called, at almost 8:30.  So I called him back, but left a message on the machine.  "Hi, I saw you called.  Just wanted to call and say hi, see what was up.  I guess you can call me anytime you want."  When I asked Mommy about it, she told me that he called to make sure I wasn't home, then dropped by.  What???  Oh, so that Daddy could sign his FAC thing.  Yeah guns.  But he called me back maybe 20 minutes later.  We talked, and it was weird, disconnected. Like talking to an old friend who's little more than just that.  I'm beginning to think that things are really over between me and B.  I'm still not sure how I feel about that.  THAT is why getting into this with Ani is such a bad idea right now.  When things have been going so poorly with B, and things are going so well with Ani (who is still getting used to me, getting used to the idea of being with me,) it's hard to really figure out the truth of who I'm better suited to be with.  I just can't see B yet, and I can't let go of Ani yet.  Totally eating my cake.  I'm disgusting.  Though I'm sure Ani would understand if he knew the truth, there's no way he'd be  happy  with the knowledge that things between B and I aren't as over as I said they were.  And after about 20 minutes of awkward silences and harsh truths, (for example, that B gathered up all my stuff and is holding it in a laundry basket in his room--including the book of mine he borrowed but hasn't finished reading yet,) I decided that we were teetering dangerously close to the brink of our issues, and I just don't have the strength tonight (luckily I'm ok to blog.)  But after we hung up, he called back only a moment later, sounding sniffly, and said "I still love you."  "Oh, sweetie, I didn't know if you'd want to hear me say that, but yeah, I love you too.  Goodnight."  And he hung up.  It's hard pulling away from one that you love.  I just don't understand where we're supposed to go.  I mean, B knows me, like he  knows  me in a way that no one else possibly could.  I guess because I've never been with somebody for five years.  But Ani seems so perfectly suited to the kind of boyfriend I need right now.  He seems more in tune with my needs, but only my right-now needs.  I dunno.  It's the culture difference that, right now, stands out as a barrier to any hopes of something more serious, more long-term with Ani.  I don't know if his Indian parents will like a non-practicing white girl to marry their son, so that we can have mixed-ethnicity babies.  I don't think my parents would have a problem, and I don't know for sure that his would, but he's said on more than one occassion that his parents are really traditional.  B's parents I already know I have a problem with, but at least there wouldn't be anything overt they could ever point to as problematic if we marry.  Although, I can think of a few things...  I need to think, I need to act.  B won't wait forever for me to make up my mind, and Ani's going to get really hurt if I let him get close and then tell him I'm going back to B.  Why can't I just be with no one?  Because I'm afraid to be alone, because I'm totally boy-crazy, because I don't know if I could do without sex and I wouldn't want to have any sort of one-nighters.  Eww,no.   "Bob, does it get any easier?"  "No."
