SO much pot. like a huge tupperware thing full of it. haha. and their dad seems wears business suits and is a lawyer and smokes pot...haha.  anyway. im bored, and hungry. i found out whats wrong with my tummy, so now i can fix it. i get to drive! im going to count up my hours, i think i have enough. my mom is being all crazy and attached.. she doesnt want me to get my liscense or something, shell never let me drive to get more hours and shes setting all these "guidelines" for me driving...  ::shrug:: i guess i dont really have anything else to say.  im in a really bad mood, but yet a really good mood. im gonna go eat ice cream.  ~abby
