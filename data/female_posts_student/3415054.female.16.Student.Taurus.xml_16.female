There was this one baby well shes like around a year n shes a really cute n shes a foster kid n shes been n like 6 homes so far.. shes a really cute black baby. I never thought I would ever say that.. lol. but turns out that her foster mom practically gives her no attention so I held her from like 2 till 5.30. I would try n give her to my mom but shed scream so Id just carry her around.. n then when she saw her mom she started screamin.. That was the saddest thing.. to kno that the lil baby was dreadin it. but shes gonna be back tomorrow but the thing is Im not.. cuz I was sposed to go w/ my mom again but Justin wants me to go with him n his sister n the resta the gang  cuz its her b~day.. so yah. But I really hope that baby finds a good home cuz shes an adorable thing! But yah. I needa find my wallet.. lol.. its got like 300 bux in it.. so Ill catchya later. mwah! bye!
