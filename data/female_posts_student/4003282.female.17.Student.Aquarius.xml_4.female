I get to see Brandon, Erica, and Syd.   >   I'm listening to that song.   So much is going through my mind. Just about things. I didn't end up going out tonight. I feel like I am geting jealous of someone.. just because this person might take away my best friend. And I know I don't need to think it because this person is my friend to. Its just hard. Because I don't know why it bothers me because I want my best friend to be happy. I want both of them happy. But I don't wanna be left alone. Ya know? But I am going to keep my mouth shut. Because I don't feel like being a bitch.   Work was boring. Till I was leaving and me and Freddy had to run through the rain. I almost felltwice. I couldn't stop laughing. Then I saw Devin. I miss him.   So I'm sitting here talking to people about how they found someone. Not going to mention names again because... Well I'm not. And how this person likes my friend. Well I just wish I could have someone. I miss being happy and in love. Or not even in love. Just haveing someone around. God why can't I just be happy. I haven't had anything bad happen to me. But not anything good. I think that's all I have to say.. Because no one cares anyway.  >
