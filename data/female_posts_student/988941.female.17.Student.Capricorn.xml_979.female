I am what some of my sisters uni mates call a 'mature drinker' because I drink stuff like JD and Coke or champagne. I don't like the cheaper alcopops and things. I can see why Jackie drinks and I think teh way she drinks is fine. She has a few but never enough to make her tipsy or anything more. I don't have a problem with people like that I just don't like folk getting drunk because its just plain stupid. Back to the example of Andy - missed his own party. Jenny at his party, threw up everywhere and probably felt like shit the next day liek most who got pissed. Its dumb. You can't remember it so whats the point in even going? Our leavers ball - it was mainly the popular or tarty lot that were drunk, they can't remember half of it. Our lot: no alcohol, just high on the buzz of the evening and we can remember every precious moment. Glad Dave's party was good. I spent the evening doing bloody homework because I was given way to much to do. I mean its half term for goodness sake, its a holiday. We should be relaxing, getting our systems back to their full potential not running them down further by working. Its not even as if I actually went away on holiday. I spent a few days on the geology trip which was doing geology work so that is fair enough, then two days with my sister at her uni who I haven't seen since she went which again is fair enough. I think family comes before college. I wouldn't be suprised if I told the teachers 'I haven't had time to do the work because I was in hospital after being a car accident' and even if it was true they would still yell at me.  I am sick of life right now. I mean is it really worth all this? All this stress over a few pieces of work, the stress of earning enough money, the stress of knowing what you want to do in life and who you want to be with. Its too much and soon its gonna get me.
