Like my song???  ********    "The man is serious, and if you don't believe me, you're a HATA!" -Boogie on the Wade Robson project  Oh shit that rocked so hard! Don't make fun of me too much, but I watch the Wade Robson project... I'm just enthralled with people who dance. AAnyways the finale is on right now, and they just did a mega awesome tribute to my main man Michael Jackson!!! Cause he's the lord of the dance, man! Aw It was soo cool. They recreated the Smooth Criminal and Thriller dance numbers (not as good as das originale, but still applaudable). I know all y'all except Charlotte think I'm nuts, but you know what, you ARE being haters and he's awesome and if you don't understand, well too bad. Millions of other people know he's awesome and his music and dance inspire people, and if you want to listen to tabloid fodder and be so close-minded, then you know, that's your deal. I love Michael Jackson!  Wow that really brought back my old passion I have for that guy. I mean, there was a period when I just got on him where I was soo obsessed, but lately I've been into lots of other stuff (well I always am) but whenever it comes back, it's back, yo. All I have to say is, it's all about the music and crazy talent. And most people still can't look past their pre-concieved notions. A few years ago that would've really bugged me, but I'm cool with it because I'm happy knowing that he had an impact on my life. K I'm scaring you guys. WOOOOAAAAH. I think I need to go listen to the Beatles. Looove those Beatles....  Hm.. to post or not to post.... op....Post!  I swear to god this will be my one and only MJ post. I swear. No really. But actually listen to what I'm saying! Suriously.
