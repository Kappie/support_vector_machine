Darrio   could not come because unfortunatley he was "stuck in NY" So we had 2   ex-Rosevillian   girls teaching us. They started us off by teaching us   "The Sexy Chair Dance"   Now this was funny.  A classic . We started by taking 4 sexy steps to the chair, then swinging our leg over, and rubbing our hand up and down it, we turned around and did 8 counts of hip swaying, we then walked around the chair, and sat down and crossed our legs, all with   "sexy" faces  . Then we did 4 leg open/twist things, spread our legs, and rubbed our hands down one leg at a time. Then we got up again, walked around the chair, flipped it around and straddled it, then spun our leg over the chair to sit sideways, then flung our back over the chair, flicking our legs up and down. Then we walked around the chair again, and stood on top of it and did a   "sexy pose".   Then we did 4 flicks of the arms, then a bit of a   Marilyn Monroe   pose, then 2 shimmys, and we did this weird pumping the air thing on both sides. We jumped up and opened our legs while in the air, and landed back on the chair, straddling it. Then we alternated our feet movements, swung our leg over the chair once again and did a   "sexy finishing pose".   Haha. It was so classic! Just try and imagine all that with about 50 people doing it, all at varying lengths of ability might I say. Haha. We then had 2 perform it in groups, and the    Resus    people arrived only about a minute after we finished performing. Haha. Poor them they missed out on us. Mrs. B even joined in in all this chair dancing! And the girls teaching us found it funny that they were teaching us the sexy chair dance at an all-girls Anglican school. And they also said weshould perform it 2 our "some-one special" much 2 Hannah's delight. Haha. The only person who objected was   Katherine Montano  . Everyone else was having loads of fun. She sat with her arms crossed and said she wouldn't do it because it wasn't   "proper dancing"   and was   "innapropriate".   Haha. Come on just because we were dancing 2   stripper music   while   straddling    chairs     !   Haha. Naa, all in the name of fun.   So, the moral of this story is:   "Watch out boys! Us sexy chair dancers r coming 2 get ya!"     *Mwah*
