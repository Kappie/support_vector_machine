Apparently I'm like those old arthritic people. I get laid as much as they do, too. Har dee har har. Okay- the lowdown. I had an excellent time at the party. Can you say badminton, lemon tarts, and low-cut pastel dresses? Also, the top story of the evening: I have a crush on another girl's boyfriend. I am so going to bad-girl hell when I die. To be continued.
