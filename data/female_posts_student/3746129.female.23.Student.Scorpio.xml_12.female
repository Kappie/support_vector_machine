Vast alley ways, stretched out to a grandeur, That used to echo prominently In the traffic backed up for miles. Shops now abandoned, were once the featured attraction. Galleries and museums housing works by people, Whose obscurity meant nothing To those with obscure tastes, Are now stagnant with the pungent aroma of decay. Remnants of the world left behind Are apparent from the bodies Left to rot in the open; The casualties of time.
