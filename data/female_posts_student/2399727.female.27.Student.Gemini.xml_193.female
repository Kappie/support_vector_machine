(drum roll, please!)    Ignatius Theophilus  .  Why would I give a 10cm high cactus such a lofty name?  He has a beautiful fire-coloured orange and red flower, and  Ignatius  comes from the Latin meaning "firey one".   Theophilus , which is perhaps my favourite Biblical name to pronounce, comes from Greek meaning "friend of God".  Given my new line of work, I thought the two sounded very appropriate and manly for my little guy.  He shall be called Iggy for short.
