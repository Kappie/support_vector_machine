I didn't rreally write in it much when I first got it and when I did they would be short entries, about the size this one's probably going to be, but they would be for the whole day which is really short.   Kind of funny how things work. I never thought myself to be the kind of person who writes in a journal everyday. I never realized how dependant upon this I would become. Just...introspection. I'm done now.
