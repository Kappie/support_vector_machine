They've done a very good job...except on Sephy. That, I am not pleased with; they made him ugly! Besides this, I just finished Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. I saw the movie a thousand times, but the book is infinitely better. I can't believe how Hollywood always manages to butcher any work of minimal or major excellence they get their hands on. It's sickening. In other news....I now know why I always feel suffocated when at my mother's, and I with all my moving and whatnot, I know why I feel like I'm standing at the edge of a cliff, waiting to fall. Great, I just got screamed at by my mother. I can't wait until I'm out of here, and I don't have to put up with her bullshit favoritism. I can't believe what a bitch she is when I'm around... Nevermind, none of you care anyway.
