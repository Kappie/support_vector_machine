Unforunetly and fortunetly i had the badass class this year . I say its bad because in the end it pisses u off that every teacher hates u and ur known to cause trouble so there all after you mostly . But good because there are all those memorable times where u laugh ur ass off over wat u did in the year thinkin how dum but halarious it was !like the days u get kicked out of class on the moment i must say not so funny but after it cheers u up ..and u get closer to ur friends .Unfortunetly for me this year half of them left but next year will be a fresh new start and u get to be how u wanna be .Maybe even romance ... or a lifetime friendship !!!
