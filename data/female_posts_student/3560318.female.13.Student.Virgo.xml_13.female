(i needed to get 2 pairs of flip flops) and so i go in and they have this  huge  rack of  white flip flops . i was like "yes!" then i was looking around for some  black  ones and i realized they didnt have that great of a selection anymore so i asked one of the people that worked there and they told me to talk to the person at the counter so i did and she said that i could get them but they will ship them to my house within 7-10 days so i was like alright i want my flip flops! so yeah i had to talk to this person on the phone and give her all my info and while im talking to he ri can see my mom waiting in the car outside with a really mad look on her face. then i also realized i was $2 short because maureen told me that the flip flops are always 2 for $5. the lady told me that sale was over weeks ago. lol oh well. so i ran out to the car. my moms getting pissed and i asked for $2 and she was like, "YOURE TAKING ALL MY MONEY!" so i just took it and walked away. ha. anyways. now i have my  white flip flops . yay. but yeah. so i have to spend the night here at georges again. oh well. i get to go shopping tomorrow. thats basicly the only reason why i have any desire to be here right now. lol.      i guess today was...    alright...i guess. :-D    yeah. well its probably a good idea if i leave now. so ill see you later!!!!!        love ya!      a lys sa  :- *
