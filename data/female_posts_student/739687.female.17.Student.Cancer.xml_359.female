You know, I start taking my Zoloft tomorrow...can you imagine...someone without depression on that stuff?  I wonder what affect it's going to have on me.  So yup yup...Umm...I guess things are fabulous right now. Sure. Why not.  I was thinking yesterday and I was wondering why I evoke the emotions out of people that I do.  I think it's because I'm bad ass.  Rofl, okay, I sound so gay right now.  Yada yada well fools I'm gonna go...my mommy and I are making a fruit pizza and I guess I should go put in my part of "my mommy and  I ".  Over and out, crazies.
