Mix honey,butter,sugar,coffee-mate,tomato ketchup,chilli sauce,coffee,milo and tartar sauce together. Fun but just gotta bear with the smell on our fingers after that. So fun to play with food. 17 years old already still play..so childish rite? The worst thing is that Theo blow bubble into the disgusting mixture using straw. yucks..eww..  After school, Roy,Lim,Wilson,me,Keith,Nicholas,Addison and Valerie went to Sakae at HarbourFront. Addison's treat.We had buffet. Total cost was $143.80. Too bad Theo didn't want to come along at the last minute, otherwise, we can really play with food.  Lim was perfectly normal today, which is quite unusual. She'd been nuts(to the power of infinity) for the past two days.  Giggles is very alert despite her age. Her lecture was damn boring that Theo and I started to write messages BUT she noticed us. Haiz..but one thing. The teachers din bother to stop us from eating sweets in class.It's against the rule to eat in class..but who cares, rite? Rules are meant to be broken(quote Mandy)..
