But its going to be o-kay.. because ON THURSDAY ME REESE BRADLEY NEIL AND VICKY ARE GOING UP TO SEE HIM! A WHOLE DAY OF WAKEBOARDING FISHING KNEEBOARDING TUBING ... AHH! ITS GOING TO BE THE BEST DAY EVER! HIGHLITE OF THE SUMMER I HOPE! PLUS... WE GET TO GO ON A 2 HOUR ROAD TRIP TOO! AHH!!! IT'LL BE GRATE! ok enough with the capslock. Anyways, these past few days have been great.. everything has been perfect lately.  I have my boyfriend... the best one ever too! And my best friends.. Reese  Vick.. and ALi  Mel.. whom i do not see very often because THEY NEVER CALL ME ANYMORE! AND then theres my stephanie... It sucks that she lives so DAMN far away because we always have so much to talk about n stuff.. but I'll get ahold of her one day i suppose. MEH! Back to my Ricci. We are the perfect couple. We have SO much in common..  our personalities just.. CLICK i cant explain it.. its like the DARKNESS song.. "I cant explain how your makin me feel.. my hearts in overdrive  your behind the steering wheel.." Its a good song.. Everything is just rite where it is now.. It all falls into place eventually.. thats what im used to hearing. Well i hope this is where it falls because this has been the most fun week.. the most fun SUMMER! Everyone can drive..  ppl are just friendly.. AHH!  So a few nites ago *(Thursday)* Alex had a party.. It was really awesome  fun.. I had a grate ol time.. Til the boxing started. Jesus CHRIST! Reese boxed.. Katie  Mandi boxed (bad idea) and MIKE AND JOHN BOXED! THAT was a HORRIBLE thing to watch, I mean.. how would you feel if your ex-boyfriend and your new boyfriendbox? They are good friends.. but STILL! AH it was terrorizing to watch i mean it! But.. ohh well whats done is done. But oooh WELL! I CANT WAIT TIL THURSDAY! I HOPE THIS WEEK GOES BY REALLY FAST!
