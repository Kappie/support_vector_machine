It would appear that due to poor harvest of the few cows that farmers have, milk is hitting an all time high at nearly $4.00 per gallon and rising.  Experts are saying that it will continue to rise to above $4 in the summer and decrease toward the end of the year.  I like milk, I do, it does a body good and all that but I am not going to be happy paying so much for the consumable!  So, while milk does a body good it does the pocketbook bad, really bad!  So now, in a world torn my war and economic strife we can add the struggle to afford milk to our list of daily worries.  Apparently not only is milk on the rise but so are all dairy products, coffee, and gasoline.  It’s almost too expensive to live in America these days!  If the taxes don’t kill you, the price of milk will starve you to death!!!  I know what the economic “experts” say about the high prices of…well pretty much everything, but I still don’t quite understand it.  Money is becoming worth less and less.  Dollar bills may still be green, and they may still look the same, but they are worth less than post-it notes!  It almost makes me want to move to a less expensive country, I hear Budapest is nice this time of year!
