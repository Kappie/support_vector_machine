Anyways, does anyone out there love family guy?  It is the best show in the world! i love it and if you dont love it or you havnt seen it watch adult swim at ten thirty PM on mondays- thursdays. everyone loves it. but yeah, just in case, Viewer's Discretion Advised! it is hilarious and fun and if your parents wont let you watch it then they suck!  Hey i might go to the beach this weekend, and if not then the weekend after next.  I like this blog thing. i had never heard of it before jamie introduced me to it like sometime this week.  ha ha i have posted once everyday. like she told me monday about it and right away i signed up.  okay enough about that... does anyone have anything interesting to share? i hate thinking up things on the spot. how do you feel about the war and all?  i think we should pull out... it's like another Nazi- Jew situation only we are the Nazis.  We are torturing their people.  Well we arent but some of the soldiers are... i see it on the news all the time! about how Iraq is being not only rebuilt, but terrorized by us.  i feel bad and bush sucks for that even though it isnt his fault... i like bush but the way things are going he doesnt stand a chance at reelection time.  i say that Chaney should have been the president! ha ha just kidding. bush is handling things okay but it could have been better.  my mom has this eerie habit of reading over my shoulder. sorry to change the subject so soon and stuff but it is annoying.  anyway, that is my opinion of it all.  send in some of your opinions too so i can see things from different points of view.
