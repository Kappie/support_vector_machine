       
      Well, just took 10 multiple choice question quiz after having read through the entire semester's worth of notes just once - 6/10, not bad, considering before I read through said notes (thanks, Mike, I owe you one) I knew just about nothing.  Normally, I do not rely on multiple choice to get me through, but I feel like on this exam, I will have to hope that the multiple choice and short answers save me, because my essays are going to be rambling messes.   It's all going to be over soon.  Going back to re-read, and see how much more I can glean before tomorrow night.  Woo hoo!
