And my knee is still really REALLY messed up. In fact its so bad that i have to wrap it in ace bandages to keep it cushioned and kinda semi-straight because its so bruised it hurts to bend it.  But, like a trooper, i still skated/played on it, i just wore a kneepad over that one knee.  Our team lost 5-1.  did i mention that our team yesterday won 5-2? Eek. Omg there was this stupid kid that could NOT skate.....and i'm serious, the kid didn't know how....but he seemed to think he could so he played.  He kept on getting in the way and falling all over the place.  Actually a few times, he was in my way of getting the puck, so i pushed him/knocked him over so i could get it to my hot Spanish teammate.  AND i dropped my stick one time and this kid, Diego (i think), was running off with the puck so i went after him and took him down!!!  And he's 6ft tall and all buff!!!  I was proud of myself.  Ugh but it was so annoying, everytime i tripped or fell or ran into someone, all the guys were like "Oh are you ok!?!?!" and come over and try to help me up....even guys that weren't on my team! i just pushed them out of the way and yelled at them to stay after the puck and not worry about me.  its like they thought i was all delicate/fragile and that i was going to break or something or cry.  Um, hello, but i'm playing on a badly bruised knee thats killing me and you think i'm fragile??!?!?!?  Argh, oh well.  It was kinda nice when i ran into the hot guy and he held my hand to keep us from both falling and spoke in his nice spanish accent "Terribly sorry, will you be alright?".  *sigh* oh well, i don't think i really have a chance with him.  My yelling at people and cussing probably scared him and he probably is extemely intimidated by me.  Also maybe my tolerance for pain (i was being hit every 5 secs by guys and bopped in the face with sticks etc.) will intimidate him also.  Meh, no big deal.  Argh, now every muscle in my body hurts and i have so many bruises and scraped....but i look so athletic and rebellious now!!!  I look like a hockey player!!!....somewhat, lol.   Sports Update: apparently the Stars won last night 4-3 over L.A.....amazing!  Britt said they did really good after the first period.  Coppell plays Keller tonight in Euless, go go Coppell Cowboys!!  I know you guys will kick ass!!!!  I will not be able to attend *tear* but i'll definitley be there next week!  Friend Story of the week!!!:  Lauren Caldwell  Haha this one is a good one.  Lauren was this girl in my PreAp Biology B class with Mrs. Terry.  She was quiet and i never really noticed she was there because i guess she never talked lol.  After the first couple weeks, i noticed that whenever me and Brittnee would make jokes about "our boys" or whenever i said something stupid, Lauren would always laugh at me.  I can't remember what it was but she was laughing at me again and this is pretty much how we introduced each other.  I walked up to her when we had free time this one day and said "Hi, my name is Taylor and i've noticed that you've been laughing at me every time i say something funny.  I think thats awesome and all, but whats your name?".  Seriously, me and Lauren talked about this and we think thats about how it went.  So after that, Mrs. Terry made us lab partners (i think it was because she was trying to separate me and Brittnee, lol, but whatever it worked for me) and we had to disect worms.  Well, as a child, i was scarred for life by watching this one Goosebumps episode (early 90's represent) where this kid disected worms and stuff and eventually this big mama worm came and took him away and treated him just like he had treated the worms.  *shiver* scary stuff.  So now, Lauren is all poking at the worm and i'm freaking out while she does it....and then comes my famous line...."DON'T SCREW WITH THE WORMS MAN!!!!!!".  When i said that, i had to reveal my entire fear of worms to the class.  Oh yes and after that every dissection project was quicly followed by "don't screw with the crawfish man!!!" or "don't screw with the squids man!!".  Lol, don't forget the crawfish Angie and Lauren!!!  Then there was the part where we dissected a crawfish and i'm yelling at Angie not to screw with the crawfish and then she pulled the freaking claw off and Lauren and me are freaking out screaming "YOU SCREWED WITH THE CRAWFISH MAN!!!!!".  yeah, good times.  Even after biology, me and Lauren were still tight.  She was always there to help me with my guy problems and listen to my rants.  She is one of the funniest people i know and i know she'll always be one of my good friends!  Now we brave the perils of lunch together and stalk the blonde kid with no fashion sense!!!!  Good times, i love you forever Lauren!!!!  ** Next week is so Liz Whiting, the Great One  Gotta go!  Love,  ~~~Taylor~~~
