So many people have made the whole Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit books seem SO INCREDIBLY wonderful, but sadly I was bored by the first chapter...I fell asleep reading it, I am only hoping it will improve for it is so hard to remember what you've read if you get bored and stop actually  reading  the story.  Maybe it's just me. I donno.  It rained all day today.  I love the rain, but this rain was rather unpleasant.  It was just too cold to be sopping wet, and I wasn't left with the wonderful smell...I wonder where it went.  I love Finding Nemo, it makes me happy. Ellen Degeneres...De...D..whatever, does an awesome job with Dory's voice, it's amazing.  Escap√©!  I hate going into AP chem everyday, I dread walking into that classroom.  I still can't get over the fact that I actually  failed  a test. Oh but I got a math test back today and I got an A, i was happy, I even got a "super" sticker...yay.  First A on a test in math this year. Woo. Anyway...I must get back to reading...
