All i do is get up, go to class, eat, come home, eat, and go to sleep. this truly not what I excepted. I though that because I had a good week last week that I would have a good summer. But what I have to realize is that a week is just a week. It doesn't determine anything. LIVE DAY TO DAY IS THE MAIN THING TO DO.
