I mean I guess I have it all wrong because I'm marrying my fiance' because I love him and my life feels empty without him. Besides the Bible says "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and rust destroy and thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth or rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal, for where your treasure is there your heart is." Matt 6: 19-21. Am I the only one who thinks that how big the diamond is or if you even have an engagement ring, doesn't matter? What matters is that you love eachother and you love God and let Him be at the head of your relationship and your love will be strong enough to survive anything. I would venture to guess that at least 30% of the married couples today are not in love, they just get married for the money. Which is why there is such a high divorce rate. I think people need to wake up and realize that money and jewels are nothing with out love!
