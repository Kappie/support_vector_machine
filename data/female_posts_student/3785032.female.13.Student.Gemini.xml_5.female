It took awhile. We saw harry potter 2 and around the world in 80 days...Hehe we only payed for one..its so easy to get in illegally there. Then we came back to my place and watched movies and simon sleepover. Next day:June 23rd..WeNT TO Simon's house.Took the train.. But we had to walk from the train station all the way to his house...about 8 km!with the heat and "shortcuts that end up having a ton of mosquito bites that swell up really big..but simon has a pool...its kinda cold though..then we ate cookies and junk food. then at midnight we went outside on his swinging love seat and talked. it was cool. then we went swimming the next morning then we went back to my place and we slept over with vlad,alice and laurie and simon. it was cool.. it was st.jean baptist day and we met up with vlad at 10pm under the bridge. and it rained like mad... it was romantic scenery.Before we had a barbecue..lol alice. then next day simon went home and me and linda went shopping. she got her outfit for 50$...grrr. I might buy a one shoulder shirt like hers. for 15$ i think but I need money for bc. which I will never have enough for but oh well. might as well try.then we ate like pigs...Saturday: Mom.Julia and I went shopping I got some really hot sandals from tommy hilfiger for only 35$ and I didn't pay for them. Thats why its good to shop with parents sometimes..And we went out for coffee and there was two really hot guys there...
