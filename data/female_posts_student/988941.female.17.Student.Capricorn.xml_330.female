It was snowing this morning when I was getting ready to come out, it stopped about 9pm, and now it has started raining/sleeting- it's disgusting! Are you lot stil going if the weather is 'orrible? I hope you have fun whateva the weather! Well well. A fun holiday full of revision etc etc and lots of homework. Yipeeee. I'm quite looking forward to the Europa Centre though, even though loads of people have said it's really crap and a waste of time.Ah well, I'm off to turn the heating on and then to do some constructive work- toodle pip!
