Well the play was 8 people and a band up there singing a ton of songs and they did a lot of audience interaction. They'd come and sit on people's laps and sing to them. One guy, Rick came up and sang to me. Later Will, the guy mom knows, came up and talked to my mom for a bit. Next thing I know later on they're bringing people on stage to dance (I don't dance). They tried to get me up there and ended up getting my mom up there and they tried to get me up there one more time so like an idiot I went. First of all I wasn't wearing dancing shoes which was a problem. They told me to get into it more and then asked me if I could do the swim so I did that cause it's easy. Then everyone was going back to their seats and they made me stay up there, so they could all sing to me. When I was leaving Rick said I looked so terrified. I was embarrassed but I'm really glad I went up there cause I did have fun looking like an idiot.
