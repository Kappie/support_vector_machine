"hey, do you know about grad school yet?"  i know, i know... i should be thankful people care about me, but just let me vent... i have NO idea what's going on with any of it!  i don't know what's going on in my life because everything is up in the air right now, so i have no answers.  when i talk with friends, i wish we could talk about politics, the weather, what's going on in the world, or just chill out and have a beer together.  i don't want to talk about me.  me makes me crazy right now.  on another note... i've really been missing sweden as of late.  i looked at my pics the other night and i miss that life so badly.  being so young and carefree, nothing to stress or worry about, no bills... just playing with kids all day, drinking beer and going out with my friends at night.  what more could you ask for?
