We tought that we're ganna be late but when we arrived at the church..the priest is not yet there. It took us about 20 mins. for waiting the priest then.. When the mass is over we cant go home..why?! Cause the rain was pretty strong  we have no umbrella  even though we have one we still cant go home..asking why again?! There's no freakin' jeep.. So, we decided to ride a trycicle instead.
