I am hoping to save up my vacation time and Ching and I will try to go some time in the early spring of 2004. Thats when we origionally planned it. We dont think we will have any children by then but you never know with those kind of things. Nature has a way of springing that kind of stuff on you. Its not like we are trying to have a kid, but then we are not really trying to NOT have a kid either.   Man I wish I could win the lottery. I hate working!
