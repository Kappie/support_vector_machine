I wonder if Sandra Bullock will show up... ; )  The rest of the weekend will be spent in Austin until Sunday afternoon.  Then I must come home to study for an EVIL Education test... I like the class a lot... and the professor... but there's just SO MUCH stuff to study.  I just took my Politics exam... and it was really easy.  I think that I got an A.  There were only 2 that really threw me for a loop... and they were T/F  so I have a 50-50 chance on those.  :-)  Anyway, I'll post something when I get back in town on Sunday about the weekend.  Hope everyone has a great weekend... hopefully the rain will go away.
