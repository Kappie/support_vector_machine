Me and Brittany think it tops Pirates of the Carribbean and thats saying alot considering that we saw that movie like 4 times each in theatres.  It was soooo awesome.  you felt like you were really in the game.  There was this one part where the Commie Russia dude knocked over the USA goalie and scored a goal and then Me and Britt started yelling goalie interference at the screen.  Then we remembered that we're not really at a game and they didn't have that penalty back in the 80's.  oops.  it was sooooo awesome.  And that movie is full of hot guys!!!  Every hockey player in that movie was incredibly hot and they all had really nice bodies.  Me and Britt were crying/sniffling at every emotional part of the movie.  I mean seriously, the guys behind us must've thought we were chronic depressive because we were all like "that was so beautiful" *sniffle*.  lol, we had to do an eye liner check after the movie.  Oh yes and here comes the part of the evening that i'm sure Brittany will rub into my face for the rest of the year or everytime Coppell plays Flower Mound.  Let me just set the scene for you.  There were these mediocre-looking guys right behind us and i was like "hey for the hell of it, lets chat them up".  So, me being the stupid person i am, said "hey do you play for Flower Mound?" (they had FM letter jackets on, class of '05 if anyone wanted to know) and i'm thinking that they would assume i'm talking about hockey.  And here goes the rest of the convo: them: yeah we play for FM me: you play on the varsity hockey team?  (i told you i was dumb) them: no we wrestle me: (i didn't hear them ok!) what? you play basketball? them: no we're in wrestling me: ooh you play wrestling! great.... and then me and Britt practically ran out of there!  oh man but here comes the best part of the evening besides the movie.  There was this hot guy standing next to us while we were waiting to be picked up (month and 1/2 until i can drive! thank god!) who we KNEW this time was a hockey player because his sweatshirt had "Jaguar Hockey" on it and his number was on the sleeve (#96 if anyone knows him).  So i really wanted to chat him up also, but i was too scared.  Finally i caught his eye and he smiled at me, but i was still too scared to talk to him.  Britt took my cell phone because i was about to chew the antenna off, a habit i developed last Coppell Hockey season during playoffs and state.   I grabbed her hand that had my phone it it and i was like "you don't give me my phone back i swear, i'll give you stitches like last time".  Now this got that boy's attention.  Now some back history on the reason i said that.  Last time me and Britt actually weren't very busy, we decided to play hockey.  So we got our skates on and started to play.  She was beating me by like 3 points (i think the score at the time was 6-3)  and then she said something that pissed me off and i don't even remember what it was.  So i hit her with my hockey stick and she had to get stitches on her back.  She hit me back with her hockey stick and i got a cut across my face.  Her cut was slightly worse though, lol.  (haha Nadia, we talked about this in aerobics, i can't play hockey because id get so pissed off so much that i'd rack up more penalty minutes than the entire team combined) Anyways back to the story.  So we revisited that entire experience and even improved/elaborated/exaggerated just a tad.  That guy was watching us and smiling right up until he had to leave.  I think he thought it was funny that people such as us, who don't look the type to play hockey much less get into a scrap, were threatening to beat each other up.  I especially loved the part of the whole thing where Brittany's like "You can't stand to lose!!  You love to win and you're a sore loser! i had to go easy on you because you were losing so bad!" and then i said "you did not! i played just as hard as you did.....bitch!" and then she's like "i'm going to get beat up real bad next time we play aren't i?", i said hell yeah you are.  Man, i think our little "show" was not so abnoxious to get everyone's attention which is not what we wanted but not too little exaggerated to get the guy's attention.  lol, good times Britt that was fun!  Britt also spent the night last night which was fun.  We had Jack in the Box for dinner and contemplated all of the reasons why my Niko hasn't tied the knot yet with his fiance, Liisa.  Ok lemme just give you the back history here.  Niko has known this girl since early childhood and officially has been dating her for 7 years, living together for 4 of those years.  They have been engaged for exactly one year as of today.  Ok and here's something else, most couples have started planning their wedding by now and at least have a date for when its going to happen.  No, not Niko, he hasn't got a date or anything.  How do i know this?  I have connections.  So me and Britt think maybe he's having second thoughts.  yaaaaay! He doesn't need a fiance!  I don't know about you guys but if i had been dating the SAME GUY for more than 4 years, i'd be like "ok so are you going to marry me or what?".  I dunno, maybe Liisa doesn't have anyone to go back to.  Maybe she's clingy?  lol, who knows?  Yeah so then we were online and we saw Tom's (Jess' boyfriend) profile that said "I love ya Jessica".  THEY'VE ONLY BEEN DATING FOR A WEEK AND A HALF!!!!! And thats really weird because most of the time guys are the last people to ever say "i love you".  And the fact that he spelled it L-O-V-E rather than L-U-V.   Scary stuff.  Whats really bad is that Tom is driving Jess crazy and there's an 85% chance that she's going to break up with him on Monday.  Reasons why: too clingy, too touchy feely, ALWAYS FRICKIN THERE, never really gives he space, never really gives her friend/leave me alone i'm talking to my girls time, knows where all her classes are, she has to hide from him to get time to herself and he has 7 tardies in the last 2 weeks because he waits until jess goes to class before he goes to his class.  Jess is starting to hope that he gets 3 more tardies so he'll get an ISS and she won't have to see him for awhile.  Yeah, so that didn't last very long.  Oh well.  Me and Britt also watched Zoolander, brilliant movie.  gotta go, everyone see "Miracle" this weekend, i promise you'll love it!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
