[ Thu Jul 18, 04:08:17 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] John Q and New Best Friend   So over the last two days I have managed to sneak in two movies between all the fighting and backtalking... most of you know what I mean.... So here is what I think:   New Best Friend  Well, it was interesting... I kind of liked it. Hadley (I LOVE THAT NAME) was played by Meredith Monroe who most know from Dawson's Creek fame. She was not only stunning in this, which she never was on DC, but she played all sides well. She played the bitch against the genuinely nice girl very well and I was impressed by her. The story is about these three girls who are best friends and rich and live in this house together at Colby (I believe this was the name) College. They befriend this poor student and basically turn her from rags to riches... at least as far as her look went. The roommates were played by Domique Swain who is quickly becoming the queen of Independent films and Rachel True, of The Craft fame. Well basically the girl they befriend (Mia something or another) ends up in the hospital with an overdose and it is suspected that she OD'd at the hands of someone else. So Taye Diggs comes in and investigates everyone, including the boyfriends of the three main girls (Scott Bairstow, Oliver Hudson, and some other guy I recognized.) It's an odd movie, but I liked it. I think part of what I liked about it was that it showed all the characters in a poor light except maybe Taye Diggs and Scott Bairstow. None of them were completely good people, least of all the girl they take in as their friend who ends up trying to play them hard core. It might be worth the rental for you.   John Q  I really liked this movie, but OH MY GOD did it break my heart! It is just so damn depressing and even when it's happy it's depressing. Basically this is about a guy who can't seem to get a break but he loves his family very much. Esentially he finds out one day that his son will die without a heart transplant and even though he's agreed to do it his insurance won't cover it. So even though he basically sells off EVERYTHING he and his wife own he still doesn't have enough money to cover it and he finds out that they are going to release his son. So he takes a gun and grabs the heart surgeon who was working on his son's case and holds him as well as some other odd ball characters hostage. But in true Denzel form (that is, until Training Day came out) he still remains the hero even though he's holding up a hospital emergency room. Everyone cheers for him. Basically the movie is all about trying to get his son the heart transplant. It's a good movie, I would rent it, but just remember that it will break your heart...
