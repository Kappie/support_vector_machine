We're really hard, going to Quasar!" and then we get happy meals and go and watch Ice Age - Yeah we rule!!!! But i feel a bit bad that i'm losing my religion by spending money at McDonlads! (shock horror) ( urlLink www.mcspotlight.org ) but i only bought some fries and a drink so its not like they chopped down acres of rainforest to battery-farm chips! mmm.... i still have a whole loada sweets left... i'll just sit here infront of you and eat them tantalisingly slowly.....
