But maybe I ask too much or walk in the wrong direction All those thoughts drive me insane and i wonder how long I fell this.  Pain, is not really what it is no, it's something different with a different name and you, you never tell me damn thing I hope someday I'll learn to play this game.  Fear, of course I fear the unknown because the unknown is a stranger to me but if you erase the pj's then what could a stranger be that remains to be seen.  Life goes on, it's just the same every day. Life goes on, though you think you feel this pain.
