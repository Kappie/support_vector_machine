I love the new stuff I'm learning, I just hate all the readings, quizzes, homeworks! The good thing is that I'm graduation soon! YEY, just a couple of semesters!! This time next year, one more sem! Gosh it seems soooooo far away! But they say it will go by really fast!   I hate pimples! Although I'm not the type to have any acne problems, I still get the occasional pimples, my face would feel so rough and weird! Yuck! Pimples sucks!   Sometimes, I don't understand why I am the way I am. My bestfriend moves to town and of course its expected that we become close again. But for some reason, I felt myself drifting further away.  Maybe its because of my situation at the time which includes a break up from a long term relationship, home construction, constant trip to and from home depot and the grocery store in the scorching weather, picking my mom up from work, being a driver for most of my family, my niece's birthday, and my own(which sucked BTW and ended in tears), my constant misery and of course school. But mostly, it was the break up that really affected me.  I expected her to at least understand my situation. I was dealing with my misery all on my own. I couldn't confide in anyone else. Of course I chose not to, because it was the only way I knew how to handle it. Plus, I didn't want to look like a fool.    The thing is I didn't even feel bad that I failed to be a good friend to her. Because I was hoping she should also understand where I'm coming from.  I kept thinking why couldn't she understand me!!!  I've noticed that ever since I came back here from New York, I've drifted from my former sociable self.  Maybe its the Vegas lifestyle that makes people anti-social, or maybe its the environment I'm in.  But when my bestfriend came to visit the 2nd time, so many things ticked me!! From then on, I felt like I'm not the same person anymore.  I often find little things that would make me mad so that I'll have a reason not to be close or to be the way I used to. I often find myself thinking that we barely have anything in common anymore and we have so much that separates us now.  I really don't know what's going on with me.  I'm not sure why I've changed so much.  I'm not sure if things will ever go back to the way it used to be between me and her. It saddens me, yet I'm not sure how to fix it or what to do about it. Do I have to be the one that needs to change or does she? Am I the problem or does she also have something to do with it?  Is it just me that changed or was it also her?  I'm not sure anymore! But I do know that this is a very big problem for me right now because it may cause the end of our friendship, and that's what I don't want to happen.
