The best thing about learning a foreign language is learning how to spell "conjugation." It's a good thing to know when you speak German. (Conjugations of "sein" and all: bin, bist, ist, sind, seit, etc.) (On a similar note, I believe that they are "Eunichs,  too .")      Not ready to give it up that easy, huh? Giving up anything isn't easy. Kinda reminds me of all the people I've seen that have given up their homes, jobs, and all that just in the hopes that they might get to see them again. Sounds kinda odd, doesn't it?>
