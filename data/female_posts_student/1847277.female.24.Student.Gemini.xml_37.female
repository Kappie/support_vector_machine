I got my India paper done, but no prelim essays this week since I've had too much to do.  And we have two weeks for these topics, anyway.  After Monday when I turn in the midterm, I'll have plenty of time to write the essays.    It's another gray day in Ann Arbor.  Here's hoping the sun will come out and lift my spirits.
