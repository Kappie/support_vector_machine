And I just couldn't help myself... *sniffle sniffle* I've decided I do like pink, after all. *sigh* Turns out I  am  a girly girl... dazok though. Long as I don't play with barbies too often, I am not too upset.   And yes, by 'him' I mean 'The Ultimately Cute Hobbit.'   And yes, what will now follow is a bunch of complaints and exclamations and periods having to do with my life...   So. Frodo just up and talked to me in science. Which was cool, because, you know, I love him and all. Also, C didn't dump J (which, if you read the whole gang's blogs, you'll already know), which makes me very happy. Because I didn't know she was going to dump him in the first place, and when I found that out, I felt really bad, because I had already told Mrs. WW that the two were going out, which made Mrs. WW really happy because she just adores J, and so now that the two of 'em are sticking together I'm just ecstatic because I don't feel nearly so guilty. *keels over, out of breath*   I've got tons of work to do in the next week. Aiee! I'll get it all done (I always do), but it still stresses me out. Mostly because I leave it until the last minute, every time. But dazok too.   Ummm... Wonderland hopefully on Saturday, and OMG if D can come that'd be hilarious. I can't believe K invited him. She honestly talked to the guy for like 15 minutes!! And if any of you hit on him, I'll kick your heinies to the moon. He dated my sister. Paws off. *g* But he's still funny as heeeell, so izallgood. Do we know who's going at all yet? Too bad J aren't going. I like J ^^; I woulda liked to mention glittery tube tops, or something of that sort... heehehehehee!!   So, that's all for now. Sucks to P, for saying it was too pink and he didn't like it. *growls* *pushes P off the sacred cloud*   And, I also finally told T that I liked Frodo too. *whew* It was really getting to me there. Felt guilty for not telling her. So that is deeefinitely a load off the mind lol. I was actually worried that she'd flip out, but she took it pretty well; we both know it's highly unlikely anything will happen. Plus, you know how I am with crushes.... *wicked grin*   heh.
