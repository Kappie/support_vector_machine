For you: Why must i let some problems ruin our friendship,it really dun worth it.Maybe you dun noe how i feel when i am with you,but i also dun wish to hurt you.Rumors are just a pack of words,why must i let it concern me.Although you did hurt me but i will try to forget it cos no use holding on to the past to the future when it does not help.Pple should always be given a second chance.I also dun wish to end our friendship as we are already so many yrs best friends.After some time of thinking shall i savage our friendship,i choose to savage it.It is very hard to start a new chapter in anyone life especially when you had a good or best friends.Maybe one day in the future,when we sit down and talk abt our days when we were young,we may laugh like shit of the things we did.I am sure one day,the four of us will sit down together and talk.And i am going to organise it.Haha.. tats all.  To the clique: Hey,i am fine now as i had solve my problems.I would also like to take this chance telling you guys how i feel in this clique.Although i am always very quiet when we had clique meeting,but i had alots of things hoping to tell you gals.I am very glad tat i am in this clique although the person i dun like is in the same clique with me,i still control.Sometimes i really feel like giving up,but somethings always stops me from doing it.It was the memories tat i had with you gals.You gals did made an impact in my life,and i nv ever regreting to start a new chapter with you all.Although my best friend sometimes dun like me hanging with you gals,maybe becos i spent too much time with you.I can understand tat friendship always had ups and downs but after a while it will be fine.Even though many times someone wants to leave the clique,the others members will do their best to stop tat person.That is the clique sprit.In this clique,i had seen or gone through alots,my thinking did mature(dun laugh) and i am more patient.Dun think tat i always look happy tats mean i got no problems,you are wrong i had a whole stack of problems but i dun wish to touch it cos i hate solving it as many things could happen.Sometimes i will feel lonely in the clique or feeling very far apart from you gals.But i just keep quiet cos i dun think i am the only one and i dun wish to make a fuss.Many times after a clique meeting,i will always ask myself should i give up and leave the clique?I love to be with the clique members as you all always cheer me up,give my some advice or comfort me.I admit tat this yr i did cried alot mainly is the chairperson position.I am looking forward to our next clique gathering which i am planning.Ya..tats all!!
