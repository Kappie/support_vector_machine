I took a nap and now I feel...incredible. A lot less sick than this morning, but still sick, but I can prevent it, I think.   But I feel really tired. Thinking I'm going to have to drink some poison/caffeine to stay awake tonight. God, I don't like what that shit does to me. But I love it so.  It smells like popcorn, this school is weird.
