And school starts in 11 days.  11.  Less than 2 weeks.  It feels like we just moved here again about 4 days ago, it's so weird.  So, seniors this year, eh?  Let's make our mark :)  Yesterday after being out in the sun all day for hockey, I came back here and just crashed.  At least, I tried to, since it hurt just to walk.  It's hard to remain cheerful when you walk in and your family is like, "Yeah, you suck, we worked on the house all day while you played outside.  You should do all the work tonight."  So I'm a slacker apparently.  We ate pizza and I got out of here as fast as I could to avoid yelling at someone, and went over to Joe's to pick him up to go to the storage shed to get our lawnmower.  (thanks Joe :) )  We watched some Olympics then headed out, and I was definitely too tired to drive, seeing as how I changed lanes without checking my mirrors... Yeah, bad.  Anyway, here's the kicker of the night:  we got pulled over because a taillight on the Volvo was out.  I knew it was out, but we had only figured it out a little while ago, so Mom hadn't done anything to attempt to fix it.  So there we are, sitting right outside the storage shed place with this cop and a kid who was shadowing him talking to me and asking me questions like "Do you live in MD?"  I was already super tired, and mad, and now I was freaking out.  Not the best experience, let me tell you.  I got off with a warning and this card thing that you have to take to the police station with the car and show them that you fixed the light.  Have fun with that, Mom.  Joe was fabulous and had suggested earlier that we go to Wally World to get a light and fix it, so we did that after picking up the lawnmower.  He drove, by the way.   Much safer.  :)    Then we headed to Rita's to meet some of Joe's amigas, namely Leah and Katie, and eat good things like Banana Split Cream ice.  I definitely suggest it - banana flavored ice with cherries and chocolate chips in it.  Yum!  All in all, an okay day turned bad turned good.    This morning I got up early (read, 6:30) to do some stuff here then I went over to Joe's to first wake him up, and then to help him get all his crap into his car.  Oh, and I got rid of some Blue, too.  Hehe...  I was definitely really sad when he left, but I didn't have too much time to think about it.  It's nice to know that my pink bandana is now chillin' in Richmond, too.    And now I head back over to the house to help out some more.  Instead of going to the hockey party.  Boo.  But maybe I'll find a cool carpet at Ollie's?  Haha, right ;)
