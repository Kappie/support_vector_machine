"We're bilingual now! oh wait...you're trilingual because you speak finnish....") Geometry: 90 and a 91 for the tri!!!! now if i can just get an A in english and not let that exam screw me over, i'll be ok.   BCIS: high A for sure Aerobics: low A, high B because i refused to study  I leave for Discipleship Now this weekend with Sarah and the gang.  Its going to be extreme......i can't wait to do the Road Rally!!!  I'm sure we'll come back with tons of nasty and hilarious jokes about everything.    haha Brittany, i decided to archive our famous song about the NHL:  The Hockey Rocks Song by Taylor and Brittany Tune: Ontario Sucks by the Arrogant Worms  I love the ice smell and the 3 blue lines too, I love the drunk fans that act like they're at a zoo, the ticket prices are high, the ice is clean,  the seats are cushony, and the waiters are lean. And the players are smart and the referees are dumb, and some of the ice rinks look like a slum, the cokes are diluted, and the coaches are dorks. Some teams are really bad, like up in New York Because Hockeeeeeeeeee-eeeee-eeey rocks! "Yup actually i think i love everything about hockey." "Yup me too." I love the puck and the hockey sticks, the skates, the pads and the arena's nice bricks. The jerseys rock, the playoffs rock and the Cup plain rocks and the game plain rocks... I took a trip to Canada to visit Lord Stanley. He introduced me to my fave players and made me happy as a bee. I went to see the Mighty Ducks  and hit Giguere in the head with a puck! I mean, i dunno how it happened but i was using colorful langauge at the time... And Anaheim sucks! Hockeeeeeeeee-eeeeeeee-eeeey rocks! "yup, now that i think really think about it, i think i hate every gosh darn team in the NHL." "But not Dallas!" "Oh yeah, definitley not Dallas! You got your Niko, your Mo, your Brenden and Jere...." I hate Anaheim because they're supposed to suck and Detroit's jerseys are ghet-to. Calgary's team has not hott guys and Vancouver only has one hott goalie. Edmonton plays dirty and it makes me mad, Hockey rocks, Hockey rocks. Montreal's jerseys have too many letters on them, isn't that frenchie?? The Maple Leafs are boring anf their players are old and as for Saskatchewan.....they don't have one! "I mean, even Manitoba has a minor league team....." But Dallaaaaaaaaas is number one! and Anaheim suckssssssssssss!  ^ haha good times in Algebra 1, freshman year, third tri Britt!  You guys have to realize how incredibly BORED we were in that class....ah, the best of our brilliance came out of that class sometimes!  lol, alright gotta go finish packing.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
