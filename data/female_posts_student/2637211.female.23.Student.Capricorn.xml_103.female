On the weather: you know it's windy when you have dreams about doors blowing open and trees falling down. I woke up this morning to the loud and crashing storm outside, and it was impressive. I went outside later and the parking lot is flooded. Makes me want to stay inside cuddled up near my computer! I've got to get moving on reading and writing today for classes; you'll be able to tell how much work I get done by seeing how much I post here today. I've taken to tagging a link for this site at the end of selected emails and I'm curious how many friends end up here. If you came here by way of an email, type in a comment, I'm interested to see how many people are as nosy as me!
