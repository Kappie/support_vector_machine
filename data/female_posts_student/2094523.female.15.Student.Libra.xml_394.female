One side of me thinks of u as a total fuckin asshole who i really wanna shoot down and never ever talk to again, becuase you're too much of a freakin typical kinda guy, the kinds i have no interest in because they lack all the respect that i want from them, and the other side of me thinks of u as the hottest cutest little thing i have ever seen, the only guy i would ever tap in my whole freakin life, the one that says the sweetest things and makes me melt in side, the one that I want every single part of, the one that makes everything beautiful.
