Haha   Early in the morning, go down the road to hop on my father's car, and nearly tripped on a couple of 'invisible' stones! It is camouflage in the grass by the way...that's why I didnt notice it. And somehow it is still early and of 'coz the sun hasn't risen and neither could I see clearly...That's how, I almost fell...  Luckily I regain my balance as soon...and my father also grabbed me just in time (My knight in shiny armor) Lolx... Well, first thing in the morning nearly tripped...What more comes next? Yeah, I know there's bound to be loads more install for me! And I was quite right if you ask me!  When I got to school...everything was still allright until the last 2 periods! First was the Chinese, our Chinese teacher told us that we're not allow to use the dictionary 'coz we already know what's coming out for the test, so she forbid us from using it. And then she didnt turn up today for our test, but the test still is carried out somehow, with another teacher of course. And fair enough, we got the same topic and (hehe I've memorise everything, though I've changed some of the words 'coz I can't seem to remember all...OoPs) I started it quickly...'coz we dont have much time after we came back from the Com Lab...and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35!  But half way through, the teacher told us we can use the dictionary! My mouth dropped open! I thought 'Didnt she told us we cannot use it? How come now can use??' Oh well, after all I've memorise most of them, there's no further need for me to get a dictionary now...since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary. So I quickly finish the letter writing, and was the second to finish, but wasn't the second to hand it in...'Coz I dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes! So I counter check it.  Then, the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming Tuesday...and this time it is the formal type. And we are asked to learn the format ourselves. But as she is kind, she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher. And we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it...that wasn't so bad. But the worst has yet to come!  She decided to run to ask the HOD of Chinese Department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves...and she choose to trust us! I couldnt believe that! And when she left, everyone started to take out their papers and copy...until she came back. And everyone manages to finish it somehow...not all though. -_-"  Chemistry is the next lesson....I hate it! 'Coz that teacher totally sucks! He teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it, he will yell at them! How weird! And he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike! Thanks god, he dont dislike me...He actually treat my classmate a ghost! And he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates! And sway...when he tested us on the Equations, I got picked! 'Coz I was 16! And 15 didnt come! So he decided on 16! Then i go up, shaking....dont know what to write. I look around asking for help. Got some help from some of them, and then he decided that we can get help from someone...and if we cant complete it by today, all of us have to stay back!   Inorder to get everyone safely back home, I quickly ask the Chemistry Experts! True enough, I got the answers...but whether or not it's right he didnt say. But for the other team, he didnt got it right, and somehow have to stay back for detention. I thought he was going to say "Who was the other one that was up there, that couldnt answer the question just now?"(me) But I was standing there, praying hard he won't. And whew! He didnt!  I think he either forgotten about me or I really did get the right answers. Haha...  Kinda sway today right? But I cant wait for Sunday! 'Coz I'd be going to the library and borrow some cool books home..And I cant wait for Wednesday Night either! 'Coz my brother is coming back! And then, I can finally get my hands on the gifts he is bringing back! Hehe...I sure hope he got the things I like...  Okay.   Laters!!
