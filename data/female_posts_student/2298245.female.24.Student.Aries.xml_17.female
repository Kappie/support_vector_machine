Scott (film critic for the  New York Times --he and I are on the same page when it comes to likes and dislikes) on  urlLink movie piracy  (link requires registration).  I don't mean to burst anyone's fun, or to pass judgment on anyone who downloads movies illegally.  It's just, I think, important to think about the impact that piracy has on those in the industry, not the stars who make millions of dollars per film, but for the people behind the scenes, who are really middle class or working class guys like the majority of other people, except they happen to work in Hollywood.  Also, the campaign that the motion picture industry is putting on in order to thwart the pirates is very interesting.  I've seen the Goldstein spot that Scott talks about in the article, and I found it to be very effective.  I don't mean to preach, but I do think that as individuals who live in society, it is important that when we act, we think about the consequences of our actions, even if those consequences don't change our minds.  So, don't worry--I'll step off the soapbox now.
