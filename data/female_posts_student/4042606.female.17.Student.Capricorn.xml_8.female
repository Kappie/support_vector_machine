I know some people are attracted to big chests (hint, hint) but he didn't need to make it so obvious when he was starring. It was like he has seen them for the first time and I was standing looking at a copy of super monkey ball. I turned to him finally and asked him what the fuck he was looking at, he just said "nothin" and walked away while still starring at my chest. If my boyfriend or Ian were there, they would have probably punched the guy out. I decided to let it go and just went and got an ice cream.  On another note I bought super monkey ball, and I love it! The only thing bad is I feel bad bouncing the monkeys around, it looks like they would die because they were spinning so fast. It is still a fun game though!
