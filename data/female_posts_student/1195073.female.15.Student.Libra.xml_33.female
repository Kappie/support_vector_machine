Maybe I'll get used to it and wind up loving it (that's what happened in junior high).  It's really strange to me right now.  I don't like my locker being so far away from my classes, and I don't like having older people in my classes.  Oh, and I can't get my locker open.  I went to the activities office and they gave me about five different combinations to try for it.  I haven't tried any of them, though, because I left school right after I got the combinations, so I hope one of them works.  The lady sounded pretty sure that one would, though.  I'll update more later, I gotta go get school supplies.
