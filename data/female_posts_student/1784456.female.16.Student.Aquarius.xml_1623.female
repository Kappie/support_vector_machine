Christmas presents are good, I now have the darkness album, my uncle gave it to me and then before I had even listened 2 it he took it back, copied it for himself and then gave it back to me, mean or what???  I dont think the rest of the family like it too much though!!!  My Grandma and Grandad gave me and my sister trinket boxes, that r not too nice!!!  Grandma phoned up and sed that i could put it on my dressing table, two difficulties with that 1) what is a dressing table and 2) I dont own one!!!! So I'm taking it to a charity shop at the first chance I have, unless any body wants it????!!!!  I also got sum make up, money to put on my phone, o and an alarm clock radio!! I got two other cds, my skiing holiday and lots and lots of sweets!!!!!! Yummy!!  Laaaallllllllaaaaaaaaaa, think I might go shopping tomorrow, buy some things curtisy of my dad, i got so9me skiing stuff today, gloves, socks etc, but still have no goggles.  so if you know anyone with skiing goggles, put me in a good word, but only if the person is vagually human!!
