My favorite day was Thursday...which wasn't all that great in itself, but the service that night was amazing. The praise and worship in the beginning was cool and everything, but it really wasn't much different from all the other nights (except for Joe Cala break dancing *melts on the floor*) the service was so boring...everyone was seriously  falling asleep  in their seat. (And we were sitting in folding chairs, so they weren't that comfortable. That's how tired everyone was.) The service ended around 11, and usually by that time we all go back to our cabins, chill out for another hour and lights out at midnight. (11:59 actually. Don't ask.) But the band got up and started playing another song...and then another song...and then another song... about the fourth song I actually started getting into it again. Two singers from the band fell to the floor, after about 5 minutes of shaking and praying. That's  never  happened before, the band falling down...not even at the retreat in March. Everyone with the small exception of me and a few others were paying attention; everyone else was falling asleep (litterally) on the floor and whatnot. One of the camp guys (strong Christian) came up to the front, and just started talking...slowly everyone's heads lifted up, "I'd like to teach you something tonight. Matthew 26:40 says 40Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. 'Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?' he asked Peter. 41'Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.' The glory of God is in this place tonight. Your flesh wants to fall asleep on the floor, but your spirit wants to say here. The only thing Moses ever asked of God was to see his glory. This was because Moses had seen  everything  else. He saw the burning bush, a defeated Pharoh, the part of the Red Sea, the only thing left for him to experience was the glory of God. At the time, for whatever reason *i can't remember it* God couldn't show Moses his glory. In Matthew 26:40, God showed his glory to Jesus and the two disciples. The two disciples, being flesh unlike Jesus, could not keep awake. They could have seen something so amazing that night." And I knew at that moment what it meant. All of my peers and I had the chance that very night to experience the glory of God. What a privilege. Something even Jesus' disciples themselves couldn't stay awake for. I won't say what happened after that. I left in tears, I'll say that much. But that night, I knew for sure  I had experienced the glory of God.  It was the craziest/most wonderful thing I've ever felt, heard and seen. That's my camp memory, people. The ride home from camp the next day was awesome. My mom was stressed out because she got lost finding the camp to pick us up, I was stressed because of things I won't mention...but we found out Vinny was gonna be in our car, I was like "Oh God..." but he was like the funniest thing I've ever seen. Him and Steve (Steve is one of the nicest kids I've met since Nick) were putting my lotion on their legs (it smelled like girl stuff) and imitating comercials off TV. Vinny fluffed up the hair on his legs and's like "Yeah, the chicks dig this..." And he'd call Kyle on the cell and be like "Oh Kyle I want you so bad...at the next rest stop you have to feel my legs." And at the rest stop they were poll dancing together...God, it was great. Camp was awesome; I can't wait until next year. I'll never forget the friends I made, the lessons I learned or how horrible the food was. Thanks, to my friends, my parents and God for making it a week away from home worthwhile. Yesterday, Nick and I had some problems...but we talked and we're okay now (problems after 3 weeks of not seeing eachother...wow, that's unheard of) I still feel a little weird about the whole thing, I know it's nothing serious but I just want this feeling gone. Well, I'm gonna bounce...thanks for reading, I'll write another entry when something important happens. PEACE.
