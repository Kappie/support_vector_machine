The train on the way back was funny. LOL. All together now - hehe. Good laughs. Good memories and good memories is what is imporant.  I went to Ash's house last night and we spent 8 hours on the Nintendo playing Bomberman and stuff. Then we watched 4 films one of which was Not Another Teen Movie which is one of the funniest movies ever. It was a good laugh. I have now seen the Ali G film, I wasn't that impressed I have to say. Dirty Danicng is always good to watch and so is The Sixth Sense. So I went down the park today. I was not impressed. I got down there and no one was to be seen so I rang Helen and she said they were in the woods and she would come a find me in a mo seeing as I didn't know where they were. So I sat there and waited. And waited. No one came. So I rang / text again and I was told to 'come and find us, its a game' to which my reply came as 'no, I am not in the mood to piss about'. Still I waited. And you know what I am like when people ignore me or leave me alone so I walked back up the Dobbins and headed home. I met Lora on the way so I turned around and went back as it was a relatively nice day. Sure enough as Lora was there they came out and we sat around all day. Which I didn't mind seeing as I was / am tired. Oh, and its fun to the be the butt of everyones jokes and jibes. Thanks a lot. I miss Jackie.
