I just taught this girl the G scale. Woo hoo, g scale. It was cool though. And of course I babysat all day. I am just a money makin machine this summer, lol. Its incredibly boring. Oh well. It works I guess. So thats pretty much all I'm doing this week. Babysitting. Meh. Yeah...and thats pretty much it. I'm just full of excitement. I have to go take my crazy dog for a walk. Catch ya later :-).
