But I've been spending most of my time playing The Sims. I know, it's sad. But the new game comes out next month and I figured what the hell, might as well get sick of the old one first.  Bruce and I bought our first major piece of artwork for the house this week.   . Okay, so actually I bought it, he hung it up...then my dad re-hung it because we couldn't hang it straight.   urlLink zoeandfrank  is in the middle of a major overhaul this week. Hopefully Bruce and I will be buying some real webspace in the near future. Now that he's got an awesome job, he has all these plans to buy cool stuff, so the website is a little ways down the list: after Disney year round passes and jewlery for yours truly! :)  In the meantime enjoy the changes and the new pictures!  ~Dannie~
