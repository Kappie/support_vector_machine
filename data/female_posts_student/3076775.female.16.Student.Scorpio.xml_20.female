Ah well, other than that, today was excellent. I haven't really done anything today though so.....I'll just leave it at that.  Love,  Shannon "Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars. Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars, in other words, hold my hand. In other words, baby kiss me."--Frank Sinatra
