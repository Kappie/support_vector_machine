I'm still kinda tired but I can sleep tonight, so it's all good. The car wash was... ok. I was the first person there, so I sat in the parking lot for 5ish mins w/ the seat back and listening to music before Fran got there. Then we went in to talk to the guy that was there and they had NO idea what was going on... Sothe wonderfully smart 'general manager' that I talked to failed to mention the car wash to anyone else... I knew he was stupid when I talked to him, but oh well... Anyway, we got stuff worked out and everything set up all right. There were only a few people there -me, Mande, Jon, Annie, and Meghan, then Sam came at 10 and Heathy around 1:30ish. Some peope *coANNIEugh* were being a bit bitchy and rude the entire time. Mande and I were talking about it -- don't you think that you should prob. NOT be super rude to your captains? They have a little more power than you. Dur. But anyway, overall things went fairly well, despite the poor weather and lack of help. I'mnot really sure how much we made, but it wasn't as much as last time. We has mushroom pizza for lunch, that was good. Now I'm hungry again though...  My mom still isn't home... She got to Pizza Hut shortly before I left so she could eat, then she was going to run a bunch of errands and come home... She's getting me some snack foods and soda and shit to take with me to Fran's. Speaking of that -- I'll put up a little schedule later of all the days, who's coming when, what's going on what day, etc. All that stuff. For now I'm just going to play games on MSN to amuse myself...
