Well ive been kindqa dating bill. Its not really official or anything but we've talked about it. I love hanging out with him, he makes me feel so comfortable and i never have to worry about trying to be something im not.We talked for about 2 hours last night. That was pretty awesome. I wish it had been in person though that would have been better. But i'll take what i can get. Hes coming over tonight....looking forward to that. Im gonna make him watch wrong turn with me cuz i hate watching it alone....even tho i lo scary movies.  I talked to meeh caitie today and told her about bill. She said he better not be anothr andrew or shell have to beat his ass. lol shes so cute. She now had a 2 week list which i think is hilarious. Poor thing i think all her relationships have been worse than mine. Hopefully her luck will change and she'll find someone she cliques with. I feel so friggin lucky to find someone i can talk to and doesnt want anything more than to be with me and for me to want to be there with him.things aee def. looking up for me. He kinda woke me up this morning...i love waking up to his voice.He is one of 9 children.I would just like to say holy crap. I think that joe is really pissed bout bill cuz now hes being an asshole to me. At least i didnt cheat on him. I wouldnt do that cuz that sucks...i would know. But just because i broke up with him doesnt mean he can be a dick to me....the bastard. ugh whatever im jus gonna finish cleaning for when bill comes over........
