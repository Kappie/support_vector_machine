"for two weeks while we were gone, she was content". "For two weeks there was no knot in her stomach, ache in her head, need to stay in bed all day". She continued with things of this nature until I had to walk out, feeling putrid.  I am sickened.  I am sickened to know that every time she told me I was the light of her life, her reason to get out of bed in the morning, the only thing in her life that kept her going, it was a lie. That I am actually some sort of parasite, dragging her down to the bottom of the bottom.  my heart screams to know that all the times I had consoled my mother, petted her head, dragged her back from the edge with oddly placed wisdom and curling witticism, I was actually just bandaging wounds that I had inflicted, but had not inflamed.  this is a day I will always remember. This is a day that will stand out with the fingers and boxes and needles and letters that cobble me together. This is the day I will learn that leaving clothes in the bathroom floor really does matter. This is a day that will be invisibly etched in her tombstone for me to see so that when people ask me why my head is turned away from her grave, I will have no answer to give them... The lyrics to a silent requiem.   this is the day I learned the truth about mothers.
