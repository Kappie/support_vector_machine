So here's what happened: School let out on Thursday of this week. I didn't see or hear from Lucas at all that day, or Friday, or Saturday, until I finally decided to break down and call him. I had talked to his best friend, Jared, about the possibility of Lucas breaking up with me and Jared said (this is a direct quote) "I can tell you with 100% accuracy as his best friend that he wouldnt do that". Well thank you, you dirty liar. When I called Lucas I used the premise that I wanted him to help pass out programs at the graduation with NHS. (I'm an officer, by the way, so it would make sense that I would try to recruit people for this.) He said he would help me and when we hung up, for the first time ever, he didn't say that he loved me. Now I was a little confused. After he came to pick me up, 15 minutes late might I add, we started on our way there and again, for the first time ever, he didn't hold my hand as we were driving along. Obviously, something was up, so I asked him if it would be alright if we just didn't go and he felt that would be fine. As we started back I began to cry because I knew the inevitable was about to occur: he was going to dump me. He noticed the tears and asked me what was wrong. After no reply he pulled into the parking lot where we had our second date; the place where he had first kissed me. Again, he asked me what was wrong and this time I told him.  "I'm afraid."  "Of what?" "I'm afraid about you."  "Why's that?"  "I think you know." Oh, he knew alright. We talked and according to him he was dumping me because of my friend Talley, because I'm a pushover, and because I automatically assume the worst about situations. Of course, I cried... and cried... and cried some more. Then he threw out the can-we-still-be-friends line and I started to bawl. When I finally got him to take me home I was able to hold back my tears and joke about the situation sayin things like "At least now I have a reason to eat too much ice cream" to make him feel less awkward. After we got home I got out of the car before he could open the door for me, the little bastard, and sat on the driveway where he gave me a hug and two kisses: one on my head and one on my forehead. Then he held me between sobs. The last thing he said to me was "Goodbye, lovely" wich really pissed me off. How could he say that? It's going to be so hard to see him now. Everytime I looked up and my eyes could see clearly enough to make out his face, I broke down again. I love him so much. I told him I would miss him, and he said he would miss me, that dumbass. I don't understand him. Of course, I've decided to go out with someone else as soon as I can to make the little jerk jealous, and believe me, he'll get jealous. Now to pick a target...
