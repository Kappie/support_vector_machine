He really didn't talk...he's the shy genius type. Very nice though, I don't mean to judge. Just not my type. He has a nice car though. God-- I can't believe I just typed that... it sounded so hollow and pretentious. Haha, no, he is a well mannered boy, good natured, and I had fun. Matt Kidd is just so cute though, but I could never allow myself to get mixed up in the love triangle he's entangled himself in. It's just better to gaze from afar...   We met Rachel and Beth at Rachel's and got there around 7, but they didn't start until around 7:30. The coffeehouse itself wasn't too shabby, but pretty typical of Conneaut in that it wasn't the Tajma Hall of all coffee shops. I saw Jo though! God it was great... I met her other couple of friends and we talked hair. She got my number and we're gonna do something next week, which is exciting because I need to go out with some new girls. I  want so badly to expand my horizons: meet new people and do new things. I think I am already beginning to do that a little bit, but I don't know if I can continue this.  I got my hair cut today, too! It's actually really cute and flippy. I want to highlight it so bad, but I can't because I am currently without a job, and without money. I want with all of my heart to look nice-- I want to do my makeup and hair and wear clothes that make me feel good. I think that I will try to fulfill this goal of mine. Ah, what a new haircut can do for you...   ACTs are tomorrow morning. Ugh! I took my practice test today and I got a 24. I shouldn't complain, it's not nearly as bad as Marie with her 16, but just isn't good enough for me. I need a 27. I want to go to a good college, but my GPA is so messed up right now, and I need a solid ACT score to show college admissions committees I am smarter than what a glance might entail. So yeah, I'm going to pray so hard tonight... I need all of the help that I can get right now.
