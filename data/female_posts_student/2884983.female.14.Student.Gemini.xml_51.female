I havent done much typing lately. just alot of reading...anyways....I dont know...you know being sick can be extremely annoying. I have had a headache since last week and now my throat is going all screwed. hmm....The series Queen's Own is really good. It is by Mercedes Lackey. She is one of my favorite fantasy writers, her and Tamora Pierce. I also really like Garth Nix. Stephen King and Christopher Pike are my favorite horror writers, although I havent been actually scared of their books yet. I dont really get scared by books, although there is this one book that I didnt like and made me all jumpy...I think it was called Deathbringer and it was a big book. 500 pages I think and all fairly small print. it was hell to read. gaahh....we went shopping today [we meaning cousin and I]  all I bought was  eyeliner. which I am in need of seeing as how mine got ran over by a car. Grama and grampa left yesterday...they took Kate with them. she is totally adorable, and she has that puppy smell. which was at times very overpowering. I made myself sicker by getting a large creme egg mcflury. goddess was that ever a bad idea. krys gave me this really kick ass earring that I love. it is helping the infection go away. it also might be going away because of the polysporin...I like polysporin..and hydrogen proxide. oh!! Anne mcaffery. she is a great writer too. I love her stuff. goddess thered are so many great authors that i cant even remember all the ones that I like! Not suprising though seeingas how I always forget that kind of stuff. I always leave someone or thing out of a list...always.well I think I have babbled on enough so I am going to go...gaia that is. :)
