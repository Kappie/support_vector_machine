This can be a very depleting and confusing time when you do not know exactly what you want. You do not feel strong, capable or effective. Physically you need to be gentle with yourself and take care not to dissipate your energy reserves.  notice it says i'm born in the year of the rabbit in my profile? well. it's wrong. i was born in the year of the dragon, 1987 is actually the year of the rabbit. *sigh*
