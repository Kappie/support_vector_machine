Derek told me that he loved my thighs and that i had great boobs lol i was like thank u, and i kept telling krissy, "we're leaving" lol i think that pissed him off but o well. he also told me that he liked me last year, i was like thanks lol i mean what good does that do? lmao Hes the most sexual guy i know, he kept touching my legs and shit bc he said they were smooth, and he asked to slap my thigh and ass. I dont really like any of that tho, bc it makes me feel like hes just an asshole and only wants sex, which is prob true but it doesnt matter n e ways bc i aint gonna go out with him. I noticed that im either NOT ENOUGH for a guy or im just a sexual object to another, so either way i suck at what im doingbc i lose every guy i like or the one i love. . . lol its really been a blow to my self esteem. This summer has been an eye opener really, i learned that i should never be in a relationship bc i just end up hurting someone or getting hurt. Im tired of being let down by my feelings..
