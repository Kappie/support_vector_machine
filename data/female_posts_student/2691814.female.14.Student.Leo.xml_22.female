Keith rode on his skateboard, I rode on the back of josh's bike and Kevin rode on the front of gabby's bike. We got back and we just sat on the curb and talked and acted stupid..just a fun 'ol time. Then we met Billy...he's 19 and really hullairius. He hung out with us for the rest of the day while Cheston, Cindy, and Carl came outside. Well, we mainly just stood around or sat around doing nothing but talk and we went over to the lil playground and just talked and played basketball.    It got dark so we all went over to my complex and hung out for about 10 mins till Kevin G. came. (he's a big pervert) I can't stand him but it didn't really matter if he were there or not. Cindy had to go home so from her house she called me and i gave the phone to gabby...she walked away from the rest of the group. Then all i heard was billy goin 'you either leave her alone or you leave!' to Kevin G. I guess he was talkin bad about me as usual. So he left...that gave alla us a sign that he wasn't going to leave me alone. I went over to tell gabby what had happend and guess who i see lookin at me over the bushes. KEVIN G.! I was sooo pissed off. He started walking so I followed him. I got to him and I went  crazy im like LEAVE ME THE F*** ALONE NASTY PERVERT. he's like..'im leaving' im like..no im not done.' don't talk about girls like that...and you wonder why they hate you so much?' I said some other things but its all just a blur. i remember the last thing i said was'AND IF YOU COME BACK HER AGAIN I'LL F*** YOU UP..i'LL KICK YOUR SORRY A**!!' i swear i said that and everyone was like you'll have back up with that lol. And after that..billy goes..' i could literally f*** him up.    That was my night. very eventful lol
