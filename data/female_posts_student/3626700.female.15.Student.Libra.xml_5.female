Underneath all your tears there is always that one person who heals your insides they help you mend your open wounds And are there to comfort you through the times those painful severs cant be bonded Even when you think the pain wont go away that person will be with you and will never let you go astray.  With just there soothing trustful words and there serene comedic charisma they help with even the littlest innocent issues  that one person will always be  that one person who will never not be there for you  in any situation  Theres is that one single person  who when all say failure she says success  She will believe in you through every task you will undertake she will always build up your self esteem just by saying hi. for it is such an honor  to have that person in your life  That one person is the one of the two who is or will be  pulling you through  So i pray now for you to find that one person in your life that person will be a godsent.  How do i Know all this?  Because i have found that  person and she is truely  sent from the Lord God Himself.    The person who inspired me to write this poem is that special person. She has been and i know she will always be there for me even when i go off to college and move to austrailia :P(shes probably thinking that will never happen...hahahha) you just have to know me to understand what that comment was about. but anywho. she knows who she is and so therefore i wont mention her name. (IN any case, "she" can be replaced with "he", but in my life it was a she so that influenced the poem) Till next time....  "Let not Mercy and truth forsake you; Bind them around your neck, Write them on a tablet of your heart, And so favor and high esteem in the sight of God and man."- Proverbs 3:3-4   Keep the faith strong,  Sammie.....
