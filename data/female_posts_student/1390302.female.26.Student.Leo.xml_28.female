Still, I wonder why that is not present in society?  Has a need to be more than we were born as, or to be, breed out of society by a lack of ambition and Welfare?  Have we grown too dependent on the system to pick ourselves up and become something?  I’m taking ‘Texas Government’ this summer.  The class is boring to say the very least, and to compound that, it’s LONG, 6pm –10pm two nights a week.  However boring it may be, I still listen to most of the gibberish that comes out of my flaming liberal professor’s ramblings –and they are ramblings, trust me!  For a man who cannot seem to put two sentences together to make an intelligible thought, he seems to have too many unfounded opinions for his own damned good most of the time.  Over and over he has insulted the urlLink  republican party  and stomped on its beliefs with little or no real understanding of what the party even stands for –leave it to a liberal not to do his homework.  For goodness sake, the man is a Government teacher and I would expect him to know something about government, HA!    I can’t count on both hands how many times he has said, “for all of you cold nosed republicans, who don’t care about anyone and believe that everyone should just make their own way, Congratulations!  Welfare is being cut in Texas, so you should be real proud of yourselves!”  Now is it just me or is that complete bullshit.  The man is a teacher, he didn’t sign up to teach this class so he could force his own moral and “compassionate” beliefs on all of us stone cold republicans.    Every man is entitled to his opinions, in my opinion.  If he hates us republicans for believing in the human spirit and believing that men have enough in them to stand on their own two feet –that is the only place where they will find true happiness and achieve their goals after all- that is his right.  I only ask that he doesn’t spend the grueling 4 hours we are forced to sit in that class, telling us all about it.  Leave your opinions at the door and teach us the facts. Is that too much to ask?  What is so damned wrong with believing that men should support themselves and not live on the system?  What is so wrong with believing that every person in this world could have a great purpose if they would seek it, and what is so damned wrong with being a little cold toward the idea of people who live off the government.  Welfare –social programs, like checks and food stamps, among others- rot away at out society as a whole and eat away government dollars.  Get a job!  ~Kristyn
