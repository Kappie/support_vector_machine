I grab the phone to shut it up, and don't realize it is actually a phone call at this point. I open it, and read the name, it's says "ex's cell", two things run through my head, first, I thought I deleted his number, and second, this is an actual phone call, so I hit the end button. I didn't want to talk, I know it was a drunk dial, and the last thing I need is him giving me a bunch of bs over the phone, I got enough of that before the breakup, I'm moving on, don't need the drama, thanks but no thanks, really.  So I hung it up, and turned the ringer to silent, I normally don't like turning my phone ringer off for emergency purposes, but I wanted to sleep and I'll be damned if I was going to let him wake me up again, definitely not worth it. Drunk dials from my friends are fine, but not from the ex when I need sleep. I just don't want or need the drama, call me crazy, but I've moved on, and I wish he would to. Being vindictive on the phone while your drunk does not show strength. It shows how juvenile and weak you really are. I've got big things going on in my life right now and the last thing I need is him trying to drag me down. I've cried the tears, and I'm done. I don't miss him, honestly I miss the idea of someone, the support that comes with it, the tenderness that exists. When that is gone, there is nothing left to miss.  I was sifting through things yesterday, and I went through all my old pictures, bad bad bad. Went through all the exes, and I mean ALL of them. Out of all of them only one do I still call my friend, and only one do I sorta regret loosing (last college love). I wouldn't call them mistakes, because the funny thing is I don't regret or begrudge any of them. I guess one can say they were all learning experiences, life lessons if you will. Maybe that's why I don't feel the need for the drama, it's over, I'm better for having known them, and I move on. My guy pal from school said something to me Wednesday night that I've never heard a guy say to me, "I believe it'll all work out for everyone, magic, dreams, romance, it will all come to you when the time is right." I've always believed in that, in dreams, magic, romance, imagination, in short that's why I'm such a Disney fanatic. I still believe that, "someday my prince will come." That's why I'm not sad anymore, that's why I don't need the drama, I know that my somebody is out there somewhere and when the time is really right I'll find him, or he'll find me. Until then I'll just keep doing my thing, selfish, yeah, but I have to worry about me first, because nobody else is going to do it for me. Until next time.
