Like I'll think, "Oh, that person's not a Christian, because they don't act like it" And it's wrong. And I know it's wrong. And I shouldn't think that either. Please help me not to. And help me not to judge myself on others actions. Tom's sermon the other week was amazing, and it really hit me, because this is exactly what I have been thinking about, and sometimes have been doing. That, "maybe I'm not holy enough or a good enough Christian, because I don't know much about the Bible". And I'm trying to evangelise, and I hear all these stories about people who have preached to over 3 million people in over50 countries, and althought it is great, it is also kind of disheartening.I have just finished reading Acts, and although the stories of Paul's evangelising are amazing, it just makes me feel so helpless sometimes. Like, i reach like what 4 people, and Paul sparks the growth of Chrisitanity and converts MILLIONS. I know I can't compete with Paul, but sometimes I just wonder...am i even making a difference?
