With a masculine name. She's ever so cute too, brown with black eyes. So adorable! She even has a wheel, that she spins in and junk. Very ultra cute.  And Nick gave me a nice present..a necklace of hickies...mom and dad stopping being impressed a while ago :p Although, the only one they noticed still, was the one on my boob...heh :P  Off to babysit the gerbil now....stupid cat still might wanna eat it after our talk. That's right. I have serious discussions with my cat. And what's crazier, most of the time she listens :P Night y'all.
