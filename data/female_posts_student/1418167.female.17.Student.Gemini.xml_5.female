I'm amazed I have the energy to think at this point, seeing as they woke me up at 7:15 again, but sometimes full days just keep me energized and happy. I watched the two girls today and barely had time to sit. I did manage to read an entire summer reading book while Gracie slept. YES! One down, two to go.   Paul and I got into a gay marriage argument. He says that if gay marriage is allowed, it will cause people to want to marry two people, or marry their dog, and that allowing gay marriage will cause a self destructive pattern in the tax system as well as the meaning of marriage. Grr... homophobe. Oh well. It is Texas (no offense).   I'm going ice skating tomorrow! I really hope I don't break anything... My parents both called to check on me today haha. My mother has no idea how to function without me around it seems. My father is trying to promote an allusion of his actually caring.   Thought for the day: Walk around a Kroger holding a baby... it's insane what you get for free and all the comments you hear. Jesus...
