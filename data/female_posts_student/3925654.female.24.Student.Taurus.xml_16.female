Baker, Chase, and I pulled into our motel at 4:05, 55 minutes before the scheduled start of the ceremony which was to take place on the top of a mountain. We checked in, yanked on our wedding clothes and took off again for Purity Springs Resort, the location of the sacred event.  It turned out we weren't late at all, and we boarded a somewhat questionable old school bus that huffed and puffed its way up the mountain's hairpin turns and deposited us at the top a good 15 minutes before the bride and her family arrived in a horse drawn carriage.  Fortunately, the rain held off until after the ceremony, which was set up so that the bride walked (barefoot) down a carpeted aisle to meet the groom and minister, who stood at the top of a double black diamond trail ("Experts Only") making for a pretty cool backdrop.  Overall, the wedding experience was pretty good. There were many more young children and much less dancing than I'd expected. It was good to see the young Berkshire faculty contingent one last time before I move out to Chicago, though. And it was fantastic to see two people look as happy and content as Clay and Kristina did.
