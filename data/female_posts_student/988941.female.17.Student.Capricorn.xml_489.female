Won't be around at all tomorrow, might make it Sunday morning, but after that I won't be around until WEdnesday night or possibly thursday due to my hectic schedule! Anyays, Gimmie something for the pain, gimmmie something for BLUEEEES, gimmie me somethig for the pain that I feel when I'm hanging on a hangman's nooooose, gimmie something for the pain, gimmie something I can usseeeee, can't remember the rest! oh no! Back to the CD! I'm listening to the White Stripes "Elephant" at the moment, it's really good! 'Seven Nation Army' is wicked, but there are some really good acoustic tracks on it too, I would think that Max and Nicki would proably like it, not sure whether Tom and Jackie would though?! Anyways......... Hmmmm. Cinema was good last night, 'Bruce Almighty' wasn't anywhere near as bad as I thought it would be, actually had me laughing quite a lot! Anyways, lolooking forwa rd to BonJovi soooooo much! I Can't describe how mcuh! Plus thorpe park too, h eh ehh e! Bye now, gtg to work!
