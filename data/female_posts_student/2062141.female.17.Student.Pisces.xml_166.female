I have no plans but as long as I don't still feel like shit I plan to have a fucking good time. On my check-list: See at least 3 movies. Search for a job. Go to Coulon. Go to Newcastle Beach. Go spring shopping. Have Charlotte over. Go to the zoo. Go downtown. Do nothing. Eat chinese food. Pick up a new cd. I can tell after break that I will immediately lose all will to stick out the end of the school year and I'll keep thinking that summer is closer than it is. Even still, I can't fathom that people that have been names I've known all my life will be gone forever; seniors will graduate, including my sister, and some of my best friends. There are people that I don't like that I want to tell off but I never will, and part of me wishes that even those people would stay in my life, if not just for familiarity's sake. I've finally reached that point in my life that we all face,  adulthood and having to deal with losing all that beloved familiarity. After this summer nothing will be the same. All those times in elementary school when we all used to say "when I grow up I want to....."... That's no longer in the future. And this will be my "last" summer. I think it will be the best one yet.
