RUMORS ARE BAD, AND THEY HURT PEOPLE. not just the people they're about either. but how shallow a person to spread a rumor about your "best friend". whatever. i dont have time for that crap anywho. people will grow up and get a life someday i reckon, if not, God help them.  July 4th is this weekend... i wonder what im going to end up doing...
