My first blog is one that has been on my mind for a while now, so I'll just say it.  Why is it that people do sh_tty things to people and then flip the script like the inoocents did it to them?  People, a true sign of maturity is knowing you are wrong and admitting it.  If you f_ck up, its your fault. Recognize, morph yourself, and grow. I mess up at least 3 times a day, I apoligize(sometimes to myself), make a note not to do it again, and move on.  Don't blame the world because you ain't got no home training.  DO BETTER!!  Anyway, shouts out to my girls. You good people help me remeber to DO BETTER everyday.  Blog ya later.
