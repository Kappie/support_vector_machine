    
       I have created this blog in a state of total boredum.  And so far how my summer's looking, I will be able to post things quite often.  This site is meant pretty much for the pure enjoyment of me, myself, and I, as I have nothing better to do.  The opinions and views displayed on this site will not reflect (directly) the opinions of anyone I may be affiliated with in any way shape of form.  So relax, have fun and enjoy
