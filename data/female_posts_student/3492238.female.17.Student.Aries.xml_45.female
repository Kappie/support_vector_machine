(better than 4-10..specially on the weekends..) hopefully i can go out on the boat on saturday, marilyn and billy finally got theirs in the water, but i'm the only one who hasn't made it on that one yet.. i guess compared to the 2 times i've been on our boat.. but hey what can i say? smile and nod. hopefully.   2 days and counting.
