Then after that, me and Jessi went to Quizno's where she was amazed that the people that worked there knew who i was and how i wanted my sandwich made.  lol, i told her that i literally live at Quizno's!  Then i went home, packed my bags, and went over to Stewie's house.  We made smores!!!  I discovered that Smores are very hard to eat and rather messy.....Stewie thought it was very funny that i didn't know how to eat one or really make one.  I spent the night and we (me, stewie and nadia) watched movies and "The End of the World" flash movie/Andrew Serb's movie about his failure to wrap Nathaniel's house.  Nate Blackwell was in that movie and i've known that kid since Kindergarten, he cracks me up....how did i know that he was going to be making movies about wrapping people's houses later in life lol?   Thursday: I left Stewie's house rather early in the morning, shortly after Nadia because Stewie had ballet stuff.  I did absolutely nothing on this day.  There was a really hott guy that came to my door selling coupons or something....naturally i looked terrible and had no makeup on.  Oh well, i think he was about 20 anyways.  I talked to Masengill on the phone for awhile and got caught up with him.  Turns out he played in this messageboard vs. messageboard hockey game thing for the Dallas Stars message boards or whatever....and his team won!  Now its a fad amongst other NHL team's messageboards that is sweeping across the continent.  Awesome huh!?  Then i talked to Brittany for a good long while considering that i haven't really gotten to talk to her since her work has taken over her life and her computer's internet had been temporarily jacked.  We decided that we needed Harry Potter posters because Daniel Radcliffe is really hott.  Oh yeah! I also discovered that Daniel Radcliffe is like Brittany's Male Counterpart!  Seriously.  The kid likes all the same music as Brittany and he says things just like Brittany.  Read these quotes off this website that i found him saying and if you know Brittany, you know that she would totally say something like this:  * After being cast as Harry Potter: "I think I'm a tiny bit like Harry 'cos I'd like to have an owl. Yeah, that's the tiny bit, actually." * "I don't know. People tell me I look mournful. They say, "Cheer up, Dan, it's not that bad!" Sometimes I just look into space, which freaks people out. If I was ever required to do anything other than look haunted, I could. I'm a happy person. Though I don't, like, dot my "I's" with hearts or anything - that would be too happy." * "I'm not much of a cake person." * "I was in the bath at the time, and my dad came running in and said, 'Guess who they want to play Harry Potter!?' and I started to cry. It was probably the best moment of my life." * "I'm not clumsy, I'm just accident prone." ( * On considering himself as a heartthrob: "Personally I can't see it, but if other people can, fine. Cool!"  See, i told you, Britt and Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter should get married.  He's due to turn 15 in a month, so its not like she's robbing the cradle or anything.  And i know he's not a hockey player but ya know....it'll work.  lol, Britt agrees also.  So yeah, today, if me and Britt don't go get our posters, i think i'm just going to hang out inside and read.  Its all rainy today and all....perfect day to read.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
