Its secret code.. so if You don't understand it.. don't ask.. it's here more for me than for you.  Option Uno: Past -> Laiste, Moon's Daughter: Light and guidance.. a clearing of thought... though the potential for a shroud to be drawn over the eyes...  Present -> Arval Parrot: Clear communication is important here. Calmly debate the issues and explore ideas...  Future-> Himself: Protection. Protection for or he who is protecting...  Blahness..... next round..  Option Dos: Past -> Ilbe the Retriever {reversed}: Something being held back by negative attitudes... not yet the time for this seed to grow.. things need to be cleared out first.  Present -> Laiste, Moon's Daughter: Light and guidance through shadow. Clearing of thought. Potential for shroud over the eyes...  Future -> Spirit Dancer: This is a time to bring out and share qualities that we have nurtured in private... Really concentrate on a project or process.. Spontaneity balanced by self-discipline....  Ironically they share Laiste.. at different points..  I don't think that helped much..
