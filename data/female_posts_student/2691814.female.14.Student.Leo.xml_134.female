Sandy was throwing up blood yesterday and now Shadow is throwing up blood. I think it musta been something in the food. So...ya..we couldn't practice today cuz we didn't get a cd player in chorus and then mom made me cancel with deidra cuz we were gonna pick her up then mom remembers that she needs to wait for the doctor in Miami to call. She's goin in for sugery on Friday...or tomarrow i can't remember. I don't like the idea of her going for surgery. Scares me.   The dance is Friday..which is also Dress Up day. I don't know what im gonna wear. The only dressy stuff in my closet is black. I might wear some nice pants(black) and a pretty shirt(black and white) lol. Tomarrow is Tacky Tourist day but i dont think im gonna dress up for that.   My room is packed up pretty much. Just ask ryan, I hadn't been in my room the whole day then when i was talking to him i went to my room and i was like 'omg' lol...the walls were so...blank. It was really scary. And now all my pictures that were in frames are packed...the only pictures in my room is the big colage(can't spell) of everyone in wv. Oh ya and (for anyone who's been in my room either in WV or FL) my big mirror almost fell right on top of me. Yep...I was putting away clothes and u know hanging them up well some of them fell...so i went to pick them up and i get alil feeling like somethings gonna fall. U know...everyone gets those where somethings gonna fall right on you and u get really scared lol. Well I had that feeling so i put my hand up and i lifted the mirror up right b4 it hit me. I was so frikkin scared lol.   Last night i couldn't sleep. I had some mixed emotions. First i was happy to talk to Ryan on the phone and we were watching One Tree Hill and laughing our asses off! It was soooo funny!!! But then when we hung up...i got into bed and started tearing up. I didn't know why. Just kinda looking at my room>it looked the same as my old room when we were about to move  Much Luv...(JKK lmao) what about WKK?!? lol
