I still have to get a job I wish someone would just hand me one. I might be baby sitting in august though which wouldnt be that bad and it would be good money. like 25$ a day times 5 days. so yah 125$ a week...unless I charge more...muahaha. yah so i went to java express today. if they get busier i will get a job there. which is awsome but first i am going ot make them some flyers. wee! i did alot of cleaning today. mostly of clothes. and i found a shirt that i altered a while ago. its very compfy. i wish i did the pic on it better. meh. i guess it just takes practice. i wanna alter more clothes. its fun to do. I need a better sewing machine though. so i was at my cabin for canada day again. i hate that. i think my family is going to the cabin again this weekend so anyone who wants to take me i would be happy. haha. yah so anyways thats all i really have for today. aurevoir!
