Sometimes it scares me that I'm writing a novel.  Anyways, I don't like that I am interested in so many things.  My mom says that that makes me an interesting person.  But I don't want to be interesting--just intelligent and beautiful.  When someone asks you to describe Megan Reuter, I want to be depicted as only a few adjectives with only a few passionate interests.  So here's the "interesting" me that I'm not sure I like: I enjoy dancing, fiction novels, writing, going to caf√©s, listening to different types of music, seeing musicals, babysitting, yoga, Spanish, teaching, singing, acting, attending church, kayaking, painting, traveling, playing The Sims, designing web pages, blogging, etc...the list goes on.  I tried to find a common thread that unites all these activities together.  To be that one powerful descripter of Megan Reuter.  Artsy?  Creative?  Fun-loving?   Interesting?  Yikes, I just don't know anymore.  I can't even describe myself.  Now that scares me.
