He was asking me about my classes for the summer, and I told him about the one on cognition theory, and he said that he had just heard about that today in one of HIS classes (he's not an anthropologist- this was in a communications class). So we talked about it, and he said that I explained it the same way as his professor, which made me feel good, and made me feel like I knew what I was talking about!!! Yay!!!  THEN we applied it to our own lives. We talked about how we group ourselves with people, and how we disassociate ourselves with others.   It was really cool :)
