What happened to the way we used to love It seemed as though life had just begun But now that love has come and gone to fade away Like the setting sun Cuz' you won't let me in.  All that I wanted from you Was something you'd never do So let me in  Oh please tonight Don't let this end  Tonight Cuz' I'm starting to fall So let me in  It was all that I wanted from you It was something you never knew To let me in But not tonight  For this is the end Tonight I fall
