(They've finally found out that your brain has haemorraged *whatever* and that's the cause of your profound *whatever x2* dumbness?) Err no... I'm ill! Like blueeergh ill. Not sicky ill. My head just feels like it's got a ten ton weight attached to it. So I didn't go to school, instead I got a healthy six hours extra in bed! It seems to have gone to my brain though because at the moment I'm finding it hard to type and talk without coughing up ...stuff. (Don't ask) Mmm... *cough cough splurrgh* Err yeah. Well owchie, my throat does kill a lot! Do you ever think that maybe you're ill because some one else is ill? Maybe you're helping some one some where. (Maybe you need a psychiatrist) Well yeah, then there's that. Maybe no one is the missing part of the jick err... wait a sec... puzzle. (I was about to say jick saw) Geez, I really am ill! (Straight to the brain) Yup! Oooh, I watched the Twilight Zone! A whole two episodes! It's soooo funny! Well... in a weird kind of way. I find any thing funny so erm... yeah...
