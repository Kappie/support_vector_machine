(Only the lucky ones are) some ppl there actually FIND themselves...they look straight into their hearts and pull out all of the emotions. Its hard todo that when your in a school full students wishing to just get out and take control of themselves. ONly the lucky ones  no not lucky ,passionate ones get to do that. But its kinda weird cuz, Many have moved here from all over and i guess its a type of 'learning to find yourself' experience. You dont' have to fit in to be excepted. We should all try to learn that...i have. I guess you have to like yourself and 'fit in' with yourself before you make any type of friend. Why should the board take that away from the people who have found who they really are? Take them away and put them in uniforms to look like everyone else?  OK now for my post:  we have so many talks They always end with crying First we talk about love Then we talk about dying A love so strong a bond so tight It ruins us all that we wake up at night we walk around the complex sad thoughts,not a sound After those talks Our true voices are not found So next time we talk Lets not be afraid to look or tap into eachothers souls and see what pieces of our hearts we both took.    ~ya this is one of my poems if your wondering~ this is NOT dedicated to anyone.  Someone unexpected always helps you in the most unexpected ways.
