I have lost about 3-5lbs in the last week. yay for me! lol I was reading some of the past posts of mine from this week. Actually, the ones last nite, or should i say, early this morning. Wow..i have these deep random thoughts at times lol thats crazy. i scare myself sometimes. but then i read about Andrew and how hes this hot skater with a tonuge ring and it seems to make it all better, IM GOING TO AT LEAST KISS HIM dammit it's my #1 goal now. Lauren just got online! :D yay! interaction with another human. haha I'm going to the mall tonight with dad to look for him a suit for the wedding. what fun? lol oh yes. but i get to look around too! and i get to pick up a new outfit for sunday. damn, all i do is buy outfits for church. i want jeans and t-shirts DAMMIT. lol NOW! i guess when theres no more sundays for me to go to i'll get jeans and all that stuff i really enjoy trying on. Lauren just reminded me of the 4th of july...lol i forgot that it's this weekend. If she was smart she'd spend her 4th of july with lipot! gettin high..hahahaha wouldnt that be a fun. lol im jk..kinda..sorta..not really.   I found out about this awesome band. They're called BRAND NEW. kickass shit there! they really are cool. One of the best songs is Jude Law and a Semester Abroad. Well, i love all their songs!! but u know, thats one of my fave. i love the dudes voice. and i got on their site www.brandnewrock.com and u can read their journals and shit but the only one who actually keeps up with their jounral is Brian. kudos b-man. i even joined their street team so i could get to the special stuff on their site..yea, im the coolest EVER. lol   I wanna be just like Gene Simmons when i grow up! :p --but more hardcore.   *much love and sick,twisted personals*
