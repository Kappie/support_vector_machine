I got a horrible sunburn! So on Monday, Kristin and I biked over to play tennis with Andrea and heather. It ended when Andrea yelled at me and told me to fuck off... Then we went back to my house. We chilled there and Kristin slept over. Then the next day we biked around and played tennis, and then we went to her house where we hung out with Rachelle and went biking some more. Then we headed back to Kristin's and had the massivest funnest waterfight ever!!!! Then yea, Rachelle went home, Kristin and I went to Tim Horton's and then went home. Then the next morning (this morning!) I went to VACATION BIBLE SCHOOL to be a crew leader with Wesley. And it was fun... I played with little kids! I loved it so much! Then I got home, had a nap and was woken up by the carpet cleaners. So then I biked to Kristin's and we biked to Zehrs were we got milkshakes. And then we biked to the West End Rec. Center were we applied to volunteer at summer camp (I'm going to have so many hours! Cause I already have 26 and I'm doing 2 more summer camps). Then we went back to her house, ate dinner and went to my house. She came to my soccer game, which I lost (2-1) and I busted my ankle. Anyways!!! The last couple of days have been amazing and awesome, but I have to get back on the tennis court. Andrea, can we please, please play games, or try to?!  Alright, tomorrow morning I go off to my bible camp or fucking whatever. Then I get home and go to Kristin's... where we hang around and hopefully go on her roof. So Andrea, we have to play tennis. And I'm going to Kristin's cottage for the weekend. So Eric, we'll write you your letter that we already started there, okay! Ummm... plus my mom finally got my birth certificate so tomorrow I'm gonna go get my Socilal Insurance Number so I can work! Which is good cause then I can make money! I have to get my sleep, so I'm off... Love, **bekah**  P.S. Notice the nice capital letters and proper spelling and all that? Oh yea! I tried!
