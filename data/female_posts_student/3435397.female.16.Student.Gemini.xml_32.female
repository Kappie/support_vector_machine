It was so nice! And I showered for the first time since Tuesday!!! WOW I never realized how much I love to shower!! Okay so tonight I went to the fireworks and hung out with Jackie, Megan, Michelle, Rhiannon, Shawn, Spencer, Devin, Mike, and Landon! It was super fun! After the fireworks some of them came back to my place and we had a fire!!!!!! It was sooooooooooo much fun!!!!! Tomorrow I want to go to Spider Man 2 but I have a feeling its going to be PACKED!!!! So I don't know what movie to go too now.....:(  Now here is what I have been doing at camp.  Besides orientation I have fell head over heals for a guy.  Crazy hey but I have and I need to regain control and get out of it before I get really hurt.  He is 4 years older than I but gosh is he cute! And To close to perfect! LOL the only thing I could deal without is his chew addiction.  When you kiss it tastes the same though! So for my 3 or 4 days at home I have slept a lot, gone shopping!!!! And I went to see Spider-man 2!!! I have done a lot and tonight family is in so I am going hang out with them and sleep LOL! Tomorrow I am hoping to lose some of my family or something I don't know we will see anyway this is my last post for a few weeks so let me know your life and how you are doing I won't see you for a long long time love you lots Later Gator
