And it sucks b/c I was supposed to help out at VBS this week, and now I cant. :( But maybe i'll be able to go and see my friends before we leave for Florida. Speaking of Florida, we leave on Saturday morning!!! I'm glad I got sick this week instead of when we were in Florida. Other new, hmmm.... I broke up with Blake. Yeah, it just wasnt working out. I have feelings for Drew. And I want to be with him again. But i'm going to stay single this summer... ya know, just be me and have 'me time.' I think im going to lay back down and sleep.
