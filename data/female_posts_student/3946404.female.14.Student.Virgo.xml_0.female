If your not in the house, come home when you see me.      Mom                Not even a  LOVE  Mom, justa mom. And it was written in cursive!! This is horibble. I'm so scared, but I shouldn't be if I haven't done anything wrong, right?        I'm still terrified.        And I have to wait till friggin 1:00 to even see her expression!! If she was here today, we could just TALK, But Nooooo, I have to wait in suspense, thinking horibble things till she gets here. I don't even know if I WANT to go outside today. I'm scared.  *shrugs*       Sorry I haven't wrote inna while. I just forgot. :(       Umm, what's been going on. Well, Britt left yesterday morning. {1.)Brittany- One of my best friends. Known me for a while too.} And she might see Stephen while she's up there, cuz the Leiningers (his family)are going up to UCF to see Melody (his sister)graduate. {1.) Stephen- I met him at church. Known him for years too. One of my best guy friends.} So Britt's psyched cuz she may see Stephen up there at the graduation, cuz she's going up to Orlando to see her sister, Tiffany, and Tiff's best friend Andrea is graduating and they're gonna go see her graduate.  *shrugs*  It's a small world, eh??       Cindy's sleepin over tonight, and hopefully on Tuesday, we're gonna go to the mall.      I'll ttyl when I find out what my mom wants to  TALK  to me about.  *cringes*       XxO xXo, Which Do You Prefer? Big Or Small!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
