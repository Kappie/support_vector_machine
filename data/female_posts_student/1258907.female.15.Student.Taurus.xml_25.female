Said the bratty little blonde With her huge bouncy curls As she runs to the pond After removing her clothes And jumping head-first She slams down hard And feels a great thirst A thirst for what, you may ask A thirst for life? A thirst for death? A thirst for time she will not get? Well it's her own fault For going to the pond For diving head first She didn't ubnderstand Understand she might die Die from herself Herself in a sence you may not know A sence she died to prove oneself Oneself to be willing And too willing she was She wanted so bad And too bad we know To be one of them, of them who knew It was only a fad.
