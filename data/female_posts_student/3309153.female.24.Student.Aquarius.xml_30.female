Sang "Best Deceptions" like he still means it.  2. Removed his button down shirt in the middle of the set, under which were the traditional skater tee and those glorious tattoos.  3. Covered a bit of "Teenage Wristband"...I just KNOW we're soulmates...how in the hell does he know that song!?! How is he a fan of  urlLink The Twilight Singers !?!    4. In almost the next breath covered the most beautiful part of "I Will Play My Game Beneath the Spin Light"...which lets me know he is a bonafide fan...not just someone who was forced to endorse  urlLink them  by his label.  5. Somehow endeared, quite obviously, the most acidic bitch in the world to him. Brilliant liar that I am, I could not fucking make up the fact that the actual daughter Satan pulled from his side in Milton's  Paradise Lost --the Registrar of my college--was seated in the row directly behind me and knew every syllable of "Screaming Infidelities" just like me. Who woulda thunk...me and her...screaming out "Your hair, it's everywhere..." together? Who woulda thunk, indeed.
