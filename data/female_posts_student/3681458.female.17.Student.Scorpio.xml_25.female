I must decide soon, so I can call him after tonights practice. I can't help but be bitter against guys. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I am in pain right now. This completely turned my world upside down when I didn't do anything mean, and someone retaliates in such acruel manner. Someone who said they loved me. You knew better! I've been hurt too many times by people who say they love me. You didn't ever love me. You blew smoke up my ass. You used me as a pawn. I used to care about you. I am over you. I can't be anymore over you. I am not over the things you've done to me. Fuck you Ben. I hate you. You're worthless. You made me feel worthless, and for that you need to go to hell. I can't describe how much I hate you. You and you're stupid friends will never learn.   There is someone I want, but I'm not sure if he still wants me. He would be perfect for me. He's liked me for so long, I can't imagine if he's completely moved on. He is my fairytale ending. I have never really told him how I've honestly felt. Megan and I were talking about it, andit hurts to think about it.   Don't want to hurt Jason. Don't know what to say. I am too confused right now. I am bitter. Not against him, but just bitter towards relationships right now. I feel like I can't trust anyone. He says he means all the things he's said. Everyone else has lied. Don't know why he should be any different. For that matter, anyone.  Will keep you updated on what I decide.
