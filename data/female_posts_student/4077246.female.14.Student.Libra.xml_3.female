Me and Josh had another disagreement...about what I'm still not sure.  O well.  But he said that Ryan told him to just break up with me.  I know that Josh wants to do it, I just don't know if he knows that he wants to.  But he is foing to do what he wants to do and I'm not going to tell him what he should do.  Well i better be going.  I need my sleep.
