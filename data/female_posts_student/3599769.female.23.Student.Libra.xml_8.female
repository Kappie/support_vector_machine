So how come its okay for you to go out and then call me and tell me what you've done after you've done it but i go and have a couple of drinks at like 6 and i get the attitude. Ahh, you do care! lol. Anyways hearing the surprise in your voice that I actually left my apartment, it was priceless. And to think I wasnt even being mean when i said it either. How you didnt notice I was 2 drinks shy of drunkiness, I'll never know. So i decided you didnt need to know until today.Someone be proud of me, I'VE ACTUALLY LEFT THE APARTMENT!Jenn knows this guy who's like 2 8and has been in the same slumped I've been in, and get this its been two years for him! Lord, I dont know if i can stop myself from killing myself if it lasts that long. Maybe its time for the good time prescription as well as the good time drug. Ah, fuck it who cares. All i know is that i have an earache from hell and I'm slowly dying from fever. what a way to start the damm weekend.
