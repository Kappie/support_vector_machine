Lone nails stick out in place. Hoping to never be lonely.  I feel like the nails, sitting there so. No worries to fill my brain. I burrow into my hole of hardness, Stuck in a rut again.  Your pleas don't make me flinch I stopped listening long ago. For when you left the last time, You left without your soul.
