After I yawned about 6 times in 1minute, I started getting suspicious. I felt hot all over. I turned to Laura and said:"Ohh, I don't feel good." Then I tried to move around in my seat. When I couldn't take it anymore and I got the "feeling", I went to the teacher and whispered:"I need to go to the nurses office. I don't feel well..." That's the last I remember besides hearing something hit a chair or desk. I woke up on the ground. I looked up at Laura who was now sitting above me in a chair rather than across from the table from me. I knew what had happened. I put my hands to my face and said: "oH God. I told you I didn't feel good." The sex ed teacher and the regular teacher looked down on me along with the rest of the class. Then the regular teacher picked me up, I said:"Wait, don't I need my backpack?" and she held me as I walked through the hall to be greeted by the dean and Rick(my softball coach who also yard duties @ NHS). Rick took me from there and to the office. I said:"Whoa. I feel like I'm goin' to faint. Can I sit down on the floor?" And with out a reply I laid down in the office next to the juvenille delquents that were sent up there. Rick said:"C'mon let's go to the nurses office." Walking was one thing. They way things looked was another. It was like walking in a black and white speckled cartoon. MY head felt heavy and light at the same time. We got to the nurses station and I barfed. MY mom eventually got me and took me home. I called Heath's cell to tell her I couldn't go shopping today. :( HeR  LLoYd called back later, and already knew what had happened. They said a lot of people were concerned and talking about it. (Humph. This is still not embarassing to me, b/c this is not my first-public pass-out.) Heath also said that kids in the class said I hit my head really hard on the desk when I went down. I have no recollection of this, but can strongly say I believe it since my head hurts like hell now.   OTher than that, it was a fine day. The guy I like noticed I wasn't in class today. He asked me why and said class was boring, besides two retards getting sent to the dean for goofing off. As I was about to sign off he said: short people are always sexy. I said: except to you. He said: No 2 me 2. Me: :) Olala. I don't care if he knows it anymore. I think everything is completely obvious. ((If you don't get why this is of any importance, then you obviously don't know me. I'm as short as short can be. 5'0"!))  WeLL that is all I guess.
