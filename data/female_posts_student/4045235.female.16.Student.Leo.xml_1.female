Yeah, just a little tedious, so here's where yall come to get the updates. So, I've moved to Raleigh, NC. It's all right here so far. I've finally gotten everything in my room out of boxes. All I have to do now is get rid of the nasty wallpaper  repaint (if you have any suggestions, I'm open, really). My room is a LOT nicer. Bigger, new bathroom, new walk-in closet. I got the works. The house is bigger too, but we also have these huge water bugs that are infesting us and scaring the crap out of me. We've found about five so far, and they're really creepy. Right now we're searching for a new church, and it's weird because I'm not going somewhere where I'm related to half the people, but oh well, so goes life. I just signed up for classes at my new school, Leesville Road High, and it's a lot different than home. Only 8 classes a year, school starts way earlier (August 10th) and I have to get there by 7:15. That might be a problem. My classes are all right. I have to take H. English 3 again for some weird reason BUT I don't have to take gym (yes!) And they've also got a whole section of classes devoted to marketing, which is a possible career choice for me, so that's way cool. Maybe I moved here for a reason... :) Not much else is happening around here. I'm trying to get out, but there's a lot to do around the house and not many other places to go, so I'm stuck. I'm getting a little homesick, but I'm toughing it. I love yall and miss you guys so much. Don't forget to drop a line every now and then... *
