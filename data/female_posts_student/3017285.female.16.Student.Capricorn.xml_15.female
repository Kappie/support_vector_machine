Got about 5 hours of sleep in total. probably less.  We're doing a political project in WWW programming now. I couldn't think of a "political organisation" to support/not support offhand, so he's given me the Green party in Germany.  Ooooooh boy. Is thiiiis gonna be  fun . I'm oozing sarcasm here, can you tell?  I mean come on. As far as I'm aware german politics never does anything. It just stagnates. And talks about pensions, I guess.  Ah well, maybe i'll learn something. I should keep up with the politics of my home country mor anyway.
