The last version of the recorded song we had was crap, and while the next was louder, it sounds bad and that damn solo's still there.  Oh by the way, thank you Dollface, thanx to your comment about the song, Eli decided to reconsider the solo! (NICE) Dun worry, I failed to mention your name and instead I said about 3 or 4 people hated the solo.  Too bad, it really does suck anyway.  Anyway, yeah it was early today, I got home at like...7? I think...sure, but after my mom started yelling at me as soon as I got in the door, I got to go outside and sleep against the side of a building! Nice! Also saw that Mongol, SovietSmurf, which means I didn't get to live in the street for too long...oh well.  I'm Deadinside, and that's my dream of life.  "She pissed me off, that pissed her off. She yelled, 'Eat me, bastard!' I yell, 'Ok, but I'm still mad!'"
