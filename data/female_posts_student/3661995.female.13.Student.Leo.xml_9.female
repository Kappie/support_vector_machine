Luckily, my fear of death saved me from committing sucide.Yah, I fear, I mean, isn't being afraid of something normal?     I didn't ask to be on this world, but I should learn to live properly... I should stop thinking about dying... I probably read too much angsty books...    I tried using the tarot as a way to hlp me straighten out all my thinking, and yeah, it did work!     Life is usually full of complications, but I should just accept this bloody life... because I'll be stuck with it till I die... which should be at least 70 years more...
