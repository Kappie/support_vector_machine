We started the day with 'interaction' games, as it was called. Each group was supposed to build the tallest structure that can balance a ping pong ball or tennis ball. Of course, the heavier the weight of the ball the higher points we get. Then there was a second part to the game. Each group will have to dress up a pair (xx  xy) to look like Mrs. and Miss Latin America!! And guess who was the unlucky/lucky (depends on how u look at it) gal...ME -_-' Yes yes, but this time Xinhui didn't  sabo  me...it was her TKGS frens. *bleh* They wrapped me up with cloth and toilet roll, played wif my skirt, hair, ears (for earrings)and even drew on my face with lipstick! That was bad enough...but even worse, the camera man came around twice or thrice and filmed me -_-' stupid camera man. Then time was running out. The tower was done but the guy was not done yet! So the ppl quickly dressed him up wif the garbage bags provided...so ugly...but damn funny man...when i looked at the other groups, i wanted to roll on the floor and laugh till i die...but that would ruin my costume. Haha. Zab was so pretty!!! Wif flowers everywhere...so her group won best dressed lah of course. Our tower was quite successful, was second tallest. Yuxin's group had the tallest and they were the overall champs for games, followed by my group. Heehee...*BOLIVIA ROX!* Anyway, the time for performing was getting nearer and nearer...when we went up on stage to rehearse, we were like...wow, the stage so bright and also quite big leh. But we were quite prepared lah after rehearsing. After that, we were like slacking, cos practise until so xian so got nothing to do...but soon the time came. I tell u, i was SO nervous lor, cos my partner is a guy, and i am right in front, and i knew the guy's frens will start oohing and aahing...i was so damn scared...my face became like tomato...haha. Anyway, we were 2nd and i performed as usual...lucky thing didn't miss any step although i bumped into one person behind. Nvm...but of course there was oohing and aahing lar, but now i'm glad it's over. We didn't win of course. Cherie's group won, firstly because she was leader and secondly because her facilitator was a dance himself...our facilitator was Ms. Tsien. *bleh* But i dare say i had a great time...then at the end of the camp, my guy partner asked me for my no. and i was like "Huh? o-kay..." I really really never expected him to ask ok...then my stupid frens made fun of me all the way to the bus stop outside. Sigh...btw, no need to be jealous ppl, he isn't that cute. Haha...being mean again... Anyway, i'm now back home and i have made a new fren among others too. Thank goodness i didn't lose the other fren. *whew*
