I mean when you think about it, a good examination result does not reflect much other than the fact that the person has been hardworking and was with a clear, confident, mind when he or she attempted the paper.   People thrive to do well in examinations to prove to others and themselves that they are indeed intelligent and capable and hence they try to emulate the best in the field. Examinations cause much stress in some students due to the intense pressure burdened upon them by their family and teachers. Exams are NOT only about studying. Its also about being fit and healthy while writing the exam. Then there is the constant nagging of your mother in the background telling you to stop watching so much soccer and movies on TV and start studying (hahaha that happens to me a lot). Then as the exams near, the urgency increases and students start to burn midnight oil. hahaha then as the next exam nears, this whole thing repeats all over again!!  Well on the brighter side of things.. Imagine... so far(up to JC 2) you have taken over 44 exams and still counting..Its true that its indeed a whole lot but you are more than half way through your education and all these exams will be no more in just a few years!!
