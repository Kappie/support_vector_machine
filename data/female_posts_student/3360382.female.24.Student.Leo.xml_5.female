In an article titled  Right Thing-business ethics , the effect of organizational ethics was questioned in reference to companies having larger market values due to more commitment to ethics within the company.  According to the article, "a study of 300 large firms found that companies that make an explicit commitment to follow an ethics code provided more than twice the value to shareholders than companies that didn't"(articles.findarticles.com).  Usually when employees can feel comfortable with making ethical decisions at work the organization/company itself gains value because the employee gains confidence in their decisions and are fully committed to facing ethical issues.  When there are conflicts within the company as oppose to an employees personal values(rights,wrongs,perceptions on different situations) an employee is probably being disagreeable on code of ethics within the company and their personal values.  I personally feel that it is a good idea that all businesses or companies implement the use of organizational ethics because an effective program can have a positive affect internally and externally.  All companies should probably have some kind of organizational values, cultural values, and culture characteristics this type of organizational commitment would help the entire company when needing answers when ethical dilemma's arise.
