It should be fun, I am going to jump into the shower and hoefully our uncle doesn't lag too much.  haha  Like I should talk right?  Anyway...a very  HAPPY FATHER'S DAY  to all the daddies out there and the soon to be daddies as well.  Oh and again... HAPPY BIRTHDAY JESSICA!   Now let's all go and have fun!
