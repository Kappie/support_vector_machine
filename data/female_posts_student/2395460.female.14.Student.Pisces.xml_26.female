No longer will you be forced to buy your  urlLink bachelor party novelty cakes  at expensive bakeries. All you need now are some dirty pictures and you can make your own, much more realistic penis or breast cakes.   All you do is pop in the  urlLink Edible Frosting Sheets  into your printer, which should be loaded with  urlLink Kopykake Edible Ink  and then the resulting print is placed atop a freshly frosted cake. The image will meld seamlessly into the frosting. The film is FDA-approved and Kosher, and hopefully tastes better than those sugar roses on birthday cakes.    I can't tell you how excited I am about this. All my friends and family should expect very personalized cakes for their birthdays.   The inks only work in Canon printers so I guess I'll be getting a new inkjet. Come on HP, please show your support for this very important innovation.  Get inspiration from the  urlLink Kopykake Gallery .
