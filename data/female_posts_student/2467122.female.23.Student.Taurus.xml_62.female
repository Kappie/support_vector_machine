I got lost in Maspeth/Ridgewood last night on a wild goose chase for the UPS warehouse.    I finally got my Dell Digital Jukebox (a full 20GB of music for my personal enjoyment), lots of cool tunes for fun and profit.  Ah, the miracles of modern technology.  I have  IMAGINATION , now all I need is a box...  I have been feeling better lately- but there are still many boogies to go.  I hate being sick, especially when I'm congested and I sound like a weirdo.  I am just glad that it's July (I keep getting closer and closer to September and classes).  Getting back to what I was talking about- what was I talking about?- ummmmmm, Rita is coming down next week (YAY!!!) and we are planning some fun adventures.  We are too cool for school!  Okay, well I will post more later (maybe) and right now I am going to go play with some doggies and refill my drink!    WHOO HOO for alcohol!!!  P.S.  Here is the  urlLink Holy Grail  of yummy drinks online.  And check out my  urlLink live journal  (although I don't know why).  Enjoy!
