A car hit the median and spun around on the Gardiner this morning so we were held up for a short time, but the driver looked okay and the emergency vehicles were there very quickly.  Off to Passion Sunday Mass (a long one) in a few minutes.  Will be busy there and to the unchurched, it would appear that we get some very odd souvenirs today.   Snow tomorrow; sun and 7C today.  More to come...
