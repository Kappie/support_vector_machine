First off, getting home from a party at 4am when you have to be at work at 8 isn't the best of ideas, even if you are the designated driver.  And then, volunteering to turn your 8-hour shift into a 14-hour one, well, that just transcends all levels of stupid.  And now I'm really tired, go figure.  Anyway, Grey's been posting all this great poetry and meaningful stuff on here, and here I am blabbing away.  Heh, she didn't believe me when I told her she'd be the all-star on this thing.  But, I swear, the moment I have an actual thought, it'll go up here.  In the meantime, though... mmmm, nap.  And Grey, you know I'm here for ya if ever you need me during all this.
