TodayI have school, of course, as well as chores and music. Like everyday. Later I'm going tohand the applications, and then I'm going to go to the music store. Specifically I'm looking for David Lanz, a decent violin and piano duet, and any kind of random pop, such as Vanessa Carlton.   Now onto the sleep portion... I went to bed around 2am. Then my alarm went off at 6:26am, but I pushed snooze. Then I guess I slept through the beeping if/when it sounded again. Around 8am my mom said, "It's getting late!" so that prompted me to get up. So... 2am to 8am... that's still6 hours. Insane, right? Better than 5 1/2 hours...   Updated at 3PM:  I didn't do any school today. Around 10 AM we went out though. I submitted an application to Dunkin Donuts, got a book of soprano arias from the music store, plus we went to the grocery store. I got some Ramen noodles, and Mac and cheese. Mmmm... haven't had stuff like this in a while. It's wonderful...
