So I'll make one up: Yardophobia: fear of curly blonde hair. See more phobias  urlLink here.   My fear tonight is that I won't get to eat dinner. I'm on call with the grumpy resident, and we didn't really finish rounds until after 7, and I lost my Pocket PC with my credit card (I'm getting it back - another student found it and e-mailed me), so I have no money on me, and I don't think that she'd buy me dinner or give me the opportunity to run home to eat. Grrr. And I'm missing the only all-school party of the year that is worth going to.  Is it okay if I keep whining? I'm on the psych inpatient floor right now, so I may just fit in...
