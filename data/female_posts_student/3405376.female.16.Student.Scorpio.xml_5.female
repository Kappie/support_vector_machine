Now as us girls at bennies have 3 weeks but most people only have two we decided not to schedule anything in the first week so as to avoid any embarassing sirtuations where only 2 people come.   Schedule:  Saturday 3rd July-  Movie Nite  Tuesday 6th July- Movies  Wednesday 7th July- Gang Show  Thursday 8th July- Movie nite  Friday 9th July- Picnic  Monday 12th July- Bike Ride  Tuesday 13th July- Go-Carting  Wednesday 14th July- Horse Riding  Thursday 15th July- Movies then Kareoke   All Venues and Details will be sent closer to the date of Event. We will need to lknow whether you can come so as we know whether it will be on or not.  Email me or Leah.  Leahâ€™s email is: leah_davison_007@hotmail.com   Anyways Hope to see everyone There Luv Dee
