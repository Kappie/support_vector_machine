Of course it had to be the house with the most coolest and most cutest guys in it. I mean they couldn't risk not winning Greek Week. Or even fathom going to the Homecoming dance with any guy that is less than perfect. I definatly think I will take a second look at the sororitiy house I want to be in when the time comes. Whoa! Too much drama for me to deal with.
