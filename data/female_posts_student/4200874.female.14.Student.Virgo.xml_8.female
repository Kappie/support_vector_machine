Bought four colours... erm, some sorta red, cream, black and purple. They looked pretty good, or so I thought. Well, maybe they're nice... just the way I did my shirt... a little messy! Well actually, ALOT messy!! Sheesh... looks like it's been done by a 7 yr old. Anyhow, I've ALMOST finished... just the sleeves left! I'll probably do them at night, before The Apprentice... coz I've got to wait for the front and back to dry completely.       Oh for the Apprentice, I sure as hell hope that Omarosa get booted out. She's just plain annoying!! It's an amazement she's lasted this long. Well, maybe not since she's got Troy in the team, and he's the reason why they don't go to the board room!      Oh and Latifah wants us to go out after Cross-country, next Friday. Should I? I don't think one of 'em really likes me... as in one of 'em if I actually go out with Latifah and gang. I don't feel comfortable around her... at ALL! Geez, come to think of ut, I don't think I like her much either. Oh well. Anyhows, I don't think I'll go with them. Wanna watch 13 Going on 30 and The Bourne Supremacy. Movie Marathon... Gonna be FUN! Go with my sister I guess.. Yeah. I'm so not looking foward to it... Oh  I'll probably walk with Latifah. Walk the whole way.. pretty fun huh?      Anyhow, gotta study Geog...      -happy studin' i guess-       The cup of life     This is the one     Now is the time     Don't ever stop     Push it along     Gotta be strong     Push it along     Right to the top
