Matt Damon (Tom in the movie) is the star of this movie, and he finds this guy Dickie and starts acting like him, and then kills him and then takes over his life. The he kills this guy Freddie or Frankie or something because he's about to blow Toms cover, and then he is about to kill Gweneth Paltrow's character Marge, because she is going to blow his cover, but Dickie's dad loves and believes Tom, and gets the cops to back off him. Then he I think falls in love with this guy Peter, and you think the movie is over and Peter and Tom are going to live happily ever after, but all of a sudden he kills Peter...WTF!!! I'm going to have to read the book because I was really very confused by the movie. And I'm still trying to find out if Tom was homosexual or not, because you never could tell. Yes, so I'm off to the library now to go get the book because I have to find out what the heck was going on...bye...okay I just saw that is 11pm, okay so I'll get the book tomorrow...
