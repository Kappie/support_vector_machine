My mom offered to keep him for two nights, so this morning I woke up at 8:30 when I had gone to bed at all of one o'clock and had to sit up and watch DragonTales and other queer ass GPTV Educational Cartoons while my mom took a shower. Then I had to go and get my tooth filled. The shot always freaks me out, but i love when my whole mouth is numb and i cant tell if its open or closed. Its like volutarily taking cold medicine, extremely pointless fun. So the whole rest of the day I've just been drunk off of lack of sleep and that drill rattling my brains around. I did get a few new outfits. I'm so glad I started babysitting. I had the weirdest day yesterday. We went to Tifton for Father's Day to see my grandpa and we always go to Wal-Mart. I had to stay with my mom almost the whole time, because I went to go look at CDs and this group of Mexican guys kept following me around. Even with my mom there, they kept on showing up and checking me out and stuff. It made me really uncomfortable, but we finally left and went to the Cracker Barrel and i saw these two guys there checking me out, so I tried to avoid them. One of them was kind of cute, and the other was alright, but I hate wating my time with guys I'll never see again. But after we ate, me and my 10 year old cousin Carrie were sitting outside in the rocking chairs and they came and sat by me and tried to say hey and start talking to me, but I got up. I would have hated it if my parents would have come out and seen me flirting with two random guys when I was supposed to be hanging out with my cousin. SO that's that story. I had a lot of fun shopping today. I got a workout walking up and down there with big ole Jack in one arm and my bags in the other. I got two new skirts, two shirts, and an awesome new bra from Victoria's Secret. Well, I gotta head off to play practice. I hope I remember all of my blocking and the dances. I want Mr D to be pleased and all. I hope I dont have to say my line..yuck, i suck.
