Yellows are the most fun-loving, free-spirited, energetic, and childlike personalities in the aura spectrum. Yellows are wonderful, sensitive, optimistic beings, whose life purpose is to bring joy to people, to have fun, and to help heal the planet.    urlLink   What Is Your True Aura Colour?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   This is sooo true, I am wonderful as it says! (though the last bit sounds like Miss Hippy!    What movie do you belong in?   You belong in the Disney movie, Pirates of the Caribbean. Your life is a constant drama with many twists and turns. But in the end there will be a true romance.    urlLink   Which movie do you belong in? clh     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   Kay I'm not a pirate....I'm confused!   What Disney Character are you?   You are Belle! Intelligent and misunderstood, you often retreat into your own little world. Try finding a common ground with people before you assume that you won't be able to get along wit them.    urlLink   What Disney Character Are You?(females)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I like Belle she's a friendly person!    You're meant for year(s) 1700-1890.      You find beauty in the frills and twists of this period, where society was based on grace and nobility.  You might also find a sort of romaticism in it, and it's dark under-belly, pertaining to the many family feuds and arranged marriages, as well as the very HIGH suicide rate of women.    urlLink   Which Era Do You Belong In?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla   Although I love this era, Suicide? I love life....I don't wanna die! I got the same thing for the other quiz of same name. It said I was a snob! I don't like the quizzes any more (she says doing more).  What is your Inner Tree?   OAK You are boisterous and affectionate. You are the kind of tree that takes nothing sitting down, and is always ready for an adventure. You like to see everything that goes on around you. You like the warm weather, but you flourish when the nights tend to grow slightly colder. You are someone who likes to extend your days into the night hours because you never want to leave anything unfinished. You love an audience when you do things and you like to show off sometimes, but others admire your attitude. You fear past mistakes coming back to haunt you, but try to live day by day. You admire the strength of others and try to find the same in yourself. When you leave this word, you want to make an impression so that you'll never be forgotten.    urlLink   What's Your Inner Tree?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Yes I was surprised too, but we all have an inner tree. I am an Oak Tree. If you do none of the other quizzes do this one so we can all compare.  Oooh I found one in the same bit for flowers lets do that!  What type of flower are you?  Result One  My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Daisy - Joyful. You, my bonnie friend, would be a daisy. Daisies are the symbol of happiness. You must be wonderful to hang out with, always so happy and cheerful. ^-^ I am so happy that you are so happy. ^-^ ^-^    Result Two  My #2 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Stargazer Lily - A dreamer. "And oh what dreams may come..." You are quite the dreamer, a romanticist. *-* You probably daydream frequently and have a very creative imagination. *-* The stargazer lily opens only at night, so it appears as if it's gazing at the stars. Perhaps you would also like stargazing.    Result three  My #3 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Baby's Breath - Innocent. Awwwww. ^-^ Kawai! ^-^ ^-^ You are Baby's Breath. Quite an innocent, huh? That's good. Baby's breath are often included in bouquets and wreaths, so don't feel unwanted just because you got a small flower! ...Oh...Oops... Stay away from cats, okay? They eat baby's breath sometimes. X_X    Result four  My #4 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  If You Were A Flower, What Kind Would You Be?  , is  Tiger Lily - Wild, crazy. Waaaaaaaaaahhh! @_@ @_@ Loca! Crazy! You are a unique and unusual specimin! Truly a tiger lily. Do you dress uniquely? Are you creative? If you said 'yes', I am not surprised! Don't let others put you down either! Continue being a tiger lily in a field of clovers! ^-^     Byeeee Guys
