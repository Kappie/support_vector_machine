And the ones that showed up before that have screwed up dates, and that kind of stuff really pisses me off so I'm making a whole new journal at a whole new site!  Woo, and that brings me to this oh so wonderful Blog!    I'm talking to Ryan, my new friend for Battle of the Bands, right now and it is making me so happy, you have no idea!  But everything he talks about is WAY over my head!  First he was talking about how a new universe is created every second, and then he started to talk about how some experiment was done with suicide to go there!  Wow, I understood none of it!  And now we are talking about A Clockwork Orange, but I don't have much to say because I've never seen the movie!  I've heard its a great movie, and I know that I should see it, but I've never got around to it!    gOaLs FoR tHe WeEk/WeEkEnD: *Rent and watch A Clockwork Orange *Have a sleepover with Ashleigh *Hopefully see Rachel and ALEX *Go to Charlotte's surprise party *Go to Jamnesty *Attempt to sleepover at Christian's condo in Wisconsin
