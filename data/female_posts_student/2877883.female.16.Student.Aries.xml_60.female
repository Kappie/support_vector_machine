It was going to be about how I'm not happy.  And bitter.  But now I don't really feel that.  I mean, I know it's there, but it's just not what I'm feeling right now, which is really good because I do not like being unhappy even though I have been a lot lately.    So, the reason why I changed my mind was just two simple things, but that make me really happy.    1.  My game tomorrow night has been canceled.  This means I get to go to the play, hopefully with Meliss/Carolina.  I was looking at the pictures in the Landmark and realized how much I wanted to see the play, but didn't think i could and now I can.  Woot!  (Note to self: stop saying woot)  2.  More importantly, let me quote:  The following items were included in this shipment: --------------------------------------------------------------------- Qty      Item                           Price  Shipped  Subtotal --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1        Apple 4 GB iPod Mini Green M94 $249.00  1      $249.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Aka my ipod has finally been shipped!  Yes yes yes so so excited about that!  So, that makes my day that much brighter.
