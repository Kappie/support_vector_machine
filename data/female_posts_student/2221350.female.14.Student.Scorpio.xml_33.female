I was thinking about a friend of mine who I could totally date. I won't say any names since this blog is semi-circulated around school, but I will blabber. He's a junior, he's in gateway((the gifted program at magnet)) like me, he's absolutely hysterical and fun to be around, and he's got that kind of -I look American but I've got good Scottish/English/something roots and that makes me good for staring at and wondering whether he wants a chick or a lass- thing going on. I see him every day and we talk a little bit, but I don't know if our joking around/getting into sticky situations could be considered flirting.  Have I yammered enough about people who could care less? I have a tendency to do that.  Going to see a movie with em this weekend. Hopefully if I post it up here I'll remember to call her or something. I think  I'll make a deal with myself to do something every weekend besides sit around here, it gets boring. But you know something really sad? I don't try extra hard to go out because I know when I get home I'll pay for it by having extra chores. I think it's kind of sick and sad that mammaw feels like she should cancel out my happiness with housework, but everything I go somewhere and come home it's like "OK YOU'VE BEEN OUT FOR ALMOST 2 HOURS BEING JOYFUL, IT'S TIME YOU DID SOMETHING AROUND HERE" and it's especially bad if we go out of town! What a pitiful thought... I don't get out much because my grandmother give me extra chores and yell if I look too happy about it. Mom says she is miserable so everyone else has to be miserable with her, and I think it's the sad truth.  I chose Katherine de Medici for my monologue, she was somehow related to lorenzo de Medici, the rich banker and patron of the arts... I think without him, Michelangelo wouldn't have had much of a chance. Well anyway, Katherine was jealous of her husbands mistress the entire marriage and this "other woman" was apparently some kind of famous harlot that hung around with all the royalty. I think I'll be able to pull of a green queen pretty well don't you?
