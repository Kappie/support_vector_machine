Park has already told the team that he will not resign with them this year in hopes of a larger free agent deal.  The Angels have been actively looking for a starter since. The one deal that seems to fit the team the best is trading Park, reliever Mike Bielecki and first basemen Greg Colbrunn to Texas for Frank Tanana and Paul Konerko. Tanana is also a free agent at the seasons end.
