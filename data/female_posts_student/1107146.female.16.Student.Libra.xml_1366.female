So I ask my mom, and she comes up with at least ten different excuses for me not to go, including "You need to be at choir on time" (there is no choir today), "You're not using a nice tone of voice", (I said, 'mom, may I please go to FRA's graduation with Abby?'), "You've been treating me like a dog for more than two weeks (yeah, which is why I've done all the laundry, all the dishes, and aced all my exams),  "I don't want to take you" (Abby's taking me), and it all ended with "I get why you want to go anyway" (Um, to get out of the house, mainly, and so I can meet Abby's school friends).  So finally she says, "Ok, but you have to clean the basement before you go."  The basement was already really clean, so I took the vacuum cleaner down there and vacuumed the entire playroom and cleanedd out the closet.  So my mom asks my dad to come inspect to make sure I actually did what I was supposed to, and lo and behold, if there wasn't a popcorn kernal on the floor, meaning, of course, that I needed to clean the  entire  floor all over again.  So I vacuum.  Again.  Dad comes to inspect.  This time there is "baseboard dust"  I'm serious.  That's a quote.  What the hell is "baseboard dust"?  So anyway, I clean all that up.  Never quite knew what it was i was cleaning, but apparently I did ok on it.  So dad comes to inspect again.  Apparently I hadn't cleaned well enough under the foosball table. So I did that.  He comes back to inspect (you'd think that he's get tired of running up and down the stairs) and this time he's satisfied with the playroom, but now he wants me to vacuum the rest of the basement.  So I vacuum.  More baseboard dust, more worms, more popcorn kernals, blah blah blah.  So finally, after about 15 insepctions (by this time I'm feeling like an Iraqui) I finally have permission to go to graduation, and my mom is NOT happy.  I can't wait for Ren Fest.  One day of freedom.  Then on Saturday I'm going to AL to visit my grandmother and cousin, but then I have to go to Auburn with my family.  Not that I don't like Auburn, I love it as a matter of fact, but my mom...it's not going to be a fun ride.  I miss yall so much.  I miss school.  I just want things to be like they were about 4 weeks ago.  THings were a lot less complicated then...*sigh*
