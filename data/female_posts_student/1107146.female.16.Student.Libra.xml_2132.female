I Just found out about it about a year ago.  Josh, don't hate prom, that's not nice. Abby and I will help out if you need us to.  And you call Rob and Gossett.  I don't want to tell my own boyfriend how much he's going to be spending on me, and Gossett is really mad at me right now.  Just call Carabba's right as it opens and get reservations.  The good news about it not taking our reservations is that they won't take anyone else's either, so it's ok.  You never did tell me about the limo...
