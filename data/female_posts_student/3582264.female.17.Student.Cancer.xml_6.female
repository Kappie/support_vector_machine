I can't find a boyfriend, and it's really starting to get to me!  All my friends are ditching me for thier boyfriends, and i just wish that i didn't feel like a 3rd wheel all the time.  Why do i still have to have feelings for Erik?  I keep on telling myself to get over it, but i can't.  Besides, he's taken to one of my friends (even worse).  I think i might like Johnathan, but i'm not sure.  I know i wouldn't want to go out w/ him though.  He's not really my type.  I wish and hope i can find a guy before the end of the school year, but I know it'll be harder cuz summer is comming up, and aswe know, guys like to be "free men" for the summer.  Well, better get to sleep!  6/3/02  Today I decided that I'm going to get my act to gether and shape up.  I acctually did my homework!  But anyway... Johnathan update: I still am not sure how i feel about him, but he notices me, which is always good.  I was walking to 6th period, and as i was heading into the building, he said,"Ali! How's the KKK going?" He always asks me that. [just to let everyone know, he was refering to the "Krazy Kortney Klan"].  I think i should try a REAL conversation with him one of these days.  I don't see him as much of a long term relationship kinda guy though, two-weeks tops!  But anyway... I'm gonna try to get a good night's rest.  That's all for now.  6/5/02  Okay!  MY week is NOT going well at all.  Yesterday, I found out that Mike, on of my "kids" got into a car chrash in Walla Walla on Sat.  at around Midnight.  Great hu?  He has a bruised lung and vertebre and cracked ribs.  His dad's shoulder is shattered and had surgury on it yesterday.  His mom, little sister, and brother all died instantly.  Mike and his dad were found concious at the scene.  It was a head on collision, with a drunk, illegal immigrant who rean from the scene.  I don't think the cops have found him yet.  And now on a less dramatic note- Johnathan likes Tasha.  Just my luck!  But i know she would just treat him like ----, like she does with all the other guys that she knows like her.  Maybe I can create a small deversion though... hmmmm.  Oh, at lunch, Tasha asked me if I liked johnathan.  I was sitting right next to him, so i didn't want to say anything.  I wanna find out if SHE likes him before I make a move.  I'm gonna write johnathan a letter now though, don't ask.  6/6/02  Today I had a migrane all day, and i still have one, grrr!  Jonathan was all, "your gonna walk with me." after 4th today I don't know what's up w/ him.  I dunno if he likes me or not, and Cortney doesn't want me to get involved with him because of the stuff he's into.  Anyway!  Erik stole me at lunch today again, and Cortney thought I got in trouble for skipping w/ johnathan or something (I didn't skip!), but anyway!  I really need to practice my piano.  I'm not doing the greatest at the moment and Holly can't go camping with me, so I called Jennifer to see if she could go, an she hasnt' called me back yet.  Her dad's (Step) sentancing hearing was today, so i don't know when she'll be home.  Well, i'm gonna go now. P.S.  I say DJ today and he came over and put his arm around me and i told him about my headeache and hen carrie said, "Oh, i thought you were going to kiss her forehead," so then he did.  DJ is such a flirt, and he has a girlfriend, weird, hu?  He calls me cutie or squirt and always flirts with me  I don't know what's with him, but I don't mind. :)  6/13/02  Sorry, it's been a while, but I'm determined to keep this diary up.  I'm sad!  Today was Johnathan's last day I was going to tell him today that I liked him, but that never happened.  I got distracted w/ something a little bit more important.  Jennifer told me earlier today that when she was 2, her real dad had raped her (supposedly).  She had told her mom, and it's not like she would lie about something like that.  But it didn't really seem to bother her, but at lunch she started to cry and later she dotl me, "I'm not even 15 and I've been raped 3 times."  And I just tried to comfort her, and tell her,"It's not your fault, that should have never happened to you.  You didn't deserve that, but you don't have to deal with it on your own, I'm there for you."  And then later in English I cried.  It's not fair, she didn't deserve this.  It should have never happened to her.  I've been trying to find the good out of all of this, the reason it happened, but i can't find it.  I've been praying about it, but i have yet for my prayers to be answered.  But I'm gonna move on 'cuz I'll start crying agian if i keep thinking about this.  So back to something a bit happier.  All my books are gone.  I don't have to worry about them anymore.  When we were walking back from the library Johnathan jumped on my back, so i ended up giving him a piggy back ride half the way.  He's really light though, like 100 pounds.  Today was the hottest day of the year, uggg! Well, gonna go to bed.  6/14/02  Today was such a weird day.  It started out really not good, and turned into a pretty good day, which is always good.  I woke up and my mom told me that I had to clean my room or cortney couldn't spend the night, so i had to get up and clean, first thing in the morning.  Then i started to let Holly and Jennifer get to me, so while I was walking to 1st period, I was blubbering like an idiot.  So i felt really stupid.  Then i found out that I still have a C+in PE w/ a 83.6%.  Which should be a B-, but no, Mrs. Abrams has to have a ----ed up grading scale just so she can ruin my life.  But by lunch, things turned around.  I found out tha ti was passing science, yes! I've got a D, but i'll get my credit.  Then Jennifer came w/ me and Cortney to -- ------ and we ate dinner and then went shopping.  I felt kinda bad cuz Jennifer didn't haave any money to buy anything,  but I think she had fun anyway.  Mom says we're gonna make me some summer shirts.  Cool, hu?  Well gonna get to bed.
