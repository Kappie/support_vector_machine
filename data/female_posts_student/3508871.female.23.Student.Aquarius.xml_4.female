So...this is my first week in my temporary summer home, location, Hood River, Oregon. What have I been doing? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Well, except that I am waiting to begin my summer job as a photo assistant and a sales person at small town Hood River. And what I am doing right now? Sitting inside my apartment, wasting my chance to be out on a sunny day for a computer....typing this blog. Yeah, so what, I have nothing else better to do right now. And here I am being influenced by Andrew...in creating this blog. I met Drew at a christmas party...hahaha yeah right....ok it was christmas break in year 2001? Ok one of those Christmas' where no one can remember anything that had happen except just clips of it....hahahahah So Drew, my anime friend....who is crazily in love with animes and also ripe ripe mangoes! Do ask him about his ripe juicy mangoes, it is his most favourite fruits in the world. Anyways, Drew just told me that he will be getting a new hot rod in a few days or a week? No idea...I guess he will be riding with the wind...time to PARTAY with da BABES in TOOWOOMBA, OZ! hahahahah. Felt so sorry for him being cooped up at home in TOOWOOMBA,OZ! That poor dude has just been dreaming about juicy juicy mangoes,hmmm it is in fact SUmmer here in the US, so JUICY JUICY Mangoes will be an option. Except that it is too cold for those MANGOES to survive in a weather that DREW is experiencing. Well, I dedicate my first posting to DREW, YOU're the MAN!heheheh. NOt sure what...but you're THE MAN! ENJOY IT While you're still YOUNG! oh yeah also guys, check out DREW's BLOG: http://funkmonkee.blogspot.com
