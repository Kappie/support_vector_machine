Turns out, w/ all of the photo editing programs I have, the one that works is actually Microsoft PowerPoint.  Still photos in a slideshow format should do nicely.    Now I just need to get the photos I need.  Also, my McNair Portfolio is due next week.  W/ graduate school information, and some other stuff.  I hadn't checked my schedule, so didn't realize it was already due until I received an email from the program director this morning.  So, I've got a lot to do this weekend.  Fortunately, I'm not too far behind.  Though I haven't actually applied...I take that back.  I did apply, online--which a lot of Universities are doing now--to University of Cincinnati.  However, I don't really count that, since I haven't sent the application fee.  Anyway, I have all of the information I need on several schools I'm interested in.  I just need to get all of the stuff together in one place.
