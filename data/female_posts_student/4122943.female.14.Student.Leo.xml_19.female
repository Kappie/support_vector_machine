YUCKS.. he den took revenge by rubbing gel glittering stuff on moi head.. i chased him around de stadium but could not catch him so i stopped n wait fer him.. once we saw him we wet him again wit de disgusting water n siew chen drew sumthing on de AI's face wit a parmanent marker but he could rub it off... after all de running, catching n crazy-ing, i felt lyk going to de loo.. so we went.. but when we went back to de stadium, our sch left.. haiz..so we went back to de indoor stadium ourselves.. there we took our snacks.. damn, it was so crowded.. te siang(think spell lyk tis) n wei liang  took one box of de oxygenated water.. haiz.. n cannot managed to bring all of it back.. NAUGHTY...
