CiCi, E.T., and Peaches (yes, a different cat) were all boarders with tempers. They were CRAZY! One of them, CiCi doesn't like to be woken up. Well, I made the mistake of taking her out of her litter box so that I could clean it. Man, she cut my palm...that wasn't fun. Peaches growled everytime i walked by her cage, and E.T. (Extra Terrifying) hissed every time I looked at him. Little brat. So i didn't bother with his litter box, and just gave him more food and water before he attacked me. Then there was this dog named Belle who was really sweet, but there was also a family with three dogs: Max, a collie mix, Samson, a male St. Bernard, and Autumn, a female St. Bernard. Oh, and one of the little puppies got loose under his cage, so i had to put him back.. Ah well, April
