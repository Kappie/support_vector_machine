IF you don't know we got a 2-2-1 in concert and straight ones in sightreading. Fun-ness, I know *sarcasm lol no anywayz*. So then I went straight to tennis. Unfortunately, I lost the set 5-7. Made me so mad. I was like 4-1 then it just went downhill. I had so many match points. GAG ME! I also learned some extremely stupid jokes on the way home, especially the one about the chain saw, lol.  Lataz, ~*EPT*~
