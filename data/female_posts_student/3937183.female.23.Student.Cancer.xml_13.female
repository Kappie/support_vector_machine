I burst out laughing when I read Sugarflys’ blog last night… She addressed me as Swan Lake… A real funny reason behind this name but it was more than 10 years ago… KAKAKAKKAKAKA!! Well, nice to know that she can remember little details for so many years… HEH! Today was a restless day… I wanted very much to get outta the house and strange enough, I had 3 groups of friends dating me today; Sugarfly called at 1pm asking me if I wanna go IMM with her and Yvonne today, Min called at 1.30pm asking if I wanna go do manicure today and QP called to wanna meet me for dinner at Jurong Point today… So happy and honored people still remember me at times….    Last night I made a major decision that would affect my life in a way. I changed my hp nos. Weird… All these years, I had opportunities to do this but I did not… Now? I think I am very determined with my decision now… I think I had met the right guy for me already and it’s time for me to put the past behind me and start afresh. These are probably reasons why I decided to change my nos, a nos since I had my very first hp. Anyway, the new nos is meant for family and friends only. Xian Zha Ren Deng, I am so sorry, you are not short-listed.    Supposed to meet up with Sugarfly and Yvonne at IMM at noon but I couldn’t make it so I asked if they’ll be going elsewhere after IMM. They had no place in mind and Yvonne wanted to go home to look at Coco the precious little bitch so I called QP instead but seems like she is meeting up with someone else already as I did not give her an answer. Fine, Jess shall stay at home lah… Anyway, tomorrow is my little bitchy sisters’ 21st birthday party. I believe I’ll die of exhaustion entertaining those people attending. Most importantly, I do not wanna hang out late also because today is 2nd July and when the clock strike 12 tonight… It’s our 2nd month anniversary!! KAKAKKAKAKAKAKK! YA LAH! ONLY 2 MONTHS BUT ALREADY SO IN LOVE! SIMI SAI!    When I read Sugarflys’ blog, I came to a conclusion that it’s true everyone is contradictory. We always claim that we can do it like this and this but when it’s time for you to prove it, we can’t. It’s not easy trying to please everyone around you. Like me, I am a person who doesn’t seem to be able to reject people. Always try to make everyone happy and in the end, I am the unhappiest! I guess it’s true that when you tried too hard, things backfire and don’t turn out the way you want them to be. So please, leave life as it is, as I always believe, everything happened for a good cause. You might think you had missed the bus to work but who knows, the bus might end up in an accident that took lives on board. So long as you are happy and you did nothing wrong, so be it and as for the rest of the people around you? FUCK THEM! FUCK THEM ETERNALLY AS IT’S FREAKING NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS HOW YOU WANNA LEAD YOUR OWN FUCKING LIFE! Remember, you earn you own living and you don’t have to an answer to anybody except those who raised you... **Contradictory spotted**   Kisskiss!
