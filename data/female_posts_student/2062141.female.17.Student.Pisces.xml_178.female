Me, Caitlin, Rachael, and Amanda are gonna see "Shrek 2" and they're sleepin' over n such and that hasn't happened for way too long so I'm looking forward to that. As for Saturday, I have no idea what I'm gonna do cause .. well seems like everyone's doing something (I hate you Ryan and Charlotte... lol uh yeah everybody!). I tried watching Mary Poppins today but have realized that it is actually too young for me (for some reason other Disney movies aren't) and I fell asleep and woke up at 6 and was like AH CRAP 8 pages!!! But it's coming along well so it's cool. Well, I'm off!
