I LOOK AT HER AND SEE HELL, I SEE WHAT I WANT AND WHAT I CAN'T HAVE AND I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE, I'M SO PISSED OFF AND ANNOYED AND DOWN, AND NO ONE GIVES A SHIT BECAUSE I CAN'T SHOW ANYONE, ITS ALL FUCKING HIDDEN BECAUSE ITS PATHETIC.... IT IS SO GOD DAMN STUPID, I NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT, I NEED TO GET FIT, I NEED TO GET PRETTIER, I NEED TO TONE UP, I NEED TO BE DIFFERENT, I NEED TO BE HER, I NEED TO GET AWAY FROM ME AND ESCAPE, ITS SHIT BEING ME, IT SUCKS BEING AVERAGE, I WANT TO FEEL SPECIAL TO YOU KNOW? AND THAT FUCKING PRIVELAGE WAS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE HER FUCKING SIZE DD BOOBS OUT AND HIM BEING A DICKHEAD OF A BLOKE LIKING THEM, WISH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BORN, MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER TALKING TO HIM AND HER, AND KNOWING, KNOWING THAT I SLEPT WITH HIM, AND JUST WANTING TO TELL HER, WELL GUESS WHAT PRINCESS? I SCREWED HIM GOOD AND HARD AND IF I HAD MY TIME AGAIN I'D DO IT AGAIN AND I'D MARK HIM JUST SO YOU SEE WHAT I DID... JUST SO YOU KNOW THAT HE WANTED ME, IF ONLY FOR A GOD DAMN FUCK, HE STILL WANTED ME AND I WILL NEVER GIVE UP ON HIM. HE CAN'T DO HAPPY LAURA, HE CAN'T DO SECURE AND HE CAN'T DO LONG TERM, IT DOESN'T WORK FOR JASON, NOT UNTIL HES COMFORTABLE AND HE THINKS I FORGOT? FORGET WHAT? EVERYTHING WE BLOODY WENT THROUGH, I COULD NEVER DO THAT BECAUSE I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, I CARED ABOUT HIM AND COULD NEVER FORGET ANYTHING ABOUT HIM BECAUSE ITS ALL SO S[PECIAL TO ME THAT I WOULD NEVER NOT WANT THOSES MEMORIES  Anger over and i feel on edge and not real, its all so fucked up in my head and mind and i can't unscrew it so to speak. On a more positive note i can type and not look at what i'm doing and actually manage to spell what i want to which is alright, finally my touch typing skills are working ok! Not the point of this post, maybe i do need to go see someone? Maybe what i need to do is talk to someone completely neutral, i doubt any of my mates actually tell me the honest truth about what they think  because they all think i am completely pathetic and need to move on. I do need to move on, but it doesn't work like that in my mind because he meant so much to me, so so so much that i cannot put it into words. Going now, need to talk to Tom he always knows what to say to me.  ~Lisa~
