Tomorrow is Mel's first day of school... just wanna wish her good luck for her first day... but when i got home it was too late! I wonder if i am able to wake up early tomorrow to call her just before she leaves for school.. Who has lecture on Sunday?? My poor gal.. My life is not so great having lecture on Saturday too...  I went to orchard today to meet Donovan... Am so happy to meet him since I only get to see his king kong face once per week.. Anyway we went to the esplanade The date with him was one of the best today... Normally I just hang in his place... not that its bad or anything but today was something more special.. Pity I was having period so I felt pretty uncomfortable sitting on the rocks! haha.. =p  Received an sms from Daphne my long lost poly friend.. Really surprised to hear from her.. Am really glad that she remembered me.. I really miss her sometimes... But I guess that's what happens to friends when u grow older.. As in we all have so much to do and so little time... But what's important is that our paths crossed.. Friends... one word but means so different as you grow older I find that I no longer need to cling to them as hard as I used to anymore.. What's important is the ride, the experience, and not possession.. That you had played a part in their lifes, and them to my own too.. Life is about experiences.. and I damn well intend to have alot of that stuff before I am 'recycled'. hehez...  Anyway I think I gotta go to bed soon..going over to Don's place tomorrow  Byebye
