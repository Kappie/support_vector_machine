Yah, got home last night at 10:30, and still had to study for a Jerry test...which I think I failed...night before at 9:30...tonight probably more like 10:45....tomorrow, only God knows when.  Man, all I can say is "I feel pretty, oh so pretty..."  So, yay.  BUT I do get to have a headset thing, and look really cool and official and stuff...even though nobody really talks to me, but whatever.
