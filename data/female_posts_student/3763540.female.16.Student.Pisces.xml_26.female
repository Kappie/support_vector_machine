It started off with boring, uninformative VBS meetings(just keep saying fun fun fun) neway then the some of the mcocyg went to TACO SMELL! which was a blast we filled up half there eating spots there must have been like 20 or so of us! But the lady had a headache so we pretty much got kicked out for "being loud" and the sad thing was was that some of the elderly people from church were there too oh well maybe they didnt recogonize us(ha). but it was ok cause ya know we just took it as a thrill plus the baptists had just let out so they were coming in so we left so they could have some more seats. We then needed somewhere to go having like alittle over an hour till KING ARTHUR started at 10 soo we went to Rainbow Elementary's play ground cause we all love to swing(yeah we are very weird) neway just as we were starting to have fun these lights came on and it looked like from like a small go cart or something so we were like uhoh the police! and then they blew their air horn so we went back to our cars i duno why cause that just made us look guilty and plus they could block our exit out anyway... but we did and it ended up being some other people from church who thought it would be extremely funny to scare us. since we were already in our cars we followed J-Love to the mall and made a car train all through the parking lot (listening to 70's music haha) until we decided we could get in trouble so we left and went to Carmike for the movie. and lemme tell ya that was a good movie! all the guys were on the edges of their seats watching Kiera Knightley wearing almost nothing and painted blue. But ya it really was good everyone should see it! After that we just kinda went home cause goodness it was 12ish which is why im writing this now and not last night!Overall it was one of the best spontaneous outings we've done in a really long while!
