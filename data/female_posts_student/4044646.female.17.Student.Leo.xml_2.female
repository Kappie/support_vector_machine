You have to love the rain for one lol cause me and my friend got soaked eventhough we were under the covered seating area it was fun though.... at times i wished i were one of those people with the lawn seating so that i could go down these peoples' tarp and go slip and sliding down the Hill, lmao it looked fun. Oh you know those individualy wrapped promotional WinterFresh pieces of gum? Well as soon as we walked through the gates this chick with 106.1 was giving out hand fulls of it, well i had a Mcdonalds bag from "dinner" and she filled up that bag half way up lol! But suckie part was that when it rained, the bag got wet and it practicly melted lol and fell apart in our hands so i was scramblin to pick most of it up and crammed it into my pockets. The concerts were great.. i was amazed by 3Doors Down and there opening hit "Duck and Run" with all the fire and explosions... it was cool then later on they used light beams and a video wall to view the music video while they were singing... But I think the most amusing thing there was this lil boy who was about 8-10 years old lmao he knew every song was head bangin' the whole works haha and even when Puddle of Mudd was on it was F this F that hahaha im not sure he  repeated any of that but i think he kinda edited it out himself lmao it was funny.... Then the worst part is ( no not the rain) but this couple who couldnt sit still and watch the concert.. every break inbetween the concerts one or both of them would get up and go get another beer.. i swear they only saw 3/4 of the whole concert ... tisk tisk... Nickleback was awesome too... lol yeah I think i was yelling/screaming, and sang to much cause yeah i lost my voice and yeah lmao that wasnt a good thing to have while at marching camp.. but hey i tried yelling as loud as i could (but it hurt like hell) you know what i dont get.. why people come and watch us teach/rehearse i mean there upperclassmen who just sat there today while it drizzled and rained on us all morning.. i ono thought it was kinda stupid... but i had a good day afterwards when i got home... fixed a pizza and put in a movie then went to sleep for about 2hrs maybe a lil bit longer so that felt really good cause i didnt get back home till 12 last night and i was soakin wet, tired ,no voice, knees hurtin, head pounding.. lol but hey i had a great time... plus i just couldnt pass up getting a shirt which was 30fricken bucks and then rachel didnt have enough money so i had to give her 15more$ so im like broke now... but then in return i get $70 from her for the ticket and the shirt woohoo lol
