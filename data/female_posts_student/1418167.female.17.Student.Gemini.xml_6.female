(Go Kerry! Sorry Paul.)  6:30-7:00 Dinner  7:00-8:00 Hang out with the girls and Paul  8:00-10:00 Bedtime for the girls... it takes a while.  10:00-12:00 Get online to talk to Morgan about how much we miss people.   So as you can see, there isn't much time to sit still. I have, however, gotten Sarah addicted to makingfiends, This Land, and homestarrunner. I refuse to show her the squirrels for fear she will develop a habit of cussing (like her cousin).   laerhgiehg.... damn I'm sleepy. I think I shall go take a nap or just sit and laugh about how many times people thought Grace was my daughter at the mall today. Odd people. Sarah told me I "looked weird" this morning cause I didn't have my glasses. Ah well. At least I won them each a toy in the impossible Crane Game. Muhaha.
