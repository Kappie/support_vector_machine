I really liked it, but I am exausted completly gutted. I guess the bottom line is that i enjoyed the module.I am coming toward the end of my MBA program.It has been an amazing experience.I just loved and hated every bit of it. Right now I am feeling like lost, i have no clue where i am going to go after this , but I know one thing for sure whatever I do i will do with all my passion and my heart. This may sound philosophical but I thank god for giving me all the oppurtunities and experiences in my life cause, I owe all to him or her for that matter.   Anyways forget the philosophy, I will go lie down as i have to get up early in the morning. Good Night.
