I don't feel like going into details... it's just like half my friends being weird to me... and me realizing how stupid I was with some other person who I don't even care about and is one of the biggest lying pigs I've ever wasted my time on. Yeah that sounded harsher than I meant it to be. But yeah couldn't care less anymore. Shit why am I so good to people that aren't good to me? I waste so much time doing that, and it's always me who somehow ends up the one fucked in the end. ARGH but anyway things that DO matter.... I had detention today, good times. It's cause I'm such a bad girl. I'm bad news.  Heh... yeah I was late three times to Language. (....Lame yes.) But Mr. Crueger saved me and I just filed papers for him (believe me it's better than just sitting there in the attendance office with all the kids who actually did something). It's been taking too long when me and Nick go out to lunch. Oh well. I want my tacos dammit! Lol Nick (*dammit, dammit, FUCK, dammit, COCK!*).  I made a whistle today!!! HOO raaay! No you don't understand. I could not make a fucking whistle by myself. For three weeks. Four. And I made one today. SCORE! hehehe. No school Friday, I'm soo happy. I think me and Josh are gonna go to the mall and scope out da hatties. Heh... yeah shoot me if I ever say that again. :p But yeah. Hotties like Josh! No not you Josh (ooo harsh! no i love ya baybah). YOU know who I'm talkin' 'bout). Stupid bisexuals. Pick a side, dammit! But if you're gonna be that beautiful then I guess we can't really judge. Heh. Then I'm spending the night at Charlotte's.... and watching the Jetsons movie, baybah! No I guess we should watch that Saturday with Nick. ("You've seen the Jetsons movie????! Oh. My. God.") I think on Saturday me and Zack will hang... But yeah either way this weekend will be massive good times. Tomorrow I'm painting sets for Alice in Wonderland. I have to draw the main poster by next week... I'm recreating an old Alice drawing but incorporating the Hazen cast's faces in them. PURTY COOL HUH??? Yeah I think it's because Mr. Grossman's been stressing me out about my portfolio... but I'm taking some art classes at the Frye Museum next month.. including a portfolio making class. So wuteva. I've also been thinking alot about orchestra and how i hate it and how i'd like to sing waaay more. Maybe senior year i'll do choir instead of orchestra. Two people have told me I should do that. I think I want to. That would rock. This probably sounds weird to you guys because you never hear me sing but I looove singing... yeah. So that's what's on my mind this week I guess. It has been a most non-excellent week. I'm supposed to call Mike. He called last weekend.... I was gone... But I can't do anything with him. It's so pointless if you live in friggin' Eastern Washington. Cause if I did it would just be another pointless weekend wasted. Even though he's really cool...   AAAA Ergh what's wrong with me lately? I need to quit wasting my time with asshole guys. Aaah I don't mean Mike... Just... in general....I'm just pissed off about everyone... 'Cept Charlotte, Nick and Josh. (That was my little disclaimer). Why is the Jason Mraz concert so far away! I need some down time seriously. I miss summer. That was the most excellent summer ever. I went to Hawaii. And camp rocked sooo much for so many reasons. Oh god I miss it. Going to Newcastle Beach (Disneyland Park! hehe) and listening to Beach Boys. Shit I was looking forward to fall so much. This is like the first time ever it's been fall and I miss summer. Then everything had to get all complicated. Dammit this is like the most dramatic 30 days of my whole life. And I hate drama. I can't stand to have anyone be upset with me for anything. And if you knew all the crap that happened to me this month you would understand why I'm so messed up right now. This is getting real long.. So I'm gone. Bye! thanks for caring about my problems... no.. you're just bored huh? Sorry this was somewhat of a downer.. I'm normally so upbeat and cool yo... Maybe after me and Charlotte have some much needed girl bonding time. yeah I'll keep you posted when that comes back. After this weekend.... I hope. Argh. Thanks so much Nick and Charlotte (and to a lesser extent Josh) for listening to me this week. You guys rock. Love all y'all lots~
