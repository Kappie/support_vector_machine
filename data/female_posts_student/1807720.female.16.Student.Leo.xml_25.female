I was happy cause well I got an 85% on my math quiz which is pretty good from me but well I just can't seem to get the hang of Chemistry.  I just wish I knew why it is so hard to understand and learn for me.  I feel like no one else has as much difficulty as I do and it is very frustrating.  My math teacher said some nice things to me today which made me feel good because I thought that maybe she didn't like me or thought I was dumb.  I do think my self-esteem is a little bit low right now but I can't do anything about it.  I just wish, I wish, oh how I wish I just understood Chem though and well everyone thought the quiz was easy and well people after were like "well that sure was easy wasn't it" and well of course I don't want to say that I thought it was hard cause EVERYONE thought it was easy - so just WHY or WHY don't I seem to get anything?!?  And well even since Monet came along I feel me and Chelsey are drifting further and further apart.  I don't have anything against her but it's hard watching my best friend laugh and seem to have a better time with her than me.  Chels always seems to have room for Mike or Monet but never me.  And it hurts.  But well it kind of cheered me up when I found out that I didn't have to write the test for the Religion unit cause I finished my work.  Everything this just doesn't seem to want to work out though and I feel upset about things - there are just so many things, and things beyond my control.  I will probably get my chem test back tommorow and well I don't think I did to well so I don't know what I am going to do.  I don't understand the Chem teacher at all but I am really trying to understand.  I am having mixed thoughts about my career choice too, I mean I just KNOW that I want to teach something that has to do with Science in the High School level but I am not very good at Physics or Chem and well Bio (have it next term) is the only thing left.  I LOVE Science so much though and I don't know why I just can't seem to get the concepts of things and understand.  I just wish I was a little more happier, and that maybe I could alot more nicer to others, and I wish that maybe for once I could just UNDERSTAND.  I wish.
