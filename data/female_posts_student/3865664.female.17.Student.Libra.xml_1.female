He's older them me by 2 years. I'm kinda laid back. I like art, books, music, rollerblading, shopping, doing hair, make up and just like everything. I'm not prissy or preppy at least i don't think i am. I don't have a bf. Not yet at least. I have an eye on a guy named Zac. I've known him for a couple years and they have turned out to be the best years of my life. I'm not gonna get too much into Zac on this first post cuz i can bet you will hear a lot about him through these post. He's everything i could dream and hope for but he doesn't know it. I'm too shy. Anyway there's not much to say. I work at AE here in the mall and i'm pretty happy with the job. Hey it gets me money. Ok i gtg. I'll write back later  Kate
