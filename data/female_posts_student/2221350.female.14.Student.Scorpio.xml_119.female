Well the lunch didn't work out so I went to quizno's with mammaw and Devon.   mammaw and Devon are about ready to kill each other, and I am ready to kill both of them. They fight like children and yell like baboons and it's no wonder Devon sleeps 20 hours a night.   after lunch I jogged on the treadmill, which is much more dangerous than it sounds. You see, the treadmill is in my room jammed into a corner. Err sort of like this:   so anyways I hopped on to the stupid thing and then lost my balance and then what happened??? I WAS JET PROPELLED INTO THE WALL! Luckily the treadmill was going slow and I didn't get hurt. I was still too embarrassed to tell anybody but my blog.  Steven gave me the money to pay for html classes. That man is such a darling. He just had surgery on his neck a few weeks ago and the poor baby is hurting all the time. That's the reason he couldn't make it to lunch today.  this afternoon I washed my cat. He is pissed. OH and I found a picture of Maximilian to show you how beautiful he is!!!   Max is my one and only darling and the most gorgeous cat on the planet. This also gives you a good view of our couch, which is a big joke in my family because it is so weird looking.  tonight we ate dinner at the neighbor's. The meal was such a catastrophe I have chosen not to relive it by writing about it.
