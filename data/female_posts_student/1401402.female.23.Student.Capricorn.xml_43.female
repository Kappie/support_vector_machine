I did not know anything about the 10k. Until my mom told me the truth, about what is behind all of this. The story begun, dad owes Oaks 10k. He has a limited of time to pay back every single penny. If the money isn't handed over, only god knows what will happen to him. Mom asked me to help.   Gosh man, WTF does families seize me as. A bank account? I really want to complain about all of this but what's the used. Family will always be families. My highest priority is to do my best to keep everyone satisfied. I would do what ever it takes to help (if I can). Another grand was all I can offer. I need the rest to cover my  ass for my own bills. I am not a greedy person or anything but my bills are due, nevertheless this is the very best that I can do.  What else can I do? I don't know any billionaires and mainly I am not rich myself.      My heart fell straight rite to the ground for a second. I could not believe what is happening to my family. The very first thing that came to mind was that he deserved it. Let him untangle this problem his self. He got himself into this situation; let him figure a way out. Let god punish him for what his done. Let him suffer the consequence alone.   Sadly, in the mean time, my little heart collapse. What can I do? I felt so bad for what's going on rite now. I sat here thinking about the old times. When dad rod his bike, two miles, to pick me up from school. I was probably in the 2nd grade. No matter how poor we were, he has always paid for my school pictures.  He would always give me lunch money though out high school. He took good care of me. He was always there for me. Under circumstance, I felt so awful if I did not give him more then I can offer.    A friend once said to me, "Without money, there's no happiness". It's very true without money you cant be happy. No money, no honeys.  In the elements of life, the saying is so true think about it.
