I went to California for 2 weeks to spend time with my Poppa and Gomma and then saw my friends that I hadn't seen since freshman year. I also went to hawaii for 10 days with my sister (15), cuz (17), and grammy which wuz a blast and very relaxing. I've been home for about a week and it's been back to vball and tryouts start on Wednesday...can't wait till those r over, the mornings are all conditioning and the afternoons are fun cuz we actually get to play but it's a lot of pressure cuz ur bein judged the whole time. Once the season starts it's all good, lookin forward to my senior year. Speakin of senior year, I got my class schedule. I don't really like my off periods so I'm gonna try to change those and maybe if I can stop bein so lazy I'll pick up advanced photography since I really like it but it's a lot of work. I also wuz looking at more ways to volunteer even though it's hard to schedule that with tennis and volleyball always goin on. And I wuz thinkin of tryin to be a youth soccer ref to make a little money, i sounds like fun, and weekends are the perfect time since most of my sports stuff is on weekdays. Busy Busy Busy... Lets see wut happens w/ all that.   I am watchin "Hook" on ABC Family right now. Such a good show, Robin Williams is awesome. Plus I luv that part of it is set in England. I'm obsessed w/ everything to do w/ Europe right now. I just made my screen saver a bunch of pics of different places in Europe like England, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, Italy (my fav. Venice), Germany, Belgium, etc. I've never even been to Europe but my plan is to take a year off before college and Au Pair somewhere in Europe (wherever I can find a job) and then backpack for like a month afterwards and explore...then I will head to college and study either kinsiology, nutrition, history or international relations, but who really knows wut I'll want to study by then, I'm so wishy washy on everything right now. Anyways, I'm gonna get back to watching "Hook". GOD BLESS ~ash         "Delight in thyself and also in the Lord, and he shall give you the desires of thine heart." - Psalms 37:4
