The boy always thinks he's right (and so do I, which is why we are like oil and water).  Don't get me wrong, he's a cool guy and a good friend, but my head pounds after working with him.  Other than that, work was cool.  It was eerily slow this weekend, except for some victims of the riots that occured on Saturday.  I got home from work around 11:15 and decided to organize my room.  I bought these great big plastic storage bins and some other devices that remind me of  urlLink Yaffa blocks .  I was up to all hours doing this organizing.  Am I suddenly becoming obsessive-compulsive?  I sure as hell hope not.  Well, I need to cut this short and get my ass to Hebrew class.  Talk to you later.
