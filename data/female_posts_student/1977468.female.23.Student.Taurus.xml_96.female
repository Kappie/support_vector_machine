What kind of rugged? The only kind.  The here-I-am-in-a-torn-up-tank-top-at-a-gas-station-in-montana rugged. The I haven't-shaved-in-two-days-and-I-don't-even-care rugged. Any rugged which strikes a "hey, who's  that  guy?" into the people around me, thats the right kind of rugged.    Example:   Fabulously Single Girl: "Hey... Who's  that  guy? mmm MM!"  Insider Friend of Single Girl: "The rugged one?"  Fabulously Single Girl: "Yes! Is that what they call him?"  Insider Friend of Single Girl: "That's just what I heard. They call him rugged. Goes by the name of Agnor. But thats just what I heard."  Fabulously Single Girl: "He's so.. torn. So un-groomed. So irresistable.. so... so..."  Insider Friend of Single Girl: "Rugged?"  Fabulously Single Girl: "YES! I need to talk to him!"  ---------  As you can see from this illustrious and soon-to-be-true situation, I am a genius. Still not convinced? I shouldn't have to do this but...  What girl could resist the likes of  urlLink   this   rugged guy?   **Since the polo pics were replaced, thats the new rugged pic. Thanks falconer**  Now mind you, these are the lightest defcons of rugged. Maybe code yellow rugged. I'm talking about code red rugged.
