I just want to be done- why do all of these extra papers and assignments keep popping up at the last minute?!  When am I just going to be able to go to bed and sleep late and be a total slacker?!  In other news, I finally got to meet Lamont- Rita's boyfriend.  Yes Rita, I do hereby give my approval!  But I must say, he reminds me a little of  urlLink Dave Chappelle  urlLink  .  Just thought you'd like to know.  Anywho, right now I'm listening to the boy snore... A LOT!!!  Trying to resist the temptation of holding a pillow over his face until the snoring stops.  No, no- that would be bad!  Only a few days left and then I get to go back to New York.  Missing the city bigtime!  Missing my Yankees!  Missing real subways!  You know the deal.  Countdown to my birthday... Only 8 more days to go!!!  WHOO HOO!!!  Hitting the big 2-3!  Damn, I'm old (but wise)!  Better get back to that paper, before I get too sidetracked.  Oops, too late.  Maybe just a little longer on eBay!  *me*  P.S.  Why is it that a guy and a girl can never just be friends?!  Someone fill me in on that one- I am so confused.  I'd love an answer at some point, but I won't be holding my breath.
