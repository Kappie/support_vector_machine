This world full of jealousy and hatred. I don't want to be borned. I don't want to be here. I don't want to be alive... But how can that ever happened...unless I get myself involved in some cranky accident and get myself killed halfway. I don't treasure life, I really don't. 'Cause they're never easy, never smooth, they're always full of hardship, full of crazy ideas. Tell me, oh tell me, what to do... Living in this world is to suffer, although I must admit I am not suffering as much as others do. But the situation I am in makes living so pointless. What do I live for...Who do I live for? Why am I even here? I don't ever know, there ain't a single answer... The society gets more and more complicated everyday...I don't know, but my emotions are high. Minor things can really make me cry, though I fought back my tears. They never know. They never understand. but what can I do? No directions, nothing. Just plain space for me to fill up. This is group work, not single. Where's the team spirit? Where's the work? Why. why. why..... Things that I can never achieve but something which I yearn for...always disappoint me. Their behavoir, as I watched from afar, is always something I yearned. To be in the best pure science class, something which I target for, but can never be fufilled. I know. I know all this. But they're repeating over and over again before my very eyes... People said I ask too much questions. But my mouth can never stop speaking. Why? Why. Why...Nobody answer. Nobody tell me anything. The only world of survival in this world is only to depend on yourself..and no one else. No one else understand how you feel, what you want, how you want matters to go. Yes, I know. I know I ask too much questions but.....do you ever even wonder about it before? How strange a human's mind work...what's called jealousy and hatred and cruelty...the language people invented had been passed down for years. how come it is there and why are we using it. we never know. we can never know... She was the leader everybody elected, I know. Yet, before my very eyes, things are going very wrong. Just by asking her directions, I could feel her annoyance. Just by stating that I don't want to do work, she said fine. Really fine, indeed. I don't know why.......................why I am reacting like this.... I went to read her blog, instead of concentrating on the leftover studies, she brood about her clothes. Both of them, none cared about studies, none knew the importance of studies. This is our path of career, something important in life. But I'm really fed up, really mad with anger. Yet they didn't care at all, 'cause they know, that, in the end, I will still do the work and they don't have to do anything at all. Tell me, oh tell me, what to do.......I know I cannot get on like this. I know I'm going to collasp very soon. but when? I dunno................... Tell me, every single one of you, what to do................  The street once bright but now so dull The sun once up but now so dark The place once cheerful but now so quiet The road once busy but now so deserted The path I took The friends I chose The people around me The hatred continues................... I don't know when this ever will stop Something called war, something called jealousy Something called wealth, something called fame Life's never fair Life's never equal Life's always there But I don't want to be alive I don't want to be here... Grant me a wish, Let me be gone, from now on............
