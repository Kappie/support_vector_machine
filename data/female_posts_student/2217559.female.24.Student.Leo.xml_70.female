I keep thinking when I fall asleep what it's going to be like to not have to wake up and deal with cranky guests, events and the politics of ship life.  It's going to be absolutely incredible.  So, as I near my last few days I have been very reflective of the time I have spent here. The friends I have made, the unbelievable sites I have seen and the changes I have made within myself and the way I view the world.  I have encountered 56 nationalities along my journey, learned of countries I never knew existed and have written in this blogg almost every day to describe my adventures. All in all, the last six months of my life has taught more than I have learned in my life time.    Work hard, play hard and remember to care about the people you meet along the way. Remember to think of others before yourself because you never know what their life has given them. Always be on time to work. When you look your best, you feel your best. Never take a good night's sleep for granted. Taske advantage of the time you have with friends and family because you never when they may not be around.   I have learned so many things since being here - things I have grown up all my life hearing from my family.  It's just now, after being away for so long and experiencing other's losses, financial obligations to their families and personal sacrifices, I am truly inspired.    I look forward to another contract even though I know it will once again take me away from those that I love the most. But from all the world I have experienced in such a short time, I can't imagine letting go of this opportunity just yet.   See everyone very soon.  My love to all. Shelly
