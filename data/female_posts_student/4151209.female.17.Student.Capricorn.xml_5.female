BUT  that was not the problem tonight.  My problem tonight was that my unequivocal dick of an ex decided to text message at 1Am (I was fast asleep which is a rarity for me( I usually can't fall asleep until like 7Am))to tell me it was over.  Now, I knew it was coming, and actually, I was going to break up with him ( although not by text messaging- which is quite juvenile), but not at 1Am! Anyways, we fought for about 4 hrs ( text messaging, mind you) and by the time we stopped, I was wide awake.  So now, thanks to him,  I am running on an hour of sleep,  and  I have to be at work in an hour.  Much thanks to him.  On a lighter note, in my opening blog I said I decided to use this to perfect my already terrific writing skills- well I changed my mind.  ( Just thought you should know that this is not by best work)  Also, I've been thinking of changing my screename...Any suggestions?    BTW:     Sleepless in Seattle  was based on my all time favorite movie:  An Affair to Remember
