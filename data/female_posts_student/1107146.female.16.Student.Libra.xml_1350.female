I wrote your song by the way, about the Easy Bake Oven, it's called  EBAMahickey ...it's really random, and I'll post it at some point. Just imagine a song glorifying the immense burning power of an EBA/making fun of it, and that's the song. And it's really random. Like, really. But back to the main point, I shall "hang" with said "cousin".
