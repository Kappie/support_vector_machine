B-Hope put me in the Mid-Rotation so it was really easy. but thats good cause i didnt really feel like doing much today. I was and still am soooo tired but idk why. Splish Splash is alwasy fun. I love it there!!! The people are just plain amazing!!! Deep Upgrade Wednesday Night (woo hoo) I am excited!!! Now I'll get to work in the Wave Pool and Shot Gun Falls!!! Yea well talked to Courtney for about an hour and a half on the phone. Another interesting Convo about well jsut about this person we know!! (haha courtney he has changed compliements on her!!) I lost the top to my Play-Doh (oh NO!!!!) Play-Doh is probably the best thing ever invented!!!! It is an awesome toy!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love playing with it!!! WHo knew that a round squishy object with lots of clor and a weired smell could be soooooo fun???? I love playing with it. I heard it is suppoed to be a great stress reliever. But idk i think it works!!! Ok thats all for now I guess. Maybe some more later on I am not sure yet depends on how tired I get!!!!!
