Wow that would be so horrible if I got the date wrong. I'll have to check.  But I'm pretty almost postive that's right. Of course that's right.  Yeah.  February 5th, 1975 Man I was thinking it was the year 2003 and I was like "Oh, he's turning 28? I thought for sure he was turning 29. Oh well" Ha Ha. Stupid new year.  If you don't know ways to celebrate The Adam's birthday, look below and find my list.  Anyway, like I was originally saying, I have to wear AFI something tomorrow. I don't think I'll wear my hoodie. Probably just a shirt. But which one??  I can never remember when the last time I wore whichever one I wore. I think the last one I wore was the Fall Children...yes, I think that was actually this week.  My days and weeks run together. Because they go to slowly.  I don't think I've worn the In Darkness Together one in a while. But maybe I have? And I'm thinking I hadn't worn the BSITS one in a really long time but I think I have. I KNOW I haven't worn the wings one in a while but I don't want to wear that one. I think I'll wear the In Darkness Together. I guess. Yeah. Most likely.  I think I always get more excited at other people's birthdays then my own.
