She's pretty upset after learning abt the underlying activities her arse ex bf did when he was with her. I dunno what to comment too cos I din really approve of certain things she was doing when he was in UK.  *Shrugs*  The surprise of the century came  (actually not really, I AM exagerating) when she revealed to me who she was seeing all these while after she broke up with Normz. I din really expected it ..-seriously-.. Felt worse than when Jac told me the same thing. *Shakes head* There are just so many lost souls in this world..and I thot I was pretty bad. How do I feel? I'm not sure now. But one thing is..I'm pretty disappointed in that guy. It's like a basis of trust that was broken because he became philanderous. Well, he's not my bf alrite but I guess I thot he had a sort of intergrity that I used to admire and now it's tarnished. Oh well... When peeps get emotionally wreck up, they behave in a way they do not comprehend I guess. I'm in no place to judge since I was did walked that path before and I know how it felt.. To be lost, to have no love, to be blinded by only that small dot in a perfect canvas and not notice abt the rest that were perfect.  I really pray all these peeps in my life stopped wandering the lost life. I pray really that they seek to Him instead to within themselves. Human strength is just too weak...  sighz
