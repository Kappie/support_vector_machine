I think i am going to tell Kasey how i really feel about him tommorow... before we leave the picnic, cuz then i wont see him for a week and yeah, i can avoid him!! but you know, i just feel like it would un-complicate alot of things... like he would be a little less clueless on alot of why i feel theway i do about him and Lindsey. his puzzle pieces might come together alot easier.... SO. these are my choices...  tommorow have an AWESOME time with him andthen right before i leave tell him how feel and just kinda talk it out... i dont know HOW i am going to tell him though.... it'll pry be a spur of the moment thing, ya know? so, yeah, i'd tell him then run away to Sr. High camp for a week and totally avoid him and try to get myself together again before i come home.. then when i get home call Lindsey and try to find out what he has said while i was gone about me telling him and then go to Jr. High camp with him and either: A.) avoid him and hang out with everyone else.. and only look at him when hes not noticing or B.) hang with him and act like nothing happened!  OR   i could just not tell him at all in the first place and whenever i see him feel guilty i am not telling him something and whenever i am with him act like everything is totally normal, while for real on the inside i am freaking out and there are fireowrks and knifes and love and hurt and just CRAZY feelings!! that he doesnt know about...   i am voting for the "tell him and run away for a week" choice!!!! but, i better decide fast..... CRAP! i dont know, can everyone just pray like crazy and yeah, we'll see what happens!
