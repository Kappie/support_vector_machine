Through the bass and rage,  he gently injects me,  filling me with liquid heat.  Taking my hand he leads me  through the gates of hell  the drug takes care of everything  there's nothing there but him.  He looks at me with empty eyes-  holds me close and pulls me under  to the darkness in the shadows,  and safety of his world.
