Although in “What is culture?” the author generalize the definition culture by stating it is “learning”, which I think is a reasonable definition. If we take behavior for an example, as humans we are trained to behave in a way that our culture has taught us.  Humans’ thinking capacity is more developed than any other species; therefore we tend to act in a way that resembles our culture.  But this could defer from borders of a nation, states, region or a city.   I was disappointed by the term “high culture”.  It said that “Generally, the most powerful members of a society are the ones who have the most influence over cultural meaning systems, and therefore the more powerful classes tend to enjoy the privilege of defining high culture”.  It breaks down the value of culture.  I don’t think culture should be divided into classes.  Culture could be different but it doesn’t mean that it needs to be ranked.  This is where all the disputes amongst cultures begin.  No individual wants to be discriminated for their cultures.  Culture is a way of adapting to a certain environment and as Montesquieu said it should be "To render an intelligent being yet more intelligent!”. I like how Raymond William has interpreted culture.  It makes more sense.  He states “Every human society has its own shape, its own purposes, its own meanings”. He talks about observations and meanings which we put into practice in our everyday life.  Humans are not perfect, they lean by their mistakes, observations and experiences.  All this happen within a culture and the culture can be improved by learning from experience.  I guess not only humans have a culture but even animals do.  Culture is ordinary not only to humans but also to animals.    Geertz argues that culture is "public because meaning is"--systems of meaning are necessarily the collective property of a group”. Most people are not diversed enough to accept other cultures, because they live in their own worlds and cultures and wouldn’t open up to the fact that there are other cultures around them.  This makes them totally ignorant.  Learning is the best way to overcome this unawareness.  Acceptance is not a must but respect is, therefore if humans respect each other’s cultures and learn from their mistakes it wouldn’t have been this bad to live on earth. If humanity is preserved by culture then our goal of been perfectionists have been achieved.
