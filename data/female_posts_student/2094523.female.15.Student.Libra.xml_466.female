I jsut sat for what seemed like forever doing nothing. i watched the cars pass by as everyone seem to have a destination to get to. and me? i didnt have any destination what so ever. i just sat there watching everyone pass by wondering why they are in such a rush. a rush to live. i cud have stayed there forever because i felt perfectly content alone. it was kind of comforting knowing no one was there to watch you or judge you or anything. it was me against the world. i cud have stayed there for a logn long time. but i knew i had to come home for dinner.
