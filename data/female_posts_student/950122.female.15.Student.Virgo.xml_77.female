I have a lot of time on my hands now because it's summer. I should be playing RO... XD I'm worried tho. I keep on wondering if I have to go to summer classes. O_o I'd kill if I had to.. But my parent's would kill me first. >  I haven't been eating lately. O_o I'm not on a diet or anything, I just haven't been really hungry lately. I skipped lunch today, and I'm still running. Makes me wonder what I'm running on.  I need to make a new layout. =/
