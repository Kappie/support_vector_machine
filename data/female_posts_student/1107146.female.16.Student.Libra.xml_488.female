My hur ("hair" in Chingy speak) is in a ponytail, is very pretty, and smells vaguely of Herbal Essences.   Are there anymore vacancies in the "I Look Like Crap" Club? Because I really need to join. Imagine a train wrecking into a plane with a nuke going off in the center of it all, and that's how I look today. Not sleeping much and having to wake up hella early is bad, and makes one look like crap, especially the male side of the species since we don't tend to like to cover it up with such wonderful devices as "makeup". Of course.  Except Johnny Depp was *BADASS* with eyeliner and shadow...I'm seriously going to do that for the rest of my days. Look...Layne Staley did it, Trent Reznor (tho I don't like NIN but Trent is a badass too) did it, Johnny Depp being a badass pirate did it...I need to do it.  Abby expanded the triad of the godly hierarchy yesterday, from a triarchy to a quadrarchy. Jesus Christ, Jerry Cantrell,  Johnny Cash , and Josh Chandler. Hahahahaha. Abby has synapses firing like no other to have caught that...heheh, she's awesome. It's too bad that the Chandler one is going to fail at life and at school. Heheheh.  O man, I told y'all.    A GIRLY-GIRL. You dont have a lot of self-esteem and people are always bringing you down for being sad. What do they know, anyway? You feel like youre too mature for your age and are frustrated by the trend-followers who refuse to accept you because youre not like them. Your virtues: Intelligence, understanding nature, modesty. Your flaws: Lack of social life, inferiority complex, timidity.    urlLink   What kind of girl are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
