However, even good players are often tempted to do things they know are bad ideas when they get frustrated, angry, or upset for any reason. They go "on tilt." Typical tilt play is much too loose and often very aggressive, beacause a player on tilt wants very badly to win a pot, and isn't rational enough to wait for cards that are worth playing or situations that are worth attacking.      Ummm..........yeah I think I'm starting to develop a problem. I never understood  how people actually GOT addicted to gambling before. Alchohol yes, drugs yes,  but gambling? Just fucking STOP  and then? came poker....  The thing is, that lately it has served as a metaphor for life;  mine in particular  Take for example my first foray onto Party Poker. I'm basically  still paying to learn how to play the game but, because of the way  I've been losing I've set up some rules for myself  like  1. don't see a flop without pairs above 9  2. don't see a flop without suited face cards  3. if you haven't hit your hand by the river don't chase it  4. check in with your emotions every 5 hands.  5. When you lose leave  6. When you don't leave  Now I see how you can lose your shit at the .5/1 Omaha tables.  They just don't respect pre flop raises so that even when  you've got the nuts you've also got alot of competition  and you're playing with a much more limited deck.   Poker as in life is about discipline and patience. If you have the  discipline the odds are in your favor. The cards WILL come to you.  Good poker players are revealed over time. Anyone can get a run of bad  cards, that's just life, but keeping your wits about it and waiting for  the right ones to play is a true test of one's strength  and in life, (mine in particular) it's a real test of your maturity level  and how well you are coping and lately with me  it hasn't been very well.   My emotional cup has been full for a long time.  I've got so much going on that  when little things happen, my tendency is to tilt  further and further  The tendency to self-destruct is also alot higher on tilt.  When you win your are invincible and when you lose  you are convinced that the world was created JUST to make you  miserable, truth is everyone gets dealt bad hands,some  worse than others, and when you start off on a bad streak  it takes alot of resilence to get you out of it.  It takes alot of faith to believe and understand that  this will eventually blow over   so don't play too many hands just smile  wait for the right cards and when they come, invest in them and do so heavily .......but  keep your eyes on your chips  Don't give them away needlessly   Diane
