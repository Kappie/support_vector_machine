They are as follows:  "Scattered fucking showers, my arse!" - Noah, 4314 BC  "How the fuck did you work that out?" - Pythagoras 126 BC  "You want what on the fucking ceiling?" - Michelangelo, 1566  "Where did all those fucking Indians come from?" - Custer, 1877  "What the fuck do you mean we are sinking?" - Capt E.J Smith of RMS Titanic, 1912  "It does fucking look like her!" - Picasso, 1926  "Any fucking idiot could understand that." - Einstein, 1938  "What the fuck was that?" - Mayor of Hiroshima, 1945  "Aw c'mon. Who the fuck is going to find out?" - Bill Clinton  "Geez, I didn't think they'd get this fucking mad." - Saddam Hussein   Wow, you guys, I'm so bored right now. And bummed because it's really ugly outside and I don't feel like venturing anywhere. It's also colder than it should be. I'm also beginning to be deeply worried about apps. I don't know how I'm going to get through the stress of this year, considering how well (HA, I laugh) I handled it last year.    Things I have learned since I started being worried about college:  ~ the Common Application scares the bajeezus out of me ~ the SAT can kiss my ass ~ the PLAN and PSAT are retarded ~ getting letters from colleges is more fun than it should be ~ SAT prep is an utter waste of time ~ the UCs are slightly evil ~ there are way too many good colleges on the East coast ~ there always seems to be another good school that I've never heard of ~ everything is way too expensive ~ my #1 criteria for a college is that it won't be like a high school ~ there is no such thing as a perfect match ~ narrowing my "Apply To" list down to 21 is a major accomplishment ~ by the time I go to college I'll probably already be over it ~ if I go to a prep school I'll go insane ~ my mom doesn't want me to go to New York, but LA is ok... ~ all in all, I don't care about undergrad ~ I hope nobody I know goes to my school. ^I mean no offense whatsoever by this last one. It would be nice, you know, to go to a new school and be the campus whore or something else interesting, with brand new people to make bad impressions on. :)  On a lighter note, I found out some tasty information about my Portugal trip: we'll be rooming with around 80 musicians from Europe. Which means, hopefully, a good amount of hot Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French guys to ogle. Should be fun.  I'm off. I hope both of you are having a great time.   Love, Insha   *edit* : My mom told me today, "I think you need to get away from here. Spread your wings and all that." Yay for not being confined to the West coast! And not being forbidden from applying to schools in New York! I have the coolest mom on the face of the earth.
