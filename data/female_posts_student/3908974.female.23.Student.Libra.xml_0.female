During the day, I stay busy enough to forget about the things that worry me--My debts, my questionable future as an academic, my very questionable ability to be a professional writer.    My life on the eve of graduating college is turning out to be a lot less than I thought it would be.  I'm staying in Kansas for grad school, and I applied so late that I might not even get a teaching position.  It's been over a year since I got laid, or even kissed someone for that matter.    I met another insomniac, actually someone I've known for a few months in connection to my roommate.  He's quite my opposite, in so many ways it's a laugh.  I mean, just pick something that I despise and he loves it.  Hair rock?  It's on his stereo.  Conservatism?  He's a big shot in KU's chapter of College Young Republicans.  I bet he even wears briefs.  It's uncanny how faultlessly I pick out the last person in the world I should seek a relationship with and get a big fat crush on him.  I could almost be doing this on purpose.  Anyway, we stayed up all night together on Monday and drank bad coffee, drove all around aimlessly, went to the Capitol, peed at a Walgreens.  The first thunderstorm of the year rolled in as we headed home.  I felt it, the feeling of something weightless at the base of my spine, the beautiful semi-sickness in my stomach.    I don't know if I can take falling for the wrong person again.    And to make matters even more complicated, my roommate used to be absolutely in love with this guy.  She has a boyfriend she's been dating for seven years (she's 22, do the math), but she burned a candle for this one for a year.  I think she will scratch out my eyes if I lay a hand on him.  At this point, I think she wants to thwart the romance, as if I couldn't thwart it myself completely on accident.
