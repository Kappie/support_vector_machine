Like Beatles or Rolling Stones to some people. Our "relationship" began some 3 years ago, thanks to a friend of mine. He played me parts from Scenes from a Memory and that was it. Musically they are almost geniuses, they have total control of their instruments. They are virtuosos, but play extremely well together... In their lyrics they actually have something to say. I've seen them live only 2 times (in Oberhausen, Germany and Provinssirock, Finland) and my third opportunity is next February in Winterthur. I can't wait... But... If I were in Germany, where I used live, I'd be able to see them twice, since they play in Koeln and Dortmund, since the both cities are close to Duesseldorf. Well, better once  than not at all.  Today I'm doing fine, it's weekend! I think I'll manage to do some translation today. My problem is just that the text to be translated SUCKS BIG TIME. So far I've just read old irc logs from #polonhoitoalue, chatted with friends, listened to Dream Theater... I should clean up and I'd like to bake something, before He comes home. Or, I don't HAVE to clean up... I just want to, since he goes to work and I'm at home, although I have work, too... Hmm, complicated;) Well, I just like to make the life of my loved ones a little easier. I know he doesn't like cleaning up.  Well, I'm gonna do something now. Dunno where to start! And WEHEY, the sun is shining! =))
