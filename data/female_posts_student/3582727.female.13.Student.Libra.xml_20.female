Except that I'd probably get sick of fettucine alfredo after a few days. But anyway.  My morning was fairly unremarkable and dull. I sat around at the computer for awhile, doing practically nothing. Then I ate a bowl of cereal. Exciting, I know.  At around 1:30 or 2:00,  urlLink VW  called, and we walked to Bever Park. Of course, we brought enough carrots to feed each of the cows, burros, and goats at the zoo. As it turned out, goats don't particularly care for carrots, but pigs do... Yeah, it's against the zoo rules to feed the animals, but rules are made to be broken, right? A zoo employee was walking around cleaning the pens, and he kept glaring at us as though he were suspicious...but for the most part it was simply funny.  Next, we alternated swinging at the playground and running repetitively through the fountain in the kiddie wading pool. It was pretty great. Boy, do we know how to have fun. Seriously, all of those other crazy people at the real pool, paying about five bucks just to hang around in the crowded pool, especially when there's a huge grey cloud hovering over the park. Brilliant. Why do that when you could be running through a huge sprinkler with the little kids (who kept disrupting our fun by sitting on the fountain. Kids...)? I swear, I'll never understand it.   Yeah, VW and I are great in that we're partially mature for our age, partially childish for our age, and hardly at all like the regular teenager. You know, we care more than the usual thirteen-year-old about political issues and the like, and we have much more serious and less shallow conversations...yet at the same time, we'd much rather be splashing through the kiddie fountain fully clothed than be in the pool with all of the rest of the kids from school, tanning in our tube top bikinis with our hairbrushes and cell phones nearby. And I hope that didn't sound as though we actually own tube top bikinis. We don't.   After Bever, we walked through the rain to the Grant Wood Elementary School playground, where we kinda...stood around for awhile. When we were about to leave, this dog came running and barking toward us. At first we were petting it...then we realized that it was barking an unusual amount, and it kind of looked as though it were foaming at the mouth (it was hard to tell because of the rain)...so instead we ran for our lives. Kind of.   Anyway, we went to my house for awhile, and then we went out to dinner. Oh, dinner. So VW was apparently really,  really ,   REALLY   hyper. She started rambling about the fact that her school ID number--130791--is kind of like her birthday--01/07/91. So she spent the next half hour or so rambling and rambling about how  my  ID number--128425--connects to my birthday--10/11/90. Her logic was very...interesting. I won't go into it here, for it was rather complicated and entirely insane. But I'll just say that I had quite a deal of trouble eating and drinking at dinner. It's hard to eat or drink when you can't stop laughing. VW's great that way.  We came home, and now VW's spending the night here. She called her mom to ask for permission, and she found out that her grandma has cancer in her heart and/or lung, which can't be removed. It's the most awkward thing when your friend starts crying in front of you, and you really have nothing to say to help them. I mean, what was there to say? I feel so terrible for her. And the thing is that I can't quite properly comprehend it all, since I've never really known or loved any of my grandparents. They're just those annoying, crazy people who I have to visit every once and awhile. But I can imagine, and I do care. So this seemingly perfect day ended in a very depressing way.   My kitten's in heat. It's really annoying and kind of gross. And rather amusing. But that's all for now, since VW's still here...I figured it would be okay to update, since she updated hers earlier, but I think I worked on this for much longer than she worked on hers.   Current... Mood: Helpless and guilty Knitting project: Dark blue tank top TV show on:  Daria  on the N Biggest worry: VW's grandma Song in my head: Fefe Dobson's  Revolution Song  Taste in my mouth: That disgusting flavor that comes after eating too much sugar...I just had a ton of jelly beans  Okay. I'm done now.
