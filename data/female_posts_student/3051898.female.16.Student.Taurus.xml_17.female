There's more that I didn't want to add. I don't feel like I've accomplished anything, though. Nothings changed. I think I'm also frustrated with myself because he explained that he does like me even if he doesn't always act like it. I'm annoyed that I seem to be moaning at him whenever I talk to him, which I don't want to do because it will annoy him. I also told him how Laura wants us to break up, and he said it was my own fault for discussing my love life! He missed the point completely... the point was that Laura isn't such a great friend to him as he seems to think and also that if she thinks we should break up he isn't treating me right.  Something else I've decided, I'm going to try to stop talking about Chris. I'll still write about him here... but when tlking to people I'll try to only talk about him when other people bring up his name.  Actually talking about Chris yesterday he told me about how he wasn't happy with life... I could give details but I promised I wouldn't tell anyone (except I was allowed to tell Laura) and Lauren might read this. I feel sorry for him, but I'm still dissapointed that he never seems to consider my feelings... I care about him so much and it often seems like he doesn't care about me at all.  Anyway, moving on, today Laura told me that she's going to go out with her friend Matt! I wish them the best of luck in their relationship... I want Laura to be happy. I know she can annoy me at times, but Laura is pretty safe to me really so she deserves happiness.  Yesterday Alison told me she was really upset... it seems her sister has been cutting her wrists because she's depressed and can't decide who she likes best out of a college friend and long term boyfriend Will. She's been arguing with him a lot lately, and I guess I finally know why. I like Rachael (Alison's sister)... so I hope things become better for her. I hope Alison cheers up, too...  (I would like to say sorry to Alison because I said I wouldn't tell anyone and Lauren will probably read this, but I'm sure Lauren won't tell anyone else and technically I haven't told her, Lauren read it...)  Lisa (can't remember if I told you, she's my sister) is ill today, poor girl. It's only a cold, or hayfever or something, so she'll be fine. I guess I'm just showing that I do care about her even if I do think she can be a right bitch at times.  My mom's losing her hearing in one ear, it's funny to laugh at her and say it's old age, but my mom is worrying it's not old age and that it's some other serious problem, so I've decided to stop laughing at her. It was mean of me to laugh anyway...  Well this is all I'm gonna write (though it's still plenty :P). I want to load on the Sims (which Lauren has kindly let me borrow :D)  Bye for now! ~Hannie xxx
