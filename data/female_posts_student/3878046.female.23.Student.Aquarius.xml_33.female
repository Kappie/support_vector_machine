This perfect love for you deep in my heart, searching for a whisper of returned emotions.  the need to hear that even the absence of beauty can not hold back the love that I deserve.  That even though unlike me, she is the picture of a goddess, the fiery passion hidden in the depths of my soul could ignite a response in you.  Until then I remain an empty vessel, waiting and enduring agony every night, ready to be eased and healed from an ache so violently heavy, that burns here in my breast.
