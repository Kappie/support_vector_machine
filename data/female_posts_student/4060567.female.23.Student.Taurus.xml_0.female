I seduced the boy downstairs the other night and my body screamed it's opposition, its silent protest. It went numb and limp and I stared at the ceiling and talked to it, mouthing words in the dark. I seduced the boy downstairs the other night, at least part of him. The part of him I never wanted, the part of him I hadn't intended, the part of him that came with too much beer and the way my strategically placed hand had grazed his groin. Deliberate, slow, searching. My eyes pled, my words spilt. "Do you like it this way?" I want love love love love crazy love... not this. But I will settle. I will contort and be this broad. This moment. I will put on this mask and move my body in all the appropriate ways. I wil be lithe and you will want me.  I seduced the boy downstairs the other night and I regretted it instantly. I realized as he grew hungrier what I had known all along. I do not want this. Some man, grinding grinding grinding me to a fine powder. My eyes were hard and my body rigid. I do not want this- what I created, what I had ellicited.  He had turned his head, earlier on the porch. He had grown uncomfortable as my projections dribbled from me to a puddle at our feet. We did not speak the same language. He could not understand me and he wasn't interested in learning. He had turned his head and I tried to write it off... write it in words I would listen to. But I don't listen.  I had another beer and sang a song on stage in front of strangers... I seduced the boy downstairs the other night after he told me we weren't on the same page; hadn't been all along when I was at the beach with him, driving long car rides with him, walking in the rain with him. In my head, anyway.  I seduced the boy downstairs the other night but stopped it. Stopped it over and over in one mind-fuck of a dance.... no, again, yes, no, I'm leaving... his hands on my body were just that. I was aware that the mind fuck was ultimately on me. That pleasure of pleasures sake is someone else's construct; not necessarily fabricated, just something that never encompassed me. The words were stamped on my hands as I stared at them over his shoulder- this is not pleasure.  I woke up and my mouth was rough and dry. I looked over at this sleeping guy and noticed the imperfections on his skin. They glared at me like my own faults and I remembered this feeling from some other time, some other bed, some other room.
