Why is it that when you're really bored and want someone to talk to no one is available, but when you're busy or want to be left alone people just come out of the wordwork to chat?  I am so very bored it's not even funny.  I could be doing my homework, however I cannot log onto MCC website right now so there's really little point.  I've tried to call my mom and my friend Amanda, both unavailable.  I tried knocking next door, nobody home.  **SIGH**  I tried to call my sister only to find that she and her less than worth husband have changed their phone number, it's okay, I realize now that Staci would be working and I would have the rather unfortunate experience of speaking to Mark, her husband, had I gotten a hold of anyone at their house.  So now I am left, alone with my two cats -who are totally ignoring me- to ponder my existence.    Kristyn
