That means tomorrow's Friday and THAT means that it's almost Saturday. Which is one more week over til summer. Tomorrow I think the gang's gonna see Connie and Carla tomorrow, you know the one with the women-pretending-to-be-men-pretending-to-be-women. I guess other than that I don't have plans... that's depressing too. But I'll find something to do. BLAAAAAAAAH. Haha yesterday me, Char, Nick and Josh went to the Hazen pool, I haven't been there in YEARS. Since freshmen year when we had to swim in P.E. I'm not the best swimmer in the world but it was fun. We all discovered that my belly button is slightly off-center, as Charlotte so aptly screamed down the hall. THANKS GUYS. I'M A FREAK, JUST SAY IT.
