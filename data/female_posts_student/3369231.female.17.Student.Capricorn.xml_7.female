Ya'll are gonna miss me aren't ya?  Of course you are.  Jessica, Todd, and Robby said that Target will just not be the same without me for a week.  It makes her sad.. I will be without my Jessica....:*-(.  Tear...  Robby still owes me a back massage.  Actually a neck massage, cause if he were to touch my back.. it will hurt a lot.  I am sunburnt.  Chared, very red.  In a lot of pain at the moment.  Jessica and I are so funny together.. I bring out the little munchkin in her.  And that scares the crap out of Robby and Todd I think.  Oh well...life is good right now.  Just waiting for that massage.... :-)
