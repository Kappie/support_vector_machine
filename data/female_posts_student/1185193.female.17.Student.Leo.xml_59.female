It's not like the book is horrible; in fact, it is quite excellent.   I just always get interrupted.  Like I went to the doctor the other day and purposely got there about 15 minutes early so that I could finish the book.  2 minutes after I got there, the receptionist says, "Oh, she can take you early right now."  Great!  Last night I hop in bed, so serious that I was going to finish the book.  I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Reading in bed is a bad idea for me.  Then this morning in my Ethics class, I finished this silent activity worksheet thingy and decided I was going to try to finish the book.  Other people finished the sheet too, and started laughing and talking really loud.  I could not concentrate.  I  found myself skimming a lot of it because of the noisy environment, so I stopped reading.  I really wanted to savor those last pages of the book.    Right now, the house is quiet.  I'm all alone.  Here I go...wish me luck!
