We did end up going to Niagara Falls today, and there we went on a double-deck bus tour through the whole area and took a ride on a boat which takes you right up to the falls. We got kinda wet, so that was fun. I took a bunch of pictures that I will probably post on my blog/profile once I get home, if not a little sooner... Perhaps. Yeah. And we went out to dinner at what seemed to me a Canadian version of T.G.I. Friday's... Except for the fact that they had pictures of various celebrities all over the walls. We actually sat in a corner with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston hanging on the walls... So that was... Interesting. Anyways, that's pretty much it.     Last song I listened to:   Master Of Puppets  by Metallica.    Last album I listened to:   S  M .    Last meal I ate:  Cajun chicken alfredo.    Last movie I watched:   Finding Nemo .    Last movie I saw in a theater:   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban .    Last time I realized I am a band nerd:  I do not know    Last time I realized I am a chemistry nerd:  Don't know.    Last person I talked to:  Absolutely no one.    Favorite song today:   Jump In The Fire  by Metallica.    Favorite food today:  I'm not much of one for sweets, and I don't know exactly what it was, but it tasted like caramel ice cream. Ooooh, that was good :).    Most interesting thing I did today:  Went for a ride on a boat up to the base of the Niagara Falls.    Funniest thing that happened today:  In the restaurant where we sat in a corner booth with Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston hanging over our heads, a fly landed on Jennifer's forehead, and a mosquito landed on Brad's forehead. That was rich :P.
