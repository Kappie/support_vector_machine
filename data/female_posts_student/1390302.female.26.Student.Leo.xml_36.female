Nah, I really don’t think that’s possible, they say its like riding a bike, you can never for get how.  To that I say HA!  I have known plenty of people who have forgotten how to ride their bikes, fall off and get all bruised up, forget that.    So what about all of these stupid sayings, I really like them.  I have to say that I am truly a fan of cliché’s and all that goes with them and I know a thousand of em’  just try me.  Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t necessarily agree with all of them, or even most of them, but alas I still really like them.  A cliché is described by dictionary.com as “a trite or overused expression or idea.”  “What goes around comes around” for instance.  I only believe this one to a certain extent or how about “It all comes out in the wash.”  Cliché’s are everywhere!!!  My favorite were ones derived from the bible, like “do unto others…”    I really have no idea why stupid little sayings about life intreague me, they just do and it drives my hubby crazy!!!  ~Kristyn
