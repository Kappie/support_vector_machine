Every once in a great while one will push me to an edge but that is very rare. Ben you are one of the friends I have never had a fight with and I fineally do and you want to end our friendship over it? I'm not willing to give up that easy. So I tried. But you say you are sure you don't want me around as a friend no more. Long as you know I tried and know I am going to be here for you when you decide you want me in you life. And I will hold no grudge to you. I'll always be your friend...you decide when you want to be mine.
