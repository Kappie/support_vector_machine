But I was crying, and it was no fun.  I can't remember the last time I told her "I Love You" other than on all the mother's days when I feel obligated to, is that a bad thing?  She's not a bad person.  I don't know how to talk to her.  I can't figure out if it's me making myself feel like I'm not good enough or if she's played a part in that.  I'm probably making all this up in my head, I'm a crazy girl.  I hate school.
