Giants went ahead 1-0 in the top of the fourth, when Michael Tucker hit a line drive double to score Ray Durham. That was all they needed, but the Giants expanded their lead when JT Snow doubled in Tucker in the 6th, making it two nothing. The Giants also struck in the eighth, when Barry Bonds hit a double to drive in Tucker and Snow. Bonds went 1 for 2 with a double, 2 (intentional walks), and 2 RBIs. Schmidt getshis 12th consecutivewin (12-2), Aaron Cook gets the loss (4-4).  No doubt about it, Jason Schmidt is the best pitcher in baseball. He pitched a shutout at Coors Field. Thatis unheard of.
