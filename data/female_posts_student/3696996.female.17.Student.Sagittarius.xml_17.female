       
      I just spent like an hour filling out an electronic job application at CVS, it was the stupidest thing ever it askes me a million and one questions about all this stupid stuff that doesn't even matter.  It was taking so long I was seriously about to walk out till I remembered how poor I am.  I need a job so bad...SO BAD. w/e I'm gonna go watch a movie, I'm done
