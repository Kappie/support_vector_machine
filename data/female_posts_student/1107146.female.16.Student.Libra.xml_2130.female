On the other hand, I feel guilty that I wanted her to leave and I'm concerned about the whole safety issue.  Because, you know, I could really protect them or whatever if I was there.  Anyway... bad part, though, is that my parents hired a freaking baby-sitter.  She was writing out what I needed to do while she was gone and what Katie (the baby-sitter) was supposed to do, and looked at it and goes "Wow, this is kind of pointless.  I'm paying her to sleep.  You're doing everything else."  I was like 'hey, good job, mom.  only took you a month and a half to figure that one out.'  So she almost called to cancel, but then was like "I think it's illegal to leave someone under 18 in charge of another minor overnight."  So the baby-sitter still stands.  But she also said I was in charge.  Whatever.  Anyway, I gotta go get dressed.  I'm going to build-a-bear.  Why am I so excited over that?  That's kind of sad...  Oh well.
