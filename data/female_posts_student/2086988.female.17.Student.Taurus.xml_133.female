Waiting sucks ass. I'm so sick of waiting, I want to go now, I want to see my Davey so much. At least by this time next week I'll be there. And then I can just lay in his arms, while he innocently kisses me... :) I love him so much, I can't wait until we're in college together and we can spend all our time with each other...And then after college, we can get a basset hound puppy together! :)   And when the stars are shining brightly in the velvet sky,  I'll make a wish to send it to heaven
