Church was good. I help out in the nursery with the 2-3 year olds. They're usually pretty cute, until one of them starts being bad, but they're young, it happens. I have two english projects due soon. One due friday and the other next monday. I don't have much done for them. I might have to work on that. I've been listening to TLC Crazy Sexy Cool latly. If you haven't got it, but like TLC I really recommend you get it while you can. It's old, but really good. Can't you tell I just lloovvee rambling on? I thougt so. It doesn't really matter to me though, so oh well. Tomorrow is school. I don't know how I feel about that. I'm kind of upset, because I know Mark and I aren't really friends anymore, and even though it is really my own fault, it still kinda hurts. Oh well, it happens. It's probably better for him we're not friends anyway, so at least it's not a lose-lost situation we have on our hands. I'm gonna go do something productive... meh, who am I kidding?
