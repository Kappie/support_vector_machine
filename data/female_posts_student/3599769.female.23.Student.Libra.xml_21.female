I keep wasting precious time on being sad instead of being happy. Realizing you have a problem is the first step...  I feel so ALONE. I wish I could make him see where I'm coming from. Yeah, right. If I would have known that this was gonna happen maybe I would have never allowed myself to give so freely. I want it back now.   I'm so tired of feeling like this all the time. I'm playing "psych myself out" games, in order to restore some kind of mental clarity. There aren't working yet. So if anyone has any new games for me to play please let me know.   I wonder if I have bad karma? I swear I try to follow the golden rule.   Woh, Woh, Woh.
