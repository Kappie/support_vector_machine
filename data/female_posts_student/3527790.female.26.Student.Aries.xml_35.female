I'm not just talking the 50 meter dash to the bush as it is pulling away. No I am talking about all of you who get out there on a regular basis and pound the pavement. Now unlike a "motivational speaker" who told me that you are not a REAL runner unless you run a marathon. I salut all of you who run on a regular basis. Whether it is a 2km or a 42.2 km run! All you you should be proud for pushing yourself that hard to get your butt up off the couch and out into the world.   As a runner I salute you all.  Why am I going off about this. Well recently I injured myself running my second half and somehow I managed to struggle through the rest of it and let support that I recieved from the people who lined the streets and the ones who blew by me as I limped along Made me think about how astouding finishing a race...any race is. It is a very visable accomplishment! so congratulations to all of you out there who have crossed a finish line!
