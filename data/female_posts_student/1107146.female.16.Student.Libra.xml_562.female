I'm annotating the sucker for kicks, it's a job...but it's pretty quick, I'm thinking.   I thought you said you were, I was looking for you but...to no avail. Mind, there were about a million people so I didn't try incredibly hard, but I had my eyes open.  I'm thinking about a template change, not the standard ones that BLogger provides, tho. What do you all think?  Irrelevently yours.
