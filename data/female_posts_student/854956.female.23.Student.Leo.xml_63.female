I'm glad to know I'm in the "normal" category.  ; )  Anyhow, I met this really nice guy in my Texas Politics class.  Don't ask me his name, for I know not this information yet.  I will find out, though.  He's a very well-mannered guy... being that on Wednesday at the end of class he asked if he could sit next to me for class today (Friday).  My response was, "That's fine..." with a nice smile to go w/it.  I've never had anyone ask me a class in advance if he could sit next to me.  It's not like there's always a long line of people trying to sit next to me and I inspect each one denying many and accepting only one.  :-)  Anyway, it was nice to meet a mannered and sweet guy for a change.  He dresses pretty nice from what I've noticed.  Although today I was quite surprised to see him wearing a nice short sleeved shirt, a cap, and a pair of running shoes!  No jacket!  Is he NUTS?!  It's friggin COLD today!  The windchill is like 33 degrees... oy.  He'll probably be sick come Monday... especially if he does that the rest of the weekend.  Anyway, classes were... eh... But yesterday I had a near perfect day!  I was telling Zack about it... and then he asked me what 3 things could've made my 'near-perfect day' even better.  Haha... he's so funny.  I swear, when I read that, I just laughed for a while, because it seemed crazy to ask something like that.  But I obliged him anyhow.    In other news, I checked in on  urlLink Celestial Rose's  blog to find out the verdict of her sonogram.  They were going to try and see the sex of the baby again.  And they're 85% sure it's a girl!  CONGRATS to her and Cole!!!  It's so interesting to keep up with her blog and read about how her pregnancy is progressing and such.  : )  Especially since my biological clock (as well as Jen's) is ticking away!  hehe  TICK-TOCK-TICK-TOCK!      This Weekend    Tomorrow my parents and I are going to my Grandma's.  Tomorrow is my Dad's 55th birthday.  It's also Jamey's 21st birthday!!!!  HOORAY for birthdays!  Anyhow, we're going to my Grandma's in Kerrville, TX to spend time with family.  My Aunt Judy, my Uncle Scott, Kim and her kids (Katy, Emily, and Travis) are all coming over there!  Tim can't come because he has to work... :-(  However, I think that we're just going to have a great time!  And we may even have some snow to play in.  I think it's more probable that it'll snow in Kerrville than here.  But I guess we'll see tomorrow morning.  I'm really anxious to see the kiddos.  I've missed them, especially Travis.  He's growing like a weed... and Kim told me he's saying more words now!  So, I'm pretty sure that tomorrow is going to be a really great day!  Then the rest of my weekend will be spent doing some laundry and catching up on readings, as well as practicing for my proficiency exam in music and related arts.  On this note, I end my blog post for today.  I'll post more after the weekend and let everyone know about the kids.  If I can get some good pics, I may even post one on the blog page in the future... :-)         urlLink  postCount('7Feb2003');
