I owed you, your hug and I got much more than I even bargained for in return. Thanks, I think it's all dissipating. Plus, "I think you're cute." LMAO. The time spent with friends... and no, I no longer feel alone. Don't ask me why I'm finally accepting things so openly. I'm just crazy like that, and you know it.
