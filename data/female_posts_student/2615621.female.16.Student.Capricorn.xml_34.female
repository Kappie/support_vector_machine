I tell him that and hes like "well me and lorne are gonna be there" I DONT WANNA SEE LORNE. He then tells me that lorne REALLY wants to talk to me face to face about things, dammit...not right now, not on valentines day, i dont wanna think about that stupid mother fuckin shit. WELL i tell him im busy on v-day so i cant go. he asks what im doing and i say "what people do on v-day duh" and he asked if i was going to a dance and i said no. he wont stop asking me what im going to do. so then he asks "well who u gonna be with?" and i say "does it matter?--no." he told me it mattered to him who i was spending valentines day with and to a "certain someone" fuck that. fuck lorne. come on lorne!! dont u see, i dont wanna talk to u about "us" there is no "us" there isnt going to be, not after u said the things u said and what i get when i talk to u. NO. dammit. never. UGH GRRRR I dont wanna be in a strangers house with a bunch of guys and then there be lorne--and god knows i dont wanna hang around him, so i would fine someone else (not joe either) and then lorne would get mad and it would ruin the whole thing. i mean, having lorne see me with one of his friends might be entertaing and a ton of fun, but not at toms house, not on valentines day--no, not with lorne period. i dont wanna see him or think about him right now. ugh. why cant  he see that?! he doesnt make an effort to talk to me and when i ask him what hes thinkin or how he feels about things, he doenst answer, changes the subject or says "i really dont wanna talk about it". FINE THEN, we wont talk about it. AND I DONT WANNA TALK ABOUT IT NOW cuz im done with it all..end of story. get it through ur fucking head (even though it is nice to have someone like u enough to chase after u like this...) BUT IM NOT TALKIN ABOUT IT AND PUTTIN ALL THE DAMN PIECES BACK TOGETHER. NO.
