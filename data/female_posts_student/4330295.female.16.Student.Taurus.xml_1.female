I'm ignoring the fact at the moment that I have no idea what I'm doing, and just going with the flow.    This will mainly be used for status update on my fanfiction's and other related things.  Posting random bits of stories and such, nothing too big.  So after this I'm just going to go and see how this actaully works and all that, because me being me, knows absolutly nothing about computers.
