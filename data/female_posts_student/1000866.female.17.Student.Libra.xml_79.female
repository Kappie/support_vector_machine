Yes, very good.  :)  Turn the faucet off baby See we're floodin' the floor now What a shame  Drown the neighbors out baby Our little love tub's out the door No more rap, nor more dub The steam Is almost hidin' you away In our tub of love here I'll scrub all over you and you can scrub... All over me  Just move your leg a bit  And I'll move mine We'll get so clean Our love is lookin' fine  I'm shining now and so are you In our tub of love, life is new We're almost perfect now, me and you.  I really don't take those words in a sexual nature. They just make me think. Sure, they could be meant in a sexual way but, I didn't take them that way.  So, yeah. There's no one right now thankfully I think. I'm kind of glad I don't like anyone. I don't have to feel all awkward around people, and it's just so much more complicated when I do like someone.  I'm really avoiding my science lab. I wish I could have gone to Kohl's with Brandon. Oh well. I talked to Chris on the phone for a bit, and still avoided doing my lab.   I've been talking to Erica a lot the past few days. It's been nice. Anyway...must go actually do homework. :(  Poo.  Bye.
