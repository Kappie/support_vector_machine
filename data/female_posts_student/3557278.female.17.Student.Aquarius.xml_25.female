I SHOULD be doing my extension speech but i'm tired... and blogging doesnt require much brain power. Anywho, i really really really don't want to go to work tomorrow :( I'd rather just stay at home in my PJs and do my assessments, as sad as that sounds. That's what i did today :) But tomorrow i have to work :'( thats really upsetting... but then i'm going to the footy which i probably shouldnt be doing, as i have assessment tasks and i am going to Avoca next weekend. Ah, im so crap. Oh well, I've at least started my extension speech (which is on the bone collector) and we get palm cards. I can't even start the second half anyway because its based on someone else's speech :\ i dont know if i like the sounds of that.  Bleh! The only other assessments i have are PDPHE (taping an ankle, which i can do) as well as society and culture, and i have a fair amount of time to do that. ah boo. So i suppose i'm not so crap after all, i just feel like i should be working on school stuff more... but it seems that (school)work is all i do. I'm running on the spot right now...  ciao (did i spell that right? :P)
