There are going to be three weddings this year, the first is for Mary and Stuart...CONGRATS TO THEM!  Then a couple of Ed's friends...or a few of Ed's high school friends...how exciting.  I love weddings.  I was thinking, I won't even be in a wedding...well I don't think my sisters will have traditional weddings, so...lol  i am SOL on them.  Oh well.  Anyway, I hope everyone is well.
