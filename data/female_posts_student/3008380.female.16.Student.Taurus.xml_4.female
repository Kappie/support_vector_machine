Huebby yelled at me once again! It's starting to upset me! He keeps getting in the way of my social aspects! I'm not grounded anymore...or so I think. It all depends on the way my closet looks (mom speaking).  Whatever that's supposed to mean. Because of all those squats I did on Tuesday, when I walked into Confirmation last night, it looked like I was drunk. Funny stuff. I'll tell ya more when I get home. Chao!
