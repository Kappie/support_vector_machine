I listened to a group of students a few months back argue that the internet should be UNmonitored, based on the idea that the net constitutes a true democracy. Alas, as much as their position struck a chord with my quasi-idealistic side, their argument was partially flawed.    Yes, seemingly, lepers, Palestinians, Israelis, the transgendered, children, the disabled, high school nerds and prom queens and kings are all equal on the net, so yes, the net is a powerful equalizer, yet, if we hope to continue to use the internet productively, it cannot be left entirely to its own devices.  Someone must attend to the practical matters of assigning domain names, which is done somewhat democratically, albeit mysteriously, as far as I know.  And while at first glance the internet may seem anarchic, it is becoming more governed by the day.  Interestingly, in part by the  urlLink Internet Society , a transparent and democratic organization.  Yes, you too, can have your say regarding the inner workings of the internet.  I just joined the Society (couldn't someone have come up with a better name?).  It's free.    Of course, we all know that while democracy is a beautiful thing, it's implementation is usually imperfect.  Some argue that democracy is not always a good thing for any country at any given time.  Initially, as an American, I was baffled by this viewpoint, which is trumpted by  urlLink Dr. Fareed Zakaria  in his book The Future of Freedom (if you get the audio book version, I recommend skipping cd one, at least if you're driving and planning to stay awake - luckily, the book progressively improves).    I guess what I'm pondering here is just how democratic a thing is the internet?  And will the net's democratic nature hinder it as its user population, a population with greatly divergent paradigms, grows?
