This is the most exciting thing I have to report now that I'm back in Florida.  Sigh.  What a depressing state to return to.  Ironically it's cooler here than it was in dc, but my office is paint-fumerrific and I'm once again parked in front of the television because there's simply nothing left to do. I'd rather be sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, watching the tourists and writing poetry that no one will ever read.  Hmm...perhaps going to dc wasn't such a good idea afterall.  Now I know what else is out there, what could have been had I gone to GW, and what might someday be if I don't give up hope and eventually find a job there.  Sigh.  Only 3 months until I leave Gainesville...I guess that's something to look forward, too, right?  The  urlLink DC pictures   should be up before morning if all goes as planned...or at least Part 1.  I have to wait until my credit cards are no longer maxed out before I can develop the other 2 rolls.  More when I'm done playing picture editor.  Tschus!
