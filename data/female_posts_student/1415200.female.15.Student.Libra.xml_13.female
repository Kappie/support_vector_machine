My bandmates and I had.."rehersal" if you want to call it that. Which was very interesting. Band sucked as usual. There's no mystery to that. The only awesome thing is, we dont have a.m. rehersal, so I get to sleep in! WOAH! Tomarrow is our first football game. And we gotta go all the way to that one place..um..Conneaut, that will be very interesting.  I really dont have anything to say. The usual people pissed me off, and thats about it. *COUGH COUGH* They know who they are. If they dont, their even bigger jackasses then I thought.   If something happens, I'll write later, if not, I'll catch you after the game.
