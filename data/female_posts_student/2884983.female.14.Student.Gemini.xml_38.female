Gaia is being an ass so I am going to go read or sleep or something..I want to have another bath but I had one yesterday and the day before and we have limited hot water :| anyways...today was hell because I felt like someone had been beating on me with sticks..and my head and stomach hurt because I am getting sick all over again. I hate Mr. Spratt. I dont know what species he is but I hope there arent any more like it. he always yells and makes us watch boring quiz taking movies. I want to shoot him with a gun full of sporks. *nod*...*I wish my cohorts werent so dumb, I'm not the dumb one, you're no fun..*  I love Lock, Shock and Barrel. and The Nightmare Before Christmas....and Inu Yasha. *more nodding.* A.F.I. I like them too. I have a gash on my hand and I dont know where it came from 0_o  but I do tend to do that alot...we had an assembly today for this group called Determine your Destiny, and it was really good. I enjoyed it. they beat up garbage cans and each other. they also broke bricks with their arms and one guy popped a hot water bottle, which is supposed to take 120 pounds of pressure to pop..which is as much as a school bus tire. another thing they did which looked like it hurt alot was knock this guy off of his stool and then proceed to wrap him up in chains. it looked painful and nothing about it was fake except the punching. goddess my brother is whining again. I hate it when he whines. he sounds like a tire getting the air let out. very annoying....headache...Silverchair is playing right now. the song is Pure Massacre. it is very good. being sick and then playing soccer isnt good, because you feel really worn after. I just got a sudden pain in my leg and it is painful. it hurts quite a bit..oh well. they ran through boards at the assembly, and we got to yell alot. it was fun. lots of people were crying...I dont know why but there was something different about this assembly. it wasnt like all the others that we've had....it was good, and powerful. oh another thing they did was rip a 1000 page phone book in half. we played floor hockey in fit and rec today and I whacked 2 people with my hockey stick..of course it was an accident... :) it really was. wow I have typed alot...more than I ever have before I think....but I think now I am either going to try Gaia again or go sleep....I like to sleep...and eat....and play soccer....anyways ciao for now.   Goddess Bless.
