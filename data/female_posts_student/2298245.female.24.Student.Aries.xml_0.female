I won't be able to post my Thanksgiving wishes tomorrow, since I will be at home, where I have no internet.  I am a little depressed about the holiday, because I will be missing my family, who are 3,000 miles away.  Well, I don't know the exact mileage, but I do know that it's very far and that I won't be with them.  But it'll be better this way.  This way, I'll have a very productive weekend and will not have to worry about getting to spend enough time with my family.  So, happy holidays to all.  Eat lots of turkey and gravy (or whatever it is you do to celebrate) tomorrow, and enjoy football or shopping or just visiting with family, or whatever your weekend may entail.
