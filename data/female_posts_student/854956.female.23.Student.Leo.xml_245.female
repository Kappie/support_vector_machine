I got there Thursday evening, around 8ish.  We watched some tv, and hung out around the girl's apt.  After awhile Ricky and Wolf decided to go to the pool, and the rest of us (Jennifer, Melissa, Brandon, and I) decided to go down to the billiards room to shoot a bit of pool.  Little did we know that the cue stick was going to be a POS.  It had no tip... but we made it work.  After such, Melissa and I went back to the apartment, and Jennifer and Brandon stayed to play a bit more.  Ricky came over to get his wallet and keys, and ended up staying long enough to eat some chicken and dumplings my Mom sent with me.  Then, after showers, we all retired for the evening.  Friday morning Melissa went to work... when she got back we decided that she, Amy, Jennifer, Brandon, and I wanted to go see  urlLink Anchorman .  So, after bumming around the apartment awhile and watching some Chapelle Show, we left around 6ish so that we could go to Target for Melissa to buy season 1 of Reno 911!!!  But it wasn't at the first Target we went to, so she called one somewhere else (near Hyde Park) to make sure they had it.  We went to eat at  urlLink Hyde Park Bar and Grill ... and I must say thank you to Amy Tao for suggesting it!  They have wonderful fries, and my turkey burger was awesome.  After dinner (where Ricky and Wolf joined us for a bit) we ran over to the other Target so Melissa could buy  urlLink Reno 911 , and then went on to the theater.  The movie was AWESOME!  Everyone who likes Will Ferrel should see it!  We went back home, watched a couple Reno episodes, and then Brandon and I went to sleep so the rest of the gals moved into Melissa's room for more Reno.  Saturday Melissa, Amy, and Jennifer went to look at a house with Briana, and Brandon and I stayed at the apartment.  I took a shower, Brandon watched tv.  Then we watched Outbreak (it was on tv)... when the girls got back, we had some grilled cheese (thanks again, Amy) and watched more Reno... Jennifer and Melissa took naps... Amy went to hang with her friend Heather.  When Melissa and Jennifer awoke, we went and got some grub at Taco Cabana... then came back to the apartment.  The boys came over after a bit (they had been house hunting) and we finally decided to go shoot some pool at the  urlLink Union Underground .  It was nice... and good fun.  Even though most of us STINK at pool.  :-)  And it was only $4 a person for 2 tables for nearly 3 hours!  Quality time.  Today was a kinda lazy day... everyone but me left to go look at a house on Eilers... which happens to be Melissa, Amy, Jennifer, and Briana's house for next year.  Congrats, girls!  Then Brandon and I ran to Subway to get some lunch... then were lazy til we left.  Jennifer left about 3:30... Brandon and I left around 5ish.  It was a quality weekend, I must say.  Hopefully we can have more of this during this next schoolyear!  :-)  If Ricky comes to town this weekend, I think we're gonna hit up downtown and check out some places.  Plus, we need a Bambino Huey from the Landing!  ;)  He knows what I'm talking about.... don't ya... BITCH?!  :-)  I'll stop with the bitch stuff... No more Chapelle Show for me!
