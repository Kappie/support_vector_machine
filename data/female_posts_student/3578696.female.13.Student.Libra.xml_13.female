When we got to the fishing place we found a lot of people there who haven't gone home 'cos they wanted to catch more fish than they needed to catch..and sad to say after many tries my relatives didn't catch any fish at all..but i did spend some quality time with my little cousins..i spent the time playing softball and baseball with my little cousin matthew..and that little guy can hit and play good..and also we threw rocks at the mississippi river..that's all i remember about the trip..oh and the best part of all was that i was away from technology and i was able to spend some time without people telling me what to do for a change..that is it for now and i have more stories to tell when i post some more.
