For me, I hate the whole bias regarding time distribution. You get less than a minute for each writing multiple choice while you have more than a minute for math problems. There is something wrong with that, at least for a person with English as a second language.  Oh phoofy, and then I get teased by college promotion letters saying how I could be accepted if I try... um a bit late for that seeing as I will be a senior in the upcoming year. Ah, it's life.  And then I get home, open up my computer, and get greeted with various online news places showing all the articles regarding the death of former President Reagan. And he was one of my favorite presidents during modern US history. I didn't really like his supply-side economics, but then again, I don't like any president's economic policy.
