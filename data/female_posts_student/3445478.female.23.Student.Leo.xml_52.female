I made an incredible dinner of stuffed porkchops, wild rice, green beans  stawberry cheese cake.-Note to self, Shawn  does not  like cheese cake! ;) Shawn had to mow the lawn, but after that, we had the whole evening to ourselves. Nick crashed around 9, which was great! Today, other than Shawn needing an oil change, we have done nothing and it has been wonderful. I absolutely  love  having Shawn here. He even got up and feed Nick at 5 this morning. Right now they are both napping. I can't beleive how fast time is flying. I wish I could press a pause button.
