He asked me if I could handle not hearing his voice for 18 days... how corny can this boy get?  We talked on the phone for a little too long last night, and we had quite a messed up conversation. It was a good one. I'm supposedly getting presents, we'll see if that happens. I still haven't even gotten pictures!  Collin come homes on Sunday, I'm really glad. I need somewhere to live part time.  I'm at Ryan's and he's fighting with me over the computer, he's a punk. He's trying to teach himself quitar and so he "needs" the computer to look up "lessons". whatever..... its my turn. he is in deep trouble now... he just tickled the crap out of me so he could listen to like two seconds of a song. Oh he is so dead later. And he is reading every word of this...and I don't care.  Work was a lot better today. My art friend Aaron Smith works there too, so I was glad to have nice person to work with. He got me a little bit more excited for school 'cause our art class is just gonna ROCK! I'll have Corynn and Jaime and Lance and Aaron and Shannon and Emily, and who knows, maybe some new juniors! And we can all be art nerds together! Oh I love it! But no more Patrick Orr to stare at all period...I don't know if I'll be able to handle that yet.... I might actually have to work instead of flaunt and flirt! AHHH!!! That's sooo hard for me haha  Only about a month left of summer...That really really really sucks. But I guess I will get to see everyone all the time. The school district is still thinking about whether we are going to have closed campus or not. They already decided we have two lunches and they are only 35 minutes.....I'm so mad. I hate the stupid people who decided that we were too irresponsible to be free at lunch. The kids who skip will find a way to skip either way, stupid administrators! Even if you lock us up and put guards at all exits and surround us with barbed wire, the kids who want to leave will find a way. Besides, the kids who don't want to be there, kind have a negative effect on the kids that do want to be there. It's so much more enjoyable without someone complaining and distracting, and just sitting there doing nothing and voicing how much they don't care. And on top of it all, afterr two years of patiently  not having parking and going to a school that looks like a war zone(construction), I think I deserve to be allowed to go to lunch...  On a lighter note, I have Friday off so I'm going boating with the Lovemarks! That's always a good time. hehe
