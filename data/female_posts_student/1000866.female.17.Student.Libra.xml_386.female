I feel like the only thing I was good for was so they could meet and now why bother even be friends with me anymore? I mean, I know its not like that but that's just how I feel sometimes. "Oh, at least so and so is here." OK, sorry I'm not more useful. Sorry I can't ever cheer you up anymore. I'm sorry......
