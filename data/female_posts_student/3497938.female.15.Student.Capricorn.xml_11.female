We met up with Mariah and swam until 3. Then me and Amber took showers and talked and then we straightened our hair and we looked cute. We were craving some chocolate so we went down to the Reefside Grill (at our resort) and ate some cheesecake. Thats where we met Justin, our 22 year old waiter. We talked to him for about 2 hours. Then we left there and met Tyler (14) and Nick (16). We chilled in the game room for a little while and then some annoying girls came in so we told them goodnight and went to bed. Wednesday we went to Islands of Adventures. We bought these Express Passes that let you skip the lines. We went to eat and met this girl, well she was 23, named Lori. She was awesome. We hung out with her all day and since she didnt have an express pass we told the ppl it was her birthday and they let her skip the lines with us. So fun. We got home from there about 9, and my grandmother got sick. We had to call an ambulance. They picked her up around 11:30. I had to fill out paperwork. She and my grandpa came back around 3 am, and then i made sure everything was ok and we went to bed. We got up at 4 pm, messed around and went swimming. We were in the hot tub with Mariah when we met this girl named Kelley. We were talkin about this guy named Colby, and come to find out it was her brother. We laughed about that. We met Travis and Tony and then we went swimming. (We as in me, amber, kelley, tony, and travis.) The kicked us out because it was 10:00 and the pool was closing. We met up with Colby, chilled with everyone until 11:30 and then went to bed. Friday me and Amber got up, went to MGM studios, and then came back, packed, and went to bed. Saturday morning we left for Panama City... thats a whole nother blog. *lol*
