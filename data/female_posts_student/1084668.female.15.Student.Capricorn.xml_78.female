The people speak of them in a generally derisive tone and make jokes about the way AhBengs and AhLians dress, their 'weird' English(usually a mixture of Hokkien and Chinese and English), and the types of entertainment they go for.   Ahbengs like to use phrases like "Wat lah!" , "Ha Nah!" , "Oi!" ,"Happi Lah!" , "On ah!" , "Fight lah!" and "Not happy ah!". If you had noticed, almost every phrase had to end with a "lah!" or a "Nah!".   Furthermore, AhBengs and AhLians like to swear a lot. Phases like "Chxx-bye", "Nah Beh" ,"Ka Ni Na" and "Wa Lan Ah" are very commonly heard.   CHEENA " ..... we do not feel any affinity to the Chinese people ...... The cheena people working in Singapore are really such a crude lot."  ---penned by a 20something year old male Chinese Singaporean and brought up at the NATIONAL DAY RALLY 2001.   Don't get me wrong. Singaporean Chinese are great people. This profile is not meant to stir up any racial disharmony but to disassociate yourself with the Bengs and Lians of Singapore and cheenas. So chill and have fun!   Who I Want to Meet:  1. Non bengs and lians.  2. Non stupid people (cheenas).  3. People who have a sense of flair and fashion (bengs, lians and cheenas don't).    ________________________________________________________________   LOL ! i found tis on Friendster wahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha fwahahahahhahaha its soooo hilarious LOL !~~~~ *faints*    Nobody reads my blog anyway =( HEY IF URE READIN TIS NOW , Y WONT U JUZ LEAVE A COMMENT !?!?!?!?!?!?
