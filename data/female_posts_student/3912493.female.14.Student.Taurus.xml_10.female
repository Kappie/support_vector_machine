Whatam I talking about? In the  urlLink ZeldaPower Temporary Forums , there's a  urlLink forum of Ocarina of Time . Holy crap. There's five members there that just keep the OoT forum alive: Kaden, Goddess Din, Mike (aka Link2004), Groucho, and of course me. =P Seriously, I love those guys. They're just so fuggin' funny, and I just love going there to have a good time. We make a lot of inside jokes, and as of right now there's one of my closet being hell. Supposedly Mike's soul is there, and we just make fun of it and have a good time. If any of you guys are reading this, then I just wanna say that all of you rawk! =D    But tonight was crazy. I spent  8 hours  talking to Mike S. Holy crap! That's like a day of school! O_O If it were a friend of mine like Yaqui,I would have gotten tired of talking to her. But I was talking to Mike for 8 hours! That's insane! We didn't go to sleep until 3 AM. Hehe, funny. Mike just pwns. We kept making inside jokes. I love inside jokes. I have the most with him. Lately we've talked a lot about Metroid Prime (and I've laughed so hard lately with him, too!), and we made an inside joke of the Ice Beam and Plasma Beam. Y'see, every time we get "angry" at each other (we really don't, but we're just playing around) or one of us says something stupid, we Ice Beam or Plasma Beam each other. He uses the Plasma Beam and I use the Ice Beam. It's kinda funny, but of course, no one else would think it's funny because it's an inside joke. =P So if you're reading this, Mike S, then take this! *Ice Beams Mike for no reason* Mwuahahaha! >=D I don't wanna forget this conversation that we had about Metroid Prime (MP), so I'm gonna put it up ("dice" means "says" in Spanish, not the dice you roll!).
