But I like it. I just went outside in the sun and took photographs. Some turned out pretty good.  I am going to go to home depot tonight to get some stuff for my garden! *Excited*  This weekend will be interesting..tomorrow I am going to garden at the church..then guitar lessons...then church.  On sunday..i just have improv. I think I am going to garden alot on sunday, also.  Hmm..I guess there isn't much to say..  Hockinson called and I am number 2 instead of 3.  I think I am going to hockinson next year. Sara might move. :(  I saw Karsen at school today. :) Her hair is getting really long :)  I can't wait till summer. I don't think I can stand school much longer.  Our water line is broken.  And I have to go to the bathroom realllly bad! Ugh! :)  Talk to you all later!  laura fantora
