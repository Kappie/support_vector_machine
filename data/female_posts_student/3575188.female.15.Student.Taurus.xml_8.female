What she doesn't know is that Bertram's Hotel is just what she's looking for. It was a hotel built in the 1800s. And it survived wars and old age without a scratch.During wars the buildings around it all fell but that wasn't touched. Miss. Marple desided that that was the perfect place for her to stay even though of it's pricy rooms. Not very scary ha. Just wait Agatha Christie is one of the best horror story writers I have ever read. You should read one.
