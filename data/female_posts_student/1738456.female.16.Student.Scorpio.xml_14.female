I swatted at whatever it was and adjusted my head on my elbow. I didn’t want to move.  “What the hell happened to her shoes?” I heard another voice say. There was something pulling at my legs. I kicked my legs a bit and continued to sleep. Suddenly I realized just who was standing over me. I jumped away and shrunk back as far as possible.  “You two stay away from me,” I said wishing I had a stick or something. I felt the cold breeze and suddenly wished for a jacket.  “We don’t want you, silly goose,” Hilary said, “Cassandra just needs your pants now, I’ve already got what I want.” She held up my black short-sleeved turtleneck and giggled. I wanted to smash her little piggy nose in, but instead, I covered myself up. Suddenly, Cassandra snuck up beside me, grabbed my hips and yanked. I jumped away and unintentionally out of my pants as well.  “Look here, you two need to give me back my pants,” I stared at them virtually naked. I could imagine nothing worse than Hilary shoving herself into my shirt and Cassandra prancing around in my favorite jeans. Neither one said anything; they just turned and began walking away.   In my head a whirlwind of thoughts processed in a second. I lost my mind, everything in this place had been toying with my patience, all I wanted to do was to wake up in my own bed. None of that was going to happen, so I flew at the two girls holding my clothes and used Hilary for a landing mat. She screamed.  “Get off me!” she huffed flailing her arms and doing her best to flip me off her back. I grabbed a hunk of hair and ripped. She screamed yet again. Cassandra was behind me again, pulling me off Hilary and yanking at my hair. I reached back and wrapped my arms around her tiny waist, and flipped her over my shoulder. I smacked her in the face to give her a warning, and continued pulling at Hilary’s hair. Suddenly, Bob was in front of me, telling me to get off her. He sat down in the lotus position, and closed his eyes.  “Do you mind, my friend, telling me what you are doing?” He breathed.  “Getting my clothes back,” I said standing up. I didn’t feel as self-conscious with him near me. He opened his eyes and looked at me, then shoed the two girls off with a flick of his wrist. My clothes disappeared with them.  “Hey! Now I don’t have any clothes to wear.”  “Material things don’t matter, only what lies within.”  “I want clothes,” I said defiantly. I was tired of his bullshit answers. He stood up, and walked towards me, climbing a set of invisible stairs as he did, so he came face to face with me.  “Well then, wear some.”  “I don’t have any to wear, you just let the two nastiest… …things in the world run off with mine!”  “You seem just fine to me,” he leaned in closer, “but if you insist upon wearing clothes, then just wear them.”  “For the last time, I don’t have any to wear!” I flung my arm up in exasperation, and a dark piece of cloth caught my eye. I stared down at my body, and a slim scarlet dress with a low neckline and short draped sleeves covered my body. My hair had been pulled up, and a scarlet begonia was tucked behind my ear. I still had no shoes. I stared back up at my Bob, and smiled.  “Thank you, I'm much less malicious when I have clothes on.”  “I didn’t do anything,” he turned and walked away, towards the horizon. His legs faded away slowly. His turned around and looked at me, “Remember, you don’t have all night my friend…” he said sadly, and then the rest of his body faded away too.
