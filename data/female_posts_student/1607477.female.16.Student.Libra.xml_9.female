They had him on life support, but they took him off at about 7 pm. We all thought he would die after that but he started breathing on his own and his heart was beating on its own. it was a miracle. but they said it was the medicine which will wear offi n about 8 hours which means he may pass away at about 4 am tomorrow morning. my whole family was there today. and i saw my gfather multiple times. i prayed for him and i prayed with a few of my family members. i am glad they are all christians it makes it easier. but anyways, they took him off life support. God is keeping him here for a reason. I want to know what that reason is but its up to God whether i know or not. There is a chance that by the grace of God he will pul through. but i kidna dont want him to. idont know if that sounds wrong to yall or not. but if he pulls through there is a good chance we could end up back at the hospital again . right nowh e isnt hurting and iwant him to pass away not suffering. he will suffer if he pulls through. i dont know . this whole thing has just kinda hit me real hard. i am likea  time bomb... all my emotions are bottled up inside me ...... there is just so much im yearning to tell someone but i cant do it..i cant do it...i dont know .. i have so much going on its un believable. sometimes i feel like its just whinning and complaining but truely.. thats the only way i know how to expresss myself is to whine and complain. i dont know maybe i need a phyciatrist or someone who knows what they are talking about. anyways.. world changers for sr high will be in atlanta next year which means i get to spend my day off with sunny and alex and john and taylor. im kinda excited. i need to take my mind off things. school starts soon. im kinda glad a/b that. back into the world of studying which is something i NEVER do, but thats ok. whoever is reading this please pray for my family.. they need it.. this is hard on them.. so even if you arent saved just ask God to be with us. and if you arent saved and need to talk to me about anything or even fi you are saved and need to talk to me about anything im here..just ask...even if i dont know you.. but im gettin distracted i will post another time. good night readers Lindsay
