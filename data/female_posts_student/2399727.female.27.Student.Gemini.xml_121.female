I officially went to bed at about midnight after having some odd hallucinatory episode.  I think the Starnoc I took reacted in me badly and I kept blacking in and out and can’t remember what I did except try to program a TV show on my VCR and I thought the TV was talking to me and little kids were laughing at me … very, very odd.  I finally woke up at 6:10 this morning and didn’t try to get back to sleep.  I went over to UC to get a book, Annie Dillard’s “Teaching a Stone to Talk.”  It was well written and she had a few passages about Advent at her Catholic parish.  Amusing but not thigh-slappingly so.  The council meeting last night was like pulling teeth.  Very petty, too much bickering.  I almost moved a motion that everyone just shut up already.  Thankfully the president beat me to it and moved to adjourn.  There were no objections.  Fr. M. went on and on about his weight yesterday.  He tried the South Beach diet and went down to 205, then “ate the whole beach” (quoth he) and is now at 228 again. I literally had to bite the inside of my cheeks not to laugh or smile when he asked me in all seriousness, “Do you think I carry it well?”  Emailed D.  Been waiting two and a half weeks for a response.  Trying   so   hard not to mind-read why (he didn’t like me, he thinks I’m weird, he wants me to go away, etc. etc. etc.)  I did call the office at 9:30 but he wasn’t in.  Did I want to leave a voicemail?  No thanks; that’s what didn’t work last time.  I emailed with a return receipt instead so at least I will know if he opens it or not.   I explained there’s a strong chance I’m leaving May 5 so I need to know if a meeting is possible or not.  I really hope so.  It is just glorious here.  16C and sunny.  Not a single cloud in the sky.  However, even despite my walk this morning, I am totally, completely, hopelessly unmotivated.  It has been 4 months to the day since I contacted C.S. but still haven’t heard back from them.  I need to do a little work to appease my sup. but that’s not in my realm of possibilities today.  I just want to lay in bed, under the covers, and sleep or pretend to sleep.  Normally I’d walk over to St. Basil’s now, but I just can’t bring myself to do it today.  Oh well.  I need to reserve my energy for tomorrow’s crazy, hectic day.  Watching S.O. live for a change.  Susan’s long-lost birth father might be on the line … I have goosebumps.  I can only imagine what she’s feeling!  I have been filling up my listless times with reading S.O. message boards.  The posters are so funny!  I’m disappointed I won’t probably get to see the second season but I live in hope.  Anyway, the posters all seem to hate Rhonda.  I didn’t realize how intense this was!   It makes truly entertaining reading, even if they are reading into personal issues of hers that don’t necessarily exist.   You doing okay E.?   Haven’t seen you online or blogging lately.  More to come…
