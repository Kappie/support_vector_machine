Group One  description: seven mostly cute, straight-edge, soon-to-be college freshmen (except one), one of whom is my  urlLink boyfriend .  reasons why i love them: eight boys + one girl = attention galore. greatmovie-partners, advice-givers, and cuddle-ers. easy to tickle. always a sourcefor good "clean" fun (though all have dirty minds). can feel like i'm corruptingthe innocent.   reasons why i don't fit in: not a guy. i like to, as they call it, party.i have created some jealous tensions, and i have more sexual experience thanten times them all combined.    Group Two  description: five fabulously fun, dare-to-be-different, new york city girls, all except one my age.  reasons why i love them: ROCKY HORROR GAL PALS (equally in love and obsessedwith both the cast and the movie itself). actresses all. intelligent conversationalists.internet trend-setters. seem to feel blessed to have me. best underwear partiesever.   reasons why i don't fit in: they're too damn intelligent. while i maybe up to their acting, i cannot sing for the life of me. i cannot keep upwith their trivia and have not been around from the beginning, and in fact,was hated in the beginning.    Group Three  description: three almost as short, same-aged, fly chicas.  reasons why i love them: goofy as all hell. love categorically girliethings (shopping, boys, etc.). always excited for a night out. have wonderfulsame-size-as-me clothes.   reasons why i don't fit in: they're too damn pretty, and i'm afraidof competition over boys, grades, etc.. i have friends of whom they don'tapprove.    Group Four  description: too many to count riotous alchies and the like. aka, any thing's funny when you're that fucked up.  reasons why i love them: source for any drug, and center for drunkendebauchery. understand a need for "relaxation." parents are always away.serve up cute guys and good times.   reasons why i don't fit in: have drifted away from them recently findingother passions. i care too much about school and am never up on the gossip.   Group Five  description: two i-hate-everything-so-choose-to-be-outcast sorta-punk boys.  reasons why i love them: really chill people with interesting and differenttheories on life. fun to scare people with. good music and movies.   reasons why i don't fit in: rather soap-opera-like relationship withone of the two. i have other friends besides them. i do not hate the worldor myself (most of the time).    Group Six jess  *group order does not at all mean order in my heart  **royal apologies to those who object to being placed in stereotypicalcategories such as these. you have my permission to hit me.   ***there are also some glaring exceptions of which i am fully aware,people are part of a group but who do not reflect the picture of it i havemade. you know who you are. please don't kill me.
