Plus, this Michelle chick is now a member of our website when Ian didn't even ask me if another person can join or not. I thought he was never going to talk to Michelle again either after what she threatened to do. I guess Ian just can never make up his mind. It is always like Ian to flip flop positions faster than the actual situation is made. I don't even understand him anymore, I guess I will just have to have a serious talk with him when I get back on Sunday.  One more thing, If anyone gets a hold of Marty at all, tell him to call me. I don't think his cell phone is working everytime I call him the phone goes out.
