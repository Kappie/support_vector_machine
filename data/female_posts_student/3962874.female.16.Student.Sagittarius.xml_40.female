I brushed my teeth then walked downstairs to my brother and Daniel getting ready to work on my loft! Woohoo. This is good news because, you see, I have this loft in my bedroom at my dad's house and it has been sitting unfinished for like 6 years since we built the house. Who knows why they didn't finish it. But now we are. The process started at the beginning of the summer and the truth is all the boards and stuff have been sitting in my bedroom waiting for themselves to screw down for about a month now. I would do it myself except for the fact that they are 9 1/2 feet long and a foot wide and very thick. They weight sooo much and I can't even lift one. Obviously that started out my day as good. Usually when something good happens something else doesn't. Ann told me that dad would help me pay for school stuff. I asked him and he said he would never ever do that and Ann tried to back out saying that she never said it in the first place. That stupid liar. Okay. No names. Dude most of the time I do have a really bad memory but when it is something like this I DO remember and people take advantage of my bad memory and they say "Oh you wouldn't remember anyway. I know what I said better than you do." My sister is one person who does that all the time. Oh well it's their problem for lying. They're going to have to deal with lies hopefully in the future and then they will figure it out for themselves. Oh yes and there is more news. Dad has tons of harnesses for me to work on all of a sudden. Now I have to decide on working on my loft (which was promised to be finished by the end of the summer by my dad) or on working on harnesses (which is required if I want to buy school clothes. Girls need things like clothes). I really want to work on harnesses because my brother and Daniel don't need my help a lot to work on the loft but there is one problem. Dad forgot to do the first step on the harnesses that he normally does. He cuts off the connectors not needed and I can't do that because I will fuck something up! Damnit now I have to wait till he gets home to work. ERRRG.
