I won't be back until Wednesday or Thursday.  But I will post when I get back.  Today's run 3.3 miles (again) in approximately 30:57.  On Tuesday I plan to run 4.0 miles and 4.0 on Thursday, and 3.3 on Friday.  My training schedule has us running 5 days a week till the marathon.  So I will be posting more often.    Have a great week and train strong!  Look forward to reading all your blogs when I return from Vegas!
