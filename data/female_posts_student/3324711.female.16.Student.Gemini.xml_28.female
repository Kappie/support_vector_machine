Oh ya, I had a reason.. to see if Lauren was on. Well she isnt. Lauren, if/when you read this, I really really need my photo drawing stuff today haha. So Ill be up later to get it. Id call you but unfortunetly Jess is on the phone with Joey.. so she wont be off for a long long time. Which is starting to piss me off but NO I refuse to be in a bad mood.  Proof I am determained to be in a good mood: went to work at 8 when I was supposed to be there for 9. Slit my thumb open with one of the bread knives. Spilled hot coffee on my slit thumb. Worked drivethru. Found out that I wont be camping much this summer as I am working a lot of weekends... Theres more but Im done now.   ON THE BRIGHT SIDE! Im almost definetly [oxy moron thing?] getting dreads now. Turns out they dont care at work sooo its almost a yes. Now I just need to think about it for a while [as if I havent been for the past month..] and see if I REALLY want them. Because I will be putting them in myself. hahaha.. yikes.  Ach, Im getting off this stupid computer. Why must it torment me so?  Shakespeare Style.
