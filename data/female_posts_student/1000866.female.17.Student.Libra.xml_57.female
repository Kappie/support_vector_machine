I've just never known anyone who is vegetarian so, I sort of wanted to know about it. I was just curious, that's all. I hope I didn't upset her. I hope she's jjust having a cranky day or something. Haha, no..I don't hope she's having a cranky day. I hope she's having a great day, but...she seems to be kind of upset. I just hope it wasn't me.
