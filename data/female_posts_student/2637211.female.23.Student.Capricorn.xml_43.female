After Liz and I had decided that our 3rd member had died and must not have wanted to help, I got a message on my cell about how she had sick all day, but still wanted to help out. This still didn't explain why she neglected to respond to any of my emails, and wrote to Liz once... it's called REPLY ALL, people. When communicating with more than one person via email, you should talk to all of them at once, it just saves time. I really think she had no idea which Liz was which, but come on, we have completely different emails and last names. Is it that hard to tell the difference between F and H? Anyway, I'm just pissy, because Liz and I had our presentation all worked out, and now we have to figure out how to add one more person. If she had just responded in a timely manner, than this wouldn't have been a problem. I sent out the first email on Sunday, and the first response I got was on Wednesday night, after I sent a barrage of pissy emails. If you knew you had a project due on Friday, and that your group had agreed to get in contact over email, wouldn't you check more regularly? Bah. Dumb people make me mad.  And after all the stress, I got a migraine after Liz left. I took a bath and some excedrine, and felt somewhat better, then watched the Bachelorette. I went to read in bed, and felt ill, so passed out promptly... so I had to get up early to work on an assignment, and now I'm behind on my reading. I'm going to try to catch up through the course of the day. Blech. And it's super foggy and cold. My bike will be cold!
