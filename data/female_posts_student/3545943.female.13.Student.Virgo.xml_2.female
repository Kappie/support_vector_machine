I was just replying to Siri's comment on your entry "Rather Bored."  Speaking of which, Ralph Nader is a rather obstinate old bat, isn't he?  Oh, I want to see "Farenheit 9/11" really horribly badly.  But it's rated R.  So I won't be seeing it any time soon.  Crap.  But anyway, back to the subject at hand, the Divorce of Responsibility.  Or rather, a tiny fraction of it.  Depression.  Can I argue that the only people who enjoy life are those who are completely ignorant of what goes on around them?  I could, but I will not.  But I do see that it is something of a bell curve, and that there is no point beyond ignorance in which you could be totally without depression.  Cogito Ergo Doleo.  But I'm tired of America's view on depression.  You're sad, have some pills.  The expanding range of mood-altering drugs is insane.  By offering drugs so easily, this takes control out of the realm of the person's own control and places it solely in the realm of mental illness.  There's nothing wrong with most of the "depressed."  America is catering to the wills of its consumers to make more money.  People don't want to be sad, so there's drugs to stop it.  There's a drug for everything now.  America's consumption-based attitude is bringing it down.  All day, America is shouting "Consume, consume, consume!"  Feel bad?  Take a pill.  Can't "go all night," take a pill.  Eat to much, yeah, we'll cure that too.  How?  You guessed it, more consumption.  Drugs everywhere.  Along with ignorance comes more ignorance, such as the Twinkie Defense.  I'll probably butcher this story, but roughly and shortened, there was a man convicted of murder.  His psychiatrist testified that he killed because he was depressed, and when he was depressed he coped with his depression by consuming a lot of junk food, and being an ex-athlete, he knew it was bad for him, which made him more depressed.  Hence the Twinkie Defence.  God, I hate America.
