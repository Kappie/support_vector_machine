Derek Fincham, a beloved 4Her and this year's OMC Delaware chief, is going to be the WVU Mountaineer for the upcoming school year. How cool is that? ...I'll know the WVU mascot.. Wheeeee!!  Haha... Today has been a good day. ...Well, Theatre 3 and rehearsal were somewhat sour because G was kind of mad at me--I miss too much school and when I'm not absent, I'm tardy... Also, rehearsal was in the cafeteria today because the dance team had the stage. Blah...   Anyway, I came in about 5 minutes before first period ended, so I just wandered around the building until the classes changed... I hate first period so much...  I wore my glasses today--for the first time in school since november, at the latest, and I got several compilments on them. Yay... :) Maybe I'll wear them more often...   Right before 7th period was over, Dillon, Kyle, and I went to Dillon's car.... Bah, I can't even do justice if I describe everything that went on... It was hilarious! ....And we nearly got into 3 or 4 car accidents in the school parking lots, two of them because of Cory and Caitlin (Dillon's girlfriend) trying to piss Dillon off... ...*sigh*...Funny stuff...   ...Sorry that this is so jumpy... Like I said, I'm watching "Kingdom Hospital"... It's pretty good...   Rehearsal was fun. Since it was in the cafeteria, I was sitting right in front of where the action was, instead of being all the way in the back of the auditorium, and I was 'talking' to the actors and the flats (you should see the play to understand)... Good stuff...   I'm cold...   ....And it wasn't even cold outside today...   ...Oh! And I walked barefoot outside today for the first time (well, the first time without my feet going numb) since last autumn.  Happiness!
