She shrank back and looked at him wide eyed Promise she purred Promise you won't harm my dreams here He swept up her hand and kissed it gently Causing a crimson flush to spread across her cheeks Of course  he said deeply and with well practice Off they took And she showed him the world of a child The age of innocence And he smiled fiercely and raised his hand to her Down fell the laughter Slashed were her dreams Her land lay in ruins She lay sprawled in the middle And looked up to him with wide, shocked eyes You promised She said in a hurt voice Tears flowing into ash His shadow rose above her And he grinned  And turned his back and walked up the hill back to reality He cast a glance back at her and laughed Didn't anyone ever to tell you? His eyes burned Never trust the Devil
