Me Dani and Nicole had been plannin to drink hypnotic but Tom was home so we were like ok thts not gonna happen lol so were bummed b/c we thought we weren't gonna do ne thing. Then Alex called Nicole and asked her if he would meet her @ CVS he seemed really upset so even though he like pocketed our $$ and he interupted our doritos binge (which we took ne wayz) lol we walked down bein the good samaritians we are. Then like we went to Cisoros and sat inside and talked for awhile and then we decided that we were gonna go to a park and drink the vodka tht Nicole brought and whisky tht i brought. So we went back to Nicole's and while we were goin back Alex was like do you wanna go swimmin, and we were all kinda like umm well like nah, and he was like we can stop by each of ur houses and get ur suits but all of us had straight hair and we didnt feel like it lol so then when we got out he was waiting down the street lol he was like my boy Jay (Jason) is gonna pick us up at washburns so we can go swimming. So, we get in the car and like im thinkin tht like were gonna go to his house or something like tht or like a park u know so next thing i know were headin north on the Palisades past bear mountain and over the bear mountain bridge to westchester LOL, me and Dani were like WTF is goin on lol. And we had been drinkin the vodka and whiskey @ tht point so like lol Nicole had drunk a little too much and at this point she was like is her words "u guys im fucked up" she must have said tht like 4 million times lol. So ne wayz when we get there Nicole is like shitfaced lol so like then we have to hike through the woods LOL and shes like stumblin and like were all like oh god and then we have to go down all these hills and stuff (and all us girls were in flipflops lol) so we finally get to the place were gonna swim, omg it was sooooo pretty. I mean the water was this deep blue color and it was just so pretty, and then i was pissed bc i didnt bring my suit!! lol i thought we were gonna swim in a pool, o well.  So then we hung out and Nicole was bein like freakin retarded lol but we all had a good laugh "don't laugh at me, i dont like it when u laugh at me, colleen when im sober were not gonna be friends" me dani and lex finished up the vodka and whiskey and after i took my last swig of the whiskey i felt a little tipsy lol but i wasnt like sayin dumb things or slurring. Then we get back (me dani and jay, nicole was waaaaaay behind and alex was helpin her) and this cop is like go tell ur friend im gonna tow his car (he had gone back to see where the hell alex and nicole were) so then he was talkin to the cop, he was competly sober but nicole u could just look @ her and see she wasnt. So we got nicole in the car while alex and jay talked to the cop, but omg it scared the shit outta me bc if he had said ne thing to nicole or nicole said ne thing we woulda been in trouble. So we left and it turns out Jay has a really good taste in music, we listened to slipknot, korn, in flames and a bunch of other kool shit. Dark and heavy it was the shit. I personally didnt wanna leave bc i was havin fun and i liked jay he's really kool, but he's 20 so lol he's not gonna go for a 16yr old, but i better not tell tht to nicole. So we went to the texco station and at tht point me and nicole hadda pee soooooo bad lol, i mean really fukin bad b/c i always do when i drink and ive nvr drank tht much. so when nicole went this guy started to open the door and she yelled "ahhhhh im not done" or something like tht LOL the guy was like tell ur friend to shut the door next time lol. It was sooo funny. Then we got this Blue Hawaiian drink and Alex bought it and they didnt id him so yea we know where were gonna get stuff from now on lol. Then Jay hadda get the car back and they ran into there friend who was like gonna follow them and drop jays car off @ his house and then meet us @ lowland park, so they dropped us off there and we ran down went on the merry go round and like drank the bottle in like 2 minutes flat lol, we just kept passin it. Then we wait 4 awhile and they still haddnt called so we decided tht we were gonna go 2 ciseros bc like Dani and nicole werent feelin well... i felt bad. And so i wanted them to eat, so we called them and they were still @ the guys house they were gonna call us when they got closer. Then we ate talked about the day and how it was nothin like we planned and talked about the guys, how alex would b cute if he was taller and like how we all liked jason, but just for the record dani wasnt attracted to him lol... but yea i liked him, he seemed nice and i liked his eyes, and he had good taste in music but he's 20 lol. Then we called them again bc it was gettin later and my dad  and danis mom were gonna get us @ 9 30, and they said tht his friend was gettin in trouble by his mom so we were like were just gonna go back 2 nicole's. So we went back but when we did nicole saw her neighbor and me and dani we in and nicole asked him if he had it and he was like i got u and left so we decided to go out and wait for him so we went outside and waited and took some dumb pictures and yea tht was tht and then my dad came and picked me up. OMG we seriously needa do tht again but next time were gonna do it right and say were gonna sleep over and then just like hang out w/ them later lol. But we came to the conclusion tht we should def hang w/ Alex b4 he leaves and we should def hang w/ jay bc he was really kool. So yea tht was our day sry it was so long but a lotta stuff happened lol...
