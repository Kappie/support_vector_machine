Apparently, the Boys were in NYC today, no doubt on a publicity blitz for their  urlLink new album .   urlLink Gothamist totally scored this pic of MCA and Mike D.  from one of their very own alert, creepy-picture-taking-cell-phone-carrying readers. We all probably mainly sweat  urlLink Adrock  anyhow, but still.    I don't know. Maybe I am just a hater. But I think the Beasties may be eligible to apply to a certain club, of which the following are already members:  - Mick Jagger / Keith Richards (Co-presidents) - Sting - David Bowie - Remaining/performing members of the Grateful Dead - Madonna  - Prince - Aerosmith  ( urlLink Diamond Dave  however, is exempt.  You somehow always remain fresh and au courant, my love. Mwah.)  I of course haven't actually listened to the new album.  But I heard it's all 80s old-school and reminiscent of Paul's Boutique.  That totally works... if it were 1989.  But it's 2004 and I have a sneaking suspision that my former boyfriends don't know what's what anymore. Not good. (Did Pharrell produce any tracks?)    This is kind of like how Prince plays some little snippets of "Kiss" and "Sign o' the Times" or whatever on  urlLink his watered-down new album .  Or how Madonna is  urlLink "reinventing"  herself on tour, and passing out from exhaustion or pulled hamstrings or something every other show.  I know it's tough when you see  urlLink who's inherting your legacies , but dude. It's over.
