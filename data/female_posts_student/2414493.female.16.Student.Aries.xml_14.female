I don't know where this sudden discontent is coming from, but I really need to fix it. From T's profile: "I had the BEST day with P," etc. Granted, I don't even know who P is, and I rarely even talk to T anymore, but it just rubs it in that everyone but me had fun. S skipped classes, E went to moca...and I stayed home and sat on my butt.
