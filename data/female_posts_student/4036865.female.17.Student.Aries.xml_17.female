However, i know it well pass, so i'm just trying to get through it slowly. i'm getting used to working, the time just seems to fly by, and i still feel like i have stuff to do. i'm really surprised that school is starting up again so quickly, it's scary to really think about it, i'm already thinking that i must pull together money to get a yearbook, and such, i just can't comprehend the idea that this is my last year. Then what am i do to with myself? :S Hmm...this is a rather short entry, but i am struggling to think of what to put next. i have been comtemplating things that have happened this summer, and let me tell You, it has most certainly been a crazy summer.  i think i may actually regret some things, and i am afraid of hurting some people, i've been biting my tounge, and waiting for the right moment, but i can't help but wonder, if perhaps my waiting is making it worse. i guess time can only answer that question.
