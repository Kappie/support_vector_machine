It was with all the church youth group. There was about one-hundred people there. So crazy! It's so nice not to have to worry about track. There's more time to do homeowrk. Such a relief. Actually, it's not like I do much homework at home. My 1st period study hall gets didicated for that. Well it's 4:15 in the morning and I am so tired! Ciao
