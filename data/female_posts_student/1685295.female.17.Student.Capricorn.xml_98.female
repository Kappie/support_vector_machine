Didn't have chocolate cake . . . had carrot cake.  Made me remember my birthday. ^_^  Mine was better.  Guy at work figured out I was only in high school today.  Gotta love the awkward moments, huh Dollface? ^_^  Maybe now he'll stop hitting on me.  Suck if he stops talking to me, though - he's one of the few who does (that speak English).  Kitten (uh, Kitten the Third, I guess?) is still at the gas station.  Haven't caught it yet - Conrad's right, I'm filling a gap.  It's really tiny . . . and likes cat food.
