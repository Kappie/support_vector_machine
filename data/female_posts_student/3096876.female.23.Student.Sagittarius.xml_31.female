Saturday, Anil and I had plans to see a movie, I had no idea whether that was still on, since I hadn't really  heard from him since Wednesday.  So I called him and the stupid grumpy-ass boy jerked me around for a bit.  "Fine, whatever.  I can make other plans," Ahh, reverse-psychology.  Did  it work on this stupid boy?  Yes.  Of course it did.  He was at my house within an hour, clean-shaven, bearing roses and hearty-handshakes for my parents.  What a trip.  We went for dinner, it was a not bad meal.  Considering that we had a mini-spat before the night even started, our moods were high and the conversation was great.  He even let me drive his car home, which was super-fun bookin' along on the Gardiner.  But Sunday, that was the day I really cherished.  Anil had to work on Sunday morning, and he was up and about by 9am, so I was too.  Instead of going back to bed as I perhaps should have, I got up.  I tooled around his apartment for a little while after he left, just trying to figure out what to do.  He left me his keys so I could come and go as I liked, and I was damn hungry so I figured breakfast was in order.  Since becoming friends with Ky  Ames, I have learned of the glory of places that serve all-day breakfast.  It's usually pretty cheap, really tasty, and it's just plain nice to have breakfast at any time of day.  I decided once I got dressed that I should take a little stroll down to Hart House on campus and feast on $5 breakfast.  It was such a beautiful day, and walking through downtown at 11am on a Sunday morning, with the sun shining, and Queens' Park full of all sorts of people milling about and doing whatever it is they do there.  The breakfast was... not bad.  The potatoes were a little dry, but they're always the crappiest part of the meal.  Hart House was surprisingly empty--there were probably only 30 people there.  And a wedding party, which I found endless humour in--flouncy dresses like a blue meringue.  Absolutely fabu!  After breakfast I walked back through the Park and sat on a bench around the horse-statue.  Every year, my college, St. Mike's, defaces that statue in its Frosh Week activities.  In fact, it's usually a race between St Mikes and Victoria college to see who can deface it first.  Many is the year that powder blue balloons have been attached to the horses' underside (St. Mikes' Double-Blue!  Hoikety-choike!)   An aside: at the Opera House on Friday, a guy came up to me with the dumbest joke... "Do you know what the difference is between beer nuts and deer nuts?  Beer nuts you find for about $2.50, but deer nuts are under a buck."  Wawka wawka wawka!   I spent a couple of hours just basking in the warm sun and reading my book.  Once I finished it, I went back to Ani's, smoked a huge fattie, and watched The Beach.  Ahh, Leo...  Later when Anil got back from work, we feasted on some chicken Pad Thai, one of my favorite dishes.  Sunday night when I got home, Mona and I went to the drive-in to see Troy.  Not a bad flick, and there is  plenty  of Brad-hiney to see.  Man, that guy spends practically the whole movie with his beautiful bronze buttocks exposed.  Definitely worth the ticket-price!  Uncharacteristically, Mona and I did not in fact talk through the entire movie as we so often do.  Granted, I was just pooped by the time I picked her up, and she was pretty tired too ("I'm old, Margaret," she kept insisting.  Yeah, whatev!)  It was an epic movie, and by epic I mean LOOOOOOONG, but I'm sure Mr Pitt will be getting some nods for it.  To tell the truth, though, it really left no lasting impression on me.  Maybe that was the joint we smoked (Eh, Moaner?   Marijuana affects the memory ...)  If this is what the rest of the summer is going to be like... bring it on!
