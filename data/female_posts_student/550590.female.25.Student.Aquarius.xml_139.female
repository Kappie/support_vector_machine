Bruce and I made plans today for a trip to Washington DC in early June. We've even bought plane tickets and booked a hotel room, so it's official.   In 2 weeks is the series finale of Dawson's Creek, and as sad as I am that it's going to end, I'm excited that it's finally in syndication, so I can watch it 80 times a day like WIll and Grace and Law and Order. I'm a little concerned that they're going to go for the cheesy worthless ending, but in honor of this momentus occasion (Slack Day, that is) Bruce and I have come up with a list of our predictions of the teaser they've been advertising that "One of these 4 will lose their lives." The four they're showing are Dawson, Jen, Joey and Pacey...So here it goes...Naturally, Bruce wrote the dirty ones...  10. Dawson dies while autoerotically asphyxiating himself in front of his Steven Spielberg shrine. Joey finds him with his ET thermos shoved up his ass.  9. Pacey is brutally murdered by Andy when she finds him in bed with Audrey. As she lunges at the bed she screams "If I can't have you, no one can!"  8. Jen overdoses at a party with Jack Osborne.  7. Dawson gets killed in a gay snuff film entitled "Dawson's Crack."  6. Pacey gets shot by the husband of the teacher he was banging back in the first season. He finally found out. It only took him 4 years.  5. Joey is electrocuted in the tub by her "personal massager."  4. Andy shoots Pacey because her dog told her that he's Satan.  3. Jen drowns...just cuz.  2. Joey falls off the ladder.  1. (and this is what we really think will happen.) Dawson dies in a car wreck and the whole series is revealed as either Joey's novel or Dawson's screenplay and the last line is something to the effect of "And that's why we call it Dawson's Creek."   Well, those our our predictions. We'll find out on May 14th for sure. The commercials are showing Joey in a wedding dress and Dawson in a tux, but I'm betting it's a dream sequence. We'll see.  Other than that, just enjoying a couple slow paced weeks until the summer semester starts. 3 months and counting until the move to Orlando and return to school. I've already ordered 2 of my text books online. Yup, I'm a dork. Deal with it.
