He's got a history of high blood pressure but this must be really serious because he went in to hospital. Eugh. My Grandma and Nanny died, so I've only got my two Grandpa's. :( My Mum's gone up to see him. Oh, another thing, I have nits. Woohooo.... can life get worse? Eugh. I have to go try to comb them out now. I'm in a really bad mood now. My Mum can't help me cause she's gone to see Grandpa and I don't want her to be here, she should be there. Eugh. I think I'm going to explode.
