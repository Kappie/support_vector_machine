I also ALSO fucking hate re-re's that won't take hints. *dave, that is not you*  In conclusion, I am taking lot's of people off my buddy list, and in doing that reducing the number of stupid cunts that IM me.   In other news...  It is almost two AM, and I'm still up. I think this is because my sleep schedule is totally fucked up *I really wish it wasn't*. I also need to shower, but have negated to do so up until now. I may do it now...hmmm...it would be a good idea. I like being clean before bed.   *sighs* I miss some of my friends. I've seen Cameron a lot and Andrew, but that's really about it. I haven't really seen anyone else. I should. There's only so much time before we all head off in separate directions. It would be a good idea.   Hmmm...I need to start working and stop being a lethargic piece of shit. It would serve me better to have something to do during the day.   It's only three days a week anyhow *shrugs* I can do that.   I should get to bed.   But my e-life is so much more exciting...
