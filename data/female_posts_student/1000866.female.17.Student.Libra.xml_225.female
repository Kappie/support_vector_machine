I don/t know what's up with me, but I know I wont want to do anything tomorrow because I'll be SO tired, and I know someone will call me, because that ALWAYS happens when I'm too tired, or too...I don't know, anti-social to do anything. I'm going to Joanne's on Thursday to watch Hitch Hiker's since it kind of got ruined last time. Eh, oh well. I kind of wasn't expecting much when I went to her house in the first place since I knew Kathryn was going. I mean, wow, that sounded mean, but what I meant by that was that Kathryn hasn't read the books or anything, so...it really wouldn't have been much fun for her probably. We probably wouldn't have ended up watching the shows anyway, which is what happened. It was ok, since we went walking and to the park and stuff but, eh. Oh well. Stuff happens. And then tomorrow night, I guess Brett mentioned doing something with Erica and Roger. I have no clue who Roger is, but...that's ok. I hope we all end up doing something. I've never hung out with Brett outside of school. I think it would be fun. I really respect him as a person. So, we'll see if we all end up actually going.  Sigh, I'm sleepy, but I can't sleep. Ridiculous. Oh well. I'll just keep typing and hopefully I'll get tired soon. I'm still excited for Michigan haha. I feel like such an idiot, but I am!! I haven't seen Conor in a year, and I don't really know Dan all that well, so it'll be cool to get to know him better, and of course Sara and Lauren, I'm always excited to see. They're fun to be with. And now Sara doesn't drink anymore so I'm even more excited about that! Someone else to hang out with when everyone goes drinking. I still need to call Lauren to make...errr....plans  to get certain people back. Heh. Heh. I met this really really incredibly cool kid today. I would love to hang out with him if he lived around here, but eh. Such is life.   I miss Kelly and Chris. I think it's weirder not having Chris around though. I mean, Kelly, I hadn't had the chance to hang out with yet this summer at all, which I fully intend to change. I've been emailing her everday, well...except the past two days. My emails all messed up. Grrrr! But, Chris...is weirder. Like, it's weirder having him gone. I'm so used to his presence. I talk to him at least once a day, or see him, so...it's just strange to think, "oh I have to tell Chris this" and then not be able to. Hmmmm, I guess being tired makes me write more or something. Hey, I think I am tired! I think I'm going to go try to sleep again soon. I hope it works this time.  I'm kind of confused about some stuff right now, and I just wish I knew what ...I guess, what certain people think of me. Sometimes I really really just....want to know what people think of me, all of it. Good or bad, I just want to know, and other times, I completely fear it. I avoid asking people questions that might make them tell me what they think of me. Heh, I avoid a lot with people. It's really terrible.   Oh, oh!!! I'm going to the DT concert July 19th. I am SO excited. So so so so soooooo excited. I've never been to a concert before, and I get to go to this one with awesome people. It's going to be Kelly, Jim, Alex, Chris, me, and this kid Tony. I've never really talked to Tony before but, but he was in my P.E. Leadership class first semester. He seemed like a cool kid. Alex made me a bunch of CD's, like 10 I think of excellent music. I'm excited to get them from him. He's such a nice kid. :) I offered to pay him for them but he was like, "No!" Heh. I have some awesome friends.   I think when Kelly gets home I'm going to see if she wants to just get together, hang out, and look at Germany pictures, maybe watch Monsters Inc. again. :) Such a great movie. I hope things are ok with Diane now...I think they are, but I don't know. I think I'll call her tomorrow. I'll see what she's doing. See if she wants to go shopping or something. Hm, I haven't been shopping in a while! That sounds fun...:) I guess it all depends on what time I wake up and how I feel. I'm not feeling so great right now. My tummy really hurts. Argh. Oh well. I'm off to try to sleep...yet again. Hopefully this time it'll work! :)
