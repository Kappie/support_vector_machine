Last Sunday, we went apple picking at  urlLink  ~ Quinn Farm ~ , near our home.  We picked 2 big bags.  I made a batch of homemade applesauce for the teacher's gift at Christmas and I will make Apple Pies this weekend for the family.  The house smells soooo nice when you cook apples. I also made 24 carrot/walnut muffins but none for the freezer.  Betty Crocker Move over...  So my freezers is filled with Macaroni Gratin and apple sauce.  The laundry is updated.  Halloween decorations are up and running and Christmas decoration are up next, neatly arrange by box number..  OK I have lost it.  I started the  urlLink  ~ The Sacred Heart Diet ~  since Monday and I have lost 6 pounds doing it.  It is a recommended diet for obese patients before surgery.  On this site you can find all kinds of diets.  I am, for the first time in my life, really sticking with it.  I feel great.  I could loose up to 17 pounds by Sunday.  Even if I loose another 5, I will be trilled.  I will also do it next week.  The more pounds off before my surgery, the better it is.  OK Let's talk BOB....  What is up with Lee-Ann,   we know who the sicko is....  I vote for Meredith.  She has class and poise and she is beautiful.  But I am very unhappy with how they cut out the rose ceremony this week, that sucks.   Mom came over yesterday so we can celebrate her birthday.  We went to see   urlLink  ~ Under the Tuscan Sun ~.   Where can I get a sexy Italian Guy...  Oops already had one,  humm  still remember it too....  It is true what they say about Italian Men...     Ok enough of this...I miss my online and offline friends lately...    Have a great Thursday and..............Be Good
