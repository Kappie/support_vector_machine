I am very much pro-choice, but after going through all that trouble of getting pregnant, and then talking to the stigmata girl, why in the fuck would have have an abortion then.  That was stupid. I think becuase she didn't want a kid with some sort of dissability.  As a mother, it wouldn't matter to me.  Kids are something  you fall in love with as soon as you know they exist. I am thinking the person that wrote the episode could not possibly have kids.  Nice episode thou.  So today I am taking it easy at work, Bought Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (4th book) Prett y good book. I've been reading it all mourning, I am on Chpater 8 by noon.  I know that it is a kids book, but I love the witch  wizard stuff. One of my favorite shows is Charmed. Not much going on today, I have to pick up Camille at 4pm from her dads. She will be a little surprised to see her bed is missing, I moved it when I was moving out, now I have to somehow get back in the next couple of days I am sure she won't mind, since she loves sleeping in the living room watching the big T.V
