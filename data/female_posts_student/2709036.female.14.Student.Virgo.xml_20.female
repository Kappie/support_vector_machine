As we sat, some little children started to gather to, I guess, "attack" us because some boy kept bothering us and calling us gay and stuff. Now, that shows how smart, open, and "simple minded" children around here are. Plus, Son was on the verge of throwing my shoe at the kid. Heh heh, that was after I threw my shoe at Lonzo and started to yell at him about "guys" in general and of how I'm getting tired of the ones around me, or the ones I know, and the ones that seem to have left me. . . I just raged on and on about how they'll only use me, use us, to help them because they can't feed themselves and stuff. Now, I'm pretty sure they can, but at that moment, all possible guys that I was friends with were basically ticking me off^^; And plus, I just had to get a lot out, from thoughts of those who have abused me mentally. . .  But wow, I would just snap out of myself and keep talking and everything was just so "argh." Plus, it's not smart to get me mad, I'm an artist, think of what I'll do if I loose my mind, man0_0. But, it's really nothing, I just started to draw. Drawing can relax me, so of course I was sitting on the corner of a street with two awesome people and was drawing. The thought of it is pretty funkie but the reason why isn't. . . |~*~|Ciao|~*~|
