WHY can't they just stay on ESPN and start early and have some STINIKING QUALITY RECEPTION AND SCOREBOARDS.   ok that is my rant for the day.  YES!!!!!!!!! I JUST FOUND OUT THAT MARIA SHARAPOVA MADE IT TO THE FINALS!!!!!   OH. YEAH.     i am so happy     Associated Press WIMBLEDON, England -- Confirming her reputation as the biggest new star in the game, 17-year-old Maria Sharapova rallied from a set and 3-1 down Thursday to beat former champion Lindsay Davenport and advance to the Wimbledon final.   Playing in her first Grand Slam semifinal, Sharapova hit a stunning 46 winners -- 20 more than Davenport -- to overcome the 1999 champion 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-1. She's the first Russian woman to reach the Wimbledon final since Olga Morozova in 1974.   In Saturday's final, Sharapova will meet the winner of the second semifinal between two-time defending champion Serena Williams and Amelie Mauresmo.   "It's unbelievable," Sharapova said. "I'm in the final. It's absolutely crazy. It's my favorite Grand Slam. I never in the world expected to do so well here, so early. I'm amazed."   The men's semifinals are set for Friday, with defending champion Roger Federer facing Sebastian Grosjean, and Andy Roddick playing 20-year-old Mario Ancic. All but Ancic were also in last year's semis.   When Sharapova ripped a forehand winner off a Davenport first serve to go up 4-1 in the third set, the match was all but over. She held at love in the next game and then broke a demoralized Davenport to end the contest. After hitting a running backhand winner to set up match point, Sharapova stroked a deep return and Davenport pushed a forehand long.   Sharapova looked up at the sky, covered her mouth in amazement and waved and blew kisses to all corners of the Centre Court stadium. She's the youngest Wimbledon finalist since Martina Hingis, who won the title in 1997 at 16.   The 28-year-old Davenport, winner of three Grand Slam titles, said it was probably her last match at Wimbledon. She's considering retiring next year.   "I'd be surprised if I was back," she said.   The 1 hour, 53-minute match featured tremendous shotmaking by Sharapova, who hit 20 forehand winners from the baseline. She also managed to neutralize Davenport's big serve and, despite eight double-faults, served six aces of her own.   "She totally deserved it," Davenport said. "I had control of the match and she took it from me. When I started to have a chance here or there, she always came up with great shots."   The match turned Sharapova's way after a 52-minute rain delay in the second set, with Davenport leading 2-1. After Davenport held for 3-1, Sharapova won 12 of the next 16 points to go up 4-3. She never trailed again.   "From the rain delay at 2-1, from then on, she definitely stepped up her game and from that point on was more in control of the match than I was in control of the tempo of the rallies," Davenport said.   Davenport twice came a point away from serving for the match in the second set, but couldn't break through. In the tiebreaker, Davenport saved two set points before Sharapova converted on the third, striking a clean backhand winner after a long rally.   Sharapova broke Davenport to open the third set in a game that went to six deuces and four break points. She dominated the rest of the way, while the 28-year-old Davenport had little left.   "I lost to someone who rose to the challenge," Davenport said. "I don't feel like I gave the match away at all."   The match was first suspended by rain at 15-all in the first game after less than a minute of play. When the match resumed 30 minutes later, Davenport broke quickly to win the first game. She broke again for a 5-2 lead and closed the set with a 106 mph service winner.   Despite the first-set score, Sharapova showed she would be a serious threat. While the 6-foot-2 Davenport tried to dictate the points from the baseline with her deep, flat strokes, the 6-0 Sharapova often managed to get to the ball and send it back just as hard. She had 11 winners in the set, including three unreturnable forehands in one game.   Davenport, who hasn't been in a Grand Slam final since losing to Venus Williams in the U.S. Open title match in 2000, was making her 11th appearance at Wimbledon. She defeated Steffi Graf in the 1999 final.   "I've had great memories out there," she said. "It's a little bittersweet to walk off a court and a venue where I've had some great victories and great moments in my career."  that is the article of the moment  la la nothing much else to say!  except for:  quote of  the  day!!  Be modest! It is the kind of pride least likely to offend. Jules Renard (1864 - 1910)
