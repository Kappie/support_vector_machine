I hope it will be a nice memory.   Today, the marks of Quantity Survey had posted, luckily, I passed! I am happy because last time, I had bad marks, and for this time, because I want to go and wait for him to leave his works, so I just use 1 day to finish this assignment, then go out to play for 2 days. For those I handed out on time, I got 1 bonus mark because the lecturer had extended the due date, so who handed out on time can have 1 bonus mark.   Last night, I had a nice dream with Gavin and Tim about while we are driving on the road, a police talked with them in Meridian, then I needed to translate to them, but while I am translating, I spoke Cantonese, then they laugh out loudly :-( then I spoke in English again to them. At that time, I also had woke up and laugh for a while!  Tonight, I should have a good sleep and waiting for tomorrow coming. :-)  好緊張呀，快點兒到明天啦。因為明天係我第一次同自己個男朋友去旅行，以前都只係同前度男朋友去過一日的旅行吧了。希望有一個愉快的旅程。  今天，第二份的測量功課有結果，合格呀。現在係澳洲讀書，合格就已經好開心的呀﹗今次我只好了一天的時間便做完這份功課，因為為了同Gavin去街，哈哈。但係亦都有好處，因為教授推遲了交功課的時間，但是如果準時交的話便可以有加1分。無情情加了1分，真開心，可以用來補返上次欠的1分。  昨晚，我發了一個有關Gavin同Tim的夢，係有關我們在路上駕車，忽然有一警察同我們講話，他是說普通話的，跟著我便翻譯給Gavin同Tim知，但我不知不覺地用廣東話同他們講，他們便忍不住大笑 :-( (我便連忙用英文再翻譯多一次。而且在那一刻，我驚醒過來，還坐在床上笑了出來，我也覺得自己百痴。但之後就好好訓，等待著明天的來臨。 :-)
