It has also come to my attention(and the attention of my friends) that i havent really said anything about myself on here so here it goes...My name is Kayla Hosea im 16 and live with my mom,step dad and little sister in North Pole Alaska, im fashion obsessed and hope to make that my future buisness venture in life. ummm...hmmm...yeah ithink that covers the basics  *MissKayla* Ps wonder where the Miss Kayla comes from? Its a nickname given to me by my grandma and grandpa McLean who come up with creative little nicknames for all of us grandchildren mine includ Miss America and Muffin....Just though y'all would like to know
