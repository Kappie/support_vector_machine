"dude, christians can rock as well as the rest of us."... "uhh... ya, i guess so. sry guys." to explain, dave and lane are keeping their relationship secret from the other ppl in their band, but when they were driving thru town, lane's mom stops them and mentions something about dave playing hymns for a christian group and about lane like him. the next time the band got together, the other ppl brought up the meeting with Mrs. Kim. luckily they thought dave was hiding his faith and not his relationship. it was funny. u had to see it to think so tho.  COLD PLAY CONCERT MAY 30. (which is the day classes get out) (but also the fri. before finals) (come on ppl, u hafta relax too) (study on sat and sun, and relax on fri). coldplay is my favorite european band.
