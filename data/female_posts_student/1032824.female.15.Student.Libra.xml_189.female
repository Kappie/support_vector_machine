Me Heart this song!! :)  I'm sure everyone who has seen  50 First Dates  would enjoy it as much as Martini, Simon, Jess and I do. * Awwsh * I can imagine Drew Barrymore singing it already.  Dum-dee-dum!     Jonney , you sure are bored aren't you? * Waves * :D No more lame jokes from you though, I noticed. :( I think Jonney is stressed due to the approaching Chinese pre-lims. Anyhow, I must persevere. I think it would be wasted if I didn't get an A. I'm on one of my favourite chapters now,  dan yuan 2.6  of the Sec 4 shou ce. Haha. I seldom stay up til' past midnight. I'm a hardcore morning person, very unlike people like Jessica, Amily, Jeremy, Yongjie, Geetha and Nana, who can stay up til 2/3am. How do they do it? Friggin' awesome.   **  Wen(1) Gu(4) Zhi(1) Xin(1) :  Gain new insights through examining old material.    Alrighty, I'm gonna hit tha' books. Or maybe I should just head for my enticing bed. I can hear it calling my name. Haha. :) Sweet dreams.
