Chad was trying to get through for like the whole night cept my phone was busy hahah.... cept as I said to Dylan, hes a lot more interesting to talk to than Chad because he actually listens to what I'm saying instead of ignoring me.  Then when I called Chad he was all "I've been trying to call you all night, your phone was busy, who were you talking to?"...."Dylan..."........Then I kinda got pissed off at Chad.. oops but thats cause he was like yeah we're going to the lake tomorrow morning. Oh really kinda like, so now I wont see him till like monday and only then if I'm lucky. And hes all lets go see a movie on monday, okay. I aint getting my hopes set on that cause in all likelyhood it wont happen. And then I was kinda like well your away but I'm like busy the next 2 days anyways. And hes like oh what are you doing... well tomorrow (meaning today in here lol) I'm going swimming... oh who with.... jess and mark and dylannn....you know I hate dylan and mark... yeah well they're my friends... and hes all well if you knew them you'd know why they arn't popular.. and I was like, well I'm not popular either and hes like yeah you are, no, and then he was like well you have me which is just as good. yup.....(I used to think so but lately...erg). Then he's like well what are you doing on thursday, going to the zoo.... why go to the zoo it sucks (this is why I didn't try and see if he wanted to go to the zoo with me), who are you going with...... dylan...(notice a pattern) I think.. he might feel like Dylan's taking over me but you know what, dylan is just a friend and when Chad makes no effort to get together with me then I'm going to make plans with my friends and those ppl include Dylan and he kind happens to be the one that's not busy most of the time lol.  Also picked up our report cards yesterday, didn't do badly, (90 in social, 82 in gym, 83 in math, 86 in science, 78 in french, 78 in l.a., 69 in art)... my dad didn't say much but he usually doesn't, he wasn't mad about art at least, (I was kinda worried about that one... worst mark I got in 3 years at that school.. true by one percent but still.)... Yeah we had to go in for an assembly... it was a really good thing cause Holly was getting her nose peirced last night, was going to at the assembly so she wasn't crying or anything which would have made everyone else cry, so that was kinda good.   Oh well.... but yeah so we're supposed to go to the pool but jess can't make it in time so we were going to take the lrt but her mom wont let her! how stupid is that, my parents would let me ride it alone and she's going to be with 3 other ppl, we don't even have to change trains it just brings us straight there... soo stupid. It's like last year when I wanted her to go to the labour day game with me and she could except then she couldn't because we were going to walk home after the game! meh her mom is wayyyyyy tooo overprotective of jess... wayyyy too.
