However, I don't read those type of internet diaries.   I read the ones with substance.   Like Satpreet's or Marissa's.  But get this: BOTH of their computers are broke and therefore I am stranded without any fun journals to read. OR comments on my blog.   Because thats who commented: Satpreet and Marissa.  Those were happy times.  What? America too dependant on technology?  Nah.   And even though I am going to list what I have to do tonight, that does not mean this blog has no substance, OR that I cadone those that lack it. It just means I am bored and have nothing to talk about.  So, here goes:  1. Get Anastasia's present 2. Go to drug store: get Shampoo, Conditioner  3. Eat dinna 4. Go see Anchorman with Debra (pry around 8 or 9)  I know, I know, I just melted your mind with all that lameness, but as you should know by now, I am lame.  Lame....  hhmmm.. I just like saying that word.  And this one:  SNOOGINS!  ***   WE  CAN  BE  HAPPY  UNDERGROUND
