Its like I was blind and thought I completely liked this guy but now its like "duh sarah, you guys would never work" I feel like I've wasted my whole summer though! I have to make up for lost time. Because seriously today I was like "wow, in order for something to work, both people have to want it and that's not how this is" I just feel so dumb but now I'm like "whoo hoo! I'm a genius again" God, I'm dumb.
