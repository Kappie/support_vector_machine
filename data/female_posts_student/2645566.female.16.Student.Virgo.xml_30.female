So how about scenario #1:  We were supposed to leave for Gatlinburg this morning. Well, since Monday my mother hasn't been able to decide whether or not we are going. One day the answer was 'yes' and the next the answer was 'no'. There was a problem with this. On the second day there, we were supposed to go to the water park. Well, I don't own a bathing suit!!! For goodness' sake I know that that is odd (but in all honestly, mine from last year is too big). That was the only reason that I kept asking her if we were going. I needed to buy a bathing suit if we were! Oh!! And it didn't really help that everytime she was on the phone she was talking to the family that we were supposed to go with! She would sit there and tell Marsha over and over that we were going, then get off and tell me no. What the heck people?! And then last evening she got really mad at me because I had asked her again while she was on the phone with Marsha. Can you blame me? I would kind of like to know what is going on in my life. Arrrr...  Scenario #2: Last night I'm sitting on the couch reading a book and all of a sudden the phone rings. Nothing abnormal about that. The nature of the call, on the other hand, could have gone over a LOT smoother. You see, it was a babysitting call...for me. But I didn't get to talk to the lady on the phone. My mom just volunteered me for the job without even asking me in the first place. What if I had plans for today? Which I did. Well it obviously didn't matter because I had to babysit. And while we are on that topic, I'm going to elaborate. The kids that I have no choice but to watch today, I have watched before. I had no problem with watching them then. My sudden change of heart was due to the fact that their mother never came to pay me. So she has owed me $50 for over a month now. Why should I do her a favor and watch her kids if she still hasn't paid me for the last time? I just don't understand that.  Scenario #3: I have to say that this one is very different from the others. This one makes me sad. Things are great with Paul. Getting better with every day that I see him actually. On Wednesday night I went to his house after my senior portrait meeting. That was so much fun. The power went out and we went to "investigate". We sat on his bed and talked for a really long time about nothing in particular. It was really nice. Then yesterday I went over to his house again. We watched a movie and played with his little brother. Once again, it was nice. The whole leaving thing got me down though. And I know how pathetic that is. But he's leaving for vacation sometime today, and I'm going to miss him. I don't even know if I'm going to talk to him while he's gone...and he's going to be gone until the 19th. Then I have band camp. So in all honesty, I don't know when the next time I will see him will be.   Scenario #4: I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BAND CAMP THIS YEAR!! Not only am I a senior now, but our show is going to be really awesome! Okay, so our theme is pirates (Arrr matey..hehe) and we are doing songs from Pirates of the Caribbean, Song of the Sea Maidens, and something from DCI (Drum Corps International). I can not wait!   And now that I have said everything that I can think of at the moment, I am going to end this post. Sorry if you actually read this...I know that it's almost pointless. I just had to say some of this stuff before I burst. I feel much better now!   God Bless!
