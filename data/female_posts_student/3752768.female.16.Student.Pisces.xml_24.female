Then when he left my mom IMed me and was like so where is Ryan? So yeah...It was gay she might have said yes.Then I was on the computer talking with my other friend Ryan and my Ryan got on my screen name...and I told my friend to tell me "I LOVE YOU" and Ryan saw it. He had done it to me in the past so. But anywaya....        I went on the internet to find somethings to make for dinner for mine and Ryans 1 year (1 week and 5 days!) and this is what I found...SHRIMP ALFREDO! Ryan likes shrimp so I hope he will like it. Iam still trying to figure out what to have for dessert. But it's going to be fun.     Me and Liz I guess got into it agian sorta. She had told me a few days ago that when the whole pool hall thing happened Ryan F. wanted to leave just as bad as she did. So I asked her about it today because I heard he wanted to stay. When I mentioned it she told me he never mentioned it to her and then she put up an away message. Iam real confused about somethings...
