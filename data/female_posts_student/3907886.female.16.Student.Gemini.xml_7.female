It was like he knew exactly the right thing to say to make me swoon. I was captivated by him so much that I didn't even realize it. I started to open up to him. I actually started to let myself go... Which is something that after my last relationship, I swore I would never do again.    When I realized what was happening to me, I suddenly pushed him away. I pushed everyone away.All my friends, my mom and dad, the people at work, everyone.    I gave Adam my love. And I realized that I had given it to other people, my friends, as well.    Giving someone your love is giving them the power to destroy you, yet trusting them not to. The last 3 times that I trusted someone, they destroyed me. I won't let that happen again. So I took back the power. I took back my love. And doing so cost me many friendships. Why do my actions always lead to regret? It seems that no matter what road I decide to take, I'm always wrong.    I guess from now on, maybe I should try creating my own new path. Not some premade one, but a path that is all my own. A path that leads me to happiness. I will pave this path in gold, and never again stray off.    I'm not sure what to do now. I feel so lost, ina forest of darkness, with no light shining through. I need help to find where the new path starts. But I've pushed everyone who knows away! I have to go try to get them back.    Maybe I'll have better news later, or tomorrow...    Good bye    ~Ani
