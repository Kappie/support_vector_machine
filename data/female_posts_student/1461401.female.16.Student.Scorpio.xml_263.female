I felt like that today, when I was walking home. I didn't really want to go home. I didn't really want to go anywhere. I just didn't want to go back.  Everyone's allowed to have a fucking bad day everyonce in a while, so let me have mine in privacy thank you very much.  Ha, I take that back. It's absolutly no thanks to you.  Whoever you are.
