I emerge from a sleep stupor at 11:00am and streach and make a series of sleepy mammal sounds.  I get up, throw on some clothes, and get out "Recent Theories of Narrative" by Wallace Martin.   "Ok Morgan, if you can get through 1/4 of the book you can get online and do a posting."  So I began with the light part.  In the back there are some short stories to give context to the narrative theories that are being proposed in the book.  An urban legend/modern folk tale, some Chaucer, and a light tale called "Bliss" by Katherine Mansfield.  I am in a pretty good mood, having found some way to do homework and still be reading fiction, ploughing through Bliss.  Its not a long story, and I knew that I would be done too soon if I kept up the pace, but the writing was manic-ly fast.  The words skipped along, telling the story of this woman who is so entranced with her life.  She is experiencing the flame of joy that burrows into your collar bone when you are just high on life.  I wont ruin the ending for you, but I will say that I had to go out and have a cigg and reconsider reading unknown fiction early in the morning.   My hyacinth is beginning to come out.  I think that it will be white, but right now the flowers are a pale green that can only be spring.  The smell of hyacinth.  Yum.  Its so amazing, that for me at least, it can border on sickly sweet without passing over.  It is sensual in its nearness to being too much, and when I breath it in I can feel it wrapping my frontal lobes in hot wet sugared air.   This space that I'm in will be a haven.  Sitting at a desk, with three glorious south facing windows opening onto our street.  There will be green, and I can watch the wind and if I sit here everyday, I can watch my plants grow, time lapsed, emerging.   These are not very fluid entries, but who asked for fluidity?  These are just thoughts, and once I press the publish button, or maybe even as I finish typing the keys to make the words, I cease to exist.  Then it is just others, or no one, reading and tying these words into their own view, text, context.  Some would claim that I cease to exist.  For all intensive purposes, I think I would agree.   Three snow flakes just blew past my window.  That must be a signal to leave off for now.  Its winter, its cold, there is no time for out.  Conserve your energy, hold in, be quiet, quieter then keys tapping, quieter then the hum of the black box.  Even that tenuous electric bond is too much.  Its time to travel in, shhh.  The essence of Sunday I think.
