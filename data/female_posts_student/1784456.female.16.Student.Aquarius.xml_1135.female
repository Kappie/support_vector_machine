The fireworks were really good, we stood at the end of Annas road and watched them.  It was sooo funny we saw her nxt Door neighbours leaving and they started talking ot us.  I was slightly hiper and started to pretend to b Irish and they were staying dead serious and i was trying to keep this convo going with me talking in an Irish accent!!  The main problem is all that i can say covincingly is Hello there Father and can I have a cuppa T!!  It was very funny!  Then we watched Popstars and i thought that Mat  (the cute 1 thats gurt lush) was going 2 b kicked out and Anna i nearly started 2 cry which is really pathetic!!  But ot was funny @ the time.  Then I woke up @ about 1/2 4 this morning 2 find that Jenny had squished me up against Annas bed and I couldn't move!  I proptly woke her up and got her 2 move and then fell back 2 sleep!   Then I was on perade at 10:30am lukin brilliant!!   Toodles xx
