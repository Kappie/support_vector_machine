Chris and i have decided to give it a go, i spent most of sat and sunday with him and thought why not, he is very funny and good looking, we watched a video cuddled up on the sofa last night, after spending most of the day up the glen, him playing footy with his mates and me enjoying the sun getting a tan, iv know his mates for about 4 years now so its quite cool although iv only known him since last year.  im trying to ignore the fact that he is only 20, he doesn't really act as if he is but will just wait and see how things get on, getting up early for work this morning was vastly improved by a text message from him saying good morning me lovely butterfly!!! well i thought it was sweet anyhow!!! Hes off back to work tomorrow so im going over to his after work for a while. he works in Aberdeen and is in the RAF(nice uniform). Irene,Angela if your reading this you have actually met him!! he came to stay at mine at uni for the weekend before xmas. dont know if you remember him ?  better go and get some work done!!
