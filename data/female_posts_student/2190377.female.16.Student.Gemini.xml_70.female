AND THEN i went to the mall with ed and his awesomepossum friends... coffeecoffeecoffeecoffee WE PLAYED WARIO WARE THAT IS THE MOST CRACKHEADED GAME EVER.  cool though.  Then I decided I might gauge my ears.. ooooh.    And then it was today.  And we went to the farm and chilled with supersuperusper cool old ladies and talked about stuff and i ate the best peaches of my entire life.  I am so serious. The peaches were better than the cake.  And it was chocolate cake  So today I realized that I am such a friggin dreamer when it comes to my goals.  i was like...   I want to write a book. I want to teach English in Japan. I want to become a doctor. I want to start my own business.    haha so the last one is really an fd up idea.
