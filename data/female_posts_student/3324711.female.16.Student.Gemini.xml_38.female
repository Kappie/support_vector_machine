But anyway at least I got to see her, and we went shopping. And talked. And looked at old pictures and yearbooks and ate icecream, just like the good ol' days.  I was walking her home actually when we decided [well I convinced her] to walk down to the bonfire that Tyler was at down at co op. When we got there who was there but Bryce, who proceeded to run and jump on me repeatedly. I really should hang out with him more often, because I miss him. Hes like a puppy. All that energy... always with the energy.  " Wear the running shoes, morgan.. run home! "  My parents are insane.  Im so tired and I work on thursday from 6:30  AM  [crowpiss if youre Lydia] till 3. But Lauren we're still gonna do something because I miss you immensely and I still need to give you your letter.  And Matt Sheidow [aka Pretty] is going to Ontario soon.. I will miss him, actually I miss him already.  Thats the only thing about school.. theres always so much socializing that goes on with it. Even if youre as anti-social as I am sometimes.
