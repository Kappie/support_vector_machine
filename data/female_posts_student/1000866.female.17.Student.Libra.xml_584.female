If this were more easily accesible, I'd be writing every free chance I got but nooo. Stupid stupi internet explorer. I no longer like you internet explorer. I shun you.   Like how I talk to inanimate beings...?  Wheee.  Anywayyyy, this weekend was pretty good. I was sick for most of it but Friday was nice. I went out to dinner and to a movie with Kathryn. Good times. MC couldn't go though :( Bummer.   Today was pretty good for a Monday. I thought I would have a quiz that I definitely didn't have. :) YaY! And, honestly, that's all that's going on right now. I usually write more when I have something to complain about but right now, things seem really really good. I'm not sure why...
