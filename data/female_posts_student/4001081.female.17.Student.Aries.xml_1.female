We will have a huge bash for your 18th birthday...a sort of "Last Chance to Be a Kid" Theme. Bubbles...Toys...WATER GUNS...anyway that's not untilNovember. We need to go forking before then. Definitely.  Ok so I know this is my first blog so far. Exciting, I know. Not really because I'm watching Men In Black 2...funny stuff.  "Yeah man every weekend you'd be like "Flush me, J, flush me." And I'd be like, "Nah." So I'm not going to pay much attention to what I'm writing. Actually I only have like 15 minutes left to my birthday, so I'm going to enjoy it.  Right...so...I'll be back when I have more to say.
