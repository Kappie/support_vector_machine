How often do people actually part on good terms.  I'd still wanna be friends with her, but anytime I'm at her house, I'd be bound to run into him, right?  So what would I do.  I can't loose a best friend over a boyfriend.  It's not worth it.  And for all those people out there who say that if it is meant to be, it'll happen (-cough-EmmyJustine-cough-), I'm (almost) 16, I'm not looking for the 'one', I just want.... him.... for now at least.  I don't care how long it would last, it's just that when things ended, I wouldn't want the ever weirdness.  I really do like him, but it's not worth the risk.   *NOTE TO FRIENDS* Next time I do something stupid like this, PLEASE TELL ME!!!  This has gone on for how long? 2 months?  And it'll probably continure for a while more concidering that I'm always at their house!  Slap me or something next time.  Maybe, "IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND'S BROTHER!!!"  Yea, I think that something along those lines might just work.  A little persuasion in the right direction never hurt.   I'm an idiot.   (Claude... He's not worth it... You can now rest easy) (Jackass... Thanks for the advice... I guess it takes my sister to get through to me)
