My brother's fiance's boss asked her and a co-worker if they'd like to volunteer to be unemployed instead of waiting because the company's not doing so well. I'm so glad I have my friend Robert to support me with this whole thing. With school coming up, I don't even know if I can handle holding a job and keeping up with my school work. Well.. actually I hope I can, I mean, I have to. I'll just have to tackle it one day at a time. For now, I have to try and FIND a job. Robert's willing to accompany me on Wednesday on the job hunt. He suggested tomorrow but I told him I can't because tomorrow I have a dentist appointment. Well... I have to wake up before 6 tomorrow. So, I'll end this short.
