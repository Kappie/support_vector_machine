So I went to Park to meet up with Meaghan so we could drive to Sinai. I came early so I decided to come into my beloved school and see if some teachers were around. In my mailbox I found yet another english portfolio- when will they stop. Park, I have to say, even in the summer was very alive. Walking up the stairs, I ducked my head from the paper airplanes the boys nearby were shooting across. Strangers walking through my school didnt seem to friendly and that is precisely why they are strangers. Almost always at Park you encounter friendly faces. I chatted a bit with Mrs. Porcarelli and Mr.Howell (who anxiously wants to read my senior essay to see how badly i cursed outCMIC lol). It was time to go meet Meaghan in the parking lot in her sporty red celica. We got to Sinai, took the elevator and got so carried away in conversation that we almost walked into "DO NOT ENTER: CARDIAC INTESIVE CARE". Safely, we made it Jayne's room. Her bright display of flowers were overwhelming to the eye. I was happy to see her awake and doing much better than I had imagined. I noticed, however, bruises on her arms from, im sure, the numerous injections and IV's that were in her. Other tid bits worried me and im sure she felt hasseled at my never ending questions about her health. Meaghan talked to her about the Olympics and friends while I questioned her about how her spine was feeling and why her fingers were so pale.A part of me wanted to hug her tight and sympathize with this immobile life she has been leading for the past week. I don't doubt her full recovery, but, as always, I am paranoid about how she's gonna go to Towson and how shes gonna take care of herself. I worry too much. Her mom and sister were there by her side and she had tons of support. I think all Park Schoolers pray for her recovery and keep her in thought. We love you Jayney- Get Better!
