I feel sorry for Blob (don't ask) we all had the foozles today cause we felt bad for her... Aww, but hey we have to be her friend! I also kind of feel bad, cause this girl Charlotte smokes but now she hasn't got a lot of friends and she's depressed aww... why do I always end up feeling sorry for people? Well, admazing but my life's ok at the moment... I guess... hmm, just waiting for some thing. Check on me in a year, it'll probably be hell!
