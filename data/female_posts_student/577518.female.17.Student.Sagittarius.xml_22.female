He told us about life and  ejek  us a bit, that's remind me about my BM tuition teacher, Mr. Oh. Will send him a e-card later, wonder how is he right now.    urlLink Jasmine  will go to KL in another two weeks because she is offered to be an educationalist(a teacher, I mean). So, she will go to KL for the training for one and a half year, then continue her study in university. We going to have a farewell party for her in Secret Recipe on this Sunday. Goodbye Jasmine, *sob sob*...  There's a Canteen's day in my school next week. And we are forced to order the food from the school. Since I step in to the school, I never eat anything from the canteen. I'm not anti the canteen actually, just too lazy to walk all the way from my classroom to the canteen and squeeze with the students. I prefer stand outside my class and eat my bread with my friends. Now, that's what we call as 'anti-social'. Oh, and I found these two site  urlLink anti-social dot net  and  urlLink anti-social dot org . Waiting for them to update their sites.
