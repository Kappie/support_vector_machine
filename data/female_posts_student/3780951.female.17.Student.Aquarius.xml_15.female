So we're at the bowling alley, i didnt have any socks..along with a lot of other people who wore flops. Well I still had to wear those nasty, but stylish, bowling shoes! By the way, a great b'day present would be bowling shoes..size 11..I know I know BIG feet!!! Anyway back to my story. Caroline Holmes (CH) and Amy Marshall and amanda, and I believe two Chelsea's were in my group. 3 A's and 3 C's. I beat them all I did with my big 76! BOO-YAH :-) ! CH and I put some tunes on the juke box..I picked Nelly's Hot in Herrr and CH picked Mariah Carey some song. Then we got 50 Cent on! It was great fun! I loved every minute of it. Even as I was singing Boston's "More Than A Feeling" to Jamie Beaver. OH YES, what great fun!! But I do think I got some fungus from the nasty bowling shoes!! YUCK!  Bowling, its a way of life!
