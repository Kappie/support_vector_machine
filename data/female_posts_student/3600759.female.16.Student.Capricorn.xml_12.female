My group (Lindsey, Chloe, Veronica, Stephen, Chris and Jordan)   were absolutely the BEST. We all got along SOOO well it felt like family. We all worked together amazing as a team. Here's a shout out to each of you:  Chris:  OMG you are hysterical. I love ya. Ride that HOBY Pony. "Front Front Front my baby, Side Side Side my baby, Back Back Back my baby," I wanna see you get down!  Jordan:  You are so sweet. You are really easy to talk to and I am so glad I got to know you. YOu were there to talk to me when I needed it, you never judged anyone and you always made time for everyone. You are a truly unique person and I am lucky to have met you.  Steven:  WOW your market managing techniques are excellent! You really have a talent, use it to your advantage. I am glad to have gotten to know you this weekend. Thanks!  Veronica:  My buddy. You knew all about my Ethan obsession for at least as long as it lasted. Thanks your awesome. Keep in touch!  Chloe:  You are so sweet! You are very bright and have so much going for you! And the Hoby Pony is a game we just enjoy watching right? Its fun to listen to him sing. I hope Chris knows your name now! Thanks for everything this weekend it was amazing!  Lindsey:  You are one of the nicest people I met all weekend. You have a truly sweet personality. Will you ride the HOBY pony? And Hey you've witnessed very big moments in my life this weekend! Eating a Cheese Burger, and me coming out of my shell and being really loud and Cheering. Chris will always keep us laughing. "Wait is it C-H-O-L-E? Or C-H-L-O-O-E? Oh that's Chloe" ahh one of the many Chris moments! Keep in touch, you are the best! Thanks for everything this weekend.  Kara:  My leader. One of the first people I met at HOBY. You are the greatest, you knew about my Ethan love. Chris always kept us laughing. You got my to come out of my comfort zone and be LOUD (which I will continue to do at home I promise) I hope to keep in touch. Thanks for an amazing weekend!  Mike:  Our one and only JC. Who always seemed to be moving boxes or running errands. But don't matter we still love you! Thanks for everything, keep in touch.     Guys this weekend was incredible! I loved it and want to come back as a JC next year. You taught me how to be myself and not worry what others think. I have come from being shy and very quite to LOUD and outgoing and that's amazing no one has ever been able to do that. You all made me the happiest I've ever been in my entire life. Thank you to everyone who has helped with that. And a HUGE shout out to group P always and for ever the Pink Plumbers! "Get it in the crack and win a prize back" you guys are amazing.
