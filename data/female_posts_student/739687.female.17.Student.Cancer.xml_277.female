And then my blow dryer catches fire.   And I don't mean, it starts shorting out and sparking...I mean it's on fire. Flames and smoke and such. I dropped it, shaking, and unplugged it, and stood in shock for a few moments before thinking to myself, 'Oh, that's right...it's 5/06.'  Yes, lovely.  Oh, and the new Fall Out Boy CD came out today, but Best Buy sucks and didn't have it. Jerks.  Well, that pretty much covers it.  Later crazies. Can't wait till 5/06 is over.
