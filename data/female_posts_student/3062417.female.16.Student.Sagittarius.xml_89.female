My life is empty. I live for the moments I talk to you and yet you always make me cry. When I don't talk to you, I worry, I worry where you are and who you're with. And I constantly just want to be with you and be happy like we used to be. Why can't things just be how they used to be? What happened to us and our plans?   My one regret in life is losing you.   I'll never give up on you. Ever. And I'll wait for you forever. Even if it means being lonely for the rest of my life. I would rather be lonely than with someone I don't truely love.  Why do you always end up making me cry? Why don't you care at all? Do you enjoy hurting me? Do you enjoy watching my heart shatter into a million pieces and laughing as I try to piece them back together?   I love you more than life itself. Life without you just isn't living. If it's not you, then it's noone.  I just want you to understand...   I'M NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT    And I don't fucking care who reads this. Maybe once you know what is going on in my life you will actually realize why I don't smile anymore and why I don't talk anymore. And maybe, just maybe, someone out there will actually care.
