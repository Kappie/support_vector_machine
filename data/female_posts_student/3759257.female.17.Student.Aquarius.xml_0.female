But today...well what an experience! in the Helth reckords dept. They dont do anything, so i was quite fed up. I was gutted actually that i didnt get to see anything. I went swimming after. Lol and i saw Glyn in the pool (waiter from Belle Vue) he's v.sexy, but i think he forgot that his goggle werent reflective like mine, so i could see his eyes, but lol i kept laughing, and typical of me i swallowed some water and started chocking!! aaargh!! lol oh well, made a quick get away, and then basicaly ran to the car to hide!!
