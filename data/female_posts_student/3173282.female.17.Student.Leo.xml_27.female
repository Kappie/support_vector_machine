Lots of people showed up and it was fun. THere were gladiator wars, and i got pretty burnt. Wednesday i babysat allll day for 3 little children who were a handful but i'll be seeing alot of them this summer. Whitney is cute :) Ever since then i have done practically nothing. Except sit around and watch tv and movies such as Kill Bill(which sucked) and Pretty Woman. How exciting. I wish someone would give me something interesting to do! I can't enjoy the great outdoors here because....there is none. York, PA sucks....let's drive to Baltimore! *Hehe* Oh i did get my belly button pierced and it is hotttt to the double maxx and today i got a new shirt at hollister. But i think its too small! Some things dont fit inside the shirt that should, and that has never happened to me before! Muhahahaha. Well i'll be going now, buh bye.
