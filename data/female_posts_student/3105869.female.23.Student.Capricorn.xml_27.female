Yes Yes I have seen it on the map, BUT it is also the name of the province, sooooo is the airport in the city or the airport of the province.  HAHA Tuesday could get really interesting, REALLY interesting.  I have fallen into my I don´t want to do anything, A.D.D. state again.  I have only taken 1, yes only 1 final, and I am already feeling quite sorry for myself.  No, the final was not particularly bad, it was more like just another thing I didn´t FEEL like doing, I would have preferred reading Crime and Punishment by the pool, yes the book has been sorely neglected of late.  I also don´t FEEL like writing my take home exam.  The question:  "What did you learn in my class?"  is a guise for an actually trying and difficult question.  It, on its face, seems to be simple, but IT IS NOT.  The answer: "Nothing."  or "Not much."  I have already questioned Maloy about.  He said I should write more.  haha.  But they all keep saying, "there are no wrong answers."  Well, heck, I should get my Pass (vs. fail) from writing "Not a whole heck of a lot." Okay Okay I am not going to do that, you all know I have probably been freaking out as usual over just another stupid test.  Actually I have been compiling notes and trtying to boil down everything.  So I pose a counter question, how in the world do you boil down Bankruptcy chapters?  Uh there are lots of chapters for lots of types of Bankruptcy?  No, okay I´ll try again.  Um the chapters are all odd numbers, wait no, thats wrong too, ch. 12 is the only even numbered one.  Okay, oaky, you don´t call bankruptcy bankruptcy anymore, its not P.C.  Okay, but I was never actually told what to call it now, so I shouldn´t say that.  Um, Bankruptcy is bad don´t do it?!?  Uh you can liquidate, or reorganize, which although there seems to be a distinction in what takes place, are still both bad and should be avoided and stuff.  Okay.  Uh for debtor-creditor, uh we are all sometimes debtors and creditors, simple, ahh, but that sounds too simple like Playschool toys, primary colors, simple.  I dunno.  My notes have been compiled from outlines and notes into a notebook of boiled down junk I barely know.  But I have to fit my treatise on bankruptcy stuff into the confines of one bluebook.  How can this be done?  I am at a loss.  This is way more challenging than I thought it would be.  Unfortunately I am trying to get it written today.  SURE.  Other than that the Laundry put black spots on my white stuff, and so I brought it back and told themt o fix it and that they should then deliver it to my hotel as I would be entirely to busy with finals.  Well three days later after calling it arrived.  Ahhh, assertiveness is beautiful.  Speaking of, to my family, everybody needs to give Mim a big pat on the back for standing up for the people in Brighton Gardens and being assertive in pushing for change.  She said I would be proud, and yes I am.  It seems like my years of, "But I want both outfits."  has taught Mim to push for things she wants too.  Good progress, keep going, but enxt time threaten suit or to bring it to the attention of WOAI news and the changes might become permanent vs. temporal.  Good luck.  So has anybody seen my boyfriend?  Yeah, me neither. haha.  Hey A., if you get this Blog,  how are ya?  Alive I hope?  Doing well?  Had a birthday?  Yeah, well ya´ll keep your eyes posted for my MIA boyfriend.  Shucks, well I hope my parents house doesn´t flood AGAIN.  That would be a bad thing plus when it rains, Mom´s best friend Hank comes inside, since our dogs are wusses that cower from raindrops.  Good luck with that Mom.  My advice:  When in doubt, you have the key to my house, and I´m still renting my own room, so I can use it as I see fit since its mine, and I see that you might have a fit from everything, so just remember its there if ya need it.  Love you tons. -R-
