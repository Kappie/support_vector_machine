I have an idea of wht i did last week here goes my attempt to recall it.. ok so last sunday (not this one but the one b4 tht) i went over to Dani's and i slept over we walked 2 Hoyer's and then that Monday i went over to Kat's house w/ Dani and we watched an a classic movie (not gonna say which 1 bc then ill feel dumb lol) and we sang karoke and caught up... then Tuesday I hung out with Dani, Tory, and Dave... we went to Tory's house and I got my ass kicked @ super smash bros and then we went to the mall and saw King Aurthur which was soooo oboring i was so pissed b/c i like King Aurthur stuff but this really sucked lol... then i hadda come home early b/c i was supposed 2b home @ like 6 and it was 9 30 oops lol... so tht was a fun day, then on wednesday i went and hung out w/ Nicole @ my house and we talked for hours and my sis drove her home (yes she passed her road test) and then the next day i wanted to tt Dani b/c i didnt think i was gonna c her till after i came back so we hung out @ my house and then the next day i went swimming @ my aunt and uncle's pool and saturday we suprised dani by showin up @ her house b4 she left and said goodbye and then i went to the mall w/ Nicole and got my itrip thing for my ipod.. its AWSOME!!!! and then yesterday i was in Long Island for a BBQ and today im gonna hang w/ Nicole... i really cant belive tht i rememberd all this stuff... wow i must b bored lol so thts pretty much wht ive been up to for the past couple of days... later
