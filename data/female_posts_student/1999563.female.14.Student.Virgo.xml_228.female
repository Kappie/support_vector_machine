THAT was scary! Matt goes "Look Laura, Dan is here for yoouuuu" I was scared.  We got a new seating aragment in SPANISH. I sit right next to ERIC and ZANE!!  AHHH!!!  Eric talked to me like the whole time so mrs. teacher kept getting mad at him.  Then Evan came voer to us an d started talking about hot supermodels, sex changes, and other REALLY bad thigns which I shall not post in my blog.  Eric kept saying "Your a fag." to Evan so I was like Okkkaayyyy.   Then we were talking about asking a ugly girl out to eat (It was a spanish exercise...)  And Eric goes "Why would I ask a UGLY girl out?" and I was like "Maybe she is nice!!"  And he was like "Who cares if she is nice!"  I was like okkkayyy.   I better go stuff my face with many yummy cookies.  Love, Laura   P.S. Did you hear Eric tell Marc "make your move!!" when you were around?
