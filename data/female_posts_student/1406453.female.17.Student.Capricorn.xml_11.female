Next year I will be in Rm. 455 of Anderson (South) Residence Hall.  This hall is known for its Greek Chapter floors (no Greek housing in D.C.), for parties, and for frosh.  My roomie Ivana and I will be sharing a double room with private baths down the hall.  Here are some cool facts:  AU Dining Assoc. says:   "There are six residence halls on the main campus, all of which are air-conditioned and within close proximity to classrooms, dining facilities, Bender Library, the Sports Center, and the main Quad. American University recently completed a multi-million dollar residence hall renovation project, and each hall offers a variety of comforts, including television lounges, complete kitchens and laundry facilities. Every room on campus is connected to EagleNet, offering access to free e-mail, campus software packages and the internet. (Note: Ethernet cards are necessary to access EagleNet.) Every room has individually controlled air conditioning and heat, and free cable service."   Every floor in Anderson is coed... *wink* *wink*  More info to come :)
