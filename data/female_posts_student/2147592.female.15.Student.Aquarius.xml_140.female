Today I went to church, it was cool, Cally decided to tell everyone how much she loves me. It was embarrassing. Then Nips and I came home. Now we're talking on the internet. TABBY AND NIPPSIPUFF ARE GOING OUT! It's a great day... chat to you later folks. Love you lots like (as Tabby would say) pork chops... xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
