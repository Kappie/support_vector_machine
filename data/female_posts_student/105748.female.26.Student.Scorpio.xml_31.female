I only liked the cadence of the banter of one of the clerks, and, yes, those scenes are unforgettable. But I didn't think it was funny--just weird.      Charlie's Angels was indeed goofy. I thought it was funny. I also loved the soundtrack cuz the music reminded me of my youth. I can't believe I used to listen to Motley Crue. I also love dance movies. Gladys has the Save the Last Dance DVD. We love the audition scene (the music for that was great! the R mixed with the orchestra music--nice blend of classical and soul).  I even watched an Australian foreign film about a ballroom dancer who wanted to win a tournament so badly and a Japanese foreign film about a man who took ballroom dance because he was lonely. Yes, I'm corny.      I could not send you an URL with my section if I wanted to. The only way you can read it is if you press "random" and by luck you find it OR you know my dairist name OR you know the age I put down OR you know the location I put down OR you know the name of my diary OR they feature it on the "recent entries" OR I'm the Editor's Choice (most unlikely).
