Fuck that. I was an awesome friend and she knows it. I bent over backward for her and for Ryan. But you know what she rarly did a damn thing for me. So I just want to say that Liz Waltrip is a backstabing minipulative 2 faced girl at Sachse High School.     So fuck her and friendship. I have a better friend and her name is Ashley Vickers. She has been there more for me in the past 9 months I have known her closly then Liz was the past 2 years we were so called "Best Friends". I love you Ashley! hehe... Well know I now who my true friends are...    It seems to me that I always get hurt when it comes to good friends. I dont know what I do. I am an awesome friend to people who need me or to my friends. It seems like all my so called "true friends" stab me in the back. The one though that prolly hurt the most was my all time best brother and my ex. so called Best friend Ashley Aiken. I wont go into detail about it but...Wow...that one hurt the most....    Oh well...seems like Liz is another Ashley Aiken maybe they should be best friends they are both backstabers...
