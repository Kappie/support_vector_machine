What bands does everyone have for frosh week?! Les gets Finger Eleven....*which i am o0o0ber jealous of*, and the Trews..and I get Billy Talent with Three Days Grace.  not that i am complaining because i super like Billy Talent, but Finger Eleven would have been sooo much better! Anyways yea..who does everyone else get was the original question before i started adding awnsers in there..hehe
