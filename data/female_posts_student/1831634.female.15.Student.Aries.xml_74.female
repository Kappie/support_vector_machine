I have allergies.  the allergies decided to act up.  my nasal passage is so freaking blocked; it's worse than US 75 during rush hour.  I seriously cannot breathe through my nose.  at all.  not even a bit.  it's like suffocation here.  then my throat is sore as freaking heck.  so I'm breathing through my mouth... and my tonsils are swelling like no other, and they're getting dry, and I start hacking away, and that requires me to force air through my nose, which just pushes at the wall of snot and ends up doing nothing but making my throat worse.  so I lay in bed for about... 2 hours doing this.  I slept at 2am, which is really 3am, so I was doing that until about 5am.  then I decide it's hopeless and go down to tell my parents.  they go get me some medicine.  it doesn't help.   so I come back upstairs and decide that sleep for tonight is totally 100% impossible.  so I decide to do homework.  not very smart.  I drip snot all over my papers and have to run to the bathroom every 10 seconds to wash snot off my hand.  it is super gross.  but I manage to finish reading humanities, nonetheless.  and then I debated starting on GE.  decided that snot would make the pages of the book stick together.  better not attempt that just yet.  So I lay in bed for a few more minutes.  perhaps half an hour.  decide that lying down just makes the snot roll around in my nasal cavity, so my nostrils take turns getting more blocked up than the other.  not very fun.  at times, both are so congested that it's like, oh em gee, I'm going to die here.  so I get up and read some crossroads.  then I decided that if sleep is impossible, I may as well get online and see if I can untangle some of our film.  so here I am.  with a congested nasal cavity, a red, sore nose from all the times I've tried to blow my nose, dry, ucky skin, a sore, itchy throat, no sleep, no food for 10+ hours, a headache, and chinese school in 5 hours.  I just love my life oh so much.
