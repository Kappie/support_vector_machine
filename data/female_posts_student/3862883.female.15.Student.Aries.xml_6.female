Capt.Willard didnt' judge Kurtz, he just followed his mission from what the machine said. He was only thinking about murdering Kurtz, and when he was murdering Kurtz, he didnt' think anything, he was nonhuman, he just acted like a machine. If Capt.Willard had judged Kurtz, maybe he didn't kill Kurtz, he would judge in different way. Even he succeeded his mission, there is nothing left. As I think, even thoughI got mission to murder Kurtz, I will not follow the mission if I don't want to, becuase I know it's not right thing to do.
