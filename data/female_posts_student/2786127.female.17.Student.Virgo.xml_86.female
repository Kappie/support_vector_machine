This vacation was so needed for me, I needed to get away, to have fun, to not worry about things like TIM and NATE and SCHOOL...all i had to worry about was fighting off all the hot guys working at Disneyland. :)   ...but seriously, there were hot guys.    I had such an amazing fun time at Disneyland with Genie. God how can you not have fun being at the happiestplace on earth with your best friend? We were pirates and princesses and absolutly out of our minds drunk and we had so much fun. Atleast I did. God I wish disneyland was closer. We made so many awesome new guy friends like Steven the pirate and Ryan the underground recluse and Kerry, Genies waiter/lover.   wonderful.  More later I need to go run around and stretch my legs, they're about to fall off.
