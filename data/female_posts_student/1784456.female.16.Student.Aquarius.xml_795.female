Ok, ok, so I jumped in the adverts before it! (I always do that!) I really should stop doing that... Any way it was really cool and no, I'm not afraid of spiders after it... although I'm kind of freaked because I'm all alone at home... and I came home and all the lights were off! Major AARGH factor going on! I'm better now... I put Metallica on and the phone's by me. Not that I'm expecting massive spiders or any thing... AAARGH! GET IT OFF ME! Hee just fooling, I wouldn't really have time to type that if I was being eaten you know! (Oh yeah, 'Excuse me, Mr I Want To Eat You, Spider, sir, could you wait until I post this and then eat me? Oh really? Thank you, be with you in a sec.') Wow, that's one nice Mr I Want To Eat You, have I met him? *groan* Any way, I found this!  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/020829/80/d8gsn.html  Geez, they must be getting desperate for news! And for all you still at school this is for you - HAHA SUCKERS! Hehe, just spreading a little festive spirit! Bisi!
