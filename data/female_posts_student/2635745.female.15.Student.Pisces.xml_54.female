I had a lot of fun, but when I got home I found out my mom had a heart attack at 9 am this morning.  I didn't know what to do, so....I called Ferrell.  He understands the relationship between my mom and I more than anyone else.  I couldn't stop crying.  It was so embarrassing.  I don't know what to do.  I'm going to Starbucks tomorrow, but I'll need a ride to and from there.  And I apologize in advance if I'm not my Speed-y self, but I feel the need to get out.  But Spring Day was fun today, but I still can't bend down.  Erica just in advance, that is how people act at away tournaments.  You only get a couple hours of sleep in 2 days and you just go crazy.  Well now off to put lotion on my face.
