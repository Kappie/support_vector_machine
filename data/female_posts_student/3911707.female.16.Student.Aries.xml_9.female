So, being a doll, I just called him around 11:30. He answered and seemed excited to talk, and I asked him if he forgot to call me back. He drunkenly admitted that yes, he did forget. No problem! But we continue speaking, until the point that he has to hit on a female, and then inform me that he did, as if I'm deaf and didn't hear it myself. Hey buddy, your phone was still ON when you were hitting on her. So I sarcastically said, "that's nice." This leads to him telling me, ONCE AGAIN, that he "can get any girl down here." every time he drinks, I hear that. The next day, or maybe even right after he says it, he'll say he's sorry. He'll make up for it by telling me flattering things, and calling me his baby, his girl, hunny, or sweetie. I envy his roommates. I'd love to be there with him, at least one night. But instead, I'm just a girl, back home in Wisconsin. I wont see him until December. And outside of the fairy tail I'm living, I'm nothing but a good piece of ass to him. Maybe a good friend, good listener. That's all. I'm just an all around "good-girl" to him. The perfect girl. The one who would date him, and yet allow him to be with other girls. Because that sweetness, fake or real, makes me feel special. I don't really care if it's fake, I love it. I never hear anything nice said about me...mostly to my face. I'd rather be lied to and flattered, that told the truth and feel ugly. I'm a little pissed at the fact that I asked Pat to call me tonight. I understand that he works 12 hour days, but it doesn't take that much fucking effort to call and talk for a little bit. Asshole. And he wonders why I get so cranky and pissed off. Maybe I blow it up a little, but dammit, YOU'D BE THE SAME WAY IF I DID THAT TO YOU. Motherfucker. Sometimes I seriously feel like I want to pop him one right in the face. Maybe that's not why I'm pissed. Maybe I'm not pissed at all, just upset. Upset at the fact that I'm alone, and am not worth committing to, apparently. A year and a half spent trying to win his heart, and I'm still alone, hurting, crying.
