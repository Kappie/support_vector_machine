Everytime exam time comes around, that joyous season of studious cramming, I find myself buried in my books. Am i actually studying? Well, for some of the time I am. But its at these moments that I start thinking, this is really silly. lol, ever feel that way? A whole 4 months have been spent building up for the one day where i will spend 2 hours trying my hardest to remember every little detail that crossed my path in those 4 months. then i leave, and forget it all. ever feel that its completely pointless?  But one thing that I notice everytime . . . God uses these times to show me how much I have been ignoring him. Its the really stressful times that I hear his voice, calling me to spend some time with him. and I can choose to keep on mindlessly studying (in one ear and out the next) or I can choose to commune with my best friend. lol which would i rather do? strangly enough . . . I often don't pick hanging out with my best friend. ironic isn't it? we would rather bury our noses in the books, then listen to god. we would rather get good grades, then be on good terms with god. we would rather rejoice in our success, then glory in his love. it baffles me.  so on life goes . . . and I must hit the books again - but not before I go take a moment to renew my mind over a talk with my best friend.
