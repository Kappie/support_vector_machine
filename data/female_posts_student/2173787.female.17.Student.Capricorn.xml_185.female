I can't find something good enough for me to want to keep onto for a long long time.  Those that I would want to hold onto are too expensive and not nearly resilient enough for a life with me.  So instead I write in transient little notebooks that I then lose.  In a lot of ways my relationships with journals are very similar to my life.  I don't make lasting ties and commitments get forgotten.  Wow, that's pretty depressing.  I'm going to go drown my thoughts in a quart of watermelon.
