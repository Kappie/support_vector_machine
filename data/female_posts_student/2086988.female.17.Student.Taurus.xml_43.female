See, Em wanted to go get some ice cream because we were going to have a movie and night, so we drive to the store and Chris meets us there. Well, we hang for a bit, get the ice cream then leave. Chris thinks it's a cool idea to follow Em out to my house and while he's driving he's going into the other lane you know the one with head on traffic, and really it was a bad night to be driving period, foggy, rainy, slick, you know. Well I was playing around and I locked Chris out of my gate, because I was already in enough trouble with my parents about leaving, I didn't need a guy following us home.   So he jumped the fence and came and gave Em a kiss. It was cute and all. They really do love each other alot, and I know she wants to be with him again, she just doesn't like all the drama with him, plus he parents would kill her too. But anyways we get back to my house, getting ready to watch movies and Em gets a call from Chris, he's had a wreck and he doesn't know where he is, so he wanted us to come get him. Well, then I had to explain everything to my dad about what happened and he wanted to come too, but he waited a bit. Well, since I know all the back roads and stuff back here, we found him fairly quickly, his car 200 feet out in the field, stuck between 2 trees, and he crawled on the way out to the road. I felt so bad for him just laying there, shaking. Some people stopped and called 911 and my parents came, and I sat next to him and talked to him trying to get him not to go to sleep, because we figured he had a concussion and that's the last thing he needed to be doing, while Em was talking to the people and police. Finally the ambulance showed up and we left. Then I got a huge lecture from my parents in the car. They were blaming the whole thing on me and Em, since if we didn't go out and get ice cream, we wouldn't of met him, he wouldn't of followed us out there, thus not getting into a wreck. Ok, yeah well number 1, he didn't have to follow us period and second he could of just went back down the main road back to the highway besides going down a dark, gravel, twisty road at night, in the fog and rain, I mean seriously people use some freaking common sense. Plus, I made another point that if I didn't go with Em she could of just gone with Chris and it would then both of them could of had a wreck. But of course I have a "bad attitude" and "no respect" so I get grounded and only get to drive my car to and from school, hey I was going to get everything taken away, car, phone, net. But I calmed down and apologized and realized where my parents were coming from, so I only got that. But my mom told me that if I do that one more time, the car goes period. So I'm going to be good, plus if I'm really, really good I'll get to go at spring break, so it's all good. The only reason I was really yelling at them last night, was because I was defending Em and myself and I didn't need all that, especially after what happened.   So I was really upset, like to the point of crying and I usually don't cry easily. I just wanted to hide under my covers and just make everything go away, I just wanted everything to end. But then things calmed down and I talked to David and he made me feel alot better, so everythings all good now :) If I didn't have him to talk to I probably would of resorted to my old ways and of done some stuff, but I don't do that anymore, yay! I've been really, really good. Whoa, its been exactly 2 months!!! And we've also been going out for 7 months exactly today, lol and also it's a year since I first registered at the millnet, whoa weird!!! That is whack! lol...    When you say that I'm one of a kind Baby, I don't see it but you believe
