Considering this is my second update today already I will save the update about tonight's meeting for tomorrow. Hopefully I will not be able to update all weekend because I will be away. Either in Worcester or in Boston. Sunday, however, is Marie's graduation party. Which, as seeing that I am missing the graduation itself on Friday, I would not miss her party. I think that did not really matter because we have Friday and Saturday, not Sunday.  So, back to what I wanted to update about. 4.5 hours of school left! 7:45-9:45 Chemistry and 10:00-12:00 History. I am not worried about either. Chemistry a little bit, but I suspect it should be fine.  Okay, yesterday I was sitting at Dunkin Donuts drinking my orange coolatta right? Well, an elderly lady, an' I mean the elderly lady you catch in Vegas with her catty friends, comes in. Leopard pants an' all, baby! Then, following her is her normal, seemingly down-to-Earth husband. Figure that. Well, she brings their stuff to the table right next to me. Of all the open seats, she goes to that one. Their stuff included a newspaper and crosswords.   For the record everyone, I hate having my back to motion, and will tend to sit with my back to a wall and face out a window because I enjoy watching the people and cars go by. BDunkin Donuts is great for this because it faces the pike and I set the sun through the massive windows, which there are three in front of where I sit.  This lady proceeds to go to the windows and begins closing the blinds! I figure, oh well, she is only doing one. Then she moved on to the next one. Okay, a bit irritated. Then I looked to the third window and thought, oh...hell no. She did it, all three. As she seated herself with me giving her a bizzare look, she smiles and says hi. Then she sits and begins to complain about the toughness of the donuts.   A message she will not receive but was running through my head: Look, you are not at home. You could sit somewhere else or put your back to the window, however, right now you are infringing upon my rights. It is 3 in the afternoon...and you expect the donuts would be fresh?   So on and so forth. It was funny when I was rambling it all out in the car.   For some reason that was frustrating.  Any thoughts on this?   TuRbOfReAk05:  if death is the greatest adventure ion life, then whats the sence of living?  TuRbOfReAk05:  i mean what is there to live for>  Jaenen6:  I do not believe hat death is the greatest adventure in life, so I cannot answer that  TuRbOfReAk05:  well lets say it is  Jaenen6:  Then your other adventures in you life may not be the greatest, per say, but they are still worth having. Along with for the people in your life  TuRbOfReAk05:  are they really?  Jaenen6:  I believe so  TuRbOfReAk05:  Do you really know who you are?  Jaenen6:  Yes  A bit odd. Whatever. I have to run. Meeting tonight.  Me amo ti mucho, siempre, Matt! Tengo ganas de menos de ti! ::hugs::
