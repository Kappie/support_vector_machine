Lots of assignments needed to be handed in by tomorrow and I've done nothing. I dont care anymore. Im going to hand in only on Monday. Come teachers, chase after me. Mwahaha. Im insane. Totally.  Life has been goin pretty well lately. Filled less with ups and down. I suppose the ups and downs of life made life a littlemore interesting. I should thank god for them. I really should.  Been thinking alot lately, since when i dont. Ha. Realised a lot of things. But well, I'm pressing on. Wonder if its good or bad for you? -scatches head and starts to let my mind run wild-  Reminiscene of what narene said just now in her convo with *, made me think of lots of things. Do i hold a place in your heart? Do you know I need assurance? Do you know how much I care for you? But But but... Im not looking out for an answer.. Cuz like I've said a thousand times, You have all the time you want. I mean it. Cuz I luv you.  I'm having Social Studies Test tmr at 7.40am.  I should be sleeping now but Im not tired. This is absurd.  Then again, Imgetting boredwith blogs.
