She made a black and white copy and looking behind her back just in case anyone was looking. It looked like she was so afraid for her life.  She came up to the counter to pay for her copy and the article was about how muslims were hurt too about the World Trade Terrorism.  She thanked me for the copy and left the store so fast like someone was going to attack her.  I felt a sad that she would be so afraid just to make a copy.  In the news, an american drove into an indian owned store.  I was shocked at what people are doing out there.  Just because they are muslim doesnt mean that they are necessarily bad. May God protect these innocent people.    Net
