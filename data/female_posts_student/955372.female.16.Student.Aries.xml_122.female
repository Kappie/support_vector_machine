Alright so my dad comes home and he's like "why didn't anyone shovel the sidewalk" and gio's like "well mom was sick" and then he turns to me and is like "what about you, you sat around all day and didn't even bother to shovel the sidewalk" i'm like "i was at madeline's all day" and he goes off mumbling shit to himself, and then later like half and hour before we were gonna leave for the hockey game that he promised he would take me too two WEEKS ago, he walks into the living room and says "i invited john crane (one of his friends) instead, is that ok?" i'm like "surrrrre, why not" and it was all because i didn't shovel the fucking sidewalk. Like oh because i didn't shovel the sidewalk your gonna be pety and give my BOX SEAT to someone else. Can you get anymore fucking childish, its like alright and you call me immature, i'm 14, you fucker, your 45. JESUS CHRIST grow up and act your age. And then my mom DEFENDS him, she's like "well he doesn't feel apreciated" i'm like "oh poor dad, he had to walk through a little snow to get to the door, i feel sooo bad for him. Just because he thought we expected him to shovel the snow doesn't mean we really did, so if he jumps to his own dumbass conclusions that his problem not mine." and i was gonna freak at him today but he's not even here, he's in chester or something for work. Thats right, run little man. Run.
