The lead role was so hott, I couldn't get over it! But what sucked was that the movie was made in 1986, which meaas that the hott guy is way too old for me...so I can only dream...What really sucks tho is when you watch old movies like The Outsiders and one of the characters (Sodapop) is really hott, all you can do is dream because the movie is really old which means that the actor is way too old which means that you'd never have a chance with them anyways!
