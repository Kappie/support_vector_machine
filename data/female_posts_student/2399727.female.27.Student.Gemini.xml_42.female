I met with the same fellow who ran both of the career seminars I took over the past month instead of the woman who I met with in late January.  That just caught me a bit off guard having to explain everything again.  The results were:  (1) He pointed out that along the counselling interests I had identified, I only selected one counselling type of job -- the chaplain role.  Why hadn't I considered addictions counsellor or career counsellor or corporate trainer (I have no idea what this is yet) or social worker or things in the medical arena -- speech-language pathology or occupational therapy or etc. etc. etc.?  Good point.  (2) He also pointed out that my training options were university-centric and I needed to explore options at colleges as well.    (3) Another point was that the same degree might lead to different choices -- for instance, one of the career counsellors in the Career Centre has an MDiv and isn't a chaplain, so I should be alert to different ways of getting places.    (4) Finally, he pointed out that my ability to make decisions is not strong (duh...flipping a coin didn't impress him, lol) so I need to pare down my choices by using my values (ranked in order of importance,) etc. to come up with the best options.  In the Quaker community, decisions are run past a board of advisors.  In this scenario, I would say to people I trust, "This is what I'm going to do" and they are not allowed to comment or make suggestions.  Instead, they may only ask provocative questions to help me figure out what I am still being blind to and ultimately make the right choice.  I was also accepted for the internship.  I will find out by April 23 if they could find a placement for me or not.
