I know where to go to confirm the fact that in the Warsaw ghetto there were 7.2 people per room.  and how many bodies they crammed in Auschwitz at the peak of production.  twelve thousand a day i have to check and re-check...  and did i dream that at 4pm on the 19th January 58,000 emaciated inmates were marched out of Auschwitz.  ... i can remember people's conversations and what someone's wife said to someone else's husband.  what a good memory you have people tell me.  ( I keep forgetting by Lily Brett, quoted from Hilda Schiff  Holocaust Poetry  )
