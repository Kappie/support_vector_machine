Had a tricky listening comprehension exam this morning... followed by an interview by the ex co. of chess club.=X Hope that everything went well. hee~ Anyway, had a nice lunch today with my friends. It was a dramatic one though... with lots of climax in between. Firstly... clumsy Fz here spilled some barley onto her skirt but luckily the material is waterproof! So not so paisei... haha... then I accidentally bumped into an old Auntie behind me when I turned around to 'peep' if my friends were still behind. Wow~ this 'accident' had a great impact on me... I bounced up immediately... upon this collision. haha~  Besides this, I just returned from a gathering at Pasir Ris Park "Fisherman Village"! Had a sumptous dinner...although the food were quite expensive, but guess it's all worth while. In fact, this mini congregation was specially organised to welcome my friend who came back recently from Australia! Yu Yan... I miss ya man! haha~ not much changes... she's still as jovial and easy going as ever. This friend of mine... we know each other since pri.school days! wow~ so tonight is a 'childhood' friends get together session!  Had lots of fun and laughter... At around 8 plus after dinner, each of us bought a drink and attempted to climb onto the 'breakwaters'... haha~ this was the funny part... as usual we made lots of noise and ended up being the "BRiGhTeSt" lightbulb there. hehe~ became a nuisance to the couples who were enjoying the scenic view and doing some star gazing... when the sky is quite clear tonight. haha~ after a while, we decided to get down that platform. As usual.... clumsy ppl like us were all in slippers and we had to 'slide' down the breakwater one by one. ahaha... we looked like 'country bumpkins' man... This commotion we caused had resulted in 1 couple leaving the area. This shows that our 'wonderful' presence is greatly felt! -_-" hee~ Then... we decided to settle at another corner of the park... facing the beach. We chatted all night long.... had many lame jokes and shared different experiences in school. Goodness... I laughed whole night long... guess I have lost some voice. Oops... better keep quiet and rest my voice box a while before it deterioriates! hehe  At about 10 plus, we left the area. On the way out, I actually noticed a sign board reading "Beware of falling coconuts"!!! ahahaha... I nearly fainted upon reading the sign! Goodness me... such 'lame' signs do actually exist. The evil thought that someone would be hit by a falling coconut... keep replaying in my mind! gosh... it will be really funny to see such a thing happen! haha... of course that victim will definitely not be ME!  Anyway... when we were approaching the bus-stop just a few km before.. we saw the bus! Then we decided to catch the bus... so all of us ran like a mad person being chased by a dog! We finally got onto the crowded bus... and throughout the journey, the bus was driving at top speed... guess the driver wants to get home in time for a rest! haaha... in fact such a scenario reminds us of the times in pri.school when we had school excursions to the Science Centre! hee~  WoooOo... today's outing is definitely an enjoyable and unforgettable one! AS i always say... CKpS6A'99 rocks man!!! Luv you guys lots~   * Everytime I miss you... a star falls. So if you see the sky and it's all dark...It's your fault coz you made me miss you so much..." ;P
