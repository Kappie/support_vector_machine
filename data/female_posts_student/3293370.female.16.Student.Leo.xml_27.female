FOR GOD'S SAKE, DON'T DO IT!!! Your own intuition is probably the most accurate feeling ever - Don't get too attatched to anything/anyone because eventually, it/they will walk out of your life as quickly as they walked in - What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger - If you pull through, everything will be ok in the end - There is an easy way out of everything shitty, but the tougher road has so many more rewards - You will never be perfect - Sometimes, friendships are better than sexual relationships - You just have to shake some things off - Forgive, but never forget - Tequila's disgusting - Friends come and go, but there will always be a few AWESOME ones that stick around - You know they're a keeper when you can tell them anything and they won't pass judgement - The greatest things show up in the most unexpected places - Sometimes, all you need is a good hug - Even the shittiest days have something good to them - When life is just sucking major ass, you will eventually reach a point where you can't go any lower and things will begin to look up - Life is never stable, everything is always changing - People (and their morals) CHANGE (not disappear), even you (and yours) - Sometimes it's easier to talk to a stranger about your problems - If you've made a bad first impression on someone, it's veeery hard to redeem yourself - Life is so much easier when you're not trying to be somebody you're not - Change isn't always bad - Don't turn the wheel too far when turning or you'll hit a boulevard - Things aren't always what they seem - Everything happens for a reason  So a lot of these things contradict what I'm doing now. For example, I know I'll never be perfect so why do I keep trying in the most wrong way? I don't know. I've learned all these things, but for some reason I keep trying to change the facts. So yes, I know all these things are true but I just don't want to accept it.  On another note ... still just trying to be me. Trying to find my place in the world. Kinda lost. Kinda ok with that.
