I will just say it to the whole world that i got an "A" for my grade 6 flute exam!!!! I'm so happy!!! Seriously when I think I have nothin more to worry about, then here comes the gala concert...grr that stupid scholarship. ok the whole story begun when i went to this scholarship thing as my TEACHER just put me in without my response and unexpectedly get the scholarship. And there's this tradition where every year there's this huge concert where many people go to watch ppl perform and that scholarship winners have to do a solo!!!!! I'm so bastard!!!!! Man i hate it when this happens...its always like this....anyway i think i've whinged enough for one day!!:P
