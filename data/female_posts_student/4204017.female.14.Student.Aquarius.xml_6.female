Later Jessica picked us up and we broke a few laws on the way home..speeding..GDL..you know, but it was fun lol cept heid had to pee and was being super annoying about it lol.  well when we got to the Circle, me Heidi and Hayls were standing there and we got the brilliant idea to sleep at Heidi's, well me and Hayls got the ok from our parents but HD's mom said no...did we listen? of course not. Me and Lowmo snuck into Hi-D's basement and stayed there in the dark until Joanne and Gordie went to bed..haha it was super fun. I love those girls with all my heart.
