Freedom of Speech    [ Wed Apr 16, 02:41:03 PM | Erin Trost | edit ] So who is the dumbass who once again waited until April 15th to do her taxes and then right after she mailed them realized that she completely forgot to include her w-2s in them. DAMMIT!!! I spent my entire ride home from work in que waiting for someone at the IRS to pick up. Finally someone picked up and told me not to worry, they'll only need them if for some reason the forms I filled out don't match the w-2s sent from the employers of mine. So everything is fine. Now I am just waiting for my credit card to show up so that I can pay off what I owe the IRS as well as the State. Damn taxes to hell.  Drew: "It's a certain as Death and Taxes."
