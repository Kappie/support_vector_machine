The Osbournes is perhaps the most repetetive, yet neverendingly hilarious show, that has been created in a long while. It's one of those shows that make you appreciate the English and the diversity of curses one can procure...it's astounding.  Umm well...I figure, the peel comes off, the job is done, but that's just me. But then again, I use the "procure-wash-indulge" method of eating apples, so I can't talk.   Pllaal. Does anyone know what that means? I was thinking of what to type next and I typed that, as you see it right now. Pray for my sanity, or insanity, depending on your viewpoint. And also notice that I used the word "procure" twice in this post, so I suppose that is the word of the day.  Hope everyone is having a good weekend. And have fun with coffee Linds.
