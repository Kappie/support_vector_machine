And while I went about digging out Lily of the Valleys I managed to develop a giant blister in the middle of my right hand which popped soon after I had dug out a few forget-me-nots. I was like *^%. So I finished up by digging out two giant hostas and set back to sit them over on my Grandma's porch. I go inside, covered in dirt, arm and hand shaking with pain, and say "Hey Auntie, I need a band-aid." So I go wash out this giant open wound in my hand. Gram gets me the peroxide and I'll be damned if my hand didn't foam for more than five minutes. That was the worst searing pain I've ever felt in my life. And now I have to wait for the damn thing to dry up and stop oozing so I can put on one of those plasticky healing band-aids that come off when you're healed in a week. My hand hurts like *^^$%^$%$#)(*!		 Feel sorry for me. :(
