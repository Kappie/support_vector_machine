When I go in sun, I black. When I cold, I black. When I scared, I black. When I sick, I black. And when I die, I still black.  And You white folks... When you born, you pink. When you grow up, you white. When you go in sun, you red. When you cold, you blue. When you scared, you yellow. When you sick, you green. When you bruised, you purple. And when you die, you gray.  So who you callin' colored?
