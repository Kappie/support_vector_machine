She is also comming to our cookout tomorrow. I think I broke up with Micah, I'm not sure. we are in this huge fight over trust. Appareltny he can't trust me. But it's soe male typical that I have to trust him, but he cant trust me, like i'n some sort of hore that chaeats on people. I swear i feel Like im gonna cry becuase i realy doe like him, but I mean if he can't trust me, then whats the point? I dount knoe. Im gust trying to escape it all. I even told myslef that i wouldnt cry, but soe far i dount have that much will power. Gust like I have no will power to diet, I swear I'm getting soe fat but what the hell? we all die neway, might as well be happy and full, then skinny and hungry. All thou when u die ur really not either. And one question has really been bugging me,. A thought really.:  Are people in society really as stupid as they are obese? I mean are they not seeing the the harm their doing to this planet? Im not some tree loviong freak, butreally. are Americans are soe ignorant that they cannot see that cars, trains, and tother pollution is making the ozone layer evaporate, which is causing the atmosphere to disapate? Really, everyone is always talking abou this generation, well what about the next one? They are the tru victomas that have to deal with our poor judgement. They may have better tachnology, but its not going to brig back the Ozone Layer, soe why try to improve something that is going to be pointless in about 200 years?This shows how todays society is truley only thinking about themselves.Also, with the Ozone Layer being depleted, this means that the Ice Caps are melting at a rapid rate. If something doesnt happen soon. The state of California is going to be totally under water. Really, if a thirteen year old can figure something this complex out, why can't a forty year old scientist?
