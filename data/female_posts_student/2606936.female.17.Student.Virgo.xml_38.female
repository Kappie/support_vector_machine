She once told me this story, i think from SNL or something, in which someone specualted that if stupid people would only carry around signs stating their stupidity, people wouldn't waste time asking them for help or speaking to them or anything.  The example she gave was that of a truck driver who drove under a bridge that was too short and got stuck. He waved people down for help and they would ask him, "Oh, is your truck stuck under this bridge?"  He would reply, "No, I'm a Shriner. Heeeeeere's your sign!"  Essentially, when we give sarcastic answers, we end with that and giggles.  SO today I was perusing my "referral stats," which gives me the URLS of search engine pages, including queries. If anyone remembers the kola nut episode, which is linked at left, I talked a little about the book  Things Fall Apart.   Anyway, this one Googler came from the USA, I guess, and their query was: "Did Chinua Achebe's life affect Things Fall Apart?"  SOmeone out there is searching the internet for this. To this person, if you still read this site: OH. MY. GOD.   I'm not going to ask if you've ever heard his quote on the spear-shaking savages, or if you know where he lived, or where he was from, or if from his name you might have figured out his heritage. I'm not even going to say "No, of course a revolutionary book written about his native culture's tragic end was not at ALL affected by his life. It was a coincidence. If he hadn't got to it first, Danielle Steele would have," with a mean ironic inflection.  I'm just going to say:  No, his death affected it. Heeere's your sign.
