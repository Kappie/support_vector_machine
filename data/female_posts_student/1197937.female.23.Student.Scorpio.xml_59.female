(i hold up the evidence. doc takes one glance, no contact, begins mad illegible scribbling on presciption pad.) doc:    this ointment VERY strong. rub on hand twice a day. me:     does it have any side effects? doc:    Yes. Many. me:     uh...like what? doc:    nevermind. you no need to know. (Father and i exchange looks of bewilderment.) me:     uh...will it make me fat? doc:    No. me:     Okay I'll take it!  dear God: please keep me safe from sprouting hairy moles. amen.
