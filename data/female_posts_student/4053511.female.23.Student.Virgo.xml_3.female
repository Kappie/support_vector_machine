My job seriously can't be beat. Well, maybe one where I was actually using my intelligence. But this job will do for now.   I'm currently waiting for a friend to stop by the lab with my graduation present, and I'm contemplating sending this guy I went out with a few times an email telling him he's rude, boring and (I never thought I'd say this about a guy) too mature. Other than the no sex and church all the time, I can see why someone would want to be a nun. No stupid boys to deal with....although you might have to deal with a priest having too much inappropriate time with the alter boys.   I'm seriously going to back to the mantra that boys are like parking spots. All the good ones are taken and the rest are handicapped in some way or another.  Well, enjoy the game and check out the rest of the site they have political games like the Bush Shootout, the War on Terrorism, Bush Aerobics, Kerry Workout and more! It seriously provides me with hours of entertainment at work.  Until next time.....
