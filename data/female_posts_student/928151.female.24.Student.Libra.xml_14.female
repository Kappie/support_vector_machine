The scene is set in a garden: one the one hand this contrasts with the public settings of the play's most important scenes; on the other, the real garden here, reminds us of Gaunt's repeated metaphor (II, iii: "This earth of majesty... this other Eden, demi-paradise...this blessèd plot, this earth") in which the whole country is likened to a garden, an idea developed in the dialogue in this scene. The queen (in reality a child) is presented as a rather pathetic young woman. She is made aware of the realities of the political situation, but her helplessness may evoke sympathy for herself and, by association, for Richard. Shakespeare varies a stock device (narrative information being reported by a messenger or well-informed noble to others on stage) as the Gardener is able to divulge information which "came last night/To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's" yet which is already "no more than everyone doth know": the queen has not been informed of what we would now call the word on the street.  Language Shakespeare takes some pains over the dialogue here. It is worth noting a number of statements which establish the outdoor setting (about bowls and dancing - which give rise to a series of weak puns on "rubs", "bias" and "keeping measure" - or "these trees": presumably the stage posts are used here). But mostly, Shakespeare gives the Gardener an opportunity to expand the idea of England as a "blessed plot" or garden. A close study of all the imagery in the scene should be made, but some ideas can be noted here. When the Gardener instructs the Servant in his task, we may already note the ambiguity of his orders: he likens the ripe fruit to "unruly children", while the servant is to be the "executioner" (we know that Bushy, Green and Wiltshire have just been executed by Bolingbroke's servants). The garden is a "commonwealth" in the Gardener's "government" and the weeds are "without profit" in sucking fertility from the flowers. In case we miss the point, the Servant now spells out the analogy: Richard has neglected his "sea-wallèd garden".  Back to top This gives the Gardener, continuing the Servant's metaphor, the chance to explain that the garden is now being tended by Bolingbroke: Richard is likened to a tree sheltering parasitic weeds which "seemed in eating him to hold him up"; the image is developed as the Gardener likens Richard's nobles to the boughs of a fruit tree: these need regular pruning (cutting back) while in extreme cases, "superfluous branches" (useless or disloyal nobles) are lopped away. Hearing this provokes the queen to join the conversation rebuking the Gardener who in "Adam's likeness" describes the expulsion from Eden of "cursèd man" in the person of Richard. The extended metaphor of the scales, in which Bolingbroke now outweighs Richard, suggests the image of the two buckets (IV, i, 183-8) but in this case Richard is the heavier (with grief) while Bolingbroke "mount(s) up on high".
