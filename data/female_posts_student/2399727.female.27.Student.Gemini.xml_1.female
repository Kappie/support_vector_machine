Although my Christmas shopping was done last weekend (I make it a rule to try and avoid shopping at all costs in December mainly because of the crowds) I noticed that my semi-dressy clothes collection has been severely depleted, so I bought a couple of new things today to spice up my wardrobe a bit.   Got new clip-on glasses for my new glasses today.  They're hard to clip on but I need some practice and I'm sure I'll be a pro in no time.  It's nice to have new glasses that look stylish for a change.     More to come in the following days...
