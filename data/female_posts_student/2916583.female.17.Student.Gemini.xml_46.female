For instance, my dad and I rolled up into 7-11 to get a slurpee, and we started pointing out cars that we think are hot, beautiful, pretty, ok or ugly for the entire trip home, about three miles.  I'm quite partial to Honda, Toyota, Pontiac, Buick, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, Jeep (my sister's in love with those box jeeps...she wants one in green, but I said to get it in blue cause they're prettier in blue), Volkswagen (still hopin for a Volkswagen Beetle Convertible in either red, blue, white, or silver), Acura, BMW, and Rolls Royce.  There was an awesome one that someone got as a limo for Prom...I actually have a picture of it.  Speaking of which, I need to tell my sister to get that cute sunset in Hawaii photo album at Old Navy for my birthday, cause I want to bring a bunch of disposable cameras to school the last few days, and take lots of pictures.  Wow, I really switch topics easily. Speaking of switching topics, I had a deep thought today.  Everyone has obsessions.  It occurred to me while I was reading Shaheen's thing about cherry tomatoes (I think all tomatoes are disgusting btw).  Lets see, I have a big thing about my breath smelling good (no Julie Ann, not drawing pictures with the steam from my breath), my eyes looking big (I think I squint too much, but nowhere near as much as Renee Zellweger...no matter what everyone else says, I still think that George Clooney does not squint often), my hair, getting the blush right and my teeth looking white.  Basically, my face.  That really says something.  Well, there's a few more, but let's not get into that... I also just realized that I hate a LOT of things.  Wow, we could be here all night if I went into that.  The two things that annoy me most, though, are animal hating/rude/conceited/slow moving (with the exception of young children, the disabled, and the elderly)/obnoxious/exceedingly impatient (stress on exceedingly, because I'm extremely impatient)/know-it-all/blase/snotty/easily annoyed people (not all apply, however...any of these annoy me), and overplayed songs.  Well my dad's pestering me to get offline, so I'll leave it at this.  Later.
