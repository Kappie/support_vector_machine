Its going to be a long night because i have to wash some clothes also. I am so tired right now but all is good. My parents should be here before lunch tomorrow. Anyways i have a few things to do and then i need to get home because its 9:00pm. The exam was ok. I think i passed. We will have to wait and see. Have a good week. I will try to write a often as i can.
