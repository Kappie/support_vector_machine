Everything makes me sad and I'm really not as content with life as I keep saying I am. I convinced myself that I was really ok this time and nothing mattered that much and being sad is pointless and such... and part of me still believes that... but lying to myself isnt making things hurt any less. I don't know why its like this. I just wish it would go away.
