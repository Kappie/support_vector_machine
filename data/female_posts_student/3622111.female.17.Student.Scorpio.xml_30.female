Vs Arsenal at 9:55pm i think, woo...  Mary, i am free that day (hold on, my parents MAY take me to Macau AGAIN since some of their friends are going there that weekend, man, i dun reli know if i can stand going to Macau 3 times in one holiday), but what if i dun wanna swim and i dun reli know that many people there...what time will it be after all?
