Only strange thing was there were these two gigantic rertarded guys in the audience, who kept shouting at the most inoppurtune moments. One repeated over and over, "I got a poem! I got a poem!"- apparently laboring under the misapprehension that it was an open mic.   But that strangeness didn't adversely affect the enjoyment of the performance to any serious degree.   Anyway, while I did walk over there with some folks, I decided to go back alone (I was in a hurry), and it was sort of a sketchy neighborhood. So I looked around until I found a guy who looked like more of a mark than I did, and followed him out. I figured if worst came to worst they'd go after him before me.   Noble, aren't I? -Theo
