And she is waiting for Raik to get on so she can give him the details for prom. So yea, I'll be around. Anyone want to do anything today? Just gimme a call if u do. You know the number, if ya don't then it's in the phone book. Maybe I'll be at Carol's though. I dunno. There's nothing to do here. I miss my life when I was never bored and always had something to do. (Sigh).  And to be on the edge of your bed With your head buried in your hands Wishing that everything would end   I know how it feels to be the loneliest   Welcome To The New South-Less Than Jake
