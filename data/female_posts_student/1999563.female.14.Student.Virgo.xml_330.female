It seems like allthe attention is always on me...scary.  Thats why when my brother drives us to school I just sit in the car until 8:05 then slowly walk in. I love my quite times in the car.  Its just me, my CD, my journal, and God.  Sheer bliss.  I love it.  EVERYONE should have quite times.     Today I was being a freak at the airport and I was pretending I was the star of a musical and I was singing and dancing and I ran into this pooor lady. Hhahaha. It was SOOO funny. I laughed my head off.  Did I tell you about my newest obsession? His name is Joe. he is 17 and he is in Falling Up. I am goign to see him in concert very soon and we will instantly become wonderful friends and talk on the phone a lot. Then we will part ways but I will meet him at a concert during college and we will fall madly into pure godly love.  How wonderful.  Well, Joe has puma shoes which are an automatic 10 bonus point before we even met. I can't wait.   Since Jon Foreman is 26 and is married Joe is the next best thing. And me oh my is he the best :)  Well, maybe not as good as acertain junior but..never mind. I am digging myself into a deep hole  *jumps out of hole*  Much better.  Gosh, I am SOOO thirrsty. *Dying*  Brb  Okay, i got my yummy purified water.  Dude, I was at my grandpas house last night and I got some water and it had this junk floating in it! It was SICK. I hate any water that isn't purrified. I'm weird like that. :)  I need to think of somethign to do at the falling up concert to make sure Joe remembers me. I think iw ill try to be less of a  Joe fanatic and more of friend. Because that is how all wonderful relationships start. First we shall become best friends.  I am so excited to get to live with my best friend for forever. even if it isn't Joe. :)  Goll its 12:25 AM. The switchfoot tickets end ina few minutes. But they are at 76 bucks so I don't think its a possibility. Oh well. I shall  have to see if Ben has any tickets. I hope he does!  I will be quite sad if he doesn't.   DUDE!  My mom went to the store today *waaaahoooo*  SHE GOT THE BEST COOKIES IN THE WHOLE INTIRE STINKING WORLD.   They are from Canada, eh.  I have always loved them SOOOOOOOO much but I can only usually get them in Canada so my mom came home them and I was like "HOLY SMAKIE! YAYAYYAYAYAyAYAYyAAY" Then KY won by 20 points which increased my happiness.  GOSH  I am so happy.  When I was at the airport I thought my brother died in a terrorist attack. I don't ever worry about those thigns but tonight his plane was a half an hour late and on the screen it said he was on time..It was weird. So I started to get worried. He still didn't show up. So I started to pray then BANG there he was. *smile*  Tonight we had a comedy sports thing and I forgot the line I got 5 minutes before we were supposed to go up there and talk. It was kinda funnny..in a not funny sort of way. :)  Yeah.  Gosh. I am almost runnign out of things to say.   I guess I will stop saying thigns then.  Good bye..   Good day.  buutttt fezzzz  I SAID GOOD DAY!  hahahhahahahhaha  its late... ;)
