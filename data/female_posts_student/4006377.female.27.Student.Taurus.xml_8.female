I'm feeling much healthier nowadays. I have just 4 (3.5 Whoo-hoo!) puny pounds to lose before I go home in 2 weeks. I can do this!  I notice the weight loss in weird places. My neck is longer and I can see my collarbone. My shoulders seem smaller. I have to turn my elbows in to touch my wrists to my hips. I can see my arms getting smaller. My knees seem smaller in size. My 2 favorite parts are my lower back just before it curves out. It is tiny in comparison to the rest of my torso. And when I lay down, I can just begin to feel my hip bones jut out. It's weird feeling my bones again.
