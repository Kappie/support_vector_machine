And Matt, love, I know your not reading this, but check your fucking email. We're all getting very pissed at you right now.  But I had a fairly good day and nothing is going to spoil that, yes thats right.  Except I talked to mom, and it has been decided that me, tyler, and ryan are not going to incubus in july as planned anymore. Well I wasnt really expecting to go so Im not really angry or anything, but its still dissapointing. On the other hand, I have $ to blow on nothing. And thats a definite change for me.  Ach Im going to bed, Im dead tired.
