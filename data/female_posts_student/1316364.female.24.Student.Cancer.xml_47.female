We stayed out until Close to Midnight. I had a lot of fun. One thing that did bother me about the night was that Jessica had 3worried me regarding the possibility of Jesse enlisting as full time Active duty. I went to bed with that on my mind. This morning I got a call from Dale’s Ex, Paul (also my friend) asking me if it was true. I told him that I hadn’t talked to Jesse otherwise but I was pretty sure that it wasn’t. When I got into work I logged into Yahoo messenger and waited for Jesse to come online, start his shift. He came on around 11:00, right about when I got to work. We talked a bit and I asked him about what Weldon had said. Jesse responded with a “F**K NO!” This made me feel a lot better. I knew that Jesse would never do that, but part of me wondered why I doubted him in the first place. I know he would talk to me before making a decision that would affect both of our lives.   Jesse and I had a wonderful talk online today. I surprised him a little though. I told him “I have always been honest with you. I have never lied or cheated or even thought about cheating or lying. You have managed to capture my heart and soul from the first time I saw you for who you really were. I don't think I have ever meet anyone in my whole life who has ever done that for me.” I think when I told him that he was surprised a bit. I asked him if he would call me because I missed hearing his voice and sure enough he did. It was so wonderful hearing him talk to me. He asked me how come I never told him how I felt and I explained to him that spoken words don’t come to me that easily. I think a lot clearer now that I am on Lexapro, my thoughts are a lot clearer to me.  I can’t wait until Jesse gets to come home. I know things are going to be a little weird at first but I love him more than anything I can imagine so I know it will all work out in the end.
