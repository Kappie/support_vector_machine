We crossed the Canada/US passage and sailed through the inside passage yesterday.  I spent 4 hour out on our crew deck looking at the mountains and the incredible stillness of the ocean.  Huge mountains with natural waterfalls about 10 meters away from the ship.  I took tons of photos while cruising through the passage.  At one point, while sailing, we were approximately 3 meters from shore. It drizzled a bit but I was bundled up in layers with my huge jacket on.  About 48 degrees.  My first Alaska experience really was spiritual - much like that Parasailing adventure in Mazatlan. Really quite.  I stood out on our deck just watching the scenery, breathing the fresh clean air and wondered what it would be like to kayack down the streams or go hiking through the mountains.  I think it was the first time in my life that I have ever considered doing any of those things.  There's just something about Alaska that makes you never want to smoke another cigarette or do anything harmful to the earth.  It's the most beautiful untouched piece of land I have seen.   Today we are in Ketchikan. A really small port for us but the neatest thing is that the ship is docked right at the quaintest part of the town.  Out my window sits our ship, a beautiful view of the mountains and several cargo ships around.  We ate in this fantastic country diner - complete with a breakfast bar and shabby looking waitresses who called us "Honey".  I had 3 cups of coffee and  a "country breakfast" with sausage gravy - it was soooooooooo freaking good.  Ketchikan has this small-town homey feel to it.  Pretty chilly today - I have a thick sweater on and my nose is freezing.    It's weird to think that I am actually in Alaska right now but really neat. I can't wait to get my photos developed to bring to show everyone. It's very cloudy here, the clouds hang so low you can just barely see the tops of the snow-covered mountains and everything is really green here. I don't know if it is the sky back drop that brings out these vivid greens or if it is just usual scenery here.  It's truly beautiful.   Tomorrow we are in Scagway.  We will be there until 9:00PM at night.  I think a few of us are going to go dog-sleding and hang out at one of the mountain cafes.  I must say this is just a really fantastic way to end my contract.  It's so much better than spending my last few cruises in Mexico and it is nice to be somewhere cold before coming home to the hot humid climate of Texas.   Just a special note to Mom - I love you so much and thank you for being so wonderful.  I am sorry I can't be with you on your day but know that I am thinking of you.  Happy Mother's Day!  20 days left. :-)
