Ms. May, the lovable lunchlady at school died in a head-on car accident on her way home from school today--the staff had to stay today. The people in the other car were from Jefferson, but Amy didn't know who they were...  This is sad. She was so nice and always smiling and cheery. Man, sad stuff...  It was common for her to give extra food to people as they were going through the lunch line. She'd say, in her slighty-broken English, something like, "You skinny! Have more food!" or, "You a cutie. Here you go!"   I want to know who the people in the other car were... But I guess I'll find out tomorrow at school.
