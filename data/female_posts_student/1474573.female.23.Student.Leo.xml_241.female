Anyway onto other more important things.  Hello?! The Apprentice, anyone?  Can you say THANK YOU LORD DONALD TRUMP FOR FIRING OMAROSA!  That bitch had to go!  I mean really!  She was the epitome of the person no one would want to work with.  She was holier than thou, had the stankiest attitude and, well, was kinda lazy, if I do say so myself!  She tried to play Donald too! I couldnt believe the nerve this woman had.  Who will take the prize? I believe it will be either Nick or the blond curly haired chick that Nick is in love with.  She's never once been to the Board Room.  I love this show so much its sickening.  I seriously need to get out more.
