So I decided that I had been broke for the last 3 days, and need some cash, along with something to yield my hungry stomach. So hit up the bank and T-Bell.   Came back home to check the Edgewood Email, to see if this girl from the golf team had wrote me any interesting stuff. She writes the funniest emails...sounds like we will get along Quite Well on the team this year! She has the same attitude and personality as I do...funny gal.  Got ready to work a smaller shift than normal at "Hell," 4:30-8:30. You would think I would have nothing negative to say about the shorter shift--But I do! I worked with Ann, whom I normally can keep a decent conversation with for a while...but tonight...I think we spoke like 10 times to eachother, in small increments! So I read magazines, and Angels and Demons...needless to say, we weren't busy! We made a grand total of $145.82. That sucks! But in the middle of our long stint of absent customers,  Dan:The Owner of Sprizzos ,comes in to Introduce himself to us, and give us a menu so we can order out food there."There's a $25 limit on delivery!"  Well lets seeDan...We are the only two here right now...andwe'redefinitley not going tobuy $25 of food to split between the two of us! The dude was like 5 feet tall too, I felt like a giant!   But after our uneventful gift shop experience...Ann went Bowling, and I headed on over to Nicoles house. A group of them went to see The Bourne Supremacy...without me! Abby said they were planning this soo far ahead of time and that they couldn't push back the time...5 people went. So whatever...I'll see it by myself! haha, so at Nicoles house, I pull into the driveway..and two cars are there(besides Nicoles), Abby's and Sam's. So we head down to the basement for a night of pure chit chattin'. I like days like these...relaxing, no bickering at eachother...it was nice. So we talked about every imaginable subject...We even talked about Observatories...bet you don't have conversations about that everyday!?   So around 12 we headed on home...tired from a long day of nothing. Now its time for bed! Ciao mes amies!
