Well, I'm not sure what happened after I left though - but whilst I was there, there were no private parts exposed. There were inquiries about when the strip-teases were going to happen and loads of fingers were pointed towared  urlLink Cheng Leong  and  urlLink Kevin  but they somehow managed to brush the declarations and were fully equiped with clothes.  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I was hoping to see some naked men. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO.         It's evident that only  urlLink Sui Lin  is capable of organizing big events. It's all so natural to her to do these things. Her PR-ship is excellent and she makes everyone comfortable and remembers everyones name. None of us would have ran the damn thing smoothly. None of us would have attracted THAT much people.                It was packed. Not as packed as Bar Savanh, but packed enough. Expensive drinks, nibbles here and there, board games and a whole lot of fun and laughters. I had a amazing time with all of them at table #1. :D It was great being with all you guys in the table. :D The chemistry was good and we'll make a good pack of noisy, drinking nutters. :D       MAN OF THE PARTY(IES) : The ever SOW:MASTER OF EVIL. Without him, there's no fucking party. And sorry to those who wanted the title - but there's just no beating me  urlLink Sow . The world WILL be such a bitter and mundane place without him.   PS: I know the pictures are just weird, but you're bound to find actual people staring and posing pictures on all the other sites. I took advantage of being the arty, abstract photos to post up. :D PSS: We should have more gatherings like this. But I reckoned the novelty wouldn't be as ... 'SYIOK' as it would be if this kinda thing was held every 6 months one. But oh well. It was good fun though... :)
