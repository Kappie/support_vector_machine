I guess this means that I am really peeved at humanity, because I do not think the students here are any different than people generally.  Well, at least not in certain respects.  Not the ones that bother me the most.  It's just that I have little exposure to people in general (though when I do, I often complain about them as well - let's face it, I just complain about everything that bothers me, and a lot of things bother me) but I do have great exposure to the fine, if somewhat annoying, populace here at St. John's, so complain away about them I will often do.  Like right now.  Why, oh why, is it necessary to use a credit card to buy only a soda, worth a grand total of about a $1?  I know a lot of people here do this in the cafeteria all the time, some of them are friends of mine.  I could understand it before, when the nearest ATM was not in the building, with the tight schedules we law students keep.  But now there is one right next to the cafeteria.  Why not just get $20 or $40 out and make that your cafeteria money for the week?  Would that be so hard?  Some people say that they just never use cash.  I can understand this.  But there are other options.  The university offers a debit system, so that you can put money on your ID and just have them swipe the card every time you buy something.  This is the fastest and most strongly advocated method.  And you get the added benefit of not being charged sales tax, which here in NYC is no joke.    But it's just a suggestion.  As you were.
