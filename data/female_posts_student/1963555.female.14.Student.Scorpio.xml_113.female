So anyway, I am so glad that I went, This year I've been trying to do things that I normally wouldn't do, and h my god, thank you for making me go. Okay Dacia's dad's girlfriend's son, Pat, was at this picnic/party. He is 15, he's got these wonderful blue and lightning eyes, and he is so nice, and pretty funny. He likes NY Yankees and likes rap, but besides those flaws, he is awesome. Like he just looks average with out his hat on, and then... When he's wearing it he looks hot. And it may be in my head, but we had a lot in common. (It probably is in my head) So my dad droped off some clothes and stuff so I could spend the night, (Pat, Dacia(friend), Sam(Dacia's little sister),Des(Dacia and Sam's aunt she's 17), and Maryia(Sam's friend), so I walk out to the truck and he brings my bright pink blanket and a blue fuzzy blanket (like those ones on the beds in hotels) I just by my gut feeling pick the blue one. I walk in and Pat yells, I have that same blanket. And every time we all hung out in a room and the blanket was there he would cuddle with it. He is pretty cute, I hate that word, but he was. I don't wanna write to much about this just so I can leave it to memory, god I sound like such an ass... He's just a good thing to smile about at a back time.  *oh I came up with this lyric, I'm sure it has been used but I havn't heard the song so just give me the credit. oh I heard my parents say this to each other during a fight tonight.  "you say your dieing, but I'm already dead" I like it  *oh and another one I made up a while ago in school, I cleard my head and just wrote anything...  "Chickens run dancing like rainbows in space"  It flows so well. So I gotta go, my mom is being extremely mean to me today, I was crying and I noticed that after a good cry my skin looks really better.  So I'm gonna go upstairs make some tea, cuddle up with that blue blanket and watch Paris and Nicole make an ass out of themselves.  Bye
