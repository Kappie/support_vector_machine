AND my left side is worse than the right because the sun was beaming down on that side more. So I can move my hands and my neck, but it's just too complicated to do anything else. Never go outside for multiple hours wearing cheap sun block. It doesn't work man...It doesn't. And I went to sleep around 4 am...I was extremely crabby when I woke up...not cool. O yea, get this. There's gonna be a new movie comin and it's Alien vs. Predator or w/e...I thought they made a mistake w/ Freddy vs. Jason and I thought the industry would learn from that. But no. They have to go and ruin two more classics. I just thought I should mention the injustice. AND I have to see Anchorman..We'll make a party out of it lol! *JULY 9*
