I guess that means that artsy people don't have correct grammer and get lost in their own thoughts. I hope they know that "stupidity" is not a adjective.  Maybe it has some internal meaning within the maze of confudled crap but I don't see it. Anyway if anyone wants to see some really strange/funny art goto:  urlLink Exploding Dog . It's kinda like stick figures/ modern art but with a very "strange" touch to it. Try it out and that was my 2 cents for today P.S. Deadinside can hate blogger as much as he wants as long as he posts.
