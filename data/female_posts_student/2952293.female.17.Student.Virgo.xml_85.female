We were playing cards before we were going to go visit her friend at work. She goes, "I hope you are going to wear something nice." Hi, not in a mean way, but your friend flips burgers at Walt's 50's Diner, why do I need to wear something nice?!  Yesterday we went to see John Kerry at the park by my house. My aunt was talking on the phone to my other aunt and telling her about it. "Yes, tonight we're going to go see John Kerry speak, you know that guy who's running for President?" WHAT THE HELL? Why didn't she just say, "Yeah we're going to go see some guy, I forget his name, speak. He is doing... oh what's that little thing, I think he's trying to run for like p-p-president of I don't know what, oh yeah maybe the US, I'm not really sure. It's no biggie at all." God, I love the family! The rally was pretty good. It was raining and I couldn't see anything. I saw the Indian boy of my dreams, he was GORGEOUS, but with an Indian girl. I told my mom that it could be his sister, but alas he was holding her in his arms. Oh tear tear, he could have been my true Aladdin. There were these fuckers with Pro-Life signs, you know how I feel about that. I walked by, looking at these stupid like 15 year old boys, screaming, "Yeah, why don't you try bleeding through your crotch fuckers!" We all yelled at them, I was like, "How do you think it feels to be 17 and celebrating your 6th year on the rag!" That's right boys and girls, six years on June 26. Buy me presents, they must say "Always". Get it?! When I was walking home I saw this woman up ahead a little ways with a Bush sign. I crept up behind her and hissed in her ear! It was so funny, ask me to show you, cause I can't describe how amazing it was.  Last Comic Standing was good last night. I wanted Dan Ahdoot and Monty to go on, but they didn't. Damn. I have to babysit at 1. Eww.  Oh yeah, I had this dream last night. I had this dream that The Early November was at my grandma's house. Ace looked awful! He looked like Bert from The Used, which isn't awful, it's just not what he looks like. Anyways, I asked them if they had a copy of their acoustic CD. Joe said to come out to the car with him. But we ended up getting into the car and driving to downtown Columbus. He then put his arm around me... interesting. We went into this CD store, but they didn't have it. I thought we were going to the car to get it from their trunk, but we tried to go buy it, and they didn't have it. That's it.
