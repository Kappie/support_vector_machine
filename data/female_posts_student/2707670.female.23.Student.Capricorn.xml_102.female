I was the Observer as everyone used there successful/unsuccessful pick up lines (who's to judge...who actually wanted them to work?) :)  ...and truly, there is nothing better than a hardee's biscuit at 2:30 in the morning. Mike really was excellent at his job of getting us more for less. Go Mike!  Cheers
