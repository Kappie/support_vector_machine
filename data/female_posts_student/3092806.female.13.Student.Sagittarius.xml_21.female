For the past few weeks all she has ever done is bug my sister and I to either go get ice cream, go to the Dollar Store, catch a movie, browse shops at the mall, play outside, go swimming, hang at her house or our house... We can't go anywhere without getting a phone call from her, an AIM from her, or her knocking on ourfrontdoor... I swear,we have a stalker... It's creepy walking into her room sometimes. She writes our namesall overher tissue boxes and stuff...    Today, she asked Nicole and I to go to the Dollar Store to buy fake NAILS with her... FAKE NAILS? Who buys fake nails? They're a complete waste of money... Anyways, I told her that Nicole and I wouldn't go, we seriously didn't want to. She called me a bad friend just because I refused to go with her. Honestly, what does she need fake nails for? Anyways, I'm all like whatever and she's all like don't whatever me and I'm sick of you... I told her that if she didn't like me for who I am then fine,we didn't have to be friends. She wrote that it was my choice to be a witch and that I should go ahead and block her. I told her that she wasn't worth blocking over. Next she threatened that she wouldn't take Nicole and I to some amusement park sometime in August because "the way Iwas acting." She said she'd take someone that is nice to her. I'm all like, you do that. Kate responded with that she would and it would most certainly not be me. I responded with "like I care." She tells me that I probably do care, I just won't admit it. I tell her that before she even asked us Nicole and I had actually planned going to the same amusement park over the summer... Anyways, she got a little more angrier and said that she didn't give a shit about my life. "That's nice,"was my reply. Then she sunk even lower and said that at least she had friends. With much more anger than I hadbeforehand, I typed in that I didn't want any friends if all of them were going to act the same way she was acting then. Ouch, that was a low blow. She definitely deserved it though. Unfortunately, seeing as she isn't too great at reading plain English, she didn't understand a word of what I was saying. What a bummer... The one chance I get to tell her how I feel and she doesn't even comphrehend what I'm saying...    I know what I said was a little harsh... It's just that she's been really irritating me these days. If she doesn't get what she wants, she throws a hissy fit. And when she gets what she wants and after hours of doing whatever she wants to do, she won't let us stop. I think she has seperation anxiety or something. Anyhow, we're all better now since she just called and apologized. She still wants me to go but I won't... I REFUSE TO GO! She can't make me!!! Great, now I sound like a toddler having a temper tantrum.    And I'm out.
