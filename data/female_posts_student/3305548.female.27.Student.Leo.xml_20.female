We shall conquer their office and crush the finacial aid hold music once and for alllll!!!!! Attttack!!!!!  Eh-hem...So that's how today will go potentially.  A trip to Morgantown to make sure the people that get paid 23,750 a year to be financial aid counselors DO THEIR JOBS. I was talking with a fellow WVU student last night who aggreed that if one didnt babysit the financial aid office nothing would ever be taken care of on their student account. Its hard to babysit long distance...so I am taking this up close and personal.   I will retell of my glorious trimph and how I overcame great odds to succeed later...of the gore and the bloody aftermath and the legendary hero...erm...yeah.  We are also going to visit one of our likely future residentcies since we are in town. Lakeside Village. Its very posh - posher than I have ever lived in...thats for sure. I am looking forward to getting to look around at a two bedroom apartment and getting a feel for it. Note to self: Take a measuring tape. Ack! The interior designer in me is crying out for measurement devices and drafting paper!  Last night I had another night of "training" to be a camp counselor. Recertifying in CPR. I didnt see the point as at the end of the night the instructor let us take the test as a group and shout out answers and whatnot. Besides the Red Cross should have seperate classes for certification and recertification. Duh, I remembered everything from last year nearly. Although our intstructor did tell us the little known "there is a 90% chance your victim will throw up on the rescuer when giving CPR or rescue breathing." The percentage was from his personal experience as a Lifeguard. Gotta love it.  Right well then I have to get ready to kick some financial aid ass. Over and out for now.  Mack
