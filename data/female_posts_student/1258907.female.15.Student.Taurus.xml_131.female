As strangers come and send you pain I will be there for you to gain As temptaion comes, and beats like your heart Deep in your veins, just like an art Black masked and strong Dark horns dont belong Fire burns in your eyes But I will always rise! Dont cry, my daughter Thou shall not cry (I will wipe away your tears) Thou shall not kill Turn to your father Thou shall not fall Chained like a prisoner Thou shall not feel The love thats in your mother Such lonliness....
