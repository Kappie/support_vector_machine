If it was English I could look at all the information and churn it out in a day; but with Geography somehow I can't do that. And I keep second guessing myself. If only I could just finish up this damn project, I could  urlLink relax  since this was supposed to be my easy day for finals. All that's left is my computers in ed class, as of yet I'm still not sure just what the test will be like and its not posted yet on blackboard.        Here I sit in the computer lab trying to cool down because it's too hot to do anything in my room and I  just keep stressing out . Lucky for me I only had to sit and spread my stuff out at three different computers til I found one that was connected to the printer. ack! Atleast I got some money from the book buy-back.  And I'm being a rebel for having pop and chips on full display in the lab. mwuhahaha. I hope they don't kick me out because I just  love sitting underneath this flickering overhead flourescent light.             I'm just waiting for the moment when I can purposefully spread out over my bed and cover myself up with the cold sheet. Wait, that can't ever happen, my room's far too hot to ever allow for  such a luxury as a cold sheet.
