It seemed like a good thing to do at the time. We'll just have to see how well this thing actually turns out.  So anywho, today is Valentine's Day. A more suitable name for it, at least for me, is Singles Awareness Day. Its just another pointless holiday to remind you how much of a loser you really are. Now don't get me wrong, its pretty hard to forget how much of a loser I am. Just take this blog for example. Considering no one will read it anyway, its a sure sign of my uncoolness. Oh well, I am perfectly content with being a loser. Its really not so bad. (Riiiiight) But anyway, this whole valentine's thing... I don't understand it. Wasn't that whole thing just a big massacre somewhere in Europe? I really don't know. History's not really my thing.  Well, I just went downstairs to get a drink and I saw my sister in the kitchen. She was disgustingly giddy with Valentine's Day cheer... I just wanted to throw something at her. Instead I just said, "Sack" and continued on my not-so-merry little way.  Everyone has their wonderful little plans for this evening... me? I'll probably just be sitting here alone all night. I had plans to go to Rob's with Nick and Amy and Erica for "Sad Movie Night/ Anti-Vday party" however these plans were shot to hell, due to Rob forgetting to mention that HE'LL BE IN FLORIDA. Lucky for him, no one could go anyway, so we'll let him live... for now. So since my parents and Nick's parents wont be around, and Amy's parents are being stupid and imprisoning her in her house, and Erica... well... I'm not sure what happened with Erica, but because of all of that, we have been forced to cancel our sad movie night, and will all be spending tonight alone. Great isn't it? Yeah I though so.... or not.   Well my sister Steve (formerly known as Michelle, but James and I decided her name should be changed to Steve) has decided to cook something so I better go supervise and make sure she doesn't catch the microwave on fire again. tah-tah for now kids. Hope you enjoyed the randomness stupidness of my brain.
