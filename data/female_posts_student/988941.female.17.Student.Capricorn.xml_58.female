Max, fair enough but it would be handy if you could post brefly in the future to say 'I may not be on here for a few days' like Jo did earlier and that applies to everyone. Then we know where everyone is and I don't start thinking that this was a waste of time. No Tom I haven't seen LOTR and I don't want to. Oh and please don't write Ryan with " around it. He is a person not someone I have made up so don't talk about him as if he isn't real. And yea he is the Ryan I was talking about. I don't exactly know any others do I?
