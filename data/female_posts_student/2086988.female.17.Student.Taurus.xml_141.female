I think once the kids go to Italy I'm going to start lap swimming there. It's only $3 and it's open every day from 1-6pm and on Mondays and Wednesdays I can go from 8-9pm. So that should be fun. I love SWIMMING! :)  Well I have my ACTs bright and early next Saturday, going to need to study for that. I just want it to be over with. I'm nervous of course, but at least if I don't get the 28-30 I want, then I can just re-take it in September. But I'm crossing my fingers I only have to take it this once.    Maybe it's intuition  But some things you just don't question Like in your eyes I see my future in an instant
