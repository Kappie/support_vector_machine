Seriously, evercise has never been that fun.  We ran around this building like 5 times then we went to the weight room and lifted weights. That was fun.  Then we sprinted around the cafeteria. Its kinda cool how we don't have to play tennis on rainy days.  Thhen it ended an hour early because it was rainy so my mom got me a slurpy. Yay!  Everyone on my team is really nice they always talk about church and everythign which is great, yet unexpected for prarie ;)  tonight I think I am going to freddys but thats it!!!  :)
