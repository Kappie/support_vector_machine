Well, "still" doesn't accurately describe the situation I guess; a single day doesn't deserve so drastic of a word, but hey, a single day seems like an eternity when someone you care about is no longer talking to you. But I'm not going to think about tonight, because you know what? They say the only way to have a friend is to be one. And that's all I've ever done to this girl. She's talked about John, and even though it sometimes hurts me, I still listen intently. And then she goes and does this, virtually the only thing she's had against me in a while. Yeah, the things I wrote about her weren't the most flattering comments, but for every bad thing there was a good thing. And Marie completely refuses to acknowledge that, AND the fact that I never intended for her to read any. What I expressed online I have never expressed to her in person, because I love her and would never put our friendship in jeapordy.   I miss Kenny a lot. I miss talking to him, I miss seeing his McDonald's smile, and I miss the way that he smells. Part of me is seriously debating calling him. And I don't know if that is completely stupid of me, but I think that I would regret it more if I didn't call him at all, then if I did and he blew me off. Because  then I would know that we're not talking for a reason, and that it's better off this way.   Alright, I'm going to bed. Wish me very very sweet dreams.
