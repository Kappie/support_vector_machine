Wonder Woman had hers, so we can live in the house once again.  Lola also had hers, and Uma, and Lana.  Sad times at Ridegmont high.  Oh wait, that's not my school, oh the delirium.  "What does that mean?"  And that is a quote from a graduating senior on a word during Giles' speech.  Quite amusing.  So I was the designated photographer at graduation, and I failed miserably, I loaded the camera wrong on my second role of film, so I missed alot of pictures of the ceremony, and we had to re-do many afterwards.  But it all worked out eventually.     I just got back from Lana's house, we met the EGSers (East Great Spoons people)there, and played mafia, and I never (with fingers, not alcoholic beverages).  I had names down by the end of the night, but sadly I still refer to them by their character names from my first and only EGS play.    I'm really going to miss all my seniors when they leave.  They are so much more fun than juniors (except for a select few, and you know who you are.)    I really need to get to bed though, because it's about 2 am, and I need to work at church tomorrow.  So have a wonder full whatever you are doing.  This is Amanda of I Dream of Genie signing off.  *boing*
