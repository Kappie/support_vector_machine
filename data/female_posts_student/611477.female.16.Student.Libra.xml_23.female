Really. I should finish the neck part today, though; maybe the whole thing will be finished today... unless I decide it's atrocious. Then it'll be another week. *nods* (huh?)  I figure if I *didn't* measure right and it does turn out too long after washing... and if "too long" really is too long and not just a features flaw (huh?)  I can either unravel it all or cut it in the middle and graft the parts together (somehow).  That second idea sounds a bit tetched - just my style.  If I mess it up, well, I'd have had to redo it anyway... but that's assuming I'm right, which is a very bad assumption to make.  (huh?)
