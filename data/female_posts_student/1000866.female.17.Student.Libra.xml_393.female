I'm somewhat confused about something but I'm hoping it will straighten itself out by the end of this weekend.   Tra la la.....we ran pacers in gym today and it was just pooey. I got sweaty. I don't LIKE getting sweaty. Haha...I feel like I'm in Clueless. Kelly and I watched that when she stayed overnight. "I'm totally buggin'" "Where does she meet these barneys?" Hehe. fun times, fun times. But yeah....I did 43 pacers which isn't awful. It's not that great but...eh, it's in the healthy norm. so I'm fine. I was going to go to 37 but forgot...whoops...  Hmmm, and at lunch I wanted to talk to Diane about some stuff and Alicia came and sat with us and just butted into the conversation. "What are you talking about?" "Nothing." "Just tell me the two people involved and I'll leave you alone." Argh.....seriously, stop being so nosy please! It's Diane's and my business! Like, it wouldn't have bothered me if after we said, "nothing" she would have left it at that...  I feel really bad for Jeff though. Gosh, I've never even met Steph and she doesn't sound nice at all. I mean, I always like to give people a chance and not judge by rumor but....there's just SO much, It's difficult to ignore.  This weekend is looking good so far though. Of course this means it'll end up crashing down on me. Tonight I'm going bowling with Brandon, Peter, Dave...yay Dave...I'm so excited to hang out with him. Seriously I love that kid. He makes me day...but yeah, ummm, Alex, Katharine, Allyice and Brad Debnar are also coming so it shall be a fun fun time.  Then, I'm supposed to go see Pirates of the Caribbean with Bryan which is very exciting because I haven't seen it yet!!   Anyway, I must go. I think I might go take a shower or something just because it sounds nice...maybe a bath. That'd be nice too.   Byebye.....
