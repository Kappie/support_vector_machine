I have never done anything that consumes my life 24 hrs a day. I have already had so many dreams about this project- the presentation, the design. Isnt that crazy?  Oh, on the good side of things, I got an email from an interior design company in California who is interested in seeing my portfolio! Yeah! I would love to move to Cali- good weather, good food, and right by the ocean. Perfect! Keep your fingers crossed. I sent her my portfolio yesterday.
