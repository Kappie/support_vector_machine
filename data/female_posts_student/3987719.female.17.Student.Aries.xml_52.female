Then they split a rain shortened series with the Red Sox who the orioles had handled all season.  Pedro was his usual strong self in game 1 but Javy Lopez almost singlehandedly beat Curt Schilling in the finale of the series.  Following that came a trip into Yankee Stadium.  Sidney Ponson began the series with an excellent outing- very rare for him.  Following that, the Orioles' offense stalled, stranding runners, not working the count.  The pitching chose the same time to go through a rough patch, not unusual for young starters in historic Yankee Stadium.  Becasue of this, the orioles lost the next 3 games.  However, then seattle came into town for 3 games in 2 days and the orioles woes were solved.  In game 1 of tuesday's doubleheader, Sidney Ponson reverted back to his usual self, but the offense bailed him out knocking Seattle's starter, Ron Villone, out of the game early.  The bullpen held the lead to seal the game.  In game 2, the orioles surprisingly managed to beat Jamie Moyer, who has been an Oriole Killer.  Wednesday's game was another all-around good game, with Daniel Cabrera giving up 3 runs in 5+ innings, but leaving with a no decision.  The bullpen came in and held the Mariners, while the Orioles offense came through with some rare clutch hitting.
