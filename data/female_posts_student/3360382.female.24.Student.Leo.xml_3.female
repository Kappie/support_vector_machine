Randall a professor of law and web editor.  In this article Vernellia exclaimed how "racism remains a prime cause of the unequal and racially discriminatory provision of the funds for health services;  of the underutilization of white hospitals; of miserable housing, gross pollution, poor sanitation, and lack of health care"(www.academic.udayton.edu/health/racist.htm).    In the article Vernellia went on to say how possibilities such as high cost were some reasons why healthcare is and maybe too high for some African Americans.  Also, she feels that some of the sickness in the black community can be eliminated if America would offer the services in a moderately affordable sense that will accomadate the black population.  Also, Vernellia goes on to say how she feels that "the black community does not get a chance to participate in any decisions or allocations concening resources in healthcare today"(www.academic.udayton.edu/health/racist.htm).    I personally feel that the black population have an opportunity to react to certain resources concerning healthcare it just that they do not know how to find the resources.  Speaking for myself I think African Americans feel that they are shadowed out because of discrimination issues and feel that they cannot do anything about systems that they cannot change.  Some people see that the healthcare is costly and decide to overlook the health plans so they go without it and it's not just the black population it's white, hispanics and other ethnic backgrounds.  I think there needs to be a health care awareness campaign done yearly that will educate all Americans on healthcare and what they should and did no know.  I personally feel that it is unethical that predominatley black hospitals are ill equipped as oppose to white hospitals and that there is a fund shortage due to unequal services.
