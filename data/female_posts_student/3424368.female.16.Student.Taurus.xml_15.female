Last week was so tiring, working everyday... but, on friday, I got paid!! yay! more than I expected! hehe, it was great. But, yeh, I haven't done much this weekend... I planned on sleeping a lot... but yeah, that didn't happen. Yesterday tho, I did go out with Gerardo... cuz yeah, we didnt get to do anything on wednesday, which was our 9 month anniversary! hehe, but yeah... We went to Metro yesterday,... and then walked around Bear Creek Park... but, that's about all. And tonight, we're going out to vancouver to have dinner with my brother. But ohh! On thursday, I was just looking thru some things, and I found my friend's number, from vancouver, and decided to call her up... it's was great! I haven't talked to her ina few years.... and then she sayd that I should call up another one of my old friends... so I did... we talked for sooo long... lol.. I havent talked to her since I moved, which was like, 6 years ago... so it was good to hear her, and talk to her again. And then, because i didnt have the number, I emailed my other friend... and yes, her and I talked... so I was happy to hear from all of them, and get a chance to catch up on SOME things with them =) But anyways... there's a spider crawling on the wall in front of me... and it's scaring me, so I'm gonna get going... bye!
