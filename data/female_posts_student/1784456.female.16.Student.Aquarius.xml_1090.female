Any way, on to more serious matters *like cheese?* No, not like cheese.  urlLink http://uk.news.yahoo.com/021123/140/dfbb5.html  - It's this Miss World thing. It's sparked violence and killed more than 100 people. Why? All because of some brainless bimbos pouncing around a stage? Not really, all because of the prejudice that still exists in this world. Some one published an article in a national newspaper saying that  Muhammad would have wanted to marry one of the beauty queens. I think I blame this person for the violence that errupted afterwards. What were they thinking? So odviously, this person is Christian. Maybe we should change 'Muhammad' to 'Jesus'. This person odviously has no respect and is a racist chauvanist *there's me trying to be clever again*. With people like that in Nigera then it's understandable that this violence has started. Seperate groups should not be seperated further, they should be put together and made to understand each other, it's too easy to say that it's all the other groups fault, and not understand why they're doing it. With understanding comes knowledge, I just hope some people learn this before it's too late. Maybe George Bush should go back to school, I think he needs it. He see's these 'terrorists' as completely unhuman and as animals that will kill us all, but surely they're still human beings. What is this world coming to?
