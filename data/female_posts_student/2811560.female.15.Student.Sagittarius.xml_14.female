Hopefully today will be better, the boys were talking about getting together to play Halo. But you never know with them. So if they don't call I'm going to get out and do something with Emily and Jasmine, hopefully. I must get out of the house!!! Okay...kind of grossed out by Chris's away message which says that he is "playing the Valentine's Day game" with his girlfriend....um, ew! *shudder* Anyways, yeah. Still not sure if I'm going to set construction tomorrow. I'm so lazy. Dammit, I am so bored. Meh, whatever.
