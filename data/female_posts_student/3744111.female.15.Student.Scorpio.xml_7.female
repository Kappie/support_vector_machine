If I am not loved and I do not love someone by the time I am 25, I will become catholic and a nun. I stayed at Peepi's house last night. It was pretty cool cause we ate watermelon and it was good. Well there is nothing else to talk about maybe I will tell you about my dentist appt. I have tomorrow. Oh yeah I did go to the pool today and this one dude flowed my friend and I around. Well bye.
