You say you were chosen for his garden, His precious hand picked bouquet, "God really needed  me, That's why I couldn't stay". It's said to be that angels are sent from above, I've always had my angel...my Friend..Who's heart was filled with love. Wherever the ocean meets the sky, there will be memories of you and I, When I look up at the sky, All I see are visions of you. While there's a heart in me, you'll be a part of me.
