Today's Wednesday Best (wait today's wednesday right?) is... Best Scene in a Movie: In High Fidelity when john cusack's character imagines beating the crap out of his ex-girlfriends new boyfriend. When his friend just blindsides that guy with the phone. And then they get the air conditioner. It's gold.
