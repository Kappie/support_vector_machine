"falling in love" in two seconds.  and how do i know i sabotage? like, take mitchell for instance. like, when i started being unhappy, i got really mean towards him, hoping he'd get sick of it and dump me first. so i wouldn't have to feel bad. but that's how you know you have a good guy.when you can treat him like he means nothing to you and he still sticks with you. unfortunately, i didn't want him to stick with me. so, after i realized what i was doing, i started looking for any little flaw in him. anything i could catch him on that would give me good enough reason to break up with him. of course, i couldn't find one. then came the night nathan spent the night with philip. i didn't plan for that to happen, i swear. it just did. but afterwards, while thinking, i realized that that was my excuse. that i was bad and i shouldn't be with mitchell b/c i'd cheated on him. of course, i have no balls and couldn't tell him. i just broke up with him for no apparent reason. but i had every intention of telling him. only someone, who will remain nameless, told him first. and yes i know who you are. mitchell didn't tell me, but i know. and i will get you back for that some day. mark me.  but, yes, that's just an example. i did the same thing to charlie, minus the cheating. poor charlie. i used him. i know i did now. before, you couldn't get me to admit that. but i did. but now i know how it feels, and i'm sorry for it. really really sorry for it. but i don't expect forgiveness outta him. i don't deserve it.  and now, with nathan. ehh.......maybe he's right about us not needing to go out right now. something still doesn't settle well with me. really doesn't. i know this, b/c i'm already sabotaging! i won't say how, just in case, but i am. i dunno why either. it's not like he treats me like the princess i am. of course, he's not the dog some of the other guys i've dated are. ok, maybe a little. i know he has a history of cheating, b/c i was involved. therefore......something does not seem right. but i don't want him to be a dog. i want to be able to like him and him not hurt me, or me not ruin everything with my scheming. but no.......something tells me that won't work. and unfortunately i'm a jealous person. i wouldn't be with him prolly if that llittle incident hadn't happened. *sigh* what you don't know won't hurt you.........but i am glad that i know. that way i can keep an eye out, and save face later. it always sucks to have someone cheating on you, and everyone knowing it but you. makes you look like an idiot. *sigh*  now that i don't have the chance, i wanna kiss him.....  damn me and my conscious! damn you conscious! damn you Jiminy Cricket!!! why?!?!?!  meh................................  my burfday is in *counts*.....mmmmmmm..................6 days! woo!  well, that was fun....but now i guess ima go. i dunno what i'm going to do....but something....i guess....  hmmm....time went by quickly....
