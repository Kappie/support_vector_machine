We got ready to leave, and by 8:45 we were out of here. I asked my mom to take me to Diamond Shamrock, and I bought two packs of Pop Rocks for Alek, since I knew that was his favorite candy. We went to Starbucks....Jeanette and Camille got Java Chip fraps, and I got a Vanilla Latte frap. Riane didn't get anything, because she didn't have money, but even so, she isn't allowed to drink coffee!!! Wow. I would die! Well off to school we were to register... I saw Alek pretty soon, I spotted him out from a mile away. Well I went to him and gave him his hat back, and I gave him the Pop Rocks, which he seemed to think was nice. I was wearing my "glasses," because he had asked me to, but I didn't wear my prescribed ones, I wore my fantasy ones, it was funny when I told him that they weren't my actual glasses....he was like "what!?!?!" Anyway, we hung out for a while, then decided we didn't wanna be at school for so long, so we left the school at like 10 and went to the river where I sat on the bridge, and then hung out with Alek. Jeanette was with us too, but she was off in her own world. It was nice sitting by the river and enjoying the day for a while, but then we headed back to school. We got back at around 12 or so. Hmm...well for all of this, Riane had taken this pretty white ribbon to school with her to play with. I use, or should I say used, this ribbon for my hair, but Stephanie killed it. It ripped, and I didn't find out about this till way later in the day. Anyway, she was also eating the Pop Rocks that I had bought Alek...what the fuck!? Oh well. Anyway, I got the whole registration process over with, and then we finally left at like 5 because my mom took forever to pick us up. But........before we left, I cannot forget to put this in here, Jeanette and me saw Roy's pube hairs! Man, it was hilarious, we were talking about something about his body, and he was like well look at my lil v line thingy, and he pushed his pants and boxers down to show us, but he kinda pushed them down too far, lol. Awwe, he was all embarrased, but it was just cute :P Well we all came back to my house and then Jeanette and my mom and me went and picked up Jamie (Jeanette's sister) and dropped her off at work. OMG! There was this lady frozen on the street laying down with her arms and legs in the air, it was horrbile, there was a crowd of people around her, and then we noticed there was a fire truck on it's way to the scene. I had no idea what the hell that was all about, but I just know that it was traumatizing seeing this lady there, it was so horrible!!! Well then we came back to my house to pick up the girls, and we all went to Taco Cabana, but not before stopping by Stephanie's house to pick up Melinda's glasses because her contact lens had torn while she was at my house. So we ate at Taco Cabana, and then went to Mccreless. I bought a skirt for school and Camille and me played Duck Hunt at this little booth where they had this video game thing plugged in. It was pretty fun! So after a while of hanging out tat the ghetto ass mall, we came back to my house. Camille got picked up just as we were about to leave to drop off Riane at her house. So right now I'm just bloggin, (duh) and Jeanette and Melinda are here and they are fingerpainting/painting .
