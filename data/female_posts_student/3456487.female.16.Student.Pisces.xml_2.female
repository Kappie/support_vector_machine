(and tiffany or who ever reads this. let me ask u a question, if u werent invited to a birthday party, who u want someone to say "oh yeah, i am having a party and u r not invited to it cause i dont like u. i wudnt. so last night, tiffany yells at me cause i told the "sisters" who were invited not to tell her. then someone told tiffany who told paige and all hell broke loose. i thought it wud b better if she didnt kno. but now next time it will kno to tell tiffany and paige what they r not invited too.   i also want to let tiffany kno, that it is harder to plan things with her cause a, she work, b, she goes to college and has a different scheduale. so i am sorry. but its hard. i dont think she understands that. we plan things last minute alot, so we dont always call her, agian, cause we dont want to rub it in her face. and when we plan something a week or so in advance, then we tell she and see if you want to come.   and i am sorry if paige feels left out but she didnt sit with us alot the past few months. and if she didnt sit with us cause she felt left out, then how is she supposed to feel back in if she doesnt talk to us. we dont c her, how can we read her mind?)
