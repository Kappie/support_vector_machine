Once it finally came out (in 2002), it was prohibitively expensive. then, the copy in our university library system spent months in 'route' - basically getting its barcode stuck on. it always shocks me how slow academic publishing can be. of course, i'm not shocked by how long things at ubc can take. but that's a different (and *really* boring) story.   today i finally got my hands on this book (i'd forgotten about it for a while) and low and behold, it's got an entire chapter section devoted to some of the native-style artists I'm working on for my MA. I had no idea! As Jacknis' historical research is much more meticulous than my own, it'll help me fill in a lot of empirical gaps. i really look forward to reading more of this work - it seems very well written and impeccibly (sp?) researched. it's such a treat to find such a useful text!
