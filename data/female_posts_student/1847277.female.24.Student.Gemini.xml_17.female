Now I need to catch up with some email.  Noah has renewed his promise to send the photo CD, but Matt wants to make a bet about whether I'll get the CD or he'll get his mandolin (ordered 2 months ago) first.  It's possible that we'll never see either of them...  Speaking of that, while I understand that some people are just not good at email, it still bothers me.  When I invest a lot in a friendship I expect some decent communication.  Guess we can't always get what we want.  Righto.
