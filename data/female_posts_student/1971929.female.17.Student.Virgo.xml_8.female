As our story begins, our hero is riding in the car with Ashley, sister, and sister's friend. She has procured shotgun and her head is filled with excitement. She is on her way. However, a quick stop to pick up friend Rachel Cornelius ends in tragedy after a broadcast airs on the radio.     "Um, well it looks like Warped Tour is going to be postponed until Monday. That's Monday. It seems that they were unable to setup due to the torrential downpour last night, of course they will be back on Monday, so don't worry about the wasted money," the announcer person said.    Our hero's smile now turns upside down, but is interrupted by a phone call. Ashley answers:    "Hello? Yeah, I know, we just heard it on the radio. OK. OK, bye."    Could this be the end for our hero? Will she survive yet another day's workload of garage sale duty? Tune in next time for Chapter Three of our saga: The Return of the Tour.
