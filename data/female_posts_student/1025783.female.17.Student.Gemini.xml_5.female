I never saw the other people in the household, and after a while they gave up on me and just let me do as I pleased. My own mother eventually ignored me, but I didn't care. It was sad how cold we had grown towards one another, but we all knew that we would rather our neighbor die then ourself. Then one night I knew what I had to do. I had to find where they hid during the day. Always from the east they came, but we had been over that area many times, it just opened up into miles and miles of forest. We had all stood on the brink of that hill during the sunny afternoon, shaking our heads in disgust because we all knew it was impossible to find them in that mess. But somehow, somehow it must be possible. I knew I would have to find a way to detect their hiding place, or we would all be driven mad by their nightly singing and taunting. So one night, I did the unspeakable. I followed them.
