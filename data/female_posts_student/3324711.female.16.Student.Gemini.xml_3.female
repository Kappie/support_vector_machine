Anyway what a great night, a whole lot better than last but whatever. Im so excited about this whole thing and yes, Im a huge dork. thats just me, so youll have to accept it.. or you could always just stop reading. Its all up to you. Im not sure if tomarrow will be quite such an eventful day but hopefully it will be. Gym tomarrow Lauren, whoop! Tyler if your reading this, you should write more in your blog because it makes me laugh. I love it.  Plus Im wearing my band sweater tomarrow.. it is so comfy, you dont understand, unless you have one of your own of course. If you come up to me asking about the fuzziness of it, I will understand completely and let you feel it.. mmm fuzzy. It would have been so much better if we got black sweaters with white writing.. classy. but meh, they rock anyway. Way to conform morgan..
