(which, in fact, i did, which caused a lot of embarrassment, but if you want, i can tell the story.)  anyway i'm honoured to be the almighty saver of springy onions!! they're victims worthy of saving!! because they add flavour to tofu!! and once again, happy birthday sharon!!   for all of you who missed it..."nyeah nyeah nyeah" - quote lizlaw.  hope you all are doing fine and please pray for Louisa as she jets off to Thailand...sawadika!!
