Thank god for work, it sounds stupid but at least it keeps me from thinking too much..I worked today and I work tomorrow and saturday. I also have to wake up at 7 am on Saturday. Okay so I get home and just got out of the shower and all of a sudden I hear my mom yelling at the TOP of her lungs at tim, like straight out screaming and cursing at him, because of cereal and he's standing there taking it all..and all I can think is how immature and selfish that is of her...then it hit me, that's me. That's who I've been my whole life and it's taken me 16 years to realize it..like yes, I've lost a lot of people in my life that don't get me wrong I've cared about but maybe it's because I'm growing or maybe it's because I love those people I just lost more than anyone I thought I could love or maybe because it's so obvious and blunt that it was all my fault..for whatever reason, this has changed me. I see now how ugly I really am and I want to change. I don't/can't run away anymore. For once, I've never been more alone in my life but then again I"ve never been more ashamed of myself. I came up with a quote I like "If I could, I'd walk back to my past and change it all because I'm dying in this present and I don't want to see the darkness of my future". My mom's getting me into the RecPlexx gym so I can work out 24/7 cuz she's like 'wut else r u gonna do this summer' and she's right I guess, it's not going to be anyhint like last summer so I might as well shape up. Well I'm going to go..bye..here's a good nfg lyric.. "I'd kill to fall asleep"
