Tomorrow morning I will be making my way to longview where Kelsey lives and will stay with her over the holiday weekend to return Monday.  because my blogging habits have reached the point of unhealthy psychological dependence and because Kelsey does not have internet hookup in her apartment, I will be utilizing the newly discovered audioblogger to keep everything up to speed.   I can't wait to see Kelsey. She recently returned from new York after singing at Carnegie hall and I am sooo proud of her. I think everyone who's ever met Kelsey has fallen in love with her instantly, seeing as she is the nicest person I know. Perhaps she has digitized a few of her pictures from new York and I'll be able to copy them on CD and post them?  the only thing I'm not sure of as far as kelsey's goes is the fact that longview is practically a hop, skip and a jump from Tyler and we'll probably be heading to daddy's house for fourth of July. Mom seems to be quite worried about this, as they've been indirectly feuding about it for quite a while, beginning with my plans to spend the summer there falling through, mompat's heart attack, and the so on so fourth details that aren't important.
