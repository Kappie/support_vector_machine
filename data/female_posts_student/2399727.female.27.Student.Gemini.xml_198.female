The revised grades will be posted in 7-10 days.  I love the prof; I think without her this would be much more difficult than it needs to be.  I even got my own,  massive  question booklet back.  (They blew it up to 11x17 paper so I can see it better.  Looks like wallpaper.)    Went to 12:10 Mass.  D. was celebrant.  Unsure why he never replied to my email but I guess he's busy or couldn't care less.    Visited CALSS today.  Threw the guy off a bit by changing gears but I was happier with the outcome.  I feel like chicken tonight...  More to come...
