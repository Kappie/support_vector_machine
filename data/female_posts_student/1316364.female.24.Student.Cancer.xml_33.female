    
       This week has gone by so fast. I will be flying back home in one day and I hate the idea of having to say goodbye again. I guess I will do what I did last time and wish Jesse good luck and tell him I will be waiting for him to come home. Yesterday we took a long drive to White Sands New Mexico to visit the White Sand Dunes. It was very beautiful. We went on a sunset tour of a Dune Basin and just around sunset we walked to a nice dune and watched to sun set behind a great wall of mountains. We also purchased a disk and took a few slides down the side of a steep Dune. I am pretty sure I got a picture of David doing this. It was very fun. I took some amazing pictures and will post a few of them. I am not to sure what we are going to do today but I figure whatever the venture, we will make the best of it. I have come to realize that every day you get to spend with a loved one is the greatest gift anyone can ask for.
