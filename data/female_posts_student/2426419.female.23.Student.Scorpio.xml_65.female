( i also believe that no analogy is even close to perfect...and there are complicated philosophical reasons for that)    now, don't get me wrong, i love it that we could know anything of what god's character/make-up is, but i don't think we're really that close by looking at humans.  i think we can get a hair closer by remembering that "creation" does not mean just humans.  what about dolphins, caterpillars turning into butterflies, sand, or the moons of jupiter?     cool.  i'm adding this section through clicking the edit button...there's nothing like never being finished.  okay.  i also wanted to say that creation is not the only way for me to get a glimpse of god's character/make-up.  i believe we also have a very extensive narrative of creation's interaction with the creator.  reductions may be all we have to work with, but it is all we have when we begin to piece together a jigsaw puzzle. (never buy a thomas kincaid jigsaw puzzle, though.  he's pretty cocky)  welcome chaddermac - where are you tiny  out
