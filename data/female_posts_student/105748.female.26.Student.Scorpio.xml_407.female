I am cancelling my account with AOL and I have to upload all the stuff I linked to this blog.  Dot's friends from Buffalo are coming to NYC this weekend.  Looks like I am the chauffer for most of the day on Friday.  I hope they tip well  =).  Happy FRIDAY!   (_)_) NET   PS. My email for now is netpanday@yahoo.com.
