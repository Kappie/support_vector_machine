Tomorrow I am supposed to be starting my new job at Chapters but unfortunately my boss at my current job is being a pain in the butt and will not let me have tomorrow off, so now I got to be in two places at once!! I called Chapters to re-schedule but so far I have not heard anything.  Lord, I need a miracle and I know you hear cries like mine! I hope next week is better. My old roommate of 2 years is getting married next week! Crazy but good! I hope that the weather is nice and I hope it all turns out.  The whole thing marriage is so weird! Maybe it's only weird to me since I have so much excess baggage!!
