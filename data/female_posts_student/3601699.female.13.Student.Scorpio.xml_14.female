Mmkay, so todaaaay, I bought a purdy necklace. (That's right. I said purdy. People always question me whenever I use that term.) It's a Celtic symbol for an iris, the same symbol as the one on the Quebec flag. Here's what it said on the bit of cardboard it came on:        "FLUER DE LEIS: The Fluer De Leis is the sign of the House of Bourbon, a family which has, or had, a member in every royal house in Europe. 'The Flower of Leis' is still found on the standards of several ruling families, including that of Spain. It is actually an iris, and is most associated with France."        Now, personally, I'm not all that emotionally attached to France or European politics. However, this is such a nice necklace that I felt I should have some sort of story to tell people when they ask about it. To help me come up with such a story, I did about 5 minutes of online research on iris' (irises?) and came up with the following:     "Well you see, I like to think of the iris as a flower with similar characteristics to an avid go-getter. For example, iris' grow in deserts, swamps, the far North...pretty much everywhere. As people, it's a good idea for us to also explore new surroundings and adapt to unfamiliar environments. As a second point, iris actually means rainbow, and there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow, so I figure that those with similar qualities to the iris in matters of perseverance and adaptability will be rewarded in the future."        Yeah yeah, I know it's a smart-ass thing to say. It's usually adults who ask about things like that though, and they're usually impressed with children actually having something intelligent to say at their parents' get-togethers.
