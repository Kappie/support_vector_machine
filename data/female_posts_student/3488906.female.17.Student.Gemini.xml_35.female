The moment i wake up, i slapped my face ( 輕輕d ) and call myself stupid or useless. Sometimes i feel that i cant really achieve my target. Or i dont seem to have a target of my own? 8As. I never seemed to work hard for it though, not trying my best but am still trying. Got fatter. CAnt resist good food. Dang.  I've got a strange feelin that laobah will be leaving irc. I dont want that to happen. How i wished i can tell her how much i liked her as a fren or even a closer relationship, lao ba. I cant deny that i rely on her as much as lao bu, i just liked her.she's someone who keeps things to herself, only to herself. I know and i admit that i am a burden to her, eventho i liked her that much ( and i dont think she can sense it ) but i dont think she'll like me in another way. How i wished i can tell her how important she is to me. just like lao bu. Duh. I'm only making things worst. How i wished she and lao bu can always be at my side. Well, i know it's a selfish thought and that's quite impossible.   Tired. Here goes my day, wasted online.
