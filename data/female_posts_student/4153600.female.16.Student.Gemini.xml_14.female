My own space, for me to speak my mind, to ponder on my confused life, and just to pour out my feelings and expressions, onto deaf ears. I've tried blogging once, but had been too busy to update it. It was long gone forgotten, until I saw jinn khing's blog. It suddenly changed the whole prespective of what blogging's for.  Reality, there's nobody I can turn to, when I'm facing problems.. Which one could not understand. They think they do, but they don't- I have no true friends, but at least i still have my true love. But sometimes, i feel that he, too, doesn't really understand what I'm trying to say. Thus, couldn't help me overcome my problems. I know he tries, but boys will be boys. Boys don't listen, they talk.. :( sigh..  On the other hand, it could be me. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just a loner. My results are slipping. I need help, drastically. But i know the only person that can help me- is me. Wah tries his best to support me, motivates me to study, and he too, i hope, will do the same to study hard and get good results in his SPM. I really hope he does. It's his last year, and I think that he should give it all his best. Promises have been made between us and I hope each of us do our part by keeping it. He said, if i get good results this semester, he'll do anything i want! ^_^ Hm.. lemme see..  1) Bring me for a joyride 2) A massaging session    3) Send me roses 4) A wedding ring  HEHE..
