That was THE SINGLE MOST IDIOTIC THING I have ever heard(Maybe I exaggerate a little...but not much.)  I know(actually hope) it wasn't your attention span that caused you to miss this but in the ohh...SECOND LINE I apologized to Seth.  I can handle the fact I upset people.  I am at peace with that.  Everyone upsets someone at some time.  You have to learn that you can't please everyone.  You are the upset one.  It is your problem to deal with not mine.  When did I blame?  There is a word for you...If I could spell it I would use it.  nuch schlepp!(Thanks grams.)
