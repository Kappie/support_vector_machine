But hey Izzy, you must be getting loads of money from this! I'm gonna go scrub mold off of bath tyles for money! (Sigh, reduced to that!) Oh well, I don't care, so long as I'm helping. Today every one's leaving me alone with my grandpa and great aunt. We're probably gonna spend the whole day either watching cricket or going to the pub! Fun! Well I'm reading some thing so bubi!
