And yes, it is dead most of the time, but today it was on silent and stored in my pocket, whereafter I pretty much missed every call I got all day, the total being 13 with 5 voicemails...that's the most in one day,  ever . And hey...your mom was pissed, I toldja so. Whadid I do to make her all mad at me? After you made me out to be the prodigal son and all. Cry.
