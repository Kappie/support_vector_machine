I got two prayer letters from Mary (going to LA missions) and Wayne  Ruth (Nepal).  Today during service we sent off the Equador team that consists mostly of high schoolers or recent high school grads.  It's good to see people younger and in my age group going off to missions.  When will it be my turn?  Seeing B's mom after service today was an unexpected treat.  I was looking around for her during service, but I didn't see her.  When she found me, I was happy to hear that she was actually looking for me after service.  I think we were both excited to see eachother.  We had a really easy conversation--not awkward at all, which was a blessing. Now I can see why B and his mom are so close--she seems really fun just to hang out and play board games with. Could she be my future mother-in-law?  That would be totally awesome, not only because I would be married to B, but also b/c I can see myself adoring his family.   I talked to Sue quite a bit today.  I'm glad to hear that she was feeling better today. This past week she was near tears several times when she called me at work because of her chronic TMJ pain. She told me when I dropped her off after church that she got a $600 scholarship to pay for her expenses from her trip to Atlanta (which only amounted to ~$300).  I think she can manage to pay the rest, but she wants to do more research about what kind of splints are out there.  I can't believe she didn't tell me about that sooner...not that I'm offended, but that's BIG news! God is totally providing for her financially, which was the only constraint to getting her splint.  She was so down emotionally about being in pain that she was even begging God to "take her".  That kind of talk totally scares me, even though she's told me that she's not suicidal or anything. This new windfall was just what she needed to lift her spirits (and mine). Does God ever fail to provide for our needs? NEVER!  I also chatted briefly with Mary after Sunday School when she gave me her prayer letter.  I asked somewhat fearfully how things were going at home, because I didn't want to stir up bad memories. Instead, she told me that things were going great and she had a really good talk with her mom.  They resolved a lot of misunderstandings about her mom favoring her brother and such. Now her mom is making a much bigger effort to cook for the family and take better care of Mary.  She said that she's even spoiling her! WOW.  That's amazing. This is more evidence that God answers prayers and that He is a God of reconciliation.  B told me that Leon went to church with him today and he said that Leon wants to go with him every Sunday! Not only that, but another student in the 1st year class wants to go too! I think it's really amazing how God brings people to HIMSELF and chooses to involve us, instead of us actively bringing people to God.  Does that makes sense? I think this is great on several different levels: 1) Having people go to church with B is good accountibility and 2) this is spiritually encouraging to B.  Getting sleepy now and it's not even 10am yet.  Being in the sun is draining, or maybe I'm just getting older.
