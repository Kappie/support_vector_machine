I sometimes feel like everyone else's life would have just been better if i hadn't been born, or if I died. It's so pathetic though...of course people would be sad. Very few though.   I just want somebody to hold on to, who can tell me everything is going to be alright, and I don't have that. School is out, the only friends I see are Corey and Erika...My mom hates me, my dad is completely horrible, and my sister hates me like she always has. Kevin hates me...I think that a few people in school liked me, but school is out and I don't know who to turn to.  Erika is really pathetic. She has to have everything her own way, and she is the center of the universe. Anyone who declares otherwise, should run for his life. I mean, I just hate her. And it's real. I mean, I just don't like her at all, and I wish she would die. Watch, tomorrow I will be all- I love Erika, but from now on...I don't know.  I hate me! Why the hell is everything so messed up. We were talking and Erika had brought up something about Corey and me being a pushover. She says that I am stubborn and I always have to argue and stand up to people and then I claimed that I didn't- for example Corey. And she said that he's got control over me, and I realized that she's right. I don't know why...I mean, it's like Corey's a special case...and with me, that's definitely something when it comes to me standing up for myself. Why do I let anybody have that control over me? I just can't let him find out because it would give him complete control over me and he's too much like me already. He would work me and get what he wanted way too much...Love is blind, and I love him as a friend...but I love Erika, and yeah, I still do, yet I argue with her so much it's not even funny.  Omg...I am a weak person today. Tomorrow I am going in the pool and that's all I want to do. I would be so happy to fricken drown while swimming. It would be perfect..except I am utterly afraid of drowning. Whatever..I babble. I don't know what I am going to do with myself.  Best Friends as of This Morning:  -Corey -Kellie -Erika  I miss Kellie. She had her date with Lance last night...wonder how it went. :-) She probably wasn't paying attention for most of the movie. Whatever. Everyone loves Kellie...  Well, I am gonna go to sleep and stop dwelling on my retarded problems for a couple of hours. I love having this, I don't need to complain to people as much...
