I mean, yeah sure, his sickness maybe be chronic but it does have its ups and downs. And when it gets down too long, I am very sure he has trouble just keeping his patience. It gets sad and gloomy around the house when his giddy spells are real bad. He does try to keep a cheerful face so that we won't worry so much. So when he complains about being stuck up in the house and not being able to do work, you know its really really really bad. To tell you the truth, I can't help but admire how he manages to keep his sanity when the going gets tough. And I am very sure how he does it is by keeping in touch with the master. Sometimes I wonder what if I were to be put in his shoes, man, I probably would have given up halfway. Or quarter way for that fact. But also I suppose he has my mom for support. They'd been pledged together in Holy Matrimony for 25 years this year. And I have come to observe that the giddy spells have been taking its toll on mom too. Not that she gets them, but because dad gets them and thus lots of dissapointments arise. I suppose after a while, life becomes so stale and when they are so many dissapointments, even if they are like small things? I don't know. I don't think its good either, allowing life to become stale with the little hills of dissapointments around you. Sometimes though, when the spells stop coming for a while, everyone will be happy and cheerful and bright. And then the house plunges again, into semi-darkness. I for one thing, am grateful because I have my computer, handphone, housephone to keep in contact with friends and all, to sorta avoid the gloom which has set in. That sounds so selfish, and it is. Ok, I must quit that mindset. But yeah, I do TRY to get mom out of the house for some fellowship with church members once in a while. It seems they spend too much time with themselves. I'm glad my bro will be coming back next week. It'll cheer up the place a lil bit. :) And then another thing on my mind, one of my close friend, she got sick becos of too much stress and pressure. And GOODNESS me, its only the midterms... imagine the real PMR, she'll probably dunno do what....  :S  Right now prayers are focused on Dad, Esther, Jon's Steph, Jon, Grace and Ivan, Gladys, Gorgor, Mom, Su Li, and exams.
