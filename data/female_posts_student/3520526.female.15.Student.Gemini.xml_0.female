Man it is so not partly sunny out today. yeah i am doubting my courage in this "civil war"...i doubt anything will happen like always.lol well i don't know..i suppose i need to get some courage one of these days. Reminds me of the cowardly lion (if you have not seen the wizard of oz..i am ashamed)anyways, i think i need to see if this oz guy is really livin up to his standards. Actually, if i remeber correctly, oz wasa total wimp who hid in a shower curtain or something. Maybe i should just ask toto? Au revior till i write again... -buzz
