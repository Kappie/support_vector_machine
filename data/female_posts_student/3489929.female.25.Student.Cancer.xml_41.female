You may be uncertain about how much value others place on your work. Now, something can happen to make you realize that others don't necessarily know what you really do and that they cannot properly judge your contribution.  What's most important now is not what others think about you; it's about what you believe about yourself.    Talk about being a day late and a dollar short. Where were the stars yesterday when I really could have used this???  Everyone in this state forgets how to drive when it rains. It's not as though everyone really knows how to drive under ordinary circumstances anyway, but when it rains, it's like, "Oh, no! It's wet and cold and slick! I think I'll drive 5 miles an hour in the left lane and piss everyone else off!" or "Wow! It's like a Slip-n-Slide! Let me drive faster and swerve into other lanes, careening at top speed!"  Needless to say, I did not enjoy my drive home, even though I made good time. It only took me about 30 minutes to get home, which on 280 traffic is unusual even in nice weather.  I spent the day wishing for 5:00. Now I will spend the weekend wishing I could stay at home for a month and recuperate. That job takes what little sanity I have and spreads it thin.  I think I will spend part of the day tomorrow at Books-a-Million. I love that place. :) Books are balm to my weary soul.  I must be tired. That was almost profound.
