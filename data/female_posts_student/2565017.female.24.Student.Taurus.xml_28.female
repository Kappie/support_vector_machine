It's empty! *giggles* I had to put all the things I collected to the basked back to their own places and leave back home empty handed.   I'll try again later with better luck...  lol .  This silliness can be caused by 2 things in my life right now 1) I have really nasty  urlLink dysmenorrhea  right now... 2) I just got a surprise phonecall from my sweetheart :D It made me grin like mad and just forget about  everything  sensible :)   I'm betting on the latter reason :P  Hmm, what comes to my webdesign... I did plan something on paper, but it looks way too conventional... *sigh* I don't think my brain is going to do any creative work today. I'm also experiencing difficulty with my A-drive.... I don't get it why it is the way it is. I can get a normal sized diskette in there only if I fold it, lol. Why is the A-drive so small? Someone PLEASE tell me... is it for MP3s of what? My lappy handbook doesn't say anything about the A-drive....  I'm giving up on computers for a while now and give in to my stomach pains. *sigh* and wait for my love to call me again.... I'm counting on him to cheer me up. He always does, like no one else :D  P.S. The very strange weather continues in this town... today it's been on and off sunshine, not very warm, but with  snowing (!??!)  in between!!! Crazy!
