Overall, it was easier than thought it would be, considerng that I only studied half-heartedly all weekend.  It makes me a little worried because there are still a lot of people who aren't done yet so it makes me wonder if I rushed through it carelessly.  I don't think so because  I was pretty confident about the answers I put.  Then again, I was pretty sure about my answers for the last repro quiz and I only got 7/10... Well, I shouldn't be conscious about how quickly other people finished anyway.  I guess that's another thing I need to work on--comparing myself to other people too much.  I'm feeling kinda crampy to day so I'm glad that I don't have class again until 1pm.  Two hours of small animal medicine...bleh.  I feel like such a dummy when it comes to respiratory diseases.  Do dogs get allergic rhinitis or not?!?!  My notes say "no", but Nozomi and my practical experience say "yes".  *sigh*  3.5 for days until B comes!!  I'm glad that I'll be busy between now and then with the Mercer VAD because that will make the time go by faster.  I almost wish that I hadn't done the Anesthesiology midterm so early because now I have nothing to work on when I get home.  Idleness absolutely drives me crazy!  I feel the need to be busy all the time, or else I feel unproductive, and unproductiveness = :( .  I think I'll go home and do my QT (which reminds me that I should order _Experiencing God_).  Another thing I need to do: write and mail thank-you notes to Sue and Tracy for their birthday gifts.  It kinda makes me bummed that Jon completely missed my birthday.  I don't even think he realizes even now that it was last week.
