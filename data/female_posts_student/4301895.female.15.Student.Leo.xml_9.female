Some things can only be seen when you've lost everything.  Oh wind, I will stand and face you! I will go to the sea of anguish, though bonds cut my chest, and the crushing waves are endless. What does everyone seek by fighting? Does spilled blood cause flowers to bloom? Until the precious tomorrow is in my hands... Until the day we meet... Oh wind, I will stand and face you! I will go and head for the brilliance. Embracing prayer to my heart, I wander the seemingly dark future. Oh wind, I am not afraid! Love is the miracle I have found! It's my joy to believe in you. The storm blows so that we might realize [our] love.	 ''Sea of Miracles'' - By Dani  ~A memorial to Danielle~
