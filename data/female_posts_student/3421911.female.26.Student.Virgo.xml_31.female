We just happened to exchange epiglottises in her car just to piss my then girlfriend off.  Anyway, we didn’t talk for a year but I did call her up after my ex broke up with me.  To blame her, to vent, to talk.  We were friends.  Besides, when she was having problems with her girlfriend, she talked to me, to vent, to cry, to talk.  I was under the impression that she understood me and had the capacity to clear my head.  When I was trying to hide from my girlfriend (  translation:  “I want to be alone”  ), I was with her.  She made me see things I couldn’t admit to myself because I was so madly in love with the ex.    She told me that we’d talk or at least keep in touch, when she and her live-in girlfriend split up.  Not so much so that I could get into the picture but so that we would be able to talk freely.  Her girlfriend had the knack of being jealous of everybody (my, uh, “friend” was such a slut anyway.  She could easily get away with cheating because the girlfriend would believe her and declare war against anyone who supposedly flirts with her hubby.   Sweetie, wake up and smell the coffee!  Sometimes, it’s YOUR GIRLFRIEND who does the flirting and you buy her puppy eyes whenever she lies to you!!! )Which is why I can’t exactly call her up or text her if the  kumander  is there.    However, they were supposedly going to be separated from bed and board.   My friend never really texted me, called or emailed me if it pushed through or not, because I did want to console her.  Besides, I got problems too and I was under the impression (false impressions.   I stand by what I said:  people have never failed to disappoint me. ) that I was important enough to be informed if they got back together or if it was okay to text or not.    I’m obviously not as important as she said I was.  It’s obviously one of those lines she uses on everybody.  Hell, I fell for it.  If not for anything, I thought she was my friend.  I thought wrong.  So it’s my turn, HON, to say your 7 favorite words:  DON’T WORRY, I WILL LEAVE YOU ALONE.     nuninu    People are natural editors.  They have this knack for adding or subtracting from statements so that something totally simple turns out to be complicated.  People leave out important details to save themselves.  Ever wonder how one story can have several different versions?  this is exactly what happened among my roommates and me.  i wasn't exactly fighting with anyone, they were at each other's throats. as much as possible,  i don't take sides because it's not fair and i wouldn't really want people to take my side if i was wrong.  hell, i'm always wrong.  anyway, i only react based on information given to me.  if i am given wrong information, i give the wrong reaction.  it's just like how a computer works - GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT.  i explain myself to them and i try as much as i can to listen to both sides and try to defend the other when the other speaks about the other badly.  but then, what i said was completely distorted and it ended up horribly.  it looked like i made them fight over something as trivial as using maxipeel and who should wash the dishes, etc.  i feel so betrayed and they felt i betrayed them.  it's dirty, and i don't even like to wash my dirty linen in public.  i feel so bad and angry.  oh well, people have disappointed me once again.    nuninu    I love my law school.  If fortunate to pass the bar exams, or even top it, I will not only wear my gay colors proudly, but I will scream to the top of my lungs my roots.  what pisses me off about my beloved law school is the fact that they don't exactly take care of its barristers (and they wonder why we have such a low passing percentage).  i have seen this all the four years i've worked as a  member of the bar operations committee.  the system hasn't changed.  all other law schools get the support they need, financial and otherwise from their school administrations, but not us.  we have to be the one to fix our papers, we have to pay for everything and we have to take the frigging exam.  not to mention, we're the ones they blame solely for the embarrassing performance when not all of us will pass. wonderful.  i've said this before, if the students don't take themselves seriously, the other schools won't respect us either.  but how can we develop that respect if our own school administration doesn't think we're good enough?
