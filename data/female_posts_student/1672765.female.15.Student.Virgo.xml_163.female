School tomorrow. Nothing to look foward to this week.  6  more weeks of school exactly. That's 30 days! Wow! 30! I'm not looking foward to summer really. Not like I usually am. I would if I had a job. But I have a problem that I don't like to admit and that's why I don't want it to be summer. It's a bad problem and I'm ashamed of it and I hate it but I know it has to be a semi-serious problem if I try so hard to help it and stop but I do it anyway no matter what. I tell myself things to make it seem okay but then after a little bit I realize I shouldn't have done that and I'm so mad at myself for saying those things to myself.  During the school week I don't have time to do this really but on weekends and breaks I do so that's why I don't like them and why I would rather be at school.  I'd rather be at school than do this. It must be a problem. I don't want help. But maybe I need it. I've gotta help myself.
