You'd think I'd be used to it, going to Parkway and all that...people tell me I have no life all the time, and that I'm ugly and have no friends and should go live in a hole.  After a while it stops hurting--and then it does again.  I hate...them.  The It people.  You were wrong, G, I'm not loved.  By these people here.  You probably know nothing about the It people, it's no secret that they hate me.  But these people just keep avoiding me.  Except I am admin to the TABASCO one now, and all...okay, Ursula doesn't hate me.  And G, you don't, do you?  And I don't know--Jessica, do you hate me?  But Shine does, don't you Shine?  You never talk to me anymore...don't you care?  All the good times we had...they were just a joke for you, weren't they?  All that talk of Germany, all lies, every bit.  I knew it.  You were wrong, G, and I don't appreciate it at all.  Not a bit.
