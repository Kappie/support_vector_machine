And you know, its true. friends do stand you up. they make these big gorgeous plans, and at last minute, "nope sorry cant do that." its already happened to me. its a part of life, i guess, disapointment - and knowing that your friends arent perfect and that you will have to make sacrifices for them. its sad, but i guess thats the way it goes.   but, i dont like the philosophy that not having friends makes you a happy person. it doesnt, not really. you're actually more depressed when you dont have friends. family is all right, but when you need to talk about sex, about drugs, about the things you dont want to say to your family, who do you turn to? friends. and some friends are like vampires and they suck your blood to make themselves look cool and popular, and those friends turn out to be not friends at all. some friends are like dummies and ditzesand all they'll talk about is guys and make up.   im not saying that if you and your friends talk about guys and make up its stupid, but 24/7 yakking about the same subject can get pretty dull.  and then there are those great friends who will sacrifice a lot for you. like once, i was really, really pissed, and sad, and angry about nothing. it was just one of those days. and i told my friend, and we went on the bus, and i was like, "god, i just feel like killing someone, like screaming." so, she had a crush on the bus back then. it was her fav time of day, to be near him. and she pulled me off that bus so we could walk home and she could hear me scream. and i screamed, and we talked, and i was so grateful to her. i know what its like, when you have a crush and something comes up so you cant be near them. but it made me realize that having arelationship is a tough thing - you sacrifice, you cry, you get mad at each other, you lie, etc.   but the funny, funny thing is, is thats its worth it. its worth the blood and the tears and the joy. and if you have had a friend that makes you work for those blood and tears and joy, you know that they're worth it.   ok, end of my long rambling.  love, gina
