If you haven't heard, there was a "big" (meaning a few hundred bored college students) push on some college campuses to have  urlLink John Cusack run for President of the United States . I even printed out the poster for his campaign and posted it on my wall. Though, it turns out that Cusack (sometimes I like to think he would like me to call him John), doesn't want to run for president. He states,  urlLink "Yeah, it's pretty galling. But it would probably be a good idea -- if it wasn't me." . I don't presume to know Cusack's inner thoughts, but I could see how he would have no desire to mess around with such an ugly, and almost worthless, game. After all politics has been called the Hollywood for ugly people. And Johnny aint no ugly person...  And if you were wondering, yes, I do worship Mr. Cusack... Ok, maybe worship is a strong word... Does writing pointless blog entries count as worship? Err, how bout owning more John Cusack movies than all other movies combined (not quite true)? Sacrificing goats to His Johness on His birthday(not likely)? Well, ok, that last one certainly counts as worship...  So, what do you say Kami and Kate? Can I invite Johnnykins to join us as co-blogger? Unfortunately his 10,512,000 minutes (~20 years if I am not a complete moron) of fame would probably far outclass our combined 45 minutes. 10,512,045 Minutes of Fame would still make a good title. Right? Actually, I did have some serious, but obvious, suggestions for this blog. We should set up a message board and having links to our emails would be nice tooâ€¦ And you two should link to this page from your blogs, as you two are famous and I want to be famous as well. Anyway, J.C. if you are reading this, send me an email and we will commence negotiations for having you come on board!
