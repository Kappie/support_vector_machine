Not only is Fox being intervened because of the possible boxing matches that took place without a licensed promoter, NBC also claims that Fox stole the idea in the first place from them. As of now the chairman of commission, Sanford L. Michealman, has scheduled another hearing on July 21 and subpoenaed all the companies involved with the Fox production including Endemol, Lock and Key, and Golden Boy enterprises. Now the question is what penalty if any should Fox receive? Can the commission allow Fox to air a reality show that might have been staged considering their wasn't a licensed official for some of the matches?    In my opinion I don't think Fox or NBC should be allowed to air their boxing reality shows this fall. The situation is completely unethical. Fox would make money off a show that isn't even real, which I believe it has to be for the sake of being called reality TV. Even if viewers don't watch the Fox version of the show because they know it is probably staged, then they will tune in to NBC. Now NBC is profiting from Fox's former misfortunes. Not only that, these shows could hurt the companiesreputation.As a viewer of many television reality shows, I feel that both stations, if decideto air the shows,wouldn't get that many viewers anyway because of this scandalous outbreak. Many people will probably have heard about the lack of accuracy in the show and find it to be a big joke.It seems to me that Fox tried to cut corners to beat NBC to the punch of broadcasting the first ever boxing reality show. In doing so, they left out some key paperwork that is now causing them more trouble than what they were expecting.Now Foxwillaccomplish indoing the opposite ofwhat theyintended which was toget ahead. Other networks are all ready taking this opportune moment to go to the drawing board and come up with something that will be even better than reality boxing.
