But when a man like Randy Johnson throws a perfect game, it's more than just his 15 minutes of fame. It's the crescendo on a career that had already stamped him as one of the most overpowering left-handers of his -- or any -- time."  Sometimes, especially after having a hard day, life seems to be dull.  When in that mood, something must help me get out of it. Yesterday's savior was the perfect show of the Big Unit.  It is very strange that glory of others can relieve my OWN pain. But it happens.  I'm regularly watching baseball and basketball news these days.  It is my relatively new habit, because I didn't watch sports news  since I was a freshman.  In my high school days (a.k.a. Dark Age), I always watched sports news.  But when I'd become an undergraduate, life was so good, and I felt no need to watch TV or newspaper because I had plenty of fascinating things to do instead.  Now, I'm again watching sports news everyday.  I don't feel sad.  But it's a life.
