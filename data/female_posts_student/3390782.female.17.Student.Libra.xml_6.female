I am so sick of everyone just acting like their so much better than me and walking all over me like I'm a piece of shit! I'm human, too, goddamn it! I have feelings that get hurt just like all of you! I wish that someone...anyone would just take a minute out to care about me for once. To care about how I feel and what I want. I'm always doing things that male other people happy and I don't even care about myself. I'm so sick and tired of faking happiness, of putting on this facade to make everyone believe that I'm happy when I'm not. I'm dying on the inside! Every moment that I have to live this fake life, I want to die!
