(i would say please save me from hell for saying the following things, but i think this past week has absolved me of any past or future wrong doings, and shouldgrant me sainthood.  sorry mary, i guess i won't beyour co-pilot on the bus to hell .) let me tell you a little secret: this was the  MOST PAINFUL  experience of my life.     my reasons      two little words:  my child  . i never noticed this before, but this phrase drives me batty. i guess it is because it is said by smug individuals who really seem to have no life outside of bragging about their  horrible child . example utterance, "Well," said ultra smugly with a nose pointing upwards and eyes looking down upon the other people in the pseudo conversation, " my child  is perfect in every way."  i discovered that i am in fact allergic to something...  the country . this was discovered when i couldn't stop sneezing and my head couldn't stop throbbing until i drove back to civilization to breathe dirty air. also, i am absolutely terrified by a pitch black sky and the silence of the middle of nowhere.  parents are really fucking stupid. honestly, i had hopes that these parents would disprove my theory that the majority of the population is composed of idiots because these are the parents of children at a smart and elitist college. but i was wrong, so very very wrong.  to keep myself slightly sane and to keep from gnawing my ears off, i decided to keep tallies of idiocy. my favorite moments where the parents absolutely flipping out about the meal plans. see the kids can have unlimited meals in the dining halls during the regular hours of operation, and they get an additional $200 to spend at other campus eateries.  eight  parents made a huge fuss about this, in a comical way as if their poor little johnny was going to starve to death... which leads into the next point (and makes me wonder why i'm numbering these points in the first place)  people do not listen to other people. most parents (like in the starving issue above) wouldn't listen to the previous questions, and would ask the same damn questions that had already been asked. it seemed that most of these parents were ultra eager to open their mouths and spew the toxic waste about how perfect  their child  is, and would only wait for the lapse in conversation to spew.  two words:   GOOD MORNING  . i guess i'm just nota chipperenough to be amused by speakers who repeat good morning until the audience is loud enough. i'm okay with waking up early in the morning, and i'm completely okay with other people who are early risers, but i really do not need the multiple good mornings.  one piece of punctuation: the  exclamation mark . i honestly wonder if i was suffering from an allergic reaction to the overuse of the exclamation. it peppered the speeches of the speakers and it decorated all of the handouts. it made me wish it was a symbol of gouging a brain (or eyeball) out.  something that was completely missing:  sarcasm . previous orientations that i've been forced to endure, i've managed to find other people to make-fun of the entire event. everyone on this parent orientation was brimming full of happiness and were completely free from sarcasm. i felt slightly bad for being an enabler, but i let my sister escape from her orientation just so we could be the only people on that campus who was laughing at the entire event.  my sister is going to go to a school that is mostly full of boys. (around 75% of the campus is male.) i don't think i like boys. (for what it is worth, i don't really think i like girls either.) but the entire campus reeked of boy. everything from the directions to the campus, to the lack of names (in obvious places) for classroom buildings. the women's bathrooms were complete with urinals (ah, i've peed in enough men's rooms that i should have honorary membership) and everything seemed designed by a man.  which reminds me, i need to start working on my subversive side project that ties into this.   i was shown pictures of campus cops hanging out with students... playing the guitar with students around them... ice skating with the students... playing sports with the students... all while a very enthusiastic campus cop decided that he had to turn around and admire how wonderful these pictures were.  two words:  formal dining . i understand the school is making a grandiose effort to blow hot air up the asses of the parents who pay the outrageous tuition (thank goodness my sister is there on a scholarship) but they forced us to eat all of our meals in a formal dining hall. i couldn't just grab food and hide, i had to sit at a circular table and pitter patter with the other parents. i had to wait for food that i didn't really choose (which was much much better than what they served the students, i bet) to be served to me. and then i had to be polite to everyone at the table. it really amused me that one mom was slightly confused because she had never been served a meal before... and the whole thing made me recall my years in  the house  and how i know how to place my napkin and that i'm not supposed to touch any plates.  i was subjected to eating a meal with a father who was sad that his wife wasn't there, not because he wasn't having an enjoyable time but because he knew how much  she loved  that kind of torture, i mean orientation.  i was subjected to people who had the mindset that they couldn't let go of  their child . the parent orientation and the incoming student orientation were on different sides of the campus, specifically so the parents would start to let go. one story, "my wife and i dropped our son off in his dorm room. he said, "c'ya, bye." and my wife nearly lost it there. all she wanted to do was make his bed and he was already done with us."  i was subjected to more "oh my child is so wonderful" than a person should ever be exposed to. of course i guess i could've combated it all with a spewing sequence about how wonderful my sister is, but her wonderfulness was diminished because i was subjected to all of these ultraproud parents and their gushing stories about their absolutely wonderful kids.   i could possibly go on for another 15 points, but life is interrupting this rant. perhaps later i will entertain you with stories from the trenches of hell.
