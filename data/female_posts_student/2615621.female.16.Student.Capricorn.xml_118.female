Okay, my dads friend, Fred, is buddies with all these movie stars and stuff and has a business selling their pictures and autographs. Well, i put all the pics and stuff into a plastic bag so he can ship it. lol thats my job. And another cool thing, Fred's gf is Shirley Eaton, a JAMES BOND CHICK. She lives in London and is an actress. She called and i got to talk to her. She was the girl in Goldfinger. Shes really cool. She told me when she comes and visits Fred this summer she'll take me shopping and out to lunch. Isnt that cool?! Shes actually been in movies..and made out with freakin James Bond...omg im so jealous. hahaha shes cool though. Im gonna get some autographed james bond stuff..awesome, even though i honestly hated the movies!! but shhhh. lol i did play the video games..with my bros of course. Anyways, its cool looking at all the pics and everything. I like to look at his personal pics better though, they arent professional, they arent the ones he sells. Anyways, he told me i could have anything i wanted for FREE. how cool is that?! lol yeah..i saw a pic of Geine Kelly..or whatever his name is, Catherine Wood's lil idol and i was like HAHA i bet if i got one i could sell it to her..haha or just rub it in her face that i had an autographed pic of him. lol to me autographed pics arent that exciting, unless i was there to get it done. umm..oh well, thats just me. anyways..it would still be cool.   Tomorrow Kaye is coming to get me about 1pm and we're going to her fave shoe store and out to lunch and to do some "pre-shopping" because me, kaye and dad are going out tomorrow evening to shop for me...more dress clothes. ughhh. At least Kaye will be there. lol Anyways, that should be fun. yay *much love*
