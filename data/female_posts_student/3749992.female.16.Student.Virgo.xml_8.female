I found Snow Patrol there, which is fantastic because it's stimulated my creativity again, so I'm writing again, which is always good. "Run" makes me cry all the time, every time.  Also, Daniel is my muse, so he makes me write.  Every girl should have a much, much older boyfriend. Eh, 25 years difference isn't that much, right? I just...I just love Daniel. I wish I didn't, because his girlfriend drives me crazy and there's my dad who would flip...but whatever. You can't choose.
