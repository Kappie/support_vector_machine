I didn't want to wait like the hour and some minutes for a stupid bus to come so while Chels, Andy, and Eric all went back to Eric's house I decided to walk to school.  They thought I was crazy but like it is just snow and a little windy.  And well I didn't want to really fess up that I love school and for the life of me I HATE being late for things.  We had a quiz in chem today which I hope I did well one but some of the answers just didn't seem right so I will see how I did tommrow or whenev she gets them marked cause she is pretty sick right now.  I am just glad that she was there today and not that sub. guy we had yesterday who had no idea what he was talking about.  At lunch we played asshole again for like a million times and then just before the bell rang me and chels kinda got mad at each other AGAIN but I am not explaining the story cause I am not in the mood for thinking about that stuff.  Today was good I guess, everything felt kinda odd though.  Felt like I was dreaming or something, but I suppose I am just not use to the snow and stuff.  And well I decided I would use my one re-write for the math test tommorow.  I have the "feeling" that that is what I am suppose to do.  It's my conscience I think, I have a very very VERY strong conscience.  Cause well if it were not loud and strong I would have given up my dream of teaching high school bio/science a long time ago, but I can't give it up.  It's my passion, the one think my heart wants, the one think I know that in the end will make me happy.  Well yeah that was today.     Conscience  Hear in this night my conscience is speaking “Take your time and live for today” Be yourself and don’t be anyone else You are who you and there is no doubt  Dreams will be dreams until they make reality Turn them into the passion of your life Life for today but remember tomorrow Here in this life my conscience is speaking  ~Vanessa
