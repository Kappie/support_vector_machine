NO! yes of course they have alot of sex.  but USUALLY, with thier boyfriends, husbands.... of course samantha was the one who slept with everyone, but you know, in the end she settles down with the hottie.  anyways, i'm getting off subject here. sex in relationships is great, and sometimes, sex out of a relationship is even better and we ALL KNOW IT! :)  not only were they going through boyfriends/relationships, they had lives, families, work (good work jobs, these were successful smart ladies), marriages... parents dying, divorce, babies, sickness....LOVE.  it was great.  just damn great and yes i still get teary eyed over the ending. it was the PERFECT end to a great thing.  AND YES YOU ARE MIRANDA!
