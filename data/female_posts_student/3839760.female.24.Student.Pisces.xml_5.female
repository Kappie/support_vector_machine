I have a sunburn on my chest and neck and tons of mosquito bites on my legs.  I have an interview on monday, I don't know how to deal with this idea that perhaps I can get a better job somewhere else.  I know I shouldn't complain but I want something that I can enjoy and use my talent in.  Carrying golf clubs all day is not my idea of a great job. Oh, well...not much to say. I am just keeping my faith, since that is all I seem to have in this desert land of mine.
