I found something that he wrote on his desk...a song or a poem or something. I think it was about me, I think. Not being vain, I just think the wording really fit this situation. It said something like, "You hold me to the little things that I easily forget," and something about "you know that I forget, but still you hold me to them." And then it says something about "Two weeks to two long months," and then something about "I can't seem to you get you off my mind, but still I know it's not right," or wrong, or something like that. I want to know what it was about, but I cannot ask to read it. But I think it's about me, I really do. Hard to say. I wish I remembered more! Anyway, I think I'm gonna get back to chatting and watching the Real World marathon. I'm too hungover to do much else. Smooches!
