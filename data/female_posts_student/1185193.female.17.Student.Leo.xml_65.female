I had to put on a gown and lay on this more-comfy-than-my-bed table.  Seriously, it had like a feather pillow.  Very nice.  Anyways, the tech put this warm jelly on my neck and started the procedure.  Throughout the whole time--about 30 minutes--I had to lift my chin up and refrain from swallowing.  I had like a pool of saliva in my mouth because I couldn't swallow (I'm sure that's more than you wanted to know).  Anyways, she showed me a black and white picture of my thyroid, which was actually larger than I thought--well, maybe that's the problem.  And then she switched the screen to color and explained to me that all the red and blue squiggly things running amuck were my antibodies attacking my thyroid.    I guess the deal is that I have a low thyroid, which means it is not producing enough hormones that it needs to.  Usually, a person's antibodies compensate for that low level, but mine are compensating too much, going overboard to be attacking my thyroid.  This is a condition called "hypothyroidism."  Then this lady scares me because as she moves the apparatus around on my neck, she is making "ho's" and "hum's" like  she is seeing something interesting--out of the ordinary.  She informs me that my lymph glands are also very swollen, which are the culprits for causing my horrible sore throat recently.  She said that it could mean many things, but as a technician, she is not permitted to give medical advice.  Therefore, as the title says, I am "still uneasy."  What happens next:  I get another blood test on Friday to see how/if this thyroid medicine I've been taking is effective.   Then I meet with Dr. Stein for those blood results and the ultrasound results.  I'll keep ya'll posted on what happens!  :)
