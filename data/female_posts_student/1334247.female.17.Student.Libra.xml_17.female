Then, Sunday I had to work 4-10 but I got sick at work and had to leave early. So, today I would've had school, but I got stuck home, sick as a dog.   I found out that I have to work Easter Sunday from 9 AM till 4 PM. Wow, that really blows. I'm alittle upset...but I shouldn't complain too much, given that I have 13 hours this week, contrast to 9 hours. But, geez, could they give me any other day or any other shift than that?!?
