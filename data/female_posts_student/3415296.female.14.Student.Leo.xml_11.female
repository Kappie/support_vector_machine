And so I did, but he wasn't home. I called again around 9 and no one picked up. I knew I had to talk to him so I called once more, and his brother got the phone and got Safee on the phone for me. I said that we needed to talk and that he needed to talk to me. It took us a while to actually get on track, since the whole time he was trying to scare me with his "7 days" phase. He knows I'm scared of these things easily.   I finally said, we have to talk, and we did. I said, so what did you want to talk to me about? He said that for the past few days we didn't exactly talk. I knew what he meant because that was on my mind for all the spare time I had to think about it. I didn't know what to say and ended up saying, "so what are we gonna so about it?" He didn't know and I didn't know. It seems that everything became more complicated. We talked about how other relationships with other people were going great but ours wasn't. I said, "maybe we should just.." , he caught me off saying "no". I didn't know what to do again. I was just frustrated and so was he.   I honestly want him to know how I feel, but I guess I just can't. I don't know how to say everything that's going in my head. It's just like what he said, "I know what to say, but I don't know how to put it in words.." I really do want this to work, I love him, and that's all I know...  We ended up hanging up, and it just wasn't what I wanted it to be, but like I said earlier "Life isn't perfectly planned out, we just have to accept the way it is." I don't know what tomorrow brings, but I hope we can work it out so we can be like the way we were before. I love him too much to lose him now..
