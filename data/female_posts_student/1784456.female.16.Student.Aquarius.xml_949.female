Hehe, sooory if I offended you, that's just what I want to say, this is more like what I would say: Sorry I hate Popstars talk to some one who doesn't. Mmm... happy happy! So, what's happening in Neighbours? (Wow, great change of subject there) Susan's gonna leave Karl I recon cause she kind of can't remember him, and it could be... awkward... Summer in the City! Sorry, I'm listening to a song it's coool! Like 60's cool style... so actually it's weird! YEAY! Any hoo my mum thought I said my brother was 'cooking' or some thing so now we have to say that! You know, like 'yeah you're cooking' like another word for cool! Sad aye? A sad word for cool! Thank god their is one, I was beginning to lose all hope! Mmm... this has been up for ages better post! Sorry about the ...randomness and ...weirdness but hey that's in all of my posts.
