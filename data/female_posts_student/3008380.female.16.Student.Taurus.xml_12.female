Well, the musical is over now, and I didn't make cheerleading, so now I'm back to ol' borin' Jordan! Yippee!   I'm not mad about not making cheerleading or anything...I'm actually relieved. I didn't want to make it, truthfully.     And now it is Good Friday and I'm at home on my computer, not eating meat. Fun, fun.  Morp was last night. I had fun. The dj blew, but it's okay.  Guess what...I GOT A CAR!!! An '87 Dodge Shadow, GG's old one. Doesn't that truly kick some major booty???   Well yeah, I don't have much else to write about. I'm going to go work on my zine. Lata!  P.S. I finished Hard Love, and now I'm moving onto Born Blue. I've read them both before, but they rock.
