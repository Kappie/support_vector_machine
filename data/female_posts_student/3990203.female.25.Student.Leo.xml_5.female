Were all booked into the same BB for the weekend and as I haven't seen them for months im really looking forward to it.  Not done to much at work today, mostly computer stuff to do with filing although did have a meeting this morning with a manager and chef from a hotel to go over there HACCP stuff ie kitchen info etc etc.  Did have the best roast beef in a roll for my lunch tho, Christine would have loved it!!!  After lunch ended up going to the local hospital with Mark (EHO) for a food hygiene inspection, the kitchen was one of the cleanest iv seen since starting work here which is good, but then that is what you would expect for a hospital.  Im off out tonight to visit friend Dawn, usually consists of a good gossip and lots of coffee, I miss doing this with the girls from uni , sniff  bye for now
