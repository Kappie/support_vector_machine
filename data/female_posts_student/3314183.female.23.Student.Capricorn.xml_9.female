What did God have in mind when He made two sexes? What is His plan?  God has made us male and female to tell a story too marvelous for us to fully comprehend. He has made the sexes different from each other to reflect a reality that existed before we did. Following God's script for our sexuality in every scene in our lives means that we are depicting the truth and faithfully telling His story. And when we do that, we experience the fullness of life that God wants for us as men and women.  His plan leads to our joy and fulfilment.  God assigned men and women different roles. God made Adam first, Signifying his unique role as leader and initiator. He created Eve from Adam and brought her to Adam to be his helper in the tasks God had assigned him. She was made to complement, nourish and help her husband. God’s greatest gift to man was “a helper suitable for him”.  Men and women were created equal, yet different. God didn’t make us to duplicate each other, but to complement each other.  “ The world cries for men who are strong- strong in conviction,  strong to lead, to stand, to suffer.” I pray that you will be that kind of man, my dearest doppio. Be glad that God made you a man, Be glad to shoulder the burden of manliness in a time when to do so will often bring contempt.  If a man’s greatest temptation is to be passive, A woman’s greatest temptation is to take control. The man isn’t setting a course,  so the woman grabs the steering wheel. It might fix things in the short term, But in the long run it only discourages men from playing their God-given role as initiators.  I can encourage men to be men by refusing to do the work of leading for them. I want to avoid developing a habit of initiating in my relationship with men.  But now with doppio, Somehow, somewhat, sometimes, I have became the initiator......
