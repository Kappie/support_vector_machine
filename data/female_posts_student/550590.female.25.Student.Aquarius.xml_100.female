So I'm walking down the hallway going to check my mail when I see a guy ahead who looks vaguely familiar.  Come to realize it's Jason Quint!  Jason and I were in Math Super Stars together in middle school and hung out a bit in high school, too.  Apparently he's been working over in Communications for almost a year, now, and we have never crossed paths.  Holy Gainesville weirdness, batman!  Well, if you're bored (and you must be if you're reading this drivel) please make sure to    urlLink Take my FriendTest      It will make me oh so happy.    Tonight is Dawson's Creek and pedicure night.  Woohoo!  Being a girlfriend is so much fun.  ()=)
