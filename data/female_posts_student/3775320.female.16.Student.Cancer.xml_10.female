I can however tell you that I am by nature solitary - I do not seek company, yet I can enjoy it if it comes. I also know for sure that I love - almost to the point of addiction - humour of any kind. And I love God.  Maybe not very well all the time, but I am sure that I always will believe in God and everything in the Bible. Apart from that, I will always love my family, and also my 'other family' which just means the few very best friends I have.  They probably don't realize it, but whatever happens [even if I don't seem to care] I will always love them - like family. Although I 'don't know myself' [when asked 'What do you want' or 'What would you like to do' or 'What is your favourite...' I am stumped], I do know perfectly what I believe in, and have done so since I was young, since I could think. I have not changed much all my life because, well, my choices as I grew rooted into me, so much that I am unchangeable.  But I am fine with that.  I've found that while others constantly discover 'their new selves', I am still same old me. My abnormally placid life [lack of better phrasing] bothered me before, but I have learned to just accept who I am after I learned to accept everyone and everything in this world for what it is.  Good or Bad.  I try hard to be non-judgemental, yet still be discerning.  If you get what I mean. [IYGWIM] I may be overstating my abilities, but I think I know what should be done in every situation, though I do not do it [most of the time!].  That's my fault.  And it is more so because I know what should be done yet I don't do it. I hate it when people are uninterested in what I'm saying, because it really puts me off, yet I am not often interested in other people, and when I am I don't show it well.  My ultimate belief is that *everything* [in all contexts of the word: object/event/process] 'happens' [occurs/exists] for a reason.  And so I 'accept' everything for 'being what it is', though I may not agree with 'it'.  I feel like the longer I'm here the more I have to say, but 'basically', if you can call the above basic, that's all I have to say for now.  There is one small note I'm adding: My interests are so wide that the profile page does not do it justice since it kind of forces you to find one or two 'favourites'.  As I have mentioned above, I simply cannot decide my 'favourites' and so here I tell you that I like too many things to list.  If I don't like something, I will probably state it when it comes up.  You're probably not interested anyway, so it doesn't matter too much. =)
