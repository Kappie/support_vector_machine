I think I'm going to head home early because I don't feel like taking my German exam. Lalala. My pain medicine will have worn out by then.  Moo  That's all I have to say, and if I said anything weird to you today, it's 'cause I do REALLY weird things when I'm feverish... Seriously.  I've got strange numbers running around in my head *sigh*.  We're talking: 6.63 * 10^-34 J sec ... -2.18 *10^-18J (z^2/n^2)  -313.6/n^2 109678/cm (1/n1^2-1/n2^2) Lyman Balmer Paschen Bracket Pfund 1s2 s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2  3d10  That's just chem! weeeee  Then there's AP bio, which I know nothing about.  I know like two words that pertain to crap on the test.  Oxaloaceate and Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase. lalalala That's the extent of my knowledge. Ok. Maybe not.  I also know crap about carotenoids, which, coincidentally make me think of Carrot Top. I'm going to explode  bye now
