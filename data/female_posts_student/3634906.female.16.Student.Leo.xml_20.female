Then I came home and burned 11 cd's which took all day. Along with a break in there to go to the park with my mom and stepdad and little sister. We had fun and played volleyball with some kids who were there who are karate students. It was fun. Then I went out tonight to Jonny's and we played some weird game like "smashing testicles" or something along those names. But anyways despite the name it was a lot of fun. Amanda and I were a team... The team with the red balls. And we played James and Michelle and beat their asses!!! and then we played Jon and Pat, and beat their asses too. HAHAHA. We reign victorious.I had a lot of fun!! A lot A lot of fun!!! I am so happy to be able to go out and have a good time...   Wow... well you might think that by telling me these things that I will question you... but I dont want to know. if you are getting around with some other girl, well good for you. and even if you are serious about her, well good for you. these things dont make me interested. all Iwant to be is friends. I dont know if you can handle that one. I might have made myself seem interested the other night but it was just a question for later reference. and seeing as you couldnt even give me a straight answer I have begun to care less. A lot less. You've known that I adore you. But people's feelings change and you've turned me off. I guess same goes for your feelings about me, aye?? Yeah well I hope that your good thing that is happening is really really good for you. I mean that, I'm not saying that in a mean way. You deserve something good and I hope that you find it. And I hope that maybe we will be able to be friends. I really hope so. I think that you are fun and can be fun, but friends is all the more I want. Not to hurt your feelings but I am not interested, not anymore. And that probably doesnt bug you at all, but I thought that you should know. And I needed to get it off my chest. I'm happy with my life, I am perfectly content with it all. I dont need a change. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what I am sorry for but I'm sorry.    And about how I started this paragraph, well I'm not even sure that that is what your intentions were. I'm sorry if I misjudged the situation. I dont know. Maybe I'm right Maybe I'm wrong, Only you will know for sure. I just hope that we are still friends. I consider you mine, and I really hope that you consider me yours. Only time will tell what will happen.   Anyways... I am so proud of what I have done today. I have really had an accomplished day. I even had a bonding conversation with my mom and I think that it helped insure trust between us. I mean my curfew was 11:30 tonight!!! Thats really good for the girl who normally has to be home at 10:00. Wow and its not like I'm just talking to her to get on her good side, its like I actually enjoy talking to her. She always has something good to say or something that will help me. I dont know I've really grown to adore my mom. She's amazing. And I really had a good night tonight. I didnt think about anything bad, I just had a good time. I messed around with james's phone and I changed his banner to "Jizzy-James" and his welcome thing is "Gabby Says Hello" and his ringtone is "Feeling This"by Blink-182.And his screen saver is a frog and hisbackground is orange and has dotsall over it!!! Ipimped out his phone!!! Haha. Goodtimes. I just hope thatI can still have just James and me days when britt gets because because of course all of us will hang out together and JustBritt and I will hang out but I also just want James day too... I dont know how that will go but we will see. He told methat he would... letssee if he keeps his promise...    Okay well these are the cd'sI burned today:     Spiderman 2 soundtrack    Blink-182; blink-182    dude ranch; blink-182    themark tom and travis show; blink-182    cheshire cat; blink-182    take off your pants and jacket; blink-182    enema of the state; blink-182    so long, astoria; theataris    international superhits; green day    a mark, a mission, a brand, a scar; dashboard confessional    and some other random dashboard cd.    they are all frickin awesome!!! i cant wait to listen to them... but i am going to go to bed now i dont want to sleep away the day... we might call chadd from waterloo tomorrow, mandy and I, and i might beg my dad to take me to see him!!!  well nighty night  -gabby
