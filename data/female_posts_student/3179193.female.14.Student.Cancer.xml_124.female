Guitar class today after school... band practise tomorrow and Thursday. 100th day into our relationship on Thursday. Yayness? Blah whatever.  Ok... Martin just said "PK LA" Roofles. Weirdos. Brian's reading my blog outloud. -O-" Smart.   I can't get over BK's song. Soo cool! ^^ Mehehehehe! Wahahahaha! Brian and Martin are talking nonsense. Well probably 'cos I don't understand Chinese that well but whatever.  So yeah. *sighzZ* So bored.  I like the song HURT NO MORE or whatever it's called. Really cool. Nice. Meaningful. Yeah... all that crap. Anyway. I'm off for now. Peace.
