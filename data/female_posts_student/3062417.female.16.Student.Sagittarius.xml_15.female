But he didn't.  Big suprise there.  Just another disappointment from him. He never goes to anything that I do. Shows how much he really cares.   Today so far just sucks. I woke up and just wanted to fall back asleep but I couldn't. Then I went to Chester's florist like we do every palm sunday and bought flowers. Then went to friendly's and ate lunch. This is where I realized how much I miss my old life. I miss everything about it. I miss being happy, I miss not being single, I miss being able to talk to my friends, I miss not having to worry about anything.  But most of all,   as much as I don't want to ,  I miss him.  Sometimes I hate myself for what I've turned into. I hate how I view the world now. I wish I could be the happy Kelly I once knew. Well, after I realized this I've been completely lost for the rest of the day. It's like I don't even know myself anymore. I've found myself just sitting there and I don't remember what I was even thinking about. I don't know what to do with my life. It's like I'm a shell of a person with nothing inside.  I'm empty.   Well, right now I'm listening to the 2003 warped tour cd and thinking about working on my english project and wondering about what I should do with my meaningless life.  Song:  They will mislead you, plug in and bleed you I swear I heard the DJ say "Swallow temptation", believe the answer Is in the order you obey   I know my purpose isn't on a poster sign  I'm still part of the game that any number can play  Majority vote, identity? No! Top forty reasons to spoon feed Immunity lost, full price at your cost Industry living by disease  Imagine, idolize and idealize A dream a nighmare couldn't change Any number can play   The sound remains unclear, There's little left to hear except contradiction Looks like somebody made our mind When history repeats the hit that I've heard for my whole life   Bring back request to radio, Your favorite song was written but you'll never know A selection for us to see a blind conspiracy Another version of the imitated tune and not one soul was saved Any number can play  -"Any Number Can Play"-No Use For A Name  Ever notice how all the songs I'm listening to pertain to what I just said? Wow what a coincidence. (Weird thing is it actually is a coincidence.)
