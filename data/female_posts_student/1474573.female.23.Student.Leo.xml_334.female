I'm not, but I  am  PMSing.  Should I tell him that?  Or is that too much information?  3. In the argument of a woman's subtlety of hint-giving regarding gifts, I was told, "Men are not malleable. If you wanna know where a man's heart lies, leave him to his own devices.  Do not give him instructions. Do not tell him what to do.  Don't encourage him to be good to you if he is not a good man.  You are absolutely right when you say he ought to know so don't remind him.  THAT is when you will find out what kind of man you got.  If he is a thoughtless dunce, it will show without you having to say a word.  If he is a great thoughtful guy, it will also show. The MINUTE you start trying to give instructions, no matter HOW subtle...you fucked up already.  Men are not subtle."  Hmm. Interesting.  I'm glad I ended up with a thoughtful guy.  That said, I still give him little hints once in awhile. I think it's just in our nature as women to do so.  4. I thought that when we got the house, I'd be all gung-ho about gardening.  Turns out, I like the flowers and such, I hate the dirt and the work required to keep it all pretty.  Like, did you know that you actually have to WATER these things?  Sheesh.  5. I have to plant my begonias today and I'm not looking forward to it.  6. I need a landscaper.  Who's payin'?  7. Looking forward to the party on Sunday.  Peeps, you better not front on me!  We've got lots of damn food that we paid good money for!  (heh)  8. I just got a Barnes  Noble gift certificate for my Graduation!  Yay, stuff!
