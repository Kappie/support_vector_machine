Still have lots and lots of Homework to do... Still have PW to handle.. Wonder if the guys will write out the written Report which is due THIS WED. Oh no...    Watched "Singapore Idol" Just now.. Very entertaining.. However, It would be even better if the contest is in chinese.. Then contestants can sing mandrin songs.. Yoru don't you think so too??? Haa. haa. ok for tonight.. Happy National Day Everyone!!!       Natsu
