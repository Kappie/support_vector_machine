Good part: Driving to Roseville with Liz and finding the perfect graduation dress. It's really perfect. Very me. Maybe I'll post a picture of it later. Also, I watched Sex and the City on TBS because I never had HBO to watch it before. It's happy. Bad part: low level headache basically all day, crazy idiots at both Safeway and Dos, and mild graduation planning crap. Also spent the day mildly irritated at the world (no, not you Liz), because of my inherent laziness and inability to plan or take care of things ahead of time. It's always the damn last minute with me. Why do I continue to be a moron?
