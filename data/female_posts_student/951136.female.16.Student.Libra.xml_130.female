I've let myself be sucked in WAY beyond any boundaries. i dont do rejection very well. i'm afraid enough to try anything that puts me out there where i could fail. and when i do, which i have, then why the fuck should i open up again. whats in it for me. nothing. and obviously theres nothing in it for anyone else either. that much i know at least. i wish i lived in lafayette again. if i moved back that would be enough of a start over for me. but better, b.c. everyone who thought they knew me... but it wouldn't help. Everywhere is the same.  I am that I am  I am enough for myself   i wish i could say that to myself truthfully instead of out loud to no one, as a lie.
