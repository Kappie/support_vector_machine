What I mean by this is that throughout our lives we try to bring more and more people into our community, but the problem with the history of evangelism is that we want to change the people to be like us, in order for them to be a part of us.  I think the church would be much better off with the difference that people joining the community can bring.  Now the hard question is that the people becoming part of the community must change somewhat, right?  In order to understand God's narrative you have to be a part of that narrative.  But if we all are only shaped by that one narrative is that good for the body of christ?  I would like to see diversity in the body, people that might see the world a little differently because of the past that they have been handed.
