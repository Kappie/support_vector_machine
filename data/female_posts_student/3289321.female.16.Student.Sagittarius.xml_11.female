We aren't doing diddly-squat the rest of the day (some gay senior awards ceremony deal is planned, but why would a sophemore wanna go??).  Plus, my grandma is here, and I want to spend some time with her.  PLUS, it's the very end of the year, and i only have 1 absence per class.  SO...i've decided that it will be a great day for shopping. :)  Have a great day tomorrow, everybody!!  Later  >
