And why is it that they like to talk and blab on and on about this and that but when they're faced with a situation wherein they're supposed to MOVE, they suddenly freeze up? Damn those guys who like to put girls through 'kilig' moments then abruptly take them away. Damn those guys who text you super mushy messages and even share you part of his load just so you can reply. Damn those guys who make you feel terribly guilty when they're down in the dumps even though there's absolutely nothing that you did wrong. Damn that guy for giving me these frustrated feelings and inspiring me to put them in words. Damn rainbowcoloredkalabasa (that's me). ARGGHH.
