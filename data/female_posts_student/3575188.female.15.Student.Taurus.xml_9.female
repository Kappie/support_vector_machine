Being part of the student government would be the only way that he would be able to get into the college that he wants to get into because his grades are so low. As the president he has to go to the homecoming dance like the rest of the student government. Unfortunately he doesn't have a date because the girl that he was dating dumped him for a twenty year-old that worked in his fathers auto shop. HA great job right. that is really getting him somewhere. No really it can. But Landen doesn't want to go to the dance alone because he doesn't want to have to mop up puck or stand next to this boy who is the treasurer I don't remember his name. Anyway... Landen doesn't like him very much, he asks to many questions. Landen has asked everyone he can think of even college girls His last chance is Jamie Sullivan the reverands daughter.
