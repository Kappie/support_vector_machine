He was the way that I have always wanted him to be as well as a night that I have always wanted between the two of us. Also I started reading the book "The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty" by Anne Rice again. That may have had a little to do with our great night. For anyone who wants to read a really great series of books, I suggest these. They are very pornographic and S but I think you will like them. (even if Nicole does not) HEHEHE. Next, I spent the evening with Nicole tonight. We had a great time but I am afraid to say this (in case she reads this) but I was a little upset with her. Don't get me wrong because we had a great time. She just admitted to me that she wasn't too sure if she still wanted to try to move in together in a couple of months. I am happy that she told me this now before I got too excited, but at the same time I was a little disappointed. The fact is that I was already starting to get excited about it.  It's all good though because I still have a someone else who is thinking about moving in with me, so thing still may come through for me. Who knows. I don't want to say who this person is right now because I want to protect the innocent. (I am so secretive hehehe) Lastly, I am really upset about something between me, Amanda, and Amber. I don't want to talk too much about it because I haven't talked to Amber yet and I don't want her to read things on here before I get a chance to talk to her. I will keep you updated on that though as more happens.  Well I guess that's all for now. I will write back later.
