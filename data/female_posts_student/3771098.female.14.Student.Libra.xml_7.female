I'm working on it though. For those of you who know what i'm talking about, that conversation me and jenn and amez had in the SD journal is now typed up and it is hilarious my friend. Amez and Jenn, check your email. Well I'm really bored today. I babysat, and I read my stupid summer reading books, and i'm starting to pack for Denver, and I practiced piano. That's all. God. I love the summer, but sometimes I hate it. Sometiems like now.
