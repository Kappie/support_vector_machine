Since I'm not a fan of typing a lot on an IM screen late at night, I told him I would answer his question later when we went to see Fahrenheit 9/11. He, however, took that as an "excuse" not to answer him and got on my back about how I never defend myself correctly and he's always right. That's actually bullshit that I shouldn't have gotten so pissed about, but I did anyway. I was up half the night searching online for facts that proved everything he said wrong. I accomplished it quite thoroughly, but the next morning I realized how stupid it was. I was wasting so much of my time and energy and sanity on these political ideals, when really no one would ever be "right". So, after much thinking, I have simply decided to not care. When I am old enough to vote, I may or may not do it at all. Maybe by then I will be ready for the mess again....who knows? I guess, I can have my ideals, but I am going to keep them to myself. Why should I drive myself apart from my democrat friends if it's over some stupid political crap that doesn't really effect our relationship at all. *sigh* I just don't care. So I'll see the movie, I'll respect the filmakers views, and hope (althought I know he WON'T) he respects mine.  SO FUCK IT!  P.S. GO TEXAS LONGHORNS! CWS 2004!
