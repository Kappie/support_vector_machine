Well, it was boring, but it was  really  nice...since my dad got EVERYTHING taken away, *sob*.   PLEASE  come back, it's been weird without you there, it's getting weirder with that black space of empty desk in front of me/Z.  We'll see you when we do. And I'll find something stupid to talk about that makes everyone latch on to it for a while and make a thousand posts a day.  G'bye.
