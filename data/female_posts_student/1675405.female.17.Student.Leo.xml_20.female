Heather said she'd  give him my number and tell him to call me. Ah, the wonders of being an old fashioned girl.  I ain't callin' NOBODY!  Marie is upset right now because she doesn't know what to do with herself no that she has no boy. I don't know what to do, she thinks Ricky and I have some sort of secret fling going on. Argh. Then Ben is all depressed and contemplating suicide, but then casually throwing in that if we went out to go see a movie, he'd be cool. I'm not stupid!   I helped Aaron ask Jessie to homecoming. It was hard. But hey, I guess friends have to do what they have to do. I tried to handle this maturely, and I guess it worked. Joy.
