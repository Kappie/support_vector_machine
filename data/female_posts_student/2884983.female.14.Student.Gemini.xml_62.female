I think I will try to type a nice big long blog a rooney. ugh..time for money talk :( I hate being told al this nonsense about all this money that I have but dint get to use!!! it makes me so mad!!! well not mad really...just bored and frustrated. anywho....the stupid lady wasnt at school today so I couldnt buy my sweat pants. now that is something that makes me mad. so do people who act like your friend until another person comes around and then they ignore you. that makes me mad. it makes me so mad that I end up just ignoring everybody. I just feel unneeded. no one talks to me or anything. I dont blame them....mom just gave me this purple high heel ornament thats cool. I like it. I am rearranging my room. but I need the vacum cleaner cause I cleaned out under my bed and it is all disgusting and such. I wish gaia was working. then I wouldnt be so bored. not that I am not bored even while I am on gaia. bah ha ha ha ha ha. yes that was a random outburst of insanity. but who doesnt have those?? I am going to post the lyrics for Bandaid covers the bullet hole by Scarling. thanks to curly who introduced me to the awesome band. even though I only know one of their songs...well here they be.   Bees in the caramel and I'm not afraid Surgeons make incisions  what a mess they've made Tearing at my skin leaving knives in my brain Stabbing at the voices making me insane Girls vomit candy and lies that they're fed Boys whisper lullabies and wet their beds Eat TV violence on the toast that they spread Talking with their mouths full here is what they've said  Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again.... Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again... Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole  LA LA LA -LA LA LA LA LA LA-   Spiders in my hair and guns on my mind Thinking about the people who've been so unkind If looks could kill them  I might make myself blind Startled at the reasons that I just can't find Kids break the dishes they crash on the floor Parents hate the noise and shove them out the door Robots steal emotions hide them under their beds It's gets them so excited  Here is what they've said......  Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again.... Say Hello to my Little friend the world is getting ugly and we did it again... Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole Ohh Uh Ohh The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole  The Band Aid only covers the Bullet Hole LA LA LA -LA LA LA LA LA LA- BLAH -BLAH- BLAH -BLAH BLAH BLAH-BLAH-BLAHHHHHH   there is also one by jack off jill but it is a little different.
