Eric over heard us and was all I'm in! So when Geena came inside he was like which one of them (she was hanging out with three orie kids [grade eights on an orientation trip to the highschool]) is the walking std?? And we just laughed and laughed. God I hate Geena. I can't find a single redeeming feature about her. She is a short, ugly poser sporting a bad attempt at emo hair.  I hate everything about her. The way she walks, talks, thinks, looks, acts. Everything.  Anyways, 'nough about her.  So next weekend Jeffrey is coming over...which means Khala will probably come too because she wants him...and he is a bloody riot!!  I'm hoping I can get Bob and James to bus down here aswell and we can have a big party!!! Haha, I let Khala add James on msn but I made her promise not to love him or let him love her.  She guaranteed me that he wouldn't love her...then I gave her a virtual hug!!  My Bus: My mom has taken to giving my busdriver info on The Green Party, meaning a) I have to deliver it, b) he calls the house and c) Jim is scary... Today we passed a horse shitting...that was pleasant...  lalala...no one is on msn...James said he'd come on earlier today cause I'm always logging off when he is logging on :( I heart him...he is my emo-boy, sex-bomb!!!  My Homework: Two sheets of 'fun' science homework about the periodic table, drawing a totem pole and a pictorial story for art, and for gym (yes, gym) -drum role please- a touchdown dance...Mrs.Rumball is bloody awesome. Wow, thats the first time I've evr called her  MRS .Rumball.  Dreams: I had this dream about Stephanie cutting herself...which is weird, cause I don't   THINK   she does, but she very well might...once I had a dream about Justin S cutting himself but I don't think he does either...wow...weird, Steph just logged on...speak of the devil and she will appear...wild...  I guess I'm done here...  Chera!
