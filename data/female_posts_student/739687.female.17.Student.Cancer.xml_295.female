God, what a beautiful thing. Today is absolutely beautiful, and when I look around, I just see this perfect ease and contention in everyone. Summer has such an amazing ambience. I feel so at ease, as if nothing in life has to be stressful. And it's true. Nothing in life has to be stressful unless we make it as such. It's something I can say, but being the drama queen that I can be, is often something a bit difficult to grasp. True, I can be so overly dramatic quite often; just ask my parents. I'm passionate about things, and that's why I am the way that I am. And I'm starting to accept that alot more. It's becoming alot easier to laugh at my passionate outbursts; my petty quarrels, and insignificant debates.  I'm finally coming to life. And I'm finally starting to appreciate who I am.  So, to get to my day now....  Woke up this morning, went to kickboxing, came home and had to rake some brush out in the front yard (so I can get money to get my nails done...because I'm quite broke), layed outside for a little bit, came inside, took a shower and here I am. I think I'm gonna go grab a bite to eat, and then figure out what the plans are for tonight.  Come to life, crazies. And enjoy the beautiful day.
