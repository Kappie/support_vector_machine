And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.  But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it."   Paul reminds us of our forefathers, who acutally saw God firsthand.  They passed under his cloud as they sojourned out of Egypt and passed through the sea that was parted for them.  I can't help but think that if God was that obvious to me, then I would never doubt Him and fall into temptation!  How could they be unfaithful to God and worship idols they had made even after God had sent them manna and quail from heaven?  It seems incredible to me that the Isrealites would be so forgetful.  Then I look at my life and see how forgetful I have been even though God has made Himself equally obvious (although not in the same ways).  I remember when I was living in Alameda and I was reading the Bible at Starbucks after work.  I knew that I should do my QT, but I was so tired and unmotivated from the long day.  I prayed that God would change my attitude.  Not even an hour later as I was doing my QT, a guy comes up to me and asks me if I was reading the Bible.  I said "yes" and my testimony just spilled out of me.  I remember talking to him for a long time about how I had gone to church all my life and yet never really knew God.  I told him how I was rejected from vet school faithful God had been to me in what seemed like a time of devestation.  I told him how God used that circumstance to break me of my pride and lead me to salvation.  I remember being fille with such joy and gratitude that God would use me even when I initially didn't even feel like doing my QT that day.  God totally rewards faithfulness!    But just like the Israelites, I quickly forgot this incident and worshipped the idol of vet school.  I was still tempted by prestige and accolades.  See, I'm no better than the Israelites because I have seen God just as clearly and yet have given in to temptation just as quickly. This verse reminds me that I am never safe from temptation and that I constantly need to be on guard. God will never tempt be beyond what I can bear and He will always provide a way out for me.  What a comfort!  God knows me so well...    What temptation do I need to guard against?  Well, how about the obvious first?  B is coming in two days (!!!) and I know that we will be tempted to become too intimate with eachother.  We just like eachother too darn much...  As if to prepare for what seems to be inevitable, we talked about this temptation together.  It seems like our conclusion is usually "Well, we'll try our best to keep our hands off eachother but let's just wait and see what happens."  Like I said, it seems almost inevitable that we will cross the line.  I remember talking about this in Boston--how we should cool things down a bit when we're together.  But, surprise, suprise, we end up naked...again.  But no, this verse reminds me that falling into temptation isn't inevitable.  God always gives us a way out in the form of a CONSCIENCE.  I don't know about guys and their raging hormones, but even in the heat of the moment, I still feel that pang of guilt. I remain level-headed enough to be able to stop what's happening, but I don't.  So basically, sin is a choice and I fall into temptation because I want to.  I'm NOT a victim after all.  Intimacy will definately be a temptation, but it's one that we are able to overcome.    B says that he hasn't felt guilty about crossing the line with me.  That surprised me. I didn't think it was possible to not feel guilty about doing something you know is wrong.  For me, I need to do my part and clean up my thought life.  The more I think about making out with him, the more I'm going to push things in that direction when he's here.  I need to not anticipate that. Instead, I should just expect to cuddle and have fun, which is more than enough already.  Maybe we should go w/ B's suggestion and I should put a bag over my head and put mittens on his hands.      Lord, thank you for knowing me so well and yet loving me so much. You know exactly how much temptation I can handle.  I confess that I sin because I want to, and I take responsibility of that.  I know that nothing in all creation is hidden from your sight (Hebrews 4:13) and that you see every sin I commit. Brandon is comming in a few days and I pray that you will enhance our relationship by helping us to practice self-control. Nothing good can ultimately come out of premature physical intimacy. I pray that during the time we spend together this weekend, we will grow closer together by growing closer to you. Please be with us as we do our quiet times together and learn to love you as a couple and as individuals.  Relight the flame in our hearts that have been quenched by business, and skewed priorities.  The passion that we have for eachother needs to be redirected towards a passion for you.  That is my desire, Lord, but I'm weak!  Help us to be a good example for the younger ones and an encouragement to our peers this weekend.  Amen.
