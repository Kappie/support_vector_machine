(a.k.a an anime Joelle wants to watch) Must steal that. . . . I have to do a new body of work now for art, all the media's suck. I'm thinking either video (installation) or sculpture. I also have this stupid English discussion thing I have to do, let me tell you.. public speaking SUCKS. Really.  Anyways I want to see that movie "The Day After Tomorrow"  if that's what it's called, it looks interesting.  What to do this weekend???  I am not drinking, considering last weekend's party, hahaha that was fun.  But yeah, according to Shiva I was really weird and funny that night, which isn't a good thing...apparently.  Aaaaah, headache.. need one of those Thai "pain killers" hehehe...        B Y E
