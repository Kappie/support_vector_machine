Neil was asked to hit "shuffle" on this computer's jukebox (or its equivalent) and post the first 15 songs it listed.  Here's my list; those out there with blogs feel free to do the same; those without, post in the comments.  1.  Utopia - Alanis Morissette 2.  Mary - Tori 3.  Can't be With You - Cranberries 4.  She's Got the Look - Roxette 5.  Rattlesnakes - Tori 6.  Good Morning Baby - The Boy's London Mix Volume 1  7.  Green - see the above 8.  Bent - Matchbox 20 9.  Come Back Home - Pete Yorn 10.  Carbon (live) - Tori 11.   To Every Captive Soul - Hannibal Soundtrack 12.  Of Square Waves/Random Thoughts - Billy Corgan from the Stigmata Soundtrack 13.  Karma Police - Radiohead 14.  Silent All These Years - Tina Turner 15.  Do You Have a Little Time - Dido  Only 4 Tori songs in 15; her grasp is diminishing...
