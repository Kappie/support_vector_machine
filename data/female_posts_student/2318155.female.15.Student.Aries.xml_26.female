Finally I have nothing else to do and had to resort to this. Not really had, but there was nothing else to do and i said, hey imma write in my blog. Well, enough of me talking about boring stuff. This week of school that i am in is finals week...woohoo yeaaaa! ha yea right. It's been alright, only one of my finals has been hard so far, my chem final. 160 mutiple choice questions and 10 configuration problems, now was that tiring. I took the chem test yesterday and i also had my oral interp final which was a 2 hr congress session. Believe it or not i actually liked it, i got one speech in and a couple questions. Today there was traffic on the way to school and i was late to class, but so was another 5 people so i think she didnt mark me tardy. Mrs.Stanek's test wasn't too hard, and didn't even have preterite in it, ha! STupid lady messed up the test and it was so easy. Then the other final for me was P.E. today. We played a soccer tournament, 4 games. Our team placed 2nd because the last team we played lied and said we tied instead of won. O well, 2nd is still good, but when we couldve tied with 1st that wouldve been ausome. Then i got my schedule, everything is the same except for P.E. 4th period with caldwell, I have it with Ward. Also with sociology i now have health with hunter 5th as usual. O and by the way on tues i had my english final which i thought was pretty easy. This week has been ok, tiring, but at least i have lots of time after school to do stuff. Yesterday went to brandon's dad's shop and louis his friend came along and we went to subway, el balazo, burger king, and louis went to supercuts (b.a. style). ha don't ask if you don't understand. Then after brandon's practice we watched american idol and the o.c. and then my dad came home from a meeting and brought brandon home. Today brandon has practice from 3-5:30 and i have softball training 3:45-4:45. Well, just thinking about that i need to get ready so yea i'll talk to ya'll later (:
