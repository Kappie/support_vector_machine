"The  urlLink Nunatsiaq News  (for full story see:  urlLink http://www.nunatsiaq.com/news/nunavut/40806_08.html )  reports on a blogger being fired from her job because of her blog. A Nunavut Tourism marketing officer was fired last month after a local resident complained about a web site she ran in her spare time. Penny Cholmondeley, known on the Internet as "Polar Penny," was surprised to learn on July 18 that she was being fired because of the online journal, or web log, she had kept since her arrival in Iqaluit in January.  There are some bizarre aspects to this tale and some unanswered questions. The complaint over which Penny was dismissed was apparently made anonymously. One anonymous complaint can get you canned? The nature of the complaint has not been made public either by Nunavut Tourism or Ms. Cholmondeley. Another strange thing is the graciousness with which Penny is taking all of this. She's leaving the frozen North and applying for work in Nanaimo, BC. I'm indignant that such a thing could happen. If you're as indignant and outraged as I am, you might want to drop an email to the person who fired her, Maureen Bundgaard at  urlLink maureen@nunavuttourism.com ."  scary hey.
