Got up about 9.45 having been woken up by Nancy shouting "Bye Jo!" about 3 million times before she went out to school, and got woken up by Louise charging around like a looney in order to get a 7.50am train- crAzy!!! So, I got up, leisurely got dressed, did some washing (aren't I helpful?), read a magazine, had a veyr long phone call to my friend Sarah, ate lunch, now I'm here! What fun. It's flippin' cold outside, hope you guys haven't frozen to death yet, cos that wouldn't be very good.  I've got everyhting sorted out for the ball now, and I'm sooooooooooo excited! My hair is gonna be so cool (even if I say so myself!), and I think I'm gonna look quite different, he he! I'm also going to pick up my dress this afternoon, so everthing will be perfect! Yay! My friend had her ball last night (Riddlesdown) and she said the limo was fab, they were all hanging out the windows and waving at anyone possible, so that's something we've gotta try guys! I think it's gonna be brilliant! Who si eveyrone having their photos taken with? Or are you lot having them done on your own? Sarah said they managed to get about 7 people in theirs, I'm looking forward to seeing it to see what it turns out like, ha ha! Generally she had a fab time, but I think ours is gonna be HUGE! Really posh place, nice food, good music, all our friends, having one heck of a time!  Right, I reallly shoiuld go and do some work now. I'm going to start by copying up Nicki's history, so I can either post it through her door tonight, or it will perhaps be Sunday? I don't know, gimmie a yell if you need it before then Nicki! Tooooooooodle pip guys. Don't really know why I'm saying that, seeings as none of you are here, but hey. Tooooooooooooodles pips.
