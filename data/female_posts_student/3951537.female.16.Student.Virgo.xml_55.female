[shut up]  see? the little brackets are subliminal messages.  [i don't like you, evil person].  see how much fun this is?  blah blah blah blah blah blah.  i hope no one reads this post.  i'd not post it, but that would take all the risky fun out of my life.  i need something really risky to do instead.  like skydiving blindfolded and guessing when i need to have a parachute.  or being taken into the middle of a cave system and left there with little food, just to see if i could find my way out before dying of starvation.  or cliff jumping.  there are so many options.  sticking my head in a plastic bag sounds fun too.  tee hee.  i'm mainly just writing to distract myself.  so we had to take the wiley house apart yesterday because it didn't fit through the door, then carry it inside, and put it back together.  wheeeee.  ramble ramble.  [go awaaaaaaaaaay].  okay, playing the malibu 9 game now.  "he is going down. he and his fucking eskimo, chinese, deepfriend penguin friends. he is going DOWN"  bai bai!
