I'm not in the mood to write. So I leave you with these bits of wisdom from the Colon and Overkleeft Relationship Consulting Group:  victoriainthesky: lol this is also true MtDewGirl87: ah fuck him MtDewGirl87: I'll never get through to that boy victoriainthesky: i don't think so either. penis on forehead MtDewGirl87: it's never going away dude MtDewGirl87: it's always going to be there victoriainthesky: yes it will MtDewGirl87: like a fucking chode victoriainthesky: lol eeeeeewwwwwwwww  "yes. sex. now. I can't live underneath these circumstances. how is a woman suppose to function without sex for so long? I hate my cycle.  I'm going to go and die of unfed, pent-up, sexual anxiety now"  So random. Think of it as what you will. Laugh when necessary.
