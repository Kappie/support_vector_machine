I took a long, leisurely nap all day while my mommy was away at work - well, after I finished my doggy popsicle treat that she had left me in the morning.    Then we went for a mountainbike ride on the "old race course" in Eagle.  Well, I ran.  She rides that thing.  I chased a rabbit and almost caught it.  Then we missed the turn and ended up riding an extra mile and a half.  And I had to run really fast during this section just to keep up.  The last section of the ride was through some very chalky white soil, so I came home hardly even looking like myself.  I had white dust all over my face and legs.  It wouldn't brush out so I got a quick bath.  It was time for a bath anyway.  I have to take one about once a month, right around when I get my heartworm pill.  I think I heard something about day care tomorrow, so I am going to get a good night's rest tonight!  Love, Caesar
