They want the Myers-Briggs people to tell me that.  Well, I guess I ruined the surprise for myself.    I called Health Services for an appointment to see if my nausea is related to an inner ear infection.  Earliest appointment?  Friday morning.  I'll either be puking or better by then.  More to come...
