I got a 100 on my permit test thing that I didn't study for, but I have some REALLY stupid people in my class I guess. At least no one failed. "I got 9 wrong, is that failing?" No, but note to self...don't drive with her...  Lunch was pretty nice. I guess Jill was talking about stuff that upset people. Diane seemed pretty annoyed. Hmmm, I actually kind of want to go outside and play basketball, so I'm going to see if my mom can maybe move her car for a bit. I need to vent out some anger. Marching was alright except I didn't feel great and I kept getting messed up, and for some reason when Hian corrected me it really bothered me. I mean, it wasn't Hian, but I got REALLY mad at myself. I don't usually worry about that stuff. I just fix it, but I just got so upset with myself for being such an idiot.   Haha, Colt 45 just came on my playlist. That's such a funny song. It reminds me of Caseville. Good times, good times. :) So, I think I'll go play basketball now. Woo....  Oh, actually, I have to write Joanne back first...lalala...
