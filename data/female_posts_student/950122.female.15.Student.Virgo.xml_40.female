I went there with Gela, and we walked around for a while before we stopped at Pizza Hut to wait for Camilla and Racine. After that we walked around even more and ended up watching a romantic-comedy movie. Then we went to the hotel Camilla's family was staying at. She and her sister tried to teach me this card game, but it was all in vain. x_X Funky. It was a lot of fun. :D But on the way home I ended up leaving my cellphone in Gela's car. So I survived a night without my phone then Gela returned it the next day. n_n Maybe I'll call her later. :D
