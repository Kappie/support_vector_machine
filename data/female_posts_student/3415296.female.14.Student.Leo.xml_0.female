I just want to say, Nima you don't have to feel sorry. I would've done the same thing if I were you. Any friend would do that. Anyways I'm greatful that your my friend =), well best friend. I'm going to ignore the past and live on 'til my life ends. I remember all those times I would go to my basement, hold my cordless phone, and just cry. I really don't know why. I miss all those times when I would talk to him on the phone. I would always want to call. Like today, he didn't come to school, and what I usualy did was call him at school to see if he was alright. Now, I don't think I could do that. I can't do that. I still care about him. He just doesn't back. That's alright though. I just wish I was sure of one thing. If he really did love me. That's all I wish to know..
