They insane you. no kidding.  'course, without friends, what meaning would my life have? thats a scary question...  bah! you kill me, you kill me...  is it so much to want to...i guess "bond" with one of your friends? Is it so much to want to actually disucss an idea instead of the usual monotony? is it so much to expect that maybe you could have some sort of fulfilling conversation worth remembering, instead of...of, i dunno, just getting what little contact you need to maintain in order to keep from going psycho? What if your soul is hungry, dammit! What if you hate these two weeks and you want to lose yourself in philosophy? in comprehension of another's spirit? what.... why cant i have the kind of conversations that are actually good for me? intellectual analyzation of life? i can talk to myself all i want, but... its not the same.  oh, i wish i didnt get so many "i dunno"s. i really do. take a moment to think, will you? Why wont you  talk  to me, God dammit? Why does this all have to die? I want to understand you! i really do! i sincerely do! and i can ask and ask and ask but it does no good at all if you arent gonna answer. its hard if you learn more about you if you arent willing to give me a hand...  maybe thats what i want for Christmas... not exactly something i can tell my mom though. well, i can hope, right? eh, its useless to refer to all this indirectly but i dont feel like being obvious, so screw you, jessica. and anyone else who happens to ever read this.   i dunno, i dunno, i dunno... i worry too much.
