On monday i went in at 12 and took my driving test and my teacher said i did "awesome" but i still only got an 85%?? kinda confuses me there but whatever i passed!! but i was sure after i passed i pulled a few fast turns and man they felt sooo good!! lol Then after i finished my test i just hung out at the mall for a little while and checked out stores and cothes i want so i can drag my mom in there to buy them. hehe And OMG i saw the CUTEST shoes at finsih line (well acctually i saw like 3) and all 3 have pink in them and omg i want them soo bad!! Anywoo after i was there for a while Ben picked me up in his (awesome)car and we went to his house and looked at his baby pictures. lol they were all so adorable. Well then we left and went to his apartment thing and hung out there for a short while and then went to a car show where we spent most of our night (and ben i wasnt bored!!!!so you dont owe me anything) then right before he took me home we went for icecream to celebrate me passing my driving test! yay!! On Tuesday i went to driving lessons again and this one was my last!! all i had to do was parallel park and then i got to just drive around on the freeway and the country and just like everywhere. It was so much fun!! i then went home and was jamming out to tunes with Mitchy like all afternoon because we were both just like wired on nothing. it was strange but fun!! Then a little before 8 Ben came over! We looked at my baby pictures this time.lol i was not nearly as cute but what can i say. We then went swimming and played bball in the pool and he killed me at horse. Like the score was H-O-R-S-E to zero it was crazy but I knew he would beat me. After we got out of the pool it was FREEZING!! we like wore towels and then we turned off all the upstairs ac's to stop the cold air and everything. it was crazy cold!! Then Kyle and his gf Diana came over and we all watched euro-trip and Kyle brought him some clothes so he wasnt so cold and we both like wrapped up in blankets to keep in the heat. Around like 11:30 Kyle and his gf left and then like 30 min later Ben left. It was so much fun!
