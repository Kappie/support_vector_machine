I've narrowed it down to index funds and (when I get a job) a Roth IRA. Now I just have the small problem of buying index funds. They couldn't make it easy...OH NO! Finally figured out to go to Vanguard but I can't understand the crap that they're spewing (are you sensing bitterness? I am.) So if anyone on here knows how to get started PLEASE help me. I'm not asking for advice in which stock to buy but HOW to buy them.  End rant.
