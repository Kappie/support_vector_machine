Of course, most places don't open at 7am which is unfortunate because I really needed to be in Sacramento, preferably by 8:30. As it was, I left at 8:30, hoping to get there by 10, but alas, I decided to take a "short cut" which it would have been if everyone didn't drive soooo slowly.  Finally made it into lab at 10:15 and checked on my plates. No colonies again. Drat. Well, I couldn't start anything else so I go home, whereupon my PI sees me leaving (it's noon). Gah, so much for a good first impression.  Dentist at 1:30, hopefully my filling won't become loose again. Stopped by the apartment and introduced myself to the landlord who started yelling at me because she didn't know who I was. Apparently no one had informed her I would be moving in. She was quite angry and said she wouldn't allow me moving in, which would have been really bad since I was already packed and ready to go. Fortunately, she calmed down and let me stay but not without giving me a piece of her mind. I imagine a similar fate will meet my subleasor when she gets back from vacation.  Family units came at 4:30 in the midst of me frantically trying to figure out where the UHaul truck I reserved was. Finally, I managed to locate my reservation 8 miles from where I had it reserved. Anyway - I'm getting really tired, but the end of the story is that more chaos ensues before I got finally moved in. Everything is still in boxes but at least it's here. Time to collapse on the bed!
