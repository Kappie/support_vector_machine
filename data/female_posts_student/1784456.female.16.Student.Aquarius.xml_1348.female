I was proud to be one of the many. And I am proud to have made a difference. I would rather have not protested, but the war started so we stopped. If George Bush is so high and mighty then why is he supporting the innocent murders of Palestinians by Isrealies? Surely they are terrorising people. That man has double standards. Go support our cause, and find out more if you are a student.  urlLink http://www.studentstopwar.org.uk/index.php  FLY MY PRETTIES INTO THE NIGHT! Yeah... getting a bit serious, I always use 'humour' when things get serious. Some situations shouldn't get too depressing. You always need a spark of the alternate emotion to bring you back to Earth.
