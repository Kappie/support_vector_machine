I have to write 3-5 pages of my India paper, deal with two huge prelim topics (chiefdoms and the origin and identification of states), and on Thursday I get my take-home midterm in Ling, which is most certainly going to kick my ass.  Boy oh boy.  I can hardly wait.  On a happy note, it's supposed to be 71 degrees and sunny tomorrow.  Yay.  I always wake up happier when the sun is shining in my window.
