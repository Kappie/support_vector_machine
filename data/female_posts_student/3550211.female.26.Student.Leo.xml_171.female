Of course, it isn't yet confirmed that West Nile is this boy's cause of death. The media here is just playing on our fear. And god damn it, they are doing a good job. The bastards.   But, I would also like to say, HELLO people, why the hell are you all standing around stagnate water? That's a breeding ground for mosquito's. Use your brains ... get rid of the water! Sheesh.  I'm still moving though. So, if a cute little gothic punk girl shows up at your house, let her in, ok. Because,  smiles sweetly,  it will only be me.
