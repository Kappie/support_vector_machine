I stumbled across this website thing by accident. I was doing a report on seashores and i googled limpets in the image thingy. I clicked on the 1st one and it was in a blog. I used that pic in my project. So later, earlier 2day, I went back to it to read it more. so thats how i ended up w/ this. I don't exactly kno what is gonna b or if im even gonna remember i hav it. whoopeeee. so far its just gonna b my random mumblings. snib. tried to sunbathe on my roof 2day. didn't really work. I didn't fall off the roof or nething i just didn't really get a tan. Im just glad i didn't get burnt. Stupid adds!!! I should get that pop-up blocker thingy. it would probly make my computer even more messed up. I don't kno what I did but now there is a search bar above my start bar thingy. It's totally messed up my computer and i don't kno how to get rid of it. now when i get on my computer if I minimize something I can't see it untill a couple minutes later. Its like I hav to wait 4 it 2 load. Ha Donald Trump is the host on Satuday Night Live. I luv my http://www. thingy. Im not really brainless. But im becoming blonde. (no offense) my highlites r taking over. and im losing common sense (according to my Kusine). I saw this ad on TV 4 these pills that lower ur period to only 4 x's a year. They said it was safe but it doesn't sound like it. I guess thats if u don't wanna get pregnant. well i guess im done here.    Ya i did it wrong but i sorta fixed it.
