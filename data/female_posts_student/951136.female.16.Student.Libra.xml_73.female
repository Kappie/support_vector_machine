Wonderland; where iIwas still clueless. god, or i can be the guy in Memento. Just forget everything. I'll makes notes of what and who i want to remember -but i'm not sure i want all those tattoos.- ANYWAY. The point. I just, get sick of remembering what i dont have. Literally makes me sick. And its just annoying. In band today i fucked up complety. Total silence. I'm playing my solo. No one had anything to do but listen to me. and someone comes through the door... and i just fell apart. I dont even understand why. I'm just embarrased. Embarrassed to live. And i know by now, it's past just him. I want to be noticed again and I'm not.  and what i said about my auditions, you must loose what you prize most, before you can truly appreciate it. applied to life everyday. its frustrating!!!!!!!! and tiring. and distracting...i want to it go away.
