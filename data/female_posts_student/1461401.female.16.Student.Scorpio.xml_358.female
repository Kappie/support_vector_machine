With a soul patch and dark curly hair, I think he's pretty cute. Just a few minutes ago, he was working infront of the back doors, and you know what? He's wearing spongebob boxers.  Well, now I have to take lilly to her swimming lessons where I get to ogle her cute, tan, shirtless swimming instructor.  Yeah, today's pretty good.
