Love  is not having to accept perfect people but having to accept imperfect people  perfectly .   After all, this world is  never  perfect because it is inhabited byimperfect people.   All humans have flaws and it is  human nature  to make mistakes.    I am human . So therefore, I am not perfect.  And as forbeinghuman, I may not be perfect but I can  always do my best  to reach the closest spot I could get to perfection.   I may not be perfect, but I could  see more than what meets the eye .    Now tell me â€“ are we having the same  vision ?
