You gotta fight to the death for what you want, if you really want it and you're not just fucking around moping pretending you do when all you really care about is the next re-run of Friends and the potato chip bag keeping you company.  Be it love, be it war you gotta fight because if you don't, you're a moron and a wimp. Fighting doesn't guarantee you'll win but it guarantees a shot at winning, that's a good start.  What if the difference between winning and losing is getting off your arse, putting on the gloves and standing your ground? It's seldom that easy, but sometimes truth be told, you don't even have to throw a punch, if you do, don't hold back.  I often hear people say "if it happens, then it was meant to happen" or some bullshit along those lines. They're losers and don't listen to them, most of them have given up without a fight too many times or think you're a loser that doesn't have the minerals to get shitfaced and fight for yourself.   "If it happens, then it was meant to happen". Not if I can help it, not if it's up to me, not if I can have my way, and definately not without a fight. I'll be  damned  before I throw in the towel without some sweat and blood on it.
