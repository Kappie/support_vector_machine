There I go again, compulsively thinking, as only a great thinker like myself can do. I have to think all the time. What lesson do I have next? Do I have any maths homework? The teachers tell me to choose a career, what should I be? That last question has been on my mind  alot  lately, no thanks to my bloody teachers. Apparently, as I am in year 10 and still have 2 years of school left, I should decide what I going to be for the rest of my life now. Not later on, now. And what a bleak future it is looking to be. Not only do I have no idea what I want to do or be, but all of those speeches have made me even more confused than I was before, and I have also ruled out things I was considering because they sound so shit boring it's not funny and this is a run-on-sentance. Crap. I hate this...uncertainty. It's sooo god damn annoying. Yes, that career as a bum seems to be getting better and better. A hobo by day, and superwoman with super powers by night. Yeah, that's me.  At the moment I am in love with Snow Patrol. Blessed be the beautiful people who create beautiful music. None of that bashing, screaming crap for me, just beautiful music. I am listening to beautiful music right now, and am shivering at the thought of this beautiful music. I know, that is really quite weird, but I honestly do love it that much. So wonderful.  I need more books. I need to read more. If music is my oxygen, books are my water. I need both to survive. Perhaps I'll read books for a living. I'll be one of those old professors, with spectacles and a sharp wit, who reviews books for the benefit of others. That's me, always giving back to the community. Or, I could always just be a writer. Jesus, I'd love to be a writer. I love words, the way they can be arranged so subtly to mean such deep, wonderful things. God, I think I'm delousional, but that's seriously how I feel. When I read, the book reaches out and pulls me into it, enveloping me in it's words. I drink it all in, just like water.  Hmm...enough pondering for one night, I think. Perhaps another night, when I am not so intoxicated with the essence of literature, I will fill you in on a little bit of what's been happening in my life. Just a little bit...  ...A clock is ticking, somewhere...  P.S: Thanks to grindy for reviewing! *hug* ;)
