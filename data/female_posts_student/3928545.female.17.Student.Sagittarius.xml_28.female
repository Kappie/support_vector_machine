I woke up, got on the computer, practiced piano, showered, practiced piano, read, watched TV, practiced piano, went to piano lessons, the went to SARAH's house (that part wasn't depressing, except that there was a scary movie!) Yeah, now I'm just comtemplating tomorrow: Work, 10-6. I suppose there isn't much to comtemplate, I go there, give people popcorn for 8 hours, then leave.   I might go on a date next week. I'm excited, unless it turns out badly, then yeah...not really excited. But I haven't really been out w/ a guy (atleast not a "DATE") in like 6 months, which isn't a bad thing but it will be a nice change, I hope.. If he calls me, which he said he would. He  better ! I don't want to make my friend by mad at me and hate me forever though. I just wish we had the same taste in guys. Hopfully if I ever enter into a relationship again I can make better decisions and handle certain things differently.  I don't know, I might get something that makes me happy and it ends up making  me sick. That is always the case with me though; once I get something I want, I don't want it anymore. Maybe lightening up would help me.   *Teen Girl Squad*- I'm  totally  crushing!
