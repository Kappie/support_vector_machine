Yar, sorry I didn't call, I didn't want to get you in trouble or whatever (like you had formally said), and I thought you might have been going against your better judgment on my suicidal behalf. So I'll try again later, perhaps, if you say to.  Linds is doing alright, by all accounts, and that is excellent. She'd been having seperation anxiety for a while there: feel like you don't belong back home, I had it plenty. I should really let her tell what she will, but that's the jist of it. Things are calming down, the problems are falling in the sights of our long-range "problem-solving" rifles. I'm going over there in a minute, so I'm going to stop talking.  Have fun at guv'na school. Will ain't dead insofaras I know, I'll check if I can, however that may be. Peace.
