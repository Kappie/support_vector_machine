During the month that sets the tone for the entire summer, we find the song that sets the tone for the soundtrack for the next three months.    To illustrate, here are the last few summer themes:  2001:  Elevation, U2  2002:  We Are Made of Stars, Moby  2003:  Hollywood, Madge  2004:  Let it Go, Frou Frou
