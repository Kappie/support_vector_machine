Greyfairy.net was my first anime forum with post up to (about to reach) 200. my school is starting to put username in every computer and password too. that means i can freely surfing the web anytime (aside from prep. times) i want =^.^= plus, the moonfantasy forum which had been banned by the server is available too. that's why i'm so hype today.  exams is nearing, i can smell it. beginning of august, to be exact. God! SPM is all bunch of hard subjects. i dont think i can cope with the stress anymore. all i ever wanted to do rightnow is to be out from this uniforms, this school and school-life.
