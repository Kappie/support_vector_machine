One more fuckin year we can do it. West york is so cool though....i dont even wana move schools. HAHAHA. wow maybe Central will take me? Ahh oh well things are gettin better. At least i have my true friends to stick around and i know they always will. My friends are the best and everyone else can eat a tree. LOL, Hillary! Oh i can't wait till Hillary comes!! And i cant wait till school is out, i go camping, i go to flying camp and i have wonderful days "alone" at my house when my parents are at work in the summer.
