YAY! go me! what happened was I met up with a few guy friends and their sisters, totaly by accident and the library was having a media swap. And one of em had a buch of stuff to trade (like 20 things) and so he gave me a few and I traded to get some stuff. I got a Star Trek game, it's call "Star Trek; Captains Chair". I got the "Pink: Misundaztod" cd and I got "Free Willy" the first movie,and I got a Playstation game called "Silouette mirage" and an A+E movie about egypt and stuff.           In all I had a good time and it went really well, today I did nothing but sit around and I knitted a little but not much. And I have drivers ed tonight. And right now were talking about alcohol, and about half of my class has drunk. Personally I never have and I don't think I ever will, that's just the way I am. So that's been my day so far, I may write later. Bye!
