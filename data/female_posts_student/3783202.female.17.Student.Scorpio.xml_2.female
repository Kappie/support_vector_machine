Not that anyone reads this to actaully answer me, but still. So, I still haven't talked to Matt, and I'm starting to kinda feel bad, yeah only kinda. I need to talk to him and give him his thing back before Nate says something to him about him calling me ALL of the time. I mean PART and only part of it is my fault but I mean honestly who calls hangs up and calls again. The entire situation kinda creeped me out. There is a point when a person touches you or tells you they miss you and stuff like that where you completely melt inside and there are people who it makes you feel COMPLETELY creeped out, yep that would definetly be Matt. no offense to him or anything, I just don't see him like that, I don't think I ever have, or ever will. He's definetly a cool kid, but i just don't like him like that. And I seriously think Nate is going to like hurt him or something. And I wish I was kidding when I say that, and the funny thing is they both hate each other and they've never met. Matt doesn't like Nate because he "doesn't like the way" he treats me and Alex. And I'm like dude he's not a bad person, he just has commitment issues. He's all like well I'm gonna kick his ass if I see him. Now I'm sitting here trying not to die laughing since I could break him in half, I could only imagine what Nathan would do. And Nate's all like why the hell does he call you all the time, my answer...shrugging my shoulders. I think I'm going to call him tomorrow and tell him that I left my phone in Dave's car last week and Dave went out of town with his dad, so I couldn't get it. And tell him to just come up to school to get it so I only have to see him for like 2 seconds and then be done with him. He left me a message on Friday night and he was all like I know why your not talking to me and blah blah blah. He was like I know your dating Brent, I was like humm that's news to me. But whatever, I'll figure it all out later.
