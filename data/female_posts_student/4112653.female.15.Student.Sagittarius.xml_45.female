Last yr, when they formed the new HS group i dunno if im right here..but didn't all of us (well excluding me i joined mid-yr)  join right at the start of the yr? They had a decent number of "freshmans" coming into yf so they could put another group together...hehe freshmans can't wait for uni.  2) I don't think it is a good idea for the yr10 ppl to stay with the Hs group and i do have a good reason for this. One of the reasons why we go to tehillah is to have fellowship and trying to put this in a non-harsh way..but i think that people in Y/f should learn to be more open to people. We have to stretch our borders of friendship in a way..we have to welcom the new people... I kno for one that hardly any of us have spoken to Tom or Alex  (yes the new alex..i kno who im talking about) so yup.  That way if the yr10's join the college group it would expand ur friendship boundaries. U get the best of both worlds ain't that great?:D Plus the college group is small enough it needs some people to bolster the group otherwise it'll probably end up folding...  3) Yes we all shuold concentrate but the thing is when ur in such a large group that makes it hard..the reason y sometimes we just start taling is coz the answer is at the other end of the table and we can't hear it..don't get me wrong it would be lovely for all of us to be lil' angelic angels but i for one wouldn't be able to do that for a whole bs session...dunno 'bout u guys though except for nate:P  That is it i beleive..hmm..yes..i dropped my monickle will be back..tarry on  Marky>
