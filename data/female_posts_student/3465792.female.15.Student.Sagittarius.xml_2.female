IT  was a great movie. though when i looked over at aaron who was sitting next to beach, they, aaron and beach, here sucking eachothers fingers.... eeewwwww. i kept poking beach in the ribs and he bit me a few times but i only bit him twice onnthe arm really, really, hard. it swelled up after that, his arm. i warned him not to mess with me... so we left and i went to ridgdale mall for awhile and read chobits. its cool and i love the outfits chi gets to wair. i went into hot topic and saw so many cool things, it was cool.
