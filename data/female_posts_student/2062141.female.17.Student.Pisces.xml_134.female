On Friday, I thought I was doomed to be alone and bored all night but then last minute I brought a sleeping bag to Amanda's house and crashed there. On Saturday... It was a beautiful day and after getting my Dave Matthews / Jason Mraz tickets I was so happy and bouncing around my room (uh.. yeah don't talk to me I'm a nerd). I was planning to have Ryan come over but NOOO Mom and Mallorie just HAD to take MY car shopping. (???!). Depressing. But somehow I remember it was good day.. probably cause of the beautiful weather, and the tickets... and that I cleaned my room so it was all pretty happiness... So I lay in my room crashing out to DMB, thinking about what I could be doing, but not doing it. And then of course Sunday i had to do our video project with Lauren and Colin (kill me now) but since it was sunny I guess it wasn't that bad. EXCEPT I HAD TO STAY UP UNTIL 1 EDITING IT.   Ah Monday.. the most horrible day of the week. But there was  perk-- it was so warm and sunny I could have died happy. I slept in til 7:30 and rushed out of the door at 8... meh who cares about missing Orchestra. But with the lack of time and laundry I had to dress ...gasp... PREPPY. But good thing cause the cheerleaders all had to dress like "Rockstars" for tryouts, and damned if I'm gonna look like a cheerleader. Lol.  Anyways... weird thing happened today... talk about blast from the past... I saw Mike Tateishi today walking around the school (he graduated last year btw) ...I was supposed to be making up a test but I ended up talking to him for a bit... he's going to Iraq in two days (!!?)... stupid army guys. But... yeah... that was wierd... BLArgh I'm hungry and tired and broke. Not good things. But... it was sunny today.
