I am well as well can be, seeing as the poplar trees are pollinating and making me very drowsy and stuffy.  I am moving soon. Excited? yes and no. In my time at the house I was sitting I had discovered how nice it is to live alone and to not have to worry about other people using bathrooms when I really really had to pee. I also discovered how nice it is to be independent and to be more or less free to come and go as I please. Not that I can't do this now, but sometimes I feel that I am being inconsiderate of those around me and therefore have the need to feel this independence.  Hockey is nearly over. Thursday the 3rd (today) is game 5 for the Flames vs. Lightning. Series is tied 2-2...GO FLAMES GO!!  I finally jumped on the bandwagon and bought a shirt but I fear that my leap onto this large bandwagon may have caused it to fall over. I hope not...I am not that big and there are people on this thing that are much bigger than I am:)  With that I will say adieu. Hopefully the best team will be winning the Stanley Cup (and by the best team I mean the Flames, of course):)   Amanda
