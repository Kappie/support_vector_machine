Human nature? The guys acting as the 'police men' started acting violently towards the 'prisoners' and the experiment had to be  stopped. Apparantly there was an experiment where people were told to listen to people answering questions, and press 'yes' or 'no' according to the answer that they gave. If they pressed no, then they would hear screaming, as if the person had been given an electric shock. But the person in the white coat behind them told them that it was ok, so they kept going, until the screams stopped. Human nature? Or the corruptive effect of power?
