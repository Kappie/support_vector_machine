Anyone who knows me has probably heard me complain about the impending snow, but my sad little Mississippi heart really does like the snow, and I always feel a little bit lighter, if a little bit colder, with the first snow of the year.  To me, snow actually brightens the day.  And I don't mean in the figurative sense; snow literally brightens the day.  When it snows, the sky is usually cloudy and dark.  But the snow is white, and it reflects the limited light available.  So it's brighter.    Some of you are probably thinking that it's amazing, and somewhat scary, to see how my mind works.  So I guess I'll just say stay warm, wherever you are...and depending on where you are, it might be easier or harder.
