GR! So went to chapel hill with my mom which is always a fun drive! Simiply because i use the 45 minutes to listen to good music. Hadta get my panoramic xray around 3 and then my actual appt was @ 4.  And then since they did so much stuff i didnt end up getting outta there until 5 20! GR! However, we ended up meeting my dad on franklin st. @ Pepper's pizza! It was really good + i got this cute shirt at some store down the street! And guess who i saw?!  HARRY!! haha--i havent seen him since school ended so that was nice! I've missed big H-dog.    Headed back to raleigh, talked on line, and then i was KIDNAPPED!! *haha* Aaron and McCall came over and we were gonna go see Fahrenheit 9/11 but of course it was sold out--opening day and all. So we ended up going back to McCall's house and watching the royal tenenbaums [sp?] I liked it a lot.  Got to meet McCall's parents, attempt to eat a triscuit with my hurty teeth, and meet inbred scout.  Got home around midnight and read Bodiily Harm by Atwood until 1.    Woke up today, showered, and now im spending the day w/ CHRIS whose finally back from the beach!  Woohoo for everyone coming back to raleigh!
