Hello, he was advised to leave by the same organization that advised him to go there in the first place, was he not? They are telling a headless man, "WE TOLD YOU SO!" *shakes her own well-attached head in disbelief*  Iraq abuse has been quoted as being seen as vigilante justice. THERE IS NO JUSTICE THERE - Vigilante or otherwise. Bush just likes nice words that have a bit of a ring to them. Who cares whether they make any sense or are accurate. The word justice has no business coming anywhere near the Iraq abuse cases....except perhaps in the trials of the accused and their superiors. Injustice however is getting its word workout for the week. Oh and hey, the Red Cross says the abuse is a wide spread problem...the guilty party - the military - says its a focused incident. Who do you believe?  Read about Bush's "white people" gaff. I can't believe that isnt all over the media. Who is sitting on this one and not letting it out?  I can't believe Sen. John McCain - R AZ. was asking a military panel whether the US should have signed the Geneva convention...and Sen. James Inholfe - R. OK.  was saying the prisoners deserved their treatment (they committed crimes to be in Abu Grahaib is his logic...) and that we should be concerned with the status of our soldiers. Yeah, since we clearly dont go by the Geneva Conventions - one of the marks of a "progressive and modern" nation - we need to be concerned about all American troops captured or being held. Just ask Nick Berg. And McCain is a former POW at that. Sure McCain, we should un-sign a document that narrowly is one of the only forms of protection US POWs have (when fighting organized government enemies.) Its not perfect - but its SOMETHING. And it serves as an international checks and balance system in the theatre of war - you take care of my soldiers, I will take care of yours. Rumsfeld informed us that the Geneva Conventions dont apply when fighting terrorists. For such a "Christian Nation" the government sure chooses when and where to apply its values. What happened to turning the other cheek? What happened to doing unto others blah blah blah *insert golden rule here*? Out the door with the bathwater I suppose. And then following Inholfe's train of logic leads this way: Inholfe has said that the prisoners in Abu Grhaib are there because they are criminals (no trials here folks!) and that their treatment is a result of that. Thus Inholfe believes that wives that get beaten deserve it, women that get raped have earned it, and that certainly any incarcerated prisoners deserve to be broken. So think Inholfe will get the US inmate vote next election in Oklahoma? How to idiots like this get to be elected? OH YEAH ITS THAT 33% VOTER TURN OUT THING!!!! VOTE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont care what party you are. As long as you do some thinking, some minimal research, and GO VOTE!!!!!  Saw a news article on TV saying Kerry needs to find his "inner Arnold" so as to unite the two political parties. Arnold's "magic" is he has no experience and no idea what he's doing so he turns to the experts on the issues...regardless of their political party. He's not really a "politician" in the partisan sense. Arnold's magic does not work on everyone. I am not sure Kerry has an Arnold within him ( and thats probably a good thing as steroids in a candidate for president cant be healthy.)  I am not sure if there is any true "politician" out there that will do non-partisan work just to get the opinions and efforts of the person who has the most expertise - regardless of their political fencing.  But perhaps, with a good audition, Kerry just might be able to get a bit part in Terminator 4  - where the United States realizes that President Bush is an evil robot sent from the future to destroy our country and Kerry has to rescue us all....Think it would sell?  On the other hand, maybe our political parties dont cooperate well because why? Too few political parties for one thing. We are a "highly polarized"electorate and our public officials dont want to lose re-election due to "sleeping with the enemy." Which brings me around to my last rant for the moment....we elect politicians to represent us. Then they get in office and do their own thing. Assuming that since we elected them, we must agree with them. NO NO NO NO NO. Politicians are supposed to REPRESENT their electorate...not decide for them...not impose their own opinions on their constituents. (Inholfe's constituents were quoted as finding his opinion not representative of Oklahoma thinking....)It seems public officials forget that they dont answer to and for the people every 4 years or so...but every day. *sigh*  I am going back to sleep now. Maybe when I wake up there will be some kind of "good news" out there....like A Team reruns coming back, or the Knight Rider coming back in syndication. But I am not holding my breath.  --Mack
