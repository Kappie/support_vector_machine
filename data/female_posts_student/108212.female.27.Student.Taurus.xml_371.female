I'm too busy with other commitments that any travelling that is not related to massage therapy or spoken word and/or arts events are just out of the question.    As you can tell, I'm beat. Plum exhuasted. I've been juggling my therapeutic massage practice, organizing for a huge poetry and arts festival, and founding Vallejo Phoenix Rising--a touring spoken word group that will promote the local arts organizations and raise funds for publications and other performance poetry productions.    Bad news. My girlfriend dumped me. It was no surprise. It was my fault. The distance. The fact that our parents would totally oppose our relationship. The fact that I'm bound in Vallejo cuz the finances are not picking up. Oh, and I cheated on her. [hisssss, hisss, BOOOO] Yeah, I feel like shit. I'm going to crawl into a cave and die now...
