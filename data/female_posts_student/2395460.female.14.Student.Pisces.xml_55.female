Some really amazing directors, like  urlLink Wong Kar-Wai  and  urlLink Ang Lee  participated but the concept didn't really seem to take off. Now it's back.   There are the  urlLink Nike Art of Speed  shorts by 15 young directors.   While not officially commissioned by Apple,  urlLink Cherry Sky Films  has produced a series of five shorts, all centered around the mighty iPod and collectively dubbed the  SkyPod Shorts .  Cherry Sky produced  urlLink Better Luck Tomorrow , the movie that launched the career of  urlLink Justin Lin .   Like the BMW films, the SkyPod shorts aren't really films at all, but glossy, extended commercials. The shorts range from arty and hypnotic ( Dream, Lover ) to silly (the straight-out-of-a Hilary Duff movie,  Glowsticks  Drumsticks ).   The SkyPod shorts are actually more like odes to Final Cut Pro than they are to the iPod. Although each filmmaker was given a budget of less than $4500, you'd never know it from the elegant production values. While I wasn't blown away by any of the films, it really hit me how much low-budget filmmaking has been revolutionized by products like FCP. These films weren't choppy or sloppy, they had all the technical grace of the ultra-high budget BMW shorts.   Hey everyone, go out and film your stories, make your movies. Anyone can do it now, it's incredible.  Ah okay, the SkyPod shorts aren't viewable online yet, as they're still being shown in festivals, but should be up at some point in the fall. You can get screening dates from the   urlLink Cherry Sky  site.
