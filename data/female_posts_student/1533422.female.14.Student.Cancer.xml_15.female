I'm talking to Clare, and getting sooo annoyed with her, so everytime she says something she finds funny, I go, "lol." or "ha." with the full stops, cuz it always looks like they're just doing that to be polite, which, indeed, I am, but also to get to her after a while.   Pooj's winding up Clare on this group convo we've got.  It's funny, because she needs bringing down to size.  Pooj's pretending to be starting this webpage, cuz Clare's all self-proclaimed HTMLy.  Lool, you have to be here.  I can't be bothered to explain it all.  MSN profiles work again!  I've got this black and white picture of me on mine, and Pooj rang me and asked who it was, pml!  Apparently it doesn't look like me.  I didn't think so either, but ... hey, it stays!  Elliot's profile is rubbish, because all it says, basically, is, "I'm free and good-looking," and I knew that anyway!! Bob's pic is funny, cuz he looks ever so slightly retarded, and Sean's ... well, the less said about Sean's, the better :P cuz T.S.Eliot smells!  Och, can't be bothered to write anymore.  Clare is officially wound up (she just keeps leaving the convos now) and I have a headache.  And I just want to talk to Pooj about Elliot, and **** *******-******, and ******
