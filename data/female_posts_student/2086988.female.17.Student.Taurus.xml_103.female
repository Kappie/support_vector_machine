I did not need this, nothing would of happened if it wasn't for Embry, I mean I don't need to be yelled at for something I can't control. Now, Kiera and Embry are fighting which puts me in the middle, great. Just what I wanted, now I get to hear them back and forth talking about each other.  And to top that off, my parents are fighting and I'm put in the middle again. I don't care about their freaking issues, if they have problems with each other freaking talk with the other person and stop making me play monkey in the middle. Like tonight, my mom is upset with my dad because he didn't ask her to come with him. I finally just told her to get freaking over it and get on with life. It's not that big of a deal. Plus, I don't care about their problems, I have enough of my own. And that shut her up.   Speaking of my mom, I HATE her so much. She is always critizing me, I will never be good enough for this woman. I'm sorry if I'll never be a freaking size 2, let me just kill myself now...It's always you shouldn't wear that or you shouldn't eat that. Well since I already have eating issues anyways, Ritika and Kiera know, they've talked to me about it, lol Ritika said if I didn't eat she'd beat me up. But I've been better about it lately... Kiera's actually seen firsthand how much of a nazi my mom can be. Kiera was spending the night last week and she had some candy, that was hers and not mine, and my mom comes upstairs and takes it away and is like you're not eating this blah blah. It wasn't even mine! And then last week I go in to give her a hug before I go to school and I know, I really don't hug all that well. So my mom asks, how does David hug? And I was like really good, he'll sometimes lift me off the floor. And she goes, well then you need to lose some weight then. I was like wtf, then she was like, well you have to be skinny for someone to pick you up, you'd have to weigh like 100 lbs. Then she tries to be like ohh I didn't mean it like that, anyways you're to sensitive. I beginning to realize why I'm so self conscious is because of her...  I just wish I could disappear for a while...  The only thing that truly makes me happy in my life, is David, he has got to be the most perfect guy. Sometimes I think he deserves better, I shouldn't have such a wonderful guy.  Wow, it feels pretty good to get this all out, it's just been inside, hidden by the happy mask I always put on. Which 99.9% I am happy go lucky, but sometimes all this gets to me. I think it's just this time in the month, I get kinda depressed and just wanna let things out...
