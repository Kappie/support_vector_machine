I have nearly spent the entire day trying to create a blog for my  family to share (we have what you would call... lost touch!). The thing  is that it has to be in French (since I'm French, and so is my  family...), and the blogging solutions are far from being as good as  the english (american) ones... I have been doing that since 5 this morning ( urlLink Gaia  woke me up because  of a very bad stomach (poor thing... we're definitely going to the vet  tomorrow, this has gone on for just too long!), and I just haven't been  able to go back to bed. Anyway! Time to go and experience the real world a little... (and I'm  sure my husband wouldn't mind if he could have access to the computer  for just about 5 minutes... I can feel him breathing in my neck!!).
