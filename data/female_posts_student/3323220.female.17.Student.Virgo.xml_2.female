They were so different from my friends in primary  secondary. Now I'm not comparing..jus dat each were unique in their own ways. And I love them in their own unique ways. A girl named Selina, helped me build up my confidence. Day by day. She may not realised how much I am thankful and grateful for wat she hafve done. (R u wondering wat is it? Haha..nah..she didnt do much actually.) It's thru her actions  behaviors dat I learned alot. Haha..(Selina, if u r reading tis..I'm giving u a hug now =P) Hugz~ She's a very very nice friend who takes care of the little baby here (ME!!). Haha..den another friend who I had pleasure knowing is HIM. Hee!  He was my classmate. My heart gave dat little jump when I first saw him. Guess I was attracted to his looks. Keke~ Who wouldnt??? He got dat tanned look. Plus he looks abit blur  innocent. He's both boyish and man-ish. Hard to find leh! GEM~ lol..He got dat kind of eyes dat shows his blurness (which makes him look cute), and always never fail to make my heart jump faster ;) Got a great smile. Very sunshine  'tian zhen wu xie' kind! Haha..mesmerised by dat dazzling smile until now! Hee..to top it all, he got those 2 cute dimples. (jus like my idol, Zaizai..except zaizai got 1 only) Which shows his boyish innocence! (Makes him look cuter!!) He always grumble abt the dimples though. Said dat they were ugly..got 2 holes in his face lidat..Haha! Though he's not considered tall (same height as me), he got a MAN body. Haha..his muscles trained from all the tough dance trainings. Of coz I dun ONLY like him b'coz of his looks. I dun look for dat department much when I like someone. Dat someone gotta haf charm or charisma or character to attract me. Yea..He got most of wat I wanted- my dream guy. Lol! He dun go for looks. (Can be proven- he dun look  judge at girls whenever he went out wif us. He dun ask Selina or me to intro him gals.) He's quite a gentleman. (Gentlemen r popular among gals. Hee..cant think y. Aniwae, my kind of 'gentleman' dun haf to be extreme case. He jus gotta respect the ladies. Yea?) He's got such a strong passion for dance dat I admire  respect alot. He's so innocent coz he doesnt think there are EVIL in tis world. As in, he had a very bad habit of hiding his things somewhere. And dat somewhere is PUBLIC. Gosh! Can u imagine??? Got one time he wanted to collect the CNY pay wif me. But we 2 couldnt find the right time to meet. So he suggested HIDING his IC (IC!!! REAL Identification Card for god's sake!) somewhere at Orchard MRT, den I go take his IC  help him collect his pay. Haha..so innocent dat I wanna laugh. I mean, there r BAD GUYS ard who wld find his IC  take it sell or wat mah. But dat's wat I like abt him in the first place. Lol! He's a generous n unselfish guy. (Opposite frm me..sobz sobz!) He got dat little streak of rebellion in him too! Makes him an adventurous  fun-loving guy. (A little like me?! Hee..) He's quite filial  doesnt seem to go against his family kind; rebellious (Opposite frm me AGAIN! *Wail*) One thing I wish he could change is: To place his education as top top priority. Haha..his dance seems to cum first. Den he haf a liking for skipping classes. (Heard he's better now..compared to during OI days..he really skip sch like siao!) He's also a super ultra caring guy. Nowadays hard to find such friend/guy liao. I learn to be more caring towards ppl, esp my friends  family. (frm him! Thanks to him!) He's always concerned abt his frds too. I hate it! Jus made me like him even more.  I tried many times to forget him. Failed badly! Haha..tis feeling is weird. Never occured b4..I mean, dat kind of feeling dat spells TROUBLE. Hee..had many dreams  fantasies abt him =P Yst I dreamt abt him again. Sighs! Selina wished me sweet dreams last nite. I said "No dreams pls!" (Coz those dreams only urge me to think more than I can afford to) Den Selina wished me a dreamless nite. BUT LOOK WAT HAPPENED? haha..not her fault..reali was a sweet dream. The reason y I dun wan sweet dreams is b'coz, it happen only IN MY DREAMS. Haha..I dreamt dat I suffered a shock. Den I opened the door to run away from the 'shock'. Suddenly someone from outside the door pulled my arm and into his embrace. I jus hugged him and sobbed. (Coz I was recovering from the shock) It felt so good! Arhhh!! (Still haf the dreamy feeling now..hmmm...) When I woke up  realised it was a dream, I practically wanna screamed "I wanted a dreamless nite...den y give me such a nice dream somemore??? Argh!!" Cannot-take-it kind, u noe? Haha..but somewhere b4 Selina's b'day, I gave up the run of liking him. Partly b'coz my love (Love??? *thinking hard* Can consider love mah? Haha) was one-sided all tis while. Sighs! Sad but true~ Tis time I am successful in forgetting him. He'll always be my dearest brother in my heart.  There was once or twice I asked myself whether I should confess to him not. Maybe he oso got feelings for me??? Haha...DREAM ON, GAL! yea..as usual la, me dreaming away..I debated wif myself for awhile b4 deciding...NO! I cant ruin these beautiful memories I had of him, and his nice impression of me. (I hope I do haf nice impressions on him..haha =P) I had our friendship to consider. I value him as my frd too much to spoil it by confessing. Besides, it was clear dat he likes me as a friend only. (same for Selina and maybe some other gal friends) 2004 Chinese New Year, we went out. Elton, Selina, him  I. Elton got sth on and left first. Simon came to meet us at PS. As most shops close early, we had nth to do so we went home lor. Selina taking MRT home, while I take bus. The guys can take both. So they were thinking who go accomapny who go home lor. Den being the nice gal (me), I told him to go wif Selina (coz they r neighbours). Den it was decided to use the traditional method to decide. Haha..yea.."O'ya peh ya som"  "scissors-paper-stone". In the end...Selina  Simon, me  him. Well actually it's kinda fated. Lol! (Selina wanted tis ending too..coz she's a very gd frd. Knew I like him..den wanted tis opportunity for us) Dunno Selina  Simon got conspire against me not..haha..anyway, even if is I oso wun blame them. *Winkz* So he accompany me take bus go home. Den he suggested go surprise Selina at her hse wan anot. So being the mischievious  adventurous me, I agreed la. Haha..it's damn irony  funny. We were both in for a surprise! Selina wasn at home. Coz she went to Chinatown wif her mom. Den no choice..I go to Willy's hse. Jus happen he gonna take his reunion dinner. (Actually not reali considered reunion la..coz only he  I eating) Haha..imagine my expressions all the way. I was sooo embarrassed coz his grandma  Aunties were at home. I scared they misunderstood I was his's gf (Who wouldnt misunderstood when a guy brgs a gal over to his hse on Chinese New Year's Eve to eat dinner???) I only ate a few mouthfuls of rice coz I was quite full. (Quite a surprise to me..coz usually I got big appetites!) Den he so cute..eat the rice wif curry  CRACKERS! Haha..dat's him! Can always expect the unexpected from him ;) I was further embarrassed when his grandpa gave me hongbao!!! Pai seh coz I didnt brg any oranges over. (the house-visiting was last minute decide one..) His hongbao oso quite generous!  Forgot to mention dat he's oso a thoughtful guy. Hmm..he reali sounds like any gal's dream guy rite? Haha..he reali is every gal's dream guy. His gf must be very lucky! *Winkz* He knew I like F4..den recently Channel 8 is showing  ..he specially called me to tell me dat the show is on. Twice! Haha..my other frds knew I like F4 oso didnt call me to tell me..haha..(actually I already knew it's on..coz I'm a TV addict! :) My frds no need call to tell me..they oso noe dat I noe..haha)  I am scared dat I will forget all these lovely memories, therefore I type tis blogspot. It's like my diary except dat it is a chapter dat has an ending le. A chapter dat I've closed long ago in my heart. Seeing him happy will make me very happy. Therefore I wish him all the best and hope he finds his dream gal soon! (Not refering to myself..haha..I noe I'm not anyone's dream gal. Maybe not now?!) A beautiful memory must end wif a beautiful ending. How I wish I am your dream gal, Willy.
