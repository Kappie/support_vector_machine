Ron  REA gan and  RAY  Charles? I think it's a message from the powers that be. Like some kind of code.. JA-RAY, RAY-JA, RAJA? AJAR? Some cosmic Raja will leave the door to the universe ajar and we will all be sucked in? I suppose what I'm writing is pointless since by the time we got sucked in it would be too late and we wouldn't know we had been sucked in because we would be dead. Ok, so I haven't slept in 32 hours, perhaps you can tell? It is a fairly interesting thought process. It took me all of 10 minutes to put the pieces together.
