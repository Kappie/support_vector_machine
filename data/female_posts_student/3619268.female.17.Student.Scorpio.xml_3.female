Mr. J popped over this morning before he had to go to work and we were canoodling on the couch (minor kissing and I was tweaking his leg hair to get his attention- the usual tame stuff) when my brother waltzes in and says "oh for the love of god I really dont need to see that".. not so bad.. it was embarassing as hell though, considering Mr. J dislike doing things on the off chance that we'll get caught (I mean, c'mon, what person enjoys having another person, let alone a family member, walk in on them??? it's weird and we try to steer clear of it) I immediately hid my face and said "i'm just going to crawl up under the ottoman and die now if you dont mind".. which my brother chuckled at... a few minutes later, though, the shmuck and my mother pulled me into the kitchen (which, mind you, you can still hear EVERY freakin word- the rooms downstairs arent exactly soundproof- duh) to chew me out about it.. saying i was a whore, and that i had no respect for them.. that I actually thought it was funny..   hell no. those words never left my mouth   grr.. it just irritates me that she a) calls me a whore, when, if she actually took the time to talk to me in the days we've had to spend together instead of avoiding me like the bubonic plague, she'd know that I'm not and Mr. J and I talk about not going further than we have because its too soon and neither of us are ready.. period.. end of story.. we're not that stupid.. and what's more, I've told her that I'd talk to her about it prior to doing anything of that sort.. which, if you ask most teenagers, isnt exactly common place.. and b) has the nerve to just barge in while I'm trying to explain myself (not give excuses mind you- it was wrong and we'll tone it down.. both for their sake and ours) to tell me that I dont respect her or this family.. well, how can I when  they  dont respect me??? I mean, they always sit there and tell me that I cant be respected untill I respect them.. I do what they ask, and what do I get? nada, zilch, a big fat goose egg... grrrrrrrr!!!!!!! Respect goes both ways.. I'm a human being and I'm not going to just blindly follow them.. A good friend of mine, Cass, once had a saying, "be blindly loyal like a dog and be prepared to be treated like one"...  ((final frustrated sight)) ..grr.. Even worse than them embarassing me though, they embarrased Mr. J.. They claim to care about him and respect him, but then she goes and yells that we're being promiscuous (which, FYI, we're not.. ) which completely insults his morals and made him feel horrible... GRR!!!   ((breathes))   sorry about that everyone, but I just needed to get it out...  ((takes a breath))  This has been a test of the emergency ranting broadcast system. This is only a test. We will now return to your regularly scheduled programming.. thank you and have a nice day..  ~Megs
