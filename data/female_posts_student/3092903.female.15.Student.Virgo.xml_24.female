I joke around with her by calling her Jimminy, but if she werent around, I would probably would go crazy from not being able to tell anyone the reasons I do things. I'm glad there is at least one person that I can be honest with everything about (not that I cant be honest with Rachel or Lisa, because I can, but their not always around like Sara is..) Sara just made me realize how I say some things to people just to please them or make them feel better and satisfy whatevr is making them mad instead of actually saying how i feel or standing my ground completely. I know I do it, I learned it from my mom and it sucks. And at the beginning of the school year, I had a friendship with someone where it was a constant argument that could never be won, and I guess now I would rather just have peace in a situation rather than proving my point. Besides, this person likes to think they have all control and attention anyway, and I have been through this with them before and if I can let her think she's won whatever it is they're searching to win then I have won myself some peace and I can go on about my life. And besides, I hate when people are mad at me. For some reason I cant live with myself when someone has a problem with me that i CAN control. So I fixed it, and I feel a hell of a lot better now. I found some things out today from another friend that helps me completely understand where the very root of this problem is, and what is it--Just what I expected it to be...jealousy. So now I understand it all, and I can finally move forward after this terrible week of dishonesty and finally move on with my normal life, because I cant live with myself one more moment if I have to be deceitful anymore and I think the very last bit of that was taken care of last night. So now I can start being normal, fun Erin again without having any shit to deal with and thats exactly what I plan to do. Whew, feels good to get all that out.   "Hey, come on, try a little. Nothing is forever. There has to be something better than in the middle. But me and Cinderella put it all together. We can drive it home with one headlight.."
