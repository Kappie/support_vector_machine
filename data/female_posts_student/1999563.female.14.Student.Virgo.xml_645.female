He is kind and sweet, but pulls a lot of pranks (and probably quite a few on you too!!)and can always make you laugh. Congrats!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (14 choices now!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    He is hot. [asthma catcher! Hahahha]  Like on that 70s show.  Wow. Every post I make is making me sound worse and worse and worse and worse...   Back to the real Laura. I have absolutely nothing to do until Sunday. Which makes me happy...but kind of sad. I want to do something awesomely cool. Like discover a new planet or something. I hope my brother wants to look at stars tonight.  He is going to buy a new telescope!! It cost 500 dollars so that will help me in my search for extra terrestials and/or my new planet! I am totally gonna name it Fantora.  Woohoo!  But the thing is, I am deathly afraid of stars so I can only look at them for about 15 minutes then I run inside all scared. Hahahha.  As I am approaching 80,000 words I want to say thank you. I know i say this a lot, but I totally mean it! I couldn't ask for a better grope of people to be reading my innermost thoughts.   Well, actually, they aren't my most innermost thoughts but they are close.  I wish I could tell you my inner thoughts but I would probably loose a lot of friends...my thoughts are just...weird...Hahaha.  Now that I have scared enough of you with that snippet on my thoughts I will be leaving...
