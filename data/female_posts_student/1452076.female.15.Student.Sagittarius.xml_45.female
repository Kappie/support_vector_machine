It's the first pedal that I really got to try out and it belongs to Sean. (Thanks for lending it to me and Nicholas!) Since no one else is at home, I can safely unleash the awesome power of the overdrive pedal! Muahaha! I hope the noisy construction work downstairs is loud enough so the neighbours won't trace the origin of the generated noise pollution to me alone. Initially I thought it was just to amplify the sound or something to that effect since it's named  'Tubescreamer' . I couldn't tell that the grey pedal was for overdrive effect when I first saw it until I received Sean's SMS. No wonder there was the tiny knob on the top labelled  'Drive' . How silly of me. I've also managed to lay my hands on Dan Brown's  Da Vinci Code  (Finally!) and  Angels and Demons  (The two bestsellers on Life! bestsellers list for the past few months) when I passed by MPH the day before. You won't be hearing from me for the next couple of days.
