I don't like running for time.  I feel like I don't run as much as I do for distance.  Today I ran for 20 min and I felt like it was a waste of time.  This whole week except for Saturday will be running at most 25 min.  I know the time and mileage will work its way, I guess I have to be patient and do what the doctors order so I wont' get injured, again.  Its hard however right when you get in your groove you need to stop running.
