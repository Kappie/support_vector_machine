Another day has almost come and gone Canat imagine what else could wrong Sometimes I'd like to hide away somewhere and lock the door A single battle lost but not the war (because)  Tomorrow is another day And I am thirsty anyway So bring on the rain  Itas almost like the hard times circle around A couple drops and they all start coming down Yeah, I might feel defeated, I might hang my head I might be barely breathing - but I am not dead  Tomorrow is another day And I am thirsty anyway So bring on the rain  I am not gonna let it get me down I am not gonna cry And I am not gonna lose any sleep tonight   Tomorrow is another day And I am thirsty anyway So bring on the rain - Bring on the Rain  Jo Dee Messina  Bring on the rain!
