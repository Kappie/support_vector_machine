The first claim I base on the fact that if I sign up for their mail-in refills program, they reduce my copay by half. I think this is ridiculous. I don't like getting important things in the mail, because they tend to get lost and/or squished. Also, there is no way to verify exactly what kind of conditions mail-ordered things are handled and shipped in. I would much rather go to a nice, well-lit pharmacy and watch the little gray-haired man carefully fill my prescriptions while I scan his diplomas.   Now, the second problem I have with this insurance company is that they have raised the copay on my prescriptions, classified as "mental health" medications, three times in the past six months, from $8 a refill to $30 apiece. They say that it's because instead of being "as-needed" medicines, for example, to treat a brief case of insomnia while under a lot of stress, they are now "maintenance" prescriptions, because the insomnia doesn't seem to be going away. Now, if you ask me, the class of consumers that I would least want to irritate, much less give the perception of screwing out of excessive copays, are those who need sedatives. I mean, if you're going to fuck with people who are on drugs, why not the peaceful, nonconfrontational patients, like narcoleptics, or people who have scrips for medical marijuana? Don't piss off the people who can't sleep more than three hours nightly without mild tranquilizersand who tend to scream at store clerks if they don't get their fix.   Case in point: I call Target pharmacy not too long ago to verify that they had received my online refill request, and that my pills were ready to be picked up. Allegedly, they were. When I arrived, only my Ambien was ready, although I had also asked that my birth control pills and my Xanax (sweet stress-relief, for the Rx uninitiated) be refilled. They weren't, and the pharmacists took their sweet-ass time in calling another pharmacy, verifying the number of refills on my birth control pills, and performing various other tasks which were not requisite to me getting my contraceptives. After about 10 minutes, I was in need of either my correctly filled prescriptions, or at least an appetizer of Xanax. Because I was very, very close to screaming, "Just give me my goddamn birth control!" But I restrained myself, and the situation resolved itself after about 45 minutes of controlled breathing by me.   This brings me to my next topic: I am just waiting for my pharmacist to tell me that he can no longer fill my birth control pills because he has a "moral objection" to it.That is one scene I would have no problem making in a public area (as if that's such a short list). Apparently, this is happening more and more in Texas, and a couple of state legislatures (not ours, yet)have gone so far as to pass laws allowing medical professionals to either not prescribe or not fill prescriptions for uses that are not consistent with their moral beliefs, including contraceptives. This outrages me beyond words. Apparently, a group calling itself Physicians for Life  urlLink has asserted  (with very few, if any, notable empirical academic references) that birth control pills are unacceptable to opponents of abortion, because they cause a fertilized egg to abort itself. This is NOT the way that the pill works; it prevents pregnancy by preventing ovulation, meaning that there are no eggs to be fertilized. Which means this is another misogynistic attempt by the antiabortion movement and the religious right to further squelch women's rights.   Now, I'm nowhere near what our buddy Rush Limbaugh likes to call a "Feminazi." I like my free drinks,get-out-of-speeding-tickets-free cardsand whistles from construction workers as much as the next old-fashioned girl, but for god's sake,women have been getting screwed in a plethora of ways since day one. Sorry, guys, but there's no way that getting away with a few speeding tickets and having drinks bought for you because you have breasts makes up for being paid less than 80% of men's average salaries, not to mention shit like this.   I wonder how the pharmacists would react if the religious right demanded that they stopserving upViagra for men who might use it in an extramarital relationship? Or to relax with some nice, sinful porn? For some reason, I just don't see that happening. And on the subject of male enhancement, am I the only person who is creeped out by that Enzyte guy? TV is getting way too personal for me, I guess. But that's another rant.
