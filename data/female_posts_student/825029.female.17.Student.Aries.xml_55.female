"modern art" of blog entries being that they are all... abstract or depressing : / but im not depressed!!! or... abstract!  so the band banquet was tonight and that was fun except when some people talk on and on about old ppl junk and then some seniors who should just keep quiet go ahead and get emotional over their stuffed walrus theyre giving to someone else no one knows heh.  all in all it was a very good night. i get to go to the Byron Nelson Open tomorrow... not really sure if i like golf but at least it isnt scarborough fair.. i have to memorize my solo for state next week and do my three lab reports due next week along with those tests i dont keep track of and blah blah i hate school. school will all be over with very soon and then the summer is here.  that is the greatest thought that has crossed my mind in at least... 20 minutes. wow.  gonna be a senior.  i cant wait.  well im not really sure what to say other than all my friends are awesome.  ok well im done here i think.  ill stay up for another hour or so. ill see you all monday and well get some serious schoolage done! (pronounced like "shoolage" kthx) layturs!
