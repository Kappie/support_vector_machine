I was just like, why bother?? Really? I tried to at least practice during lunch, but Wind Symphony didn't have to play, and I'm too self-concious about my playing to play whn people can hear me, haha, so I just hung with Brandon and Alex and them. Lot's 'o fun. Tomorrow's going to be a reallllllly long day. School, marching, then marching sectional. I probably wont get home until about 7:30 and then I've got homework and other stuff to do  Blah. I know that's not busy compared to some people's lives like...Diane. Diane has school, marching, AND TCBY. I honestly don't know if I could handle that. Too much to do. I'd go insane, and I'm not a very organized person so, that doesn't help much.   Anyywayy, I think I'm going to go eat dinner now actually, then go for a bit of a drive, then I have to go get a plunger from Home Depot or something so I can make my plunger mute. Lots to do, lots to do.
