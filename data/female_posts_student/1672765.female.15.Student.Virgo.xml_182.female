I always am on time but my sister and mom are always at least 30 minutes late for everthing and I hate waiting. So I have nothing to do so I figured I'd just write some nonsense up.  Everything was going okay but I just heard my sister yelling at my mom so it's going to be a bad trip up, I can tell. Four hours. I like road trips, myself. Actually, I just remember I should take different headphones because they keep the sound in more - usually my music can be heard by everyone around me when I'm using my CD player.  I still don't know what I'm going to do about this thing that I found out about yesterday. It's very wrong and horrible but there isn't anything I can do about it. It makes me angry though, but I don't want to get into it because it's not something most people talk about, and I certainly don't - it's one of those things society has made us feel ashamed about. Besides I'd just rant a long time and that's no fun. I'm just trying to cope with it even though it's always there and there isn't any avoiding it. Not this.  I have about a gallon of water and two quart bag ziplocks of cheetos for the trip so I'm good to go. Also I have my CD player a few CDs and a couple books for choice. Should be alright but then I think about this one thing that's going to come up on our trip and it has to do with the thing that I was talking about and that's not going to be very fun but you know - whatever. I have some money for when I go to Tower but I can't decide on what I'm going to get yet. I think I have enough for two CDs - depending on the price I might be able to get 3. Or maybe two CDs and a cassette. I don't know yet.    " Yo Adrien! "    Music: Short Pause/Long Pause - We're All Broken
