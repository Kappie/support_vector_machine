So I really hope he gets his act together and it looks like things will be okay. I mean I always knew they would be but it was just getting so damn hard to even see positive at all. But I'm really just looking forward to spending time with my baby! I'm getting my license soon and I have a car, but that now means, I have to get a job. :( Oh well, with privledges come resposibility...hehe. gotta go!!!!!  ***Looking through the bad, is the best way around a tough situation***
