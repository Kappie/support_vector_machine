My parents don't want me to know that they know, because if they did they would have talked to me about it. My brother on the other hand, I thought when he found out he would want to go and kill someone. Instead he talked to me about it helped me out and gave me the support I need. He may not be happy with it but he learned instead of getting pissed just to be there for me. Some times they way people act are really different then you think they will.
