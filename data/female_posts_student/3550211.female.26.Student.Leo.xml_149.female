I am punk. So here I am standing inbetween these two gigantic beasts of women, who together must total near 200 years old and 400 pounds, listening to them argue over what  I should be labeled.   Uh ... huh ... wha?  Gothic? Punk? Last time I checked, I thought I was just ME.   See -   I'm just me.  Why do we feel the need to label everything? We label people, sexuality, places, attitudes, politics, etc. What are we so scared of, that we feel this need to define and label everything and everyone?   Take for instance, this goth/punk issue that I found myself in the middle of. Now, I wear almost all black, all the time. I don't have anything against color, I just don't want people staring at me. It's kind of funny if you think about it; I don't care if people stare at me because I have a ring through my lip, or tats on my back, but I feel really uncomfortable when people stare at me when I have on, say a bright pink shirt. Or a red one. An orange, or  (gag)  yellow one. I just can't handle it. I feel  good  in black. Sexy. Confident. Why change my attire just because everyone seems to think I'm goth? Ok, so I have black hair and my finger nails are painted black too. I'm sure that doesn't help. And the truth of the matter is, I am somewhat goth. But more importantly, I'm  all  punk. Do I need have safety pins through all my clothes to stress this point? A mohawk?   I'm a punk rock girl, through and through, so I can't help it that I get bothered when called a goth. Wait. Let me correct myself. I don't get so much bothered, as annoyed. If I'm going to be labeled, LABEL ME CORRECTLY DAMN IT!  I could say more, but I don't have time. Let these half-baked, unsupported remarks carry the conversation a few more versts. It's early and I'm just sort of making this up as I go, anyway.  So please, by all means elaborate.
