My parents would totally take us, they wanna see it too. *grin* My parents are too cool.  If you guys haven't seen the trailer yet, you can find it on Michael Moore's website. At one point he tries to get Congress blokes to send their children to Iraq to fight. I don't know what the answers are going to be, but they will be funny. Or at least make us angry. Or both.  Bowling for Columbine is like that too. Mike and two survivors of the Columbine shootings went to K-mart and single-handedly stopped them selling ammunition. It was great. I'm not sure I've seen the whole thing, and I'm not sure I could handle it. Not anymore.  Blerg. Now I'm depressed. Just promise you'll see F 9-11, okay guys?  It will rock.
