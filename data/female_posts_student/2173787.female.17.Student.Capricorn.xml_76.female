I look at my sitemeter and see that 11 people have read my blog so far today and that that is the smallest number of people for the week (wow...11 people reading my blog in one day?) and I can probably guess who a few of them are but the rest....It makes it hard to say anything substantial.  But I will say this, people are really good at forcing me to be honest to myself.  I've been in denial over the meaning of this mood of mine for weeks and one short conversation forced me to face reality.  I know what this mood is, and I'm sure most people close to me could guess it.  not knowing what else to say without feeling pathetic I'll stop and of you are left wondering maybe (probably) at some point I'll enlighten you if you ask.
