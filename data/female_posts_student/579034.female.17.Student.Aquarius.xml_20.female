And no I didn't figure that out all on my own its on the board in Mr. Boardman's room so HA! Yea, anyway... hillight of my day: Deb wrote me my first note of junior year! lol Forget hilight of the day thats the hilight of the week! Yea, so I'm gonna be a dedicated trackie (or a loser) and stay home tonight. I'll probably just relax and watch "The Patriot" (calm down Mariana). I been tellin myself to watch it all week cause we are learning about the American Rev. and I been craving to see it and I guess I'll have the time to do that tonight. Yea... so... Strawberry Kiwi Gatorade is good. Just thoght I'd share. Okay, I'm out. much love xOxOxOxOx
