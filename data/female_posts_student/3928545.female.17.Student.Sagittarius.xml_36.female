Those two arn't really related, I don't think. Just making a point. So I try starting my car a couple more times, probably 5 or 6, and when it still doesn't start. That's when I pop the hood. I know nothing about cars. At all. Yet, I still open the hood and look under it, thinking, some way, somehow, something about cars will come to me and I'll be able to magically fix it somehow.   urlLink
