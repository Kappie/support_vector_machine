For I've never known sweet a love can be, Come in my dreams  love me again, For days to come no more, Rescue me from torture of absence, Relieve me with your loving presence, Embrace this flower, never let it wither, Join me in heavens, flowers in summer, My memories you love,  the love that I give..
