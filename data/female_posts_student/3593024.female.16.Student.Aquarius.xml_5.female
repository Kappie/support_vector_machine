So I ended up only running about 3/4 of a mile and I cannot feel my legs I feel like a noodle. I can't believe school starts in just a couple of weeks. So ppl say you should always tell ppl how you feel, you will feel better about it. So I did and nothing has changed nothing has happened. I think no one knows for sure. And I wish that ppl would just tell you the truth all the time well at least most of the time like when you really need it like whether or not everyone in the whole world thinks your ex-boyfriend is gay, well thank god that is over with. You only live once and I guess I can say I dated a fag, who doesnt realize he is a fag yet or he knows but doesnt want anyone else to know well I hope comes out soon......lol b/c that will be hilarous. Well that is all for now and I guess I will write in here whenever I get bored again....lol   Love always,   Jess
