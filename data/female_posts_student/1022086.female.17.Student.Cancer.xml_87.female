Today, I went to my locker and put all my books in it, consequently realizing that I'm not going to need a backpack anymore for the rest of the schoolyear (all 6 days of it)... That's never happened to me before.   Mrs. Landreth stopped me as I was approaching the lunch room, likely because I must have had a most stupid expression of disbelief on my face, and, when I explained my dilemma to her, she laughed and said I should keep bringing my backpack anyway... Hmmm... nah, let's not do that.   All that there is essentially left to do is to take a US History 9 weeks exam and a Crackulus one.  I slept so much today. I literally arrived home, ate because I was hungry, and went to bed and didn't get up until 9. I'm going to be going back to bed in about 2-3 hours. It's beautiful. I feel like such a bum and I should have been cleaning the jungle (my room currently), but I feel so rested!  I can't believe the year's practically over. I'm excited about it, but I'm also really going to miss people. Props to me for minimal tears at the choir concert, though! (Kim, DOON'T LEEEEEEEEEEAAAAVE MEEEEEEEEEEE!!! *sob sob sob*) Well, at least now that I won't have anyone to complain to about Chemistry anymore, I won't really have Chemistry to complain about anymore, either.    I feel like I've learned a lot this year, and I feel as though I've grown and matured much along with other folks. All the same, at this point, I also feel like I've learned to be more immature, and I don't know how I feel about that. A lot of good things happened, but a lot of bad things happened, too. I guess you could say that this year was just... there. A year of hard work and butt-busting, a year of minimal mother-fighting (although not totally nonexistant mother-fighting), a year of depressing good music, a year of dancing (or, rather, attempts to dancing), a year of sorrow, a year of cracking up into laughter, a year of coffee, a year of getting pissed off at losing SC II battles but rejoicing at Tekken-Tag butt-kickin', a year of not keeping in touch with people I love even if I saw them every day, a year of learning to be open-minded and accepting... a year of feeling apart from God...    An exhausting year, indeed. I shed no tears as I salute it. Well, maybe a few, but anything for Kim, even if it's undesired public speaking... =-)   Of course,    "Seasons of Love" from Rent   Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear FIve hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes How do you measurea year? In daylights, in sunsets, In midnights,  in cups of coffee , In inches, in miles, In laughter, in strife, In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes How do you measure a year in the life?  How about love?  Measure in love Seasons of love  Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes Five hundred twenty-five thousand journeys to plan Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes How do you measure the life of a woman or a man?  In truths that she learned Or in times that he cried In bridges he burned Or the way that she died  It's time now to sing out though the story never ends Let's celebrate, remember a year in the life of friends  Remember the love  Measure in love  Measure, measure your life in love  Seasons of love Seasons of love
