Gosh But anyway, i'm happy that I got my webbie *Beams* My mum just dyed my hair..now waiting for it to dry up. just finished the marathon of school work and i slept the day away..but as usual, the package comes with incessant chanting from my mum. sighz, been clubbing too often after I broke up. Men's an ass. I feel even worse than an ass for letting these asses degrade and deteriorate my life.  Someone pls severe the nerves from my thalamus and hypothalamus! Then i no nid to feel this uncontrollable spiral. DAMN. But oh well, i'm going to beautify myself, even as broke as I am. And i'm going to try and seek God's solace again.
