U see, i am very bored and noticed that i havent posted a B-LOG (haha, gets me everytime) in a very long time, at least 3 days! So here i am. But i do have good news! i had a little scare a few days ago over osap, it said i was only getting $5000 even though i was quoted 9, but thats all better now! which is good cuz i was totally freaking out about it cuz it would have drained all my savings for the first year! Um, what else is there...Oh! my dad STILL hasnt started my computer! grrr! yeah, but other then that, there isnt so much going on in the highly entertaining life that is mine (oh, i am a funny one aren't i?! lol) but that is all, if i forget anything you know i;ll be back ;)
