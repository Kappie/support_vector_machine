But it sucked cuz I didn*t get to see the last part of the movie cuz I feel asleep. I couldn*t take it anymore! I was so sleepy! Well hmm... I was supposed to go to a gig today but the band (Drunk Skunks) and I don*t have a ride... sigh... I haven*t gone to a gig in like 2 weeks. I*m so bored off my mind staying home! I need live music! I need to skank with the homies! I need to go all out in the pit!!! Ahhhhh!!! This is so boring... Wow... well right now I*m listening to some Tiger Army and I tried to learn "True Romance" on the guitar and it*s kinda hard... Asshhh... I like a challenge anyways but I*ll try to learn it later. Besides that, I drew this really bad (good) picture!   There*s the link! Go check it out!!! Man... I*m leaving for Europe this Friday. My friends and I are going to have a kick back in Thursday probly. Mehh... So what*s new? Nothing with me. I*m talking to Tony right now... The best trumpet player in the world!!! Drunk Skunks beyyyyybe! Sigh... I*m so bored and tired. I wanna go out today but I have no one to go out with... Nana and Palm Tree are going to be playing at a gig today and Tony is in trouble and ehh... Sigh... What to do...
