But i just told her to go away cause i was tired bt thn i found out we were ;leaving in 15 mins so i had 2 rush and get ready! only got 2 c half of the tweenies this morning!!      so we went to get somegeneral suplies for the family who had taken my brother on holiday with them ! But we were only away for a little while cause i had to be at hannahs at 12.oo ands it was already 12.15 !      So i arrived at hannahs at 12:39 just a wee bit late! hehe.     We did the usual :                                  Trampoline                                  Msn                                   Music                                                 Spill watermelon all over hannahs floor and she gets shouted at !                                                 (*opps sorry jill! )                                              Shower         So then we went round to Hannah Stothers house to watch disney movies !       There was 4 of us Me and 3 hannahs lol! Stothers Mckimm and Preece lol!      We decided to watch jungle book . So Hannah Mckimm tried to put it on and it wouldn't rewind ! So we thought it was broken and she had been trying to fix it for ages and it turned out it had already been at the start lol!!! So it started  and then we realised it was the film n not the cartoon version lol! So we watched Pocohontis instead ! (i have no idea how 2 spell it lol! ) .      So it was really good and we eat doritos ,sensations and banana and toffe popcorn ! It was great! Laura g and Nicky missed out!! lol! Half way  through the movie i noticed a light go on in the house next door and a very attractive guy looking out the window ! He just stood there! I thought he was praying or something ! So i said to Hannah Stothers and she said o no thats the bathroom and that would be him peeing lol! !  So we all laughed for ages and then i asked his name ! ( which i cant state as he mite b embarased if anyone new lol!) bt i found out I know him! Isnt that hilarious!!       So i got home from Hannahs house and my brother was home!! It was soo exciting!I couldnt believe it! I hadn't seen him in 3 weeks in spain! It was really good to see him home again! He was looking lovely his hair looked really blonde and his tan was gorgeous!       So i talked to him for a while and then he gave me a preaasant ! he said he didnt know what to get me! So i opened it and it was Ushers album Confessions ! its really really good!!       So thats what i did today lol! not very exciting !
