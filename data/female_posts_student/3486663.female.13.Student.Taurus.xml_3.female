I would rather give it a cooler sounding name. Like....Amanstyrelcodaron? Ya I'm good at making up names and stuff. anyway...I was just reading  urlLink Joe's  blog, and I suddenly realised I have a very wierd laugh. Not at all ladylike. Not that I'm very ladylike in the first place, but you know. Its all wierd. All...snorty and stuff. I don't laugh like that with my friends. Only at stuff I read on the net in blogs. I was laughing at someone else's blog too. I forgot who. But it was the same laugh--all wierd and high-pitched and snorting ike a pig. When I read anything else on the net (eg. webcomics) even if they're funny as I still don't alugh that wierd. Okay, so I have a wierd laugh normally too. But its nowhere near as close to that. I would give you a nice recording of it but my laptop's sound recorder doesn't work. :) Be thankful.  PS. I don't care if this is my third post. I don't feel like editing them so that they're all in one nice big post. Okay? Good. Now shut up.
