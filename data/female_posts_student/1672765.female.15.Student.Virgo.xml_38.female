Let's think of things one could do to honor The Adam:     Go pirate for the day  Listen to Tiger Army's early stuff  Drink Red Bull  Kill Aaron Carter for having the same initials  Be fascinating  Play drums  Laugh amazingly     That's all I could come up with at the spur of the moment.   You all do know who Adam Carson is, right? Drummer of AFI. The band.
