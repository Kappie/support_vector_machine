The words I worship most dissolve into love.  *  That I love you means recognized impermanence That I let you, fellow raptor, tear at me with want and loathing.  I planted sunflowers by the gate but left before the flower. Did I not cleave earth for seeds to flourish?  When is it enough? That my head will crumble next to yours under the heft of stones? â€¦to become the dust of pigeon wings  I cannot promise what words will do to me.  Love and love Church and church  The death parting.     (I'm looking for a title and comments)
