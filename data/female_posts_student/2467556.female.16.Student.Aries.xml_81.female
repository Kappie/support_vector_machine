Thank goodness we won't be staying in Williamsburg for much longer, i don't know if i can take much more of that.  My mom wants to tour Thomas Jefferson's house on friday on our way back to williamsburg....i don't know if i can tour one more house and listen to them ramble about the wallpaper.  Hopefully she'll be too tired and abandon the idea.  I think tomorrow we're visiting the Smithsonian museum or whatever.  That'll be cool.    Sports Update: OMG so pissed off! So the stars are leading for most of the game and we get to the last 5 mins 3-0 and we're about to shut them out......and then SJ scores 3 goals and we tie in OT.  ARGH!!!!  Mo was better so i know Britt was happy, i'm glad his bruise on his foot healed up quick.  I can't believe we tied!!!  Argh!  So now we're 3 pts behind SJ.  Coppell plays Marcus 8pm in Valley Ranch this thursday!!!  See you guys!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
