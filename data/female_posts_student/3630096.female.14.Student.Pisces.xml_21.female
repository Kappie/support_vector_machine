I'm anticipating the cookie baking class today very well and thus was in a cheery mood. However, it ruined my day when I was called... I thought she was calling szehui but no, it's me. I went up, wondering what's going on to have my form teacher to call me. But no. Alas. From happy immediately turned to troubled, frustrated and fed up. Why!? It's that stupid st john thingy again! Why why why!? I HAD NOT put THAT as a choice in my cca form! And my name was right in the band list...why why why.............so troubled. I plead Miss Yani to let me off. It had been going on, since last year until now, this cca had been haunting me like a ghost. I didn't mean any offence or anything! Why can't they just let me off!? I'm in band! NOT ST JOHN!!! why why why? It's such a simple order, isn't it? Teachers had been calling me but I really really didn't put my name in...I don't even know why I am there...why............tell me why. Why can't I be just like other people? Why get me into more and more trouble... why am I the outcast... Other people, so happy, so perfect but me........is never normal. I can't even pass my napha test...not even have a trustworthy friend or companion......................... I dunno what to do anymore. ___________________________________________________ It started off with a fine day....but end off with a moody day....I really don't feel like typing anymore................I really don't know what to do...........nor do I know why I am even borned in this cruel world....
