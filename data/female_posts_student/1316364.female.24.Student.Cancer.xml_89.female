I did wind up emailing that guy mapping out that my sole intention of letting him call me was purely for friendly conversation. I didn’t appreciate him coming on as strong as he did and I guess that makes me naive but this time away from Jesse has left me lonely and unsatisfied with general conversation with my peers so I have been looking for friendly people to talk to online. I never intend on attracting these people and I do always let them know that I am happily married. I just don’t understand why they feel like the internet is just one huge dating game when I know there are kind and decent people out there like me who just want someone to talk too.   Despiration drive people to do some stupid things.  In other news, I received a package from Jesse a few days back. He sent me this beautiful blanket that was on his bed in Kuwait, smelled a little like him. The blanket had a beautiful wolf on it and I plan on sleeping with that blanket every night until he comes back. He also sent me an audiotape letter. Although it was short, it was still good to hear his voice. On his letter he mentioned that he had gained some weight. Mind you all that know Jesse know that he is a bean poll, so imagine my surprise when I heard this. He is still tiny to me, but he gained enough weight to move up one size and I figure that means there is more of him for me to love when he comes home. I did wind up talking to him a few days back but it was only for a half an hour, long enough for me to find out that they changed his work schedule again. Ever since that night I haven’t been able to connect with him online. I do know that he does go online and does read my blog to see what’s happening with me, but I do miss our online chats during the day, because it always seemed to help pass the time away. I know that our little chats always improved our workdays.   I miss him a lot.
