Business and Economics, um, pretty much the same as before only more detailed. Geography, Mrs Green is so friendly, but doesn't shut up, but friendly. ICT, well what not to say? BARRY! Hehe. Media Studies, looks great fun, something I really want to do. Diary is as follows... working tomorrow. Saturday, Bon Jovi! Sunday, sorting out the house for next weekend (mothers party!). Monday, Thorpe Park! Tuesday and the rest of the summer, eat, sleep, and repeat. 1 day, 20 hours, 39 minutes, and 26 seconds to go! BOOOOOOOOON JOOOOOOOOOOVI! Beep. Hehe.
