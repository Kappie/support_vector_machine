Without love, or without feeling love, peoples' lives have no meaning. When nobody cares about you, and especially if you don't care about anything - you have a sad, solitary  existance . There's very rarely a case where someone is this way - because it means they have reason to love themself. If you saw a starving child as you passed by on the street, and their eyes didn't haunt you, I think you'd have a hard time finding something respectable in yourself. Then there are the zealots who care about a  cause . I've never felt this kind of attatchment to anything, but it's kind of like a replacement love. Everyone needs something to obsess over, think about when they're lying in bed awake.
