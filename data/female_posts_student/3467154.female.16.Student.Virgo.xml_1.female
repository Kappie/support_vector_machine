It was good, kinda freaky though in a sense that if we do destroy our environment, it could affect us in a way that we can't explain in words. In some cases, we may freeze to death. The weather can just kill us.  So the next time you use styrofoam, don't think "Oh, just one. It won't hurt." The truth is, I believe it can and it will. I love our earth, and we must take care of it. I sure wouldn't want to move to Mars or Venus soon. We are the human beings put on this earth-let us take care of it-all of us, both young and old. The movie, I guess, should convict a lot of people for the actions they may have done in the past, or even now. By the way-totally out of topic-I love Jake Gyllenhaal!   Another part of this not so stressful day-(I am on the go for a stress-free life now that school's over)-Story of: Frankie and Jen  So today Frankie and Jen chilled in the mall..."Hmmm...is there a point to all of this (LOL, inside joke?)," says Jen. "Ummm..." Frankie remarks "I dunno." A really weird conversation is sprung up then between two look-alike (maybe relkatives) people close to us-(listen if you care observe if you don't) Lady 1: So ur son is going to university in England? Lady 2: Yes, in Worcester. He got a full scholarship... Lady 1: I'm happy...he's such a smart boy. Lady1: Yes-but I feel like he's not smart enough. (By this time, Jen is laughing) Lady 2: How can you say that? Lady 1: Because...I feel it. He's a straight-A student, but slacks of and drinks a lot, parties till midnight. I hardly know how he does it... (Ok, Jen stops laughing) As if the conversation wasn't weird enough...Kris, Miko, and Leilana came...nope, just kdding it wasn't weird they just LOOKED weird cuz they had their hair dyed in pink-all three of them. They looked like they could be back up singers for Gwen Stefani.  So..think about it-absorb it LOL just kidding but odd? Take it or leave it.  Peace  And love mother earth.
