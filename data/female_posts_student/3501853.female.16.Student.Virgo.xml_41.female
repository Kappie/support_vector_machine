I'm just really confused and it doesn't help to know he hates me and we dont talk yet Tim misses him so much. Okay but whatever I'm trying really hard to not whine anymore and bring others down or me down so I'm gonna just stop that thing right there. Cuz besides the last part of the night..my day was good good. I woke up kinda early to watch Dawson's Creek as usual but they didn't show it today, made me upset (lol) but whatever I lived. Since it wasn't home I asked my mom to take me to RecPlexx so I could work out but I guess they closed at noon cuz it was still a holiday so I'm just hopefully going to go tomorrow after work. My mom left for Bally's to work out her skinny ass (lol) so I just laid down for a bit till Mik called and came over. We watched TV for a bit then I had to get ready so we just hung out in my room. I'm such a ditz but it's okay she puts up with it. My mom came over and Tim did after awhile and we all went to Woodfield..family shopping day lol. I got 2 shirts and sunglasses but I had to pay for them cuz my mom paid for everything from Cali so now I'm broke but w.e it's all good. We went to eat at Stir Crazy too, I remembered our date there but I pushed back the tears. I got home and went to Mik's then I called Melissa and we decided to go to her house for a bonfire. My mom was a lil grumpy but it's all good, she was just p.m.s.y I still love her so Mik and I went to Melissa's. It was funny watching her start the fire, on a side note, her dog grew up a lot. At like 9:30 I took Mik home but since she's my neighbor I dropped her off on the other side of the dead end so my mom wouldnt know that I wasted all that gas, haha I felt lame as fuck (lol) but it was kool. After that, Melissa and I went to Burger King and went back to her house to catch up on things, oh man funny ass stories I love that girl. Her mom's so nice and funny too. I went home around 10:30 cuz my mom was being weird and I didn't wanna start a fight so I called it an early night. Took a shower, talked 2 Jon 4 a bit, talked 2 jamie r. too and szabo of course but mostly Melissa and Kev...god, they're cracking me up tonight..they made it easier to hide the tears that I had 2 release 2 Kev but I"m okay now...k I'm gonna go now and finish up our convos then go to sleep and start paintinga nd who knows what 2morrow. I was supposed to watch a movie with Art tonight at his house but we never got to make plans and I didnt have enough time since my mom was being mean so I feel mean about that but ya need sleep..write 2morrow, bye bye..._Camille_
