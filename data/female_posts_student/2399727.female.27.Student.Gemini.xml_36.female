Here's a joke to tide you over while I recover.  Here's a goodie I shared with my priest-friend before he died last month:   The new priest is nervous about hearing confessions, so he asks the older priest to sit in on his sessions. The new priest hears a couple confessions, then the old priest asks him to step out of the confessional for a few suggestions.   The old priest suggests, "Cross your arms over your chest, and rub your chin with one hand." The new priest tries this.   The old priest suggests, "Try saying things like, 'I see, yes, go on,' and 'I understand. How did you feel about that?'" The new priest says those things.   The old priest says, "Now, don't you think that's a little better than slapping your knee and saying 'You're pulling my leg, right?!? What happened next?'"  More to come...
