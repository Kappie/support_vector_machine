It's tradition to stay up all night and go out to the beach for the sunrise, after which most people went to sleep.   Some friends and I decided we'd help ourselves out with staying up. The chill guy here who smoked me out (his name is Matt too, or "Haz-Matt" [hazardous materials] as he is called here)is friends with this girl in the program (as am I, but he's better friends with her) who it turns out is on Aderoll for ADD. She was kind enough to hook us up, and it was a pretty amazing evening. We first stopped at Starbucks around 10 last night to get some warm-up caffeine, then we moved to Kafein, the local coffee shop, for the "spiked, ass-kicking caffeine" stuff. We got back to the dorms by 11:30 and took the Aderoll, then we signed t-shirts and notebooks for an hour or so. I signed on girls' boobs (well, the shirt covering them, but they were wearing them as I signed); twas much fun. Haha, I signed this one republican girl's right breast with "Megan- I'm starting over here because you're a republican." Then I drew an arrow to her left breast and finished "I'm not. Much love, 'Hot-Matt' (my nickname)."   I danced around like crazy for a little while, and got this great southern girl named Ashley Allen to dance with me on a table in the Great Room. Everyone kept asking how I had so much energy...   We moved outside to the beach around 3. A few of us stripped to our boxers or underwear and bras and ran into the freezing Lake Michigan water. We messed around for a while, and it felt great. We didn't bring towels, so we had to stand around on thebeach cold and soaking wet. My boxers fell a bit and some people saw my ass, so I kind of started showing it off (this sounds absolutely  wonderful  in retrospect...must've been the speed) and got compliments and squeezes. After a bit, most of the chill kids had moved outside, and we started singing Disney songs, 80s-pop-songs, and musicals. It was really, really fantastic standing there in my boxers and singing Mulan's "Make a Man."   After I was pretty dry, I put my clothes back on and moved inside. We hung around the Great Room for a bit, then I found the same Aderoll friends again (Haz-Matt, Heather [great name], and Liz) and we planned our pot-smoking endeavors. We agreed to meet at 4:45 AM, and I went and hung out with some OMs and Kirsten told me about her hooking up with Elia (an instructor). Great details, much fun. I left to go smoke, but by then it was raining, and most of us waited in the suite on my floor until the sun started to rise. We reasoned we were too exhausted to smoke (only Haz-Matt and I were on the Aderoll).   We made our way outside and the weather was rainy (as it still is) for the first time in a few days. We couldn't actually see the sun rise, and I was feeling a bit more inhibited than I had felt several hours ago, so there wasn't anymore swimming. We moved back inside at 6:00 AM to see off Schmidy (David Schmitt), an endearing individual who is unlike anybody I've ever met. We reluctantly admitted that Cherubs was over, now that Schmidy had left. Most people trudged up to their rooms to sleep. My roomate slept and I packed while watching "Saved By the Bell" (god bless early morning WB). I went down to the Great Room to get my sandals and found that some friends were going to breakfast at Clarke's, this amazing cafe nearby, so at 7:00 AM we left.   I had lots more coffee and some strawberries and waffles. I've got about 60 mg of Aderoll in my system, and I've still got a 15 mg pill left for when this day gets a bit harder. Right now, I feel really great. We had deep conversations at breakfast (at least I thought so) but my friends retreated to do their own packing. So now I'm sitting here watching Dawson's Creek reruns on the WB. All packed, minus my trusty laptop. It's so sad.   This was an amazing experience. Yesterday we got this detailed booklet about the history of this program, including pictures of 1930s Cherubs. The history of this place and prestige of the alumni continues to amaze me. I am constantly humbled by those around me, and equally exhilarated by their passion for journalism. It's surreal to look around here, where I've spent the last five weeks, and say goodbye to it all. It's a gloomy day, and appropriately so.   I'll be doing college visits with my dad for the next week. I'll probably check my e-mail and have more time to call, so perhaps we can exchange some words in the coming week. I miss you guys so much, and when I'm ultimately done with my summer adventures, I look forward to returning to a place I call home.   Much love, "Hot-Matt."
