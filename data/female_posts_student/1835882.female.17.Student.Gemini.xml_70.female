For the most part its kind of easy w/ the cash register but just dont ask me to make it special, start over, take something away, add something, or move fast. i can do everything else just not those mentioned above. i met some really cool people but see i met them but i cant remember their names....this one guy he was pretty cool, he likes sprint car racing too, and he's even been to slideways and said its awesome and he said he's also going to knoxville this weekend. then there was this one girl she was friendly and really cool...she looks really familiar but i cant remember her name...but she's really cool. ok so anyway when i was finally done on the puter i had about an hour to start actually interacting w/ customers. this gal sara who is much older than me she was helping me...all i had to do was tell the people how much it was then they give me the money then i touch the screen w/ the amount they gave me and press another button the drawer open i give back the dollars and change thingy give me the exact amount. i suppose if you are anybody but me you could handle this simple task. ok so i did ok but i made some little errors and then some stupid errors and then some just plain duh errors. sara was really nice about when i goofed up. geez, it was so obvious it was my first day. i do look forward to tomorrow i just hope they let me do what i did today again w/ sara so i can get the hang of it.  there is one small problem...change...pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters. i've never handled money before and when they give me change i freak b/c i dont know if its the exact amount or what so then you have me here and im trying to count it and they're waiting for there change if there was any and ugh, so sara told me what i might want to do is "practice". which its not stupid its a good idea that im going to do tonite.   so ima gonna go and uh, eat lunch b/c i sort of skipped that meal b/c of the puter.
