You see, I took an undergraduate honors course over two semesters; the spring 2003, and this past fall.  The grade was supposed to be carried over to both semesters, with an incomplete for the spring that was supposed to be changed by this past thursday.  The problem was that my professor turned in a grade for this semester, but forgot to turn in the grade for last semester.  As a result, that incomplete turned into an F.  I checked my grades on Thursday night, and was quite hysterical for at least 20 minutes.  For obvious reasons, I didn't get much sleep that night.  I called the registrar, Liberal Arts, and Latin American Studies at 8:00am, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.  Apparently my prof had indeed forgotten to turn in the grade, and he alone would have to fill out a grade change form.  Of course nobody knew where he was, myself inluded.  Luckily, Anne Dibble over at Latin American Studies called the prof at home and had him physically come up to campus to fill out the form.  I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I re-checked my grades Friday night, and discovered that everything had gone through.  So.  It's all done now--everything.  I can officially say that there's a green light to graduate.  And I'll be looking for that diploma in the mail.  Today I saw Return of the King for the second time.  Still just as good the second time, but I think I'll wait awhile before I see it again--it's very emotional and almost too much to handle.  It's always nice, though, to catch the little things that you may have missed before, or to re-examine certain very powerful moments in the film.  Did anyone else get chills down their spine during the scene at the Black Gate when Aragorn and crew are standing there facing the last group of 10,000 orcs, with Sauron's Eye staring at them?  I imagine that it would be like staring the devil in the face.  Not exactly the most comforting prospect.  I'd have to say, though, that my favorite moment was when Eowyn killed the Witch King, threw off her helmet, and yelled, "I AM NO MAN!"  She rules.  If I have a daughter, I'm naming her Eowyn.  I need to go study for the GRE now.  Bleh.
