All I know is that  urlLink anthrotech  has been holding steady at $1,000 and it's P/E is 1.0.   Buy!  Buy!  Welcome to the world of   BlogShares, which has escaped my attention until just now.  BlogShares is    "a simulated, fantasy stock market for weblogs where players invest fictional money to buy stocks and bonds in an artificial economy where attention is the commodity and weblogs are the companies. ...blogs... are valued by their incoming links from other known blogs. In effect, links become the business deals in the simulation and players speculate on the fortunes of thousands of blogs by buying and selling shares. A whole host of options exist for advanced play including gifting shares, leveraged buy-outs, stock splits, additional share issues, market and player bonds."   Maybe I'll sign up in order to promote anthrotech. It's free, plus I automatically get stock in my own blog (which is nice, yet strangely disconcerting).  I just have two questions.  What constitutes insider trading?  And where is Elliot Spitzer?
