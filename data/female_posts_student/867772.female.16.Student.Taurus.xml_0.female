I've been watching too many movies involving death lately, because I seem to be stuck on it. I've been thinking about what really happens when we die. If you're religious, you have your beliefs, but how can you be sure? I know, I fucking know aleady, it's called faith. Even with faith, you can't be sure. It's comletely possible that when we do die, absolutely nothing happens. It's scary how we can be so uncertain about something so important. I guess we don't really realize how many things we dont know anything about. Of course we wouldn't think of them often, for reasons being....we don't know anything about them. I'm getting confusing now, even to myself. I'll stop.  I seem to have a talent for stating the obvious. See, I did it again!  I've gotten sidetracked now. The point is, when I die, or when the people I love die, I want everyone to know that I love them. Knowing me, the "people I love" include anything and everything then can breathe, blink, and/or hump something.   So, what a good idea it is to post this on my blog! The fact that I am the only person who reads it will help spread the word of love around pretty fast, don't you think? Me too.  Fuck it. I love you.
