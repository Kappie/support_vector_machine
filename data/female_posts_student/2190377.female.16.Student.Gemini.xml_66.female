I don't even know enough to know what to write about lol.  yesterday was my mommys birthday.  as well as screen on the green... err gym.  i had fun. now my quads hurt. next week = bone scan time. finals too? maybe. today sat 2. chem hw.. kinda.  no longer limping. or making any sense.  brother.. where is he? *worried*  friends... at this point, id rather say everyone than no one so thats how it'll be.
