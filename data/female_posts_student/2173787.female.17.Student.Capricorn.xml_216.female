Before I even stepped of the porch I could hear the soft rumble of thunder and see the sky come alive with bolts of electricity.  Once enveloped in the darkness I could hear the wind and feel it across my skin.  Combined with the electricity of the air I began to tingle all over, and for the first time in a long time the sense of loneliness faded.  I have no idea how long I stood there, eyes shut, just feeling the weather, feeling alive and connected.  I could hear the thunder, the wind, the frogs in the pond and the low hum of traffic.  I could feel the cool air brushing by, the vibrancy and current pulsing through it, the power it contained.  And with every bolt of lightning I could see the edges of the things around me, the trees, the houses, the clouds.  It was like a spark pulsed through me and took over for a moment. Just thinking about it brings back the feeling and returns those magic moments to my mind.  The storm brings me hope, it lets me know that there will be turbulence, will be a show of power, will be consequences, but it will pass through and be replaced by a clean new day, waiting to be explored.
