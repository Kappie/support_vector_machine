Col, u gotta make me feel interested in that G game first =P  these few days were so weird, esp. yesterday and today, i spent at least half of my time alone, yes,  alone , coz somehow my parents and my bro just got stuff to do and got out of home all at the same time, oh well...the worst thing is probably i dun think i spent that time in a right way, i just totally wasted it, eh......if i wanna waste my time, i dun have to do it in Hong Kong, this makes that waste of time an EVEN BIGGER waste --"" yer i would be happier if i wasted my time in the U.S., or instead, if i had time to waste in the U.S....  talking about that, did i mention that i  hate  that country? and my whole family hates it? and all of us wanna break the TV or curse Bush whenever the news talks about the U.S. policies? and my parents sent us there? kinda funny (and ironic, sadly)...okay, i know, not the time to talk about that anymore, everything is set...  umm, coming back to Hong Kong is not exactly ESCAPING, there's no way i can reli run away and relax...i always feel something heavy is on my shoulders and pressing on me (i bet u all that if my mom just stopped buzzing like she is now, that weight would be a bit lighter, ARGH!!), and this probably won't go away till i retire, this is life, i guess...=P  once again, nice to have this place, i actually have a way to say a lot of stuff that i dun wanna tell most people, probably except u guys? coz many others will only try to CORRECT me instead of listening and trying to understand, at least u guys won't reject what i say...  i am not feeling that well today, nah, i am not sick =P mentally, emotion swing probably? it's so sudden, and this happens more often now, strange...  better go now, tired, and my mom is asking, no, TELLING me to get downstairs, cya around
