It could all be so simple But you'd rather make it hard Lovin' you is like a battle And we both end up with scars Tell me who i have to be To get some reciprocity See no one loves you more than me And no one ever will  Is this just a silly game That forces you, to act this way Force you to scream my name Then pretend, that you can't stay Tell me who i have to be To get some reciprocity See no one loves you more than me And no one ever will  *Chorus* _________________________ No matter how i think we grow You always seem to let me know It ain't workin' (it ain't workin) And when i try, to walk away You'd hurt yourself to make me stay This is crazy (This is crazy) ____________________________  I keep letting you back in How can I, explain myself As painful as this thing has been I just can't be , with no one else See i know what, we've got to do You let go, and i'll let go too Cause no one's hurt me more than you And no one ever will  *repeat chorus*  there's more after this... but just a bunch of libs and shit.
