It's a HUMONGOUS black fluffy Newfoundland, like Beethoven (only solid black), but she's not wearing a collar. If anyone's seen this dog, her name is Ellie, and you should get her and call Animal Care and Control. It's very sad. See, yesterday, Cliff's friend took her to the beach while Cliff was at work and left the garage door open after he dropped Ellie off at home. My dad saw the door open at around 4:00 p, but by then Ellie was gone. So if anyone is in the Glen Park area or anywhere that surrounds it, keep you eyes peeled. She's not that hard to spot. Well, that's all the interesting stuff for now. Yay! It's Friday! Tomorrow I am going to Safari West in Santa Rosa overnight so don't expect anything for the next 2 days.
