It's funny how you'll read some entries (i.e. A's) and think it was totally harmless last summer but now it's a completely different issue. And seeing N's again. Sigh.  Listening to the old Coldplay CD too. What does this tell me?  I'm already mapping out the music I'll have in the car when I get my license. Ah.
