No one ever acts the way they really are,  Everyone always goes that little step to far,  Its hard to like somebody  that isn’t really real,  Especially when the outside,  Is the only part that apears.  The inner beauty is precious,  its what we thrive on,  Because no one really knows their friends,  when all the make-up’s gone.
