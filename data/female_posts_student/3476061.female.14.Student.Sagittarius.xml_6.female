(i wont use names to protect everybody) lol. so yeah and my friend was telling me how he liked me too. so i told him that i liked him then it turned out that he was just desperate and didnt really like me in the first place which kinda sucks...especially for someone who usually doesnt express her feelings for the dude she likes. i woke up this morning and my stomach was killing me. so im not doing anything today. ok im done now. that was a really really long thinggy   oh yeah and whoevers getting on my SN and adding a bunch of random ppl from dillard drive to my buddy list can u PLEASE stop it. thanks                alright peace.
