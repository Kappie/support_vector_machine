It sucks, and I think I give up. no one is givng me reason to stick around. and it kinda hurts.  A lot.         at least i can say i made the effort one more time. but having it thrown in my face(again) this way is just too much for me to bear.     i had hoped things would be different.         Feeling: grossed out. Listening to: my fan.
