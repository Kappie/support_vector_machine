At first I was a bit confused as to why this was happening, but I have deduced that the annoying little boogers discovered my screen name on my cousin's subprofile. They apparently think I am their friend Jill. At first I was very polite in informing the kiddies of the mistaken identity situation, but now it has happened so much that I've become quite irritable.  Tonight, Bad Boi JaWad made contact with me on aim and queried "is dis Jill?" I responded: "no" Then Bad Grammar Jawad: dan who u b? I told the "bad boi" my name. And I will post the rest of our conversation. jawad is a pretty good sport. I actually ended up liking him a lot. blah blah blah...Anyway, here it is:  BadbOiJaWad10: dan who u b? me: are you from this country?
