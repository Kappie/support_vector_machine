Don't try to be a hero and use some cheap shampoo (FUCK YOU, SUNSILK) when you know it's going to fuck up your scalp and hair eventually.  Try to sleep at goddamn 2AM, Kim.  You are hopeless at configuring handphones. You are also hopeless, and I stress on hopeless, when it comes to ANYTHING technological and works with wires, cable and an electric socket.  You must floss daily. Don't let those braces be of any excuse. It's no excuse. And it doesn't matter if it takes x10 slower with all the maneuvers and what not, you just fucking do it.   Cut fingernails, please. You have started to hurt yourself unconsiously with them again. Your body does not want more self-multilaton.  Do NOT try to cut your fringe. You are growing it out.  You are not Bjoerk and you sure as hell don't look good nor cute in them.  Exercise 4x a week. How many times do I have to remind you!? And no, it doesn't mean if you exercise you can then binge on whatever food you like right after the workout! It does not work that way.  You are not invincible. Please remember that.  Fishes die. They eat the plants as well. Don't be upset. Just clean the damn tank and know that those deceased fishes are in a happier place.  Dogs are very cute. Cats too!  Please drink atleast 2 liters of water a day. Anything less than that will kill you!  And no, you cannot spend your money on CDs, Books or Smoothies. SAVE MONEY. And no using your ATM card.
