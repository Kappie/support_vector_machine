Last night was so fun, Felicia came over and we took millions of pictures then got online and started messing with Paul. It was so fun! Jeremy and I broke up last week. That's alright, it's for the best. PE was so much fun! We played softball but there's only 3 batters and when a batter gets out she goes to left feild and everyone rotates and the pitcher goes to bad It's great! I'm really hot right now. At lunch we got into a paint fight it was so much fun! It got all over my sweat shirt though. Felicia is comming over andwe're going swimming and getting ready for graduation, it should be a lot of fun =) Felza and I always amuze ourselves, It's great! Well we're watchign a movie so ciao!
