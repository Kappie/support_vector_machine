"... and it's hard at the end of the day, I need some distraction"      I went to Cranston today and looked into a couple of jobs.    A place I'm really looking into getting is at the bowling Alley. The lady that talked to me was really nice and I wouldn't mind working with her.   She gave me some advice on how to get the job or my best chances are.   So yeah, I'm looking into that.      Um... gosh, I don't really have a lot to say tonight, other than... I finished "The HotZone" it's a really good book,  well... I think it's really good for a non-fiction, which, I'm not usually a great fan of.       Well... that's all.
