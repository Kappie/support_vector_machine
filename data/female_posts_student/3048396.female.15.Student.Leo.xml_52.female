I wanted to go to Ross's game and my mom was actually looking forward to it to...but it was cancelled. :( *Sigh* Guess he has to wait longer for his b-day present. So now I probably wont get to see him play at all...that really makes me mad...Cuz Algona was the closest to us...even tho that was an hour and a half away...we were gonna go...but I guess thats how it goes.....  So Mom and I went over to Spencer to visit Grandpa and see how he was doing. He was sitting up and was started on clear liquids...so hes doin good. Hes not in any pain and hes not sick to his stomach so its all good. When he took a nap Mom and I took Grandma out for lunch so we went to the mall and I got a blizard. Even tho it was only like 69 today it still tasted great. I didn't attempt to throw this one at anyone...lol. Last one I had I kinda attempted to throw at Kait...but it just tipped over. LoL. So yeah...then we went back and stayed with Grandpa till about 5 and came home...and I really haven't done anything else. Our internet got fixed. A guy came and gave us a free upgrade and new modem so it works great now. Tho I think we might have a virus and thats slowin the whole comp down...But W/E. So all I did tonight was clean my room and get stuff in boxes...I took all my pictures off my wall :( Im sure gonna miss that. But it'll be nice to have my room painted all fun n stuff. We picked out the colors today and we're gonna go get them tomorrow. Yeah Im gonna count all the pictures that I had up there...I betcha I had atleast 200...But I'll count them later...I also went thru some old toys...brought back some good memories...there was some stuff that brought back bad memories too....those all went in the trash tho. So I guess not much else has gone on....  Tara    Current Music:  none  Current Mood:  tired  Quote of the Day:  "You taught me that socks don't need to be ironed." -How To Deal
