Crisp and clear could we see so many constellations, the moon so big and bright. I enjoy reaching beyond the stars, especially with the one's I love.  I did have an awesome occurrence today that I failed to share with you earlier. Wed. as I was thinning out my Mexican Sunflowers I observed a krysallis hanging from a tree that I attempt to uproot every year from my flower garden. Yet it always comes back. In all my many years out in nature I have never seen, up close, the krysallis of a catepillar's life cycle. Of course I've seen it in books and on television and studied about it in grade school, but never have I witnessed it until now. I have checked it everyday since I first found it and today it had been emerged from.  Why does that tree come back every year despite my uprooting? Was it meant to be there for this krysallis to form? Was it meant to show me that the catepillar and I are in the same stage in our life? That I was once a catepillar and as I found days before, have I been in my krysallis stage to emerge now as a beautiful butterfly? I think so.  With love,  BLG
