Luckily I brought it with me (so weird because I never bring ID with me...I'm 24 for crying out loud).  I chuckled and laughed at the bouncer telling him I was 24 and he didn't believe me.  So out came the good ol' Montana drivers license stating that I indeed was born in the late 70's.  Then he told me I looked like I was 18.  So funny!  I wouldn't have been so pleased but the drinking age is 18 here and I got carded.  Its like being 30 in the states and getting carded.  So that is the latest breakthrough in my life...I look 18!  (Addy that means I could pass as your LITTLE sister).  Tomorrow I am off to Dublin to play in a Basketball Tournament.  Wait...Stop laughing!  I'm serious.  Yes I know I should bring a video camera and tape the whole thing, because it will be well entertaining!  Then in a weeks time I am off to Belgium to visit EU parliament and NATO.  It should be a good time, being in Belgium with the Irish folk over St. Paddy's day...ahhh resting in the home of good Stella Artois with the Irish...life couldn't be any better!
