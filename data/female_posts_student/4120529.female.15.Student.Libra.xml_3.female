Atleast save on transport and furthermore she is still recovering frm the operation and can hardly walk.      2moro is finally the last day of prelim. Left maths paper 2 and geography elective. Damn I looked so lethargic. My lips are sooo dry and my stomach is empty. *growls*3 days of endless sleep and worries. It's really taken its toll on me. I could already see the dark circles. *boohoo* burning the midnight oil. I can't sudy in the afternoon, i prefer at night after my prayers. Funny ehks? That's me. Coffee again i guess.. I sound like a baby always whining.      Did Physics Paper 1  2 and FN... For physics the questions looks ancient to me. I tot it is suppose to be from N lvl TYS. I gotta know that those qns are frm O lvl TYS. wadda!! waste my time practice TYS. Hahaha.. nvm. Prelims are actually suppose to be very very very tough,but so far i could do all the papers except for english compo and ss paper. I screw up. and the fact that i'm better in english makes it even worse. Mr Zahed is gonna be sooo dispntd in me.This time round goodbye A2. Blardy! Thankfully it's not N lvls. I panicked coz I didn't really go thru F in detail. Luckily I could do the paper. Hopefully I can beat   Tony Seet   this time round. I need to get a distinction for FN. *cross-fingers*      I pity my bestie   Shasha  . She is so freaking stressed up right now. Yesterday she had maths tuition up to 10.30pm. By the time she go home she was too tired. She hardly touch her physics and FN. She's really pissed off and is not confident about passing both papers. Sha u can punyer. Don't worry ok. On top of that she has to study for her religious class exams.. plus geography and maths paper 2moro. Its only prelim k. Cheer up. I'm never felt so much pressure before. Pressure to do well,serves me right for going to the 1st class. Nvm .. I'll take on the challange.   I suddenly realised all my entries mostly about exams. Haiz. Btw for those of u who have been trying to contact me thru my cellphone 948221**.. Sorry yah I didn't switch ON for 3 days. My apologies.      Yesterday   Mr Zahed   inform all the 4NA'S that we are suppose to attent school after prelims, during sept holidays and after Nlevels to continue sec 5 syllabus. Mati siot gitu. No rest day uh? He added    ''unless u all are confirm u are going to ITE.. than by all means absent urself..attendance will be taken and do not start finding work yet!''.     Actually I've already plan  to get a part time job.. but heck care I'm still gonna work. It's not that I don't care about my studies but I need a break. Sec 5 next year what.. just strt nex yr la. Start a fresh...    I'm goin for facial and SPA this weekend.. anyone wanna join.. ekekeS`.. Pamper myself.
