I woke up at 8:42, early for my lazy ass, and turned on my computer. Last night we had a severe thunderstorm and thus I was not able to check my e-mail or anything. Going through my e-mail I see I have tons of reviews for my lemons (Fanfics that have descriptive sex scenes). I shift through, find many compliments, one flame and one that pissed me off even more than the flame. (Although the flame tickled my funnybone more than pissed me off) It was saying that it didn't belong on the site because it was NC-17. On Anime Spiral, you rate lemons like that as R, so I didn't know. Quickly, I went to Fanfiction.net to find that they had disabled my account. Prior to the thunderstorm I had shifted though this one man's profile and saw that some of his stories got pulled for inappropiate content, but they go and disable my  entire  account for inappropiate content! Prior to that I also discovered that this man paid for support services, I did not. Don't you find it funyy that girl just writing fanfics and doesn't pay the damn site gets disabled for inappropiate content, yet this man who pays them does not and only his stories are pulled? Some things just royally piss me off!!!>.  For those of you who don't know if I put * after a smiley it is my vein pop. Anyways, so I just send them an e-mail about it and continue on with my day. I get another chapter up for Love Never Dies and eat some lunch. I get one person still asking me to continue that, another who just simply had their eye twitch-.-; Then I managed to do something I thought impossible (then again she is one of my more frequent readers) I managed to make a "Kikyou-hater" believe that Kikyou was sweet in my lemon. The world is either ending or I am just getting better. My money is on the world is ending, though some would argue that. I added yet another chapter to the still growing and vastly popular, Public School. I don't know what it is about that story, but people just love it. The drama in it is just an exaggeration of teen life, maybe that's why some can relate and like it. It has been proclaimed the best multiple times and I have people who check it hourly to see if their is an update o.O Flattering really, but kinda scary. I just have to keep writing with the flow. I still have two characters to introduce and must get my butt in gear about it. Though they will be making their appearences quite soon, while poor Inu-Yasha will be tormented by Kiba aka Buddha Jr. Buddha is my loveable, yet annoying puppy. Poor Inu-Yasha, I can sympathize with him. Anyways, after I added that chapter I decided to be lazy and do absolutely nothing. Then I went for a walk. So much for doing nothing, eh?  After my walk I came back to reviews and wrote more. Then added that, ate supper, and went on, bored. Finally I added yet another chapter and decided to go for a walk, but ran into the problem of 6 little kids who all adore me and do sometimes call me by the name Kikyou. They scare me...so much that I had to sneak out the backdoor to get in and out unnoticed. Being so bored, I had an hour to burn before the highlight of my day/night. I stupidly went outside. They demanded for my headsets and heard the Japanese, instantly becoming enchanted by it while childishly fighting over the headsets. Not wanting to break them more than they already were, I brought out my boombox and played the music, they boogied like it was 1999.  Then I have a long 1 hr.  50 min. conversation with my boyfriend and thus concluded my day on a good note. Other than that, nothing has happened. I will be writing a new chapter to The Taiji-Ya Village and then Love Never dies and then Public School and then The Taiji-Ya Village and then...you get the point. So thus concludes my long-ass day, wasn't it just great? Just remember, I'm not a whiner, I just complain a lot ~_^
