Because I have a photographic memory. I can walk into a store and just be walking around, not looking for anything in particular, and a week later my mother can ask me how much milk is at the store and I know how much it is. I read an obscene amount (amassing huge collections of random facts that dazzle people who will listen) and I use my large vocabulary when talking. Yea, I'm arrogant, and I know it. I'm fucking narcissistic and I know that, too. I don't really give a shit.      It's just when my family degrades me and says things like "go stand in your closet and stay there" or "who cares, you live in fantasy land all the time anyway" that upset me. I don't understand it at all. I'm so cynical of the world, the only way I can survive is to read and  live in my fantasy world . The real world disgusts me so much that if I didn't have my own domain (my room, where I read and write and  live ) I would have gone through with the suicide attempts a long time ago. Like in the fifth grade when I first tried and almost succeeded to OD on random pills.      They disgust me so much. They gang up on me and I don't have a clue why. What the fuck, you would think they would be used to my ugliness and conceitedness. It especially upsets me when my stepfather makes jeering comments or sounds ("oink oink") when I'm looking for something to eat or am doing  nothing . Except usually when I'm out of my room someone will usually tell me to go back to my cave.       Oh, I have gone into this too long. I really hate to post depressed writing in here. They were just doing it all again and I am upset. I just went there to talk and play with my cat, but no. It turns into a ganging up on me once again, with my brother making lewd comments and doing imitations of me, and my stepfather doing much of the aforementioned.      But why I really wanted to post, before I got caught up in all that, is that I've implimented something new into my blog. On the sidebar I'm adding something. By January 1st, 2005, I want to have jogged 250 miles. Yes. There are 137 days remaining this year, and that averages 1.83 miles per day. Not a lot for a person in shape, which is why after January 1st I want to start running more. The 250 miles is just to get me in shape and geared for the Big Year. The Year of Graduation and All. Sooo...I'm making an image I'll update every Sunday night or so, with numbers of miles to run left, along with miles ran so far and days left to achieve this.      So thanks all, for being supportive of me. I hope you will all still be supportive during this time too, because I'll need a lot of willpower to do this. I usually get into shape and then quit running, get out of shape, and then repeat the whole thing again. This time I'm trying to stay in shape permanently.       On another note somewhat related, I really enjoy reading everyone's comments. I know I'm not interesting a lot of the time but it means a lot that I can count on you all. You're all great people and thanks for putting up with me.
