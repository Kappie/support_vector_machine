I had a kind of bad feeling when I got to first hour English II and she had a BOOK of our assignments this month rather than a calendar. Research papers, explications, a page long monologue I have to write, memorize and perform in character, luckily renaissance writers didn't do many chokas or tankas, but still, only morehead could make me want to die in less than an hour. The rest of my classes stayed the same except that all the teachers had that overzealous snip and need for organization and "fresh slates" that comes with the new year and should clear up by tomorrow.  Eghck, I was supposed to go to Barnes and Noble with Emily today, but she called while I was at the store and I got off track, that kind of thing.  Oh and also, for that renaissance monologue, I have to have a costume! I hope I can find something to wear, even if it would be cool to have a fancy ruffly dress made. morehead said the hardest part of the assignment would be to BECOME the character and put words in their mouth, drama class don't fail me now...  Well it's 8:30 and I've done everything I was supposed to, I think I'll rundown my buddylist real fast and see who's not ignoring me, then I'll maybe play with some html?
