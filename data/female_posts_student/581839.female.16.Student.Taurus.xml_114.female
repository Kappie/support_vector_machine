Mom, Smith, and Patterson were watching the last few minutes of rush hour, so i watch it with them. then, my mom gets in one of those moods that i hate. margaret is in her room doing homework, and mom catches me, and gives me thing after thing to do, without a break. when i ask for one, and sit down, she would say something totally embaressing about me. i hate that so much, especially because she has no problem saying anything about me, so she had no trouble talking about how i won't wear "these shorts because they won't let my "cheeks" hang out of them" or how she can see "my budding breasts" the phrase that i despise of the most in the world. UGH! so i'm doing this work, and her attitude is making me more and more fowl, and i just want to scream. during all of this, margaret is doing her homework and smith is in the shower, while the kids run around. smith leaves, and so i get cornered into going to the park. yipee hooray! so i play basket ball with patterson, which wasn't bad at all, but we get home. and i go get ice cream with dad, jordan, zack, and patterson, while margaret does homework. then, we get back, smith returns from his appointment, they watch a video, and low and behold, margaret just doesn't have anymore work to do all of a sudden! how does that happen? so margaret leaves to see some dj and mom makes me work again, and lets everyone see the worst of me. because i am definatly NOT nice when i'm working while mom is in one of those moods. so. thats my night. i still have math to do, but i don't want to do it. i don't want to go to school tommorow. Jules -so... your saying there's a chance...
