Was reading about him in the paper, why do some men have to me absolutly drop dead gorgeous and then others, mainly all the ones we happen to know are ugly as wotsits!!!! Ummmmmmmmmm...... U really should ban me from talking about men again, it should shut me up for a while.  I really like pink Jelly Babies, in small amounts they are really very nice.  Sorry I am sat here with a bag of jelly babies and there is only one left, a black one, which I strongly dislike!!  Poor old Jess, she is ill with a cold like the rest of the nation.  OOOO it snowed over night, yes the snow was slightly pathetic, but it still snowed!!!!  Yay the first snow of winter, wasn't that a name of some really bad film??  Lalala i'm rediculously mad.  I really hate shopping for dresses.  Im sure you have all seen what women want, well when I go shopping with my dad its like shopping with mel Gibsons character, he wants you to have a dress that makes you look like a nun!!!  Or an old lady.  I really don't ware dresses.  Have you seen me in a dress in the last 5 years?  NO!!!! Ahhhhhhhhh I hate them they are soooo ugggghhhhhhh.  Right rant over, o I hate shoes with heels to, I really cant walk in them, they make me fall over to much.  Ummmmmmm I really need chocolate and Coldplay, ooooo coldplay. Did you have a nice time with Tim laura, I was going to text you during today but I keep on forgetting and I expect your coming home now or something.  O well. I'm all alone, dad and nicole are with the caravan cleaning it and Mum is at nans, at least I think she is.   When I go sking my loverly family are all going to London, and France I think without me.  But muuuhahahahahah *evil laugh* they wont be able to get a family ticket for anything, because they are all based on two adults and two children, I know these things, don't ask me why.   Hummmmmmm had better go and do something constructive, but then again what is constructive, this could be said to be constructive as I am entertaining millions *cough*!!! That is a very interesting thought!! xx
