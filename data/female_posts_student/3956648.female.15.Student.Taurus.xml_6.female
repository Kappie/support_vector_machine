I don't wanna try to be bad ass cause I'm not. No need to talk shit you can't back up.  I hope that jessica gets on her Yahoo Messenger cause my dad took out my phone from my room  Tony, Mason and the little dude Sky came ova to the house. I don't know about Mason he can be so sweet at certain times but yet he has his moments and I think the next time I go over to his house and he was to "hop on the right foot and do the bad thing" I'm gonna tell him how I feel. I don't wanna fuck no more boys with out like going out wit them and I want to be sure that when I do take that next step I wouldn't mind him haven my kid or what eva *ya feel me* Prolly not. But yeah I just want to be prepared well i am gonna hit it up cause my girl jessica is talking to me now LOVE PEACE AND MUTHA FUCKING CHICKEN GREACE BITCH Q TO THE P
