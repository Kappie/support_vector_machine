Leverage Suitable Trends, Contacts  Partnerships    1)  Sell, service and support Linux and Linux-based products.     2)  Allow companies to lease software off-site, hosted and supported 		       	                by Microsoft.    3)  Continue talks with Hollywood studios to provide technology that will curb        movie pirating over the internet.   4)  Continue research into wearable computing products, including the use of          holographic displays.     Reassess Profitability of Segments    1)  Decide whether its too late for MSN to compete with Google (July 1, 2004,        MSN released a new search technology in an effort to compete).  Microsoft        needs to evaluate its cash outlays in this field, although many of the        search utilities that Microsoft develops under the auspices of MSN may        have a second internal life in-house.   2)  Continue to invest heavily in R     3)  Explore expanding consulting business, including entering traditional IT          consulting markets, specifically opportunities that may emerge from the        outsourcing of corporate or governmental IT departments.    Reexamine Marketing Goals  Expenditures   1)  Sales functions seem to be doing well, despite dull marketing.  Reinvigorate brand        image (and revamp images associated with working at Microsoft, i.e. a start-up that no        longer can act like a start-up) and brand with a global, mildly edgy advertising        campaign (the MSN Butterfly campaign is a start).  Marketing department seems to lack        focus, i.e. the brands are controlling the marketers instead of vice versa.   Pay Attention to Global Strategy    1)   Develop better software localization and human-centered design strategies 	   2)   Microsoft must think globally and devise global solutions both for its own         operations and for its customers, now more than ever (perhaps offer global  		       outsourcing of IT functions and global IT consulting) 	   3)   Continue to pressure China and other countries with lackadaisical IP laws         (perhaps pledge to help the Chinese implement the laws for a fee).  Tweak People Practices     1)  Microsoft seems to be doing a good job in regard to its HR functions,            although making the Microsoft brand a bit less stodgy could help attract the           best and brightest technical talent.      2)  Microsoft should implement cross-disciple teams in its R efforts (guessing it does,         but not drawing heavily enough on people from the social sciences) and then         reward those who receive patents  inventions by team rather than by individual.           3)  Microsoft should stop being so secretive and promote R stars in the press to         generate buzz.     4)  Microsoft should have a clear succession plan in place for when Bill Gates          and Steve Ballmer retire.
