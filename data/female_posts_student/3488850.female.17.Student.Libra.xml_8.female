Well, i couldn't rememeber what i dreamt, forgotten immediately i woke up.   Today is my church youth group anniversary. I did Sushi, and we had bbq.  It was a tiring day. i did the Sushi until quite late that i had to take taxi down to "his" place. I wanted to do something for him. And yes, for my first time doing things for him, i did Sushi for him. He wore a blue sleeveless t-shirt and jeans. HE wore his spectacles. He looked like a decent chap, lolz. He looked nice. Muack~* He comments that the Sushi is nice. Glad to hear that. :)   The bbq was alright, more than enough food to go around. We had 2 guest of honor. lolz. Not that bored with them around. Like this middle aged couple. Hehez.   Rather tired now... Goodnitez....
