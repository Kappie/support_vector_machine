Need to clean the apartment a bit, have to read some things about the creative explosion in the Upper Paleolithic, have to do a lot of looking at crania pictures to try to learn the important features on the temporals, occipital, and parietals.  And figure out how to tell them apart when you only have tiny little fragments.  Wheee.  Stupid Latin names.  It means that there's just lots of memorization involved.  I guess I also need to know about measurement points on the skull, so I have to draw a complete skull (I think I'm just going to focus on the front) and add the points in my notebook.  This class is a LOT of work.  Sigh.  No class on Monday, though, so that gives me a bit more time.  Anyhoo, I need to go.  Should get dressed and ready to go.  Stupid cold weather.
