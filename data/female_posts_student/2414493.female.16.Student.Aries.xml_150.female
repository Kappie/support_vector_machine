Hoping the hours go by quickly until 11:30, and then wishing every moment stays.  Collecting red envelopes. I always feel bad opening them just after you get them, as if you were eagerly awaiting the $20 bill inside. I'll have a hard time growing up, hah. No more free money like this when...is it when you marry? and then you have to pass them out. I know it's still money, but I have a hard time spending it too. As I hand the bill to the cashier thoughts run through my head: this was last touched by Grandma, who gave it to me as a birthday present. And then, at that precise moment I'd rather spend another $50 bill. I am too sentimental about things. Leads to being a packrat. I have a hard time thinking money is money and I might as well use it since the next bill is worth jsut as much as the last.  Had another thirsty dream. Maybe it was from noodles last night.  I really don't feel 16.
