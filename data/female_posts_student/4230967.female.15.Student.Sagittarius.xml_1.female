I had a boyfriend but he broke up with me for another girl, surprisingly im still friends with him. i cried about it twice, and that was a week and a half after it happened.       I have great friends, but id rather read books then socialize. Talking about drinking isn't one of my favorite topics. i wish i could talk more to them, but i don't know how. this is one of the first times ive actually got friends.       i was bullied during primary school because i had a problems with my nose, it kept on running, also because id be out playing sport with the boys, then sitting down bitching.       this isn't really much but at least its a start. ive got to go, but ill add a more meaningful blog later....      till then
