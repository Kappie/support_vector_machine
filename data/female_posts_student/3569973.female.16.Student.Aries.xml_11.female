Thursday me and Jake ended up being the only ones who went to hurrican harbor but that didnt matter because it was really fun, I even learned how to seriously swim, even though it was only in 8ft of water...it still counts because I stayed above the water the whole time for about 5 min I swam whith no help and then we went back to his house. Friday we went to go play golf which was actually fun...I think it was only fun though because I got to drive the golf cart, then we came home so that I could go to work and yes of course ended up back at his house, saturday...I went to get fireworks with Jakes whole family and then ended up leaving later to go to work and of course back to Jakes. Yesterday I learned how to change a tire and all that stuff about my truck and then me and Jake ended up going to wal-mart and taking about 5 hours to finish with his front and back yard, but thats okay because we got paid for it. Then today I had to take that stupid practice THEA and Im supposed to be looking for a new job today but its raining pretty bad and I dont want to look really bad when I go in and ask hey are you hiring, ya know. But I think that me and Jake are still going back to ross because I found a really really cute wallet there that I like a lot and he found some really nice pants that he likes. Now if you didnt understand why the title of this blog was the way it was. Its because if you cant tell Im at Jakes a lot...not just because I want to see Jake all the time but because I love his family, his family feels more like family to me than my own sometimes, his family understands a lot of the stress Im under right now, and his home even if its not the best in the whole world...feels more comfortable and more like home. Well thats all I have right now...Till then, Later Days
