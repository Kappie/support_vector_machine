FUCK them in their ASSES... is how i feel about that... dont promise me something and then not go through with it you dumb shitface... sorry i know i sound absolutely selfish and dumb but im used to people keeping their promises to me, especially my dad and he didnt and now im outraged... so i talked to my mom and for my birthday shes going to get me a line on hers!!! yay thats not that far away... lets hope that shes not lying to me too or i will go ape... okay anyways moving on with the story... my night ended up consisting of me sitting on my ass and not doing anything... chad and i had plans but then his mom wouldnt let him so that kind of made my night shitty, but thats not his fault... i dont know but i am real ready to go back to moms and be away from my father who is driving me fucking crazy... no offense to him but you can only take so much of not having privacy i mean i am a teenage girl and i live in my room away from everyone or i am out with friends but here, no i have no privacy. i mean seriously i wake up and i have my father hovering over me and asking me questions like do you want food... FUCK no!!! i dont want food the second i wake up, no i dont want to go and spend the day at the mall with you, i want to be out with my friends or sitting in my room with my cd player and tv or sitting on my computer away from everyone... my goodness even the computer is in his room so there is no getting away... AHHH... i think that i am basically just in the mood to complain right now... sorry... um yes well here are the plans for the next few days... monday: dad's working, must find something to do... tuesday: dad's working, must find something to do until james is ready to do something wednesday: dad's working, its britts b-day, um... must find something to do thursday: canoeing!!! YAY!!! friday: um... well i dont know... maybe camping with chad?? saturday: same as friday sunday: dad's b-day, having a BBQ and the family's coming up monday: BACK AT MOMS!!! HALLELUJAH!!! tuesday: well this is where i dont even want to think about having to plan things this far in advance, we'll see what happens...  um well thats a run down of life at this moment... by tomorrow i will probably be complaining about something else or i will be so happy that its obnoxious who knows?  i kind of go through mood swings on here, not actually in life, but when i get on here i can either find the best thing ever to complain about or i can find something really lame to celebrate where as when im with someone im just weird and dance to all different songs in my mind and jump around... well i really am done babbling... im sick of writing on here... goodnight... gabby
