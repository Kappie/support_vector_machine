We took 196 and made our way to Shaw Tower to watch The Village for the 3.45pm show. By the time we bought the tickets and reached the theatre,the movie already started. I quite understood the show,but halfway... I lost my concentration cos it was simply too draggy and boring. My boyfriend,was sick.. Having his cold.. Poor him. Hehehe.. I almost fell asleep actually.. The movie was like 2hrs.. Not worth watching.. But the theatre was not packed at all. In fact,only 1/6 of the theatre was occupied.. Came out of the movie at 5.45pm.      Went to Marina Square to eat cos we felt hungry.. Ate at Mcdonalds.. Then Raihanah called to say she too is in Marina Square.. With her boyfriend.. Eating at K. Rogers. Met them and Feeza after that. Feeza had to bring along her siblings.. Poor her. Lol. We made our way to the Esplanade.. And damn,it was bloody packed. Had to squeezed thru until we reached the mid of Esplanade and Merlion. And met Nana and Jali,her boyfriend there. Her boyfriend was becoming friendlier.. Lol.. Such a small world that my boyfriend know Jali.. Cos they always play football la..      So we watched the fireworks.. Abit onli.. Cos the Pan Pacific Hotel blocked it!! Hahaha.. I watched the fireworks already actualli on Sunday. Lols.. But it was sweet la.. Cos we were with our loved ones.. Saw Zaid and his gfren.. He was shocked when seeing me and Amirhadi. Nevertheless, we had fun that day. Took 14 home.. Saw abit of S'pore Idol.. So bloody funny man.. Lodsa crappy talent.       That was it. I reached hme close to 11. But i enjoyed it.. cos I get to spend the day with him and my friends(for a while,at least).. Hehehehe     ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
