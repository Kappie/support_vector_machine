And then you can't? For whatever reason? I mean like.... ahhhhh! It is extremely and painfully aggravating. I hate this. *growls*   I should go play the piano, but it's too late now. And I have nothing to write about. And I don't like my flute. And I tried sketching out some more anime, but that didn't help. *sigh* At least my sketchbook is getting nice and full... what other forms of art are there?   Dance!   *does crazy John Peter Louis dance to Lateralus*   *is tired*    Some time later....  okay, so that helped a little bit. But I am going stir-crazy!!! Really! Silvery art-juice is going to run out of my ears if I don't get rid of it. This is insanely uncomfortable. Now I won't be able to sleep, I won't be able to sit still for any length of time, won't be able to work... I need to scream. Or at least do some mind-numbing activity so that I stop thinking and die or whatever.    Who here believes in an afterlife? I'm not sure if I do. If I did, I'd believe in reincarnation, since I do believe that we're here to learn. Obviously you can't learn everything in one lifetime, so you'd come back... or, your spirit would move on. Because I just don't see how, if you are to learn things, you forget everything when you return in your next life. Of course, maybe we progress to some creature that can't express itself like that... or maybe, I'm just not advanced enough to know.    I'm a Mahalayan Buddhist, btw. That's what the Belief-o-Matic told me. And then a Universalism thing, and then a neo-pagan. I emailed myself a copy of the results :) I love religions! I loathe close-minded people who think their religion is the one true way though. My old best friend was like that *sigh* It was depressing. I remember we got into a massively huge fight because she said my parents didn't know between right from wrong. And I know none of you will believe me lol, but I hadn't said anything personal like that to her! Just that I believed something else. Nothing about her family.    I do remember that I gloated after she got into trouble though. hehehe.   Anyone think religion is a good thing? I think belief is, and faith is, but that religion isn't. I haven't entirely worked out clear distinctions between the three, but I know there are subtle differences. I just haven't figured them out yet. I will eventually.   I've also decided that I'm a hippie =D I'm going to hitchhike across Canada with my harp and show how treehugging-ness is the world's salvation! Hell, maybe I should be the next Jesus or something...   *falls off chair*   I sure as hell hope none of you are strict Christians. hehehehehe...
