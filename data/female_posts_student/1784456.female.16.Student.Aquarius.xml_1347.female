I was the living dead in school today, mixture of stress, lack of sleep and protesting (it takes up a lot of energy!) Yeah! Hey! I'm a celebrity! I was on GWRfm! I hope they put my point across ok... and didn't make me sound ba (I probably did that any way) Who needs editing when I can muck up for you! (...) But it was fun and we got our point out, we were heard! (In the wrong light in some cases) But we spoke louder than the politicians. (I think we did!) Well... I'm really bored... there's nothing to do! I'll have to arrange all this stuff to do next week, but I'd rather just laze around. Oh, feel free to come to my house *people that I know* and do... whatever. Just don't paint it green... I hate green. Oh, and I'm broke! Fun! Oh geez... depressing music, well I'm kind of down and I don't know why... *sniff sniff* It all starte- *We don't want to know about your twisted life* Oh right... stick to the non-existant point, got it. Mmm... well better go talk protesting with my brother. Remember -  No one's life is worth it
