It's not as good as a camera phone, but it's better than nothing.  I'm really happy now!  And I can also send up to 100 text messages a month so expect to receive a lot of text messages.  Mwahahahahahaha.  Anyways, other than that, today was pretty uneventful.  I hung out with Jamie and Mia for a few hours and watched  The Birdcage , which was this movie about drag queens and such and I finally watched  Grind  which had like the most unbelieveable plot ever, but was still a good movie.  I *heart* Adam Brody, the guy who played the main character, and the guy who played "Sweet Lou".  They were all incredibly hot.  After that, I went to the city to see my brother, and we saw  Troy .  Bleh, they got the entire sequence of the entire war messed up, and they made it seem like the war lasted about a week instead of 10 years.  But they did cover most of the key events, though they left out a little and several Greeks died that weren't supposed to.  They left out all God intervention, which pissed me off but eh, you can't have everything.  The actress who played Helen was hardly beautiful enough to have launched a thousand ships.  Bleh.  I can't wait for the class trip to Dorney Park tomorrow!!! It's going to be so much fun, even though a lot of people aren't going, including Dot.  Whatever.  After Dorney Park, there's only graduation, yearbook signing, and the 8th grade talent show left and then it's Good Bye Welsh Valley, I won't miss you.  ONLY 2 AND A HALF MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL!!!  ...la Gu
