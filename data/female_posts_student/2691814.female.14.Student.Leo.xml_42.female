Math class, seeing ryan and lipping accross the room, mr.mosers class cuz me ryan deidra and thomas talked almost the whole time, and then the bus ride home which was fun. As for right now...im bored...but not really cuz im watching Charmed. I dont' wanna talk to gabby right now...even though she's outside cuz....im getting bad vibes from her. I try to be nice but...oh well.   only 100 tickets left....boo hoooo. Me and Francesca need to hurry up and get tickets other wise we cant go lol. Ryan-if you wanna go..u better hurry as well. lol....anyway...omg im like freaking out. I need to go ...this would be like the best part of my year in FL. I need toget out and have some REAL fun.
