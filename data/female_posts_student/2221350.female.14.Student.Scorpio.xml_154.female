He's a cool dude.   and um, where the fuck is  urlLink Tr0y ??? Did he die???  anyways, at six when Luis passed out from sleepiness, I had one of those crazy industrious moments in which I cleaned the whole house, made tea, lemonade, coffee, and fluttered around in some sort of sleep deprived euphoria. By 11 o' clock, I felt horribly shitty what with mother fucking nature working her magic((I'm ready for menopause, I tell you)) making me want to scrape my ovaries out and stirfry them. Thankfully, that never lasts long. I slept from 11-3, having nothing better to do than listen to the rain. When I woke up I sort of wandered about the house, showered for the second time, and watched Jeopardy(("Ken Jennings returned for the 20TH time to play JEOPARDY! On Tuesday, June 29TH. Ken triumphantly added $40,000 to his earnings. His jackpot now stands at $662,760."))((this guy must know freaking everything, eh? He's a trivia buzzsaw)).   it's now 3:36AM... What am I doing up?     Me((all sweaty from volleyball)) with Bess((not looking sweaty))     My cousin Thomas((AKA Tommy))
