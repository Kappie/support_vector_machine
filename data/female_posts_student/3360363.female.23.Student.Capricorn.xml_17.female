Silently,  he turns upon us so we can read,  recognizing us for the sinners  we are, and, silently,  tries to save us from his dreaded  faith imagined.  I bid him: goodnight, and receive  an unintelligible rambling sermon-like reply,  and - silently - I thank him for his sign;  for trying to save us, for a mighty good laugh, and for allowing me to contemplate that famous last syllable of recorded time, end of all things (which I am sure is always near) once more
