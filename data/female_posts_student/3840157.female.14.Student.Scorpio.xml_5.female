Oh that day is Khai Wan b'thday too.She seem very happy and her eyes seem have shone lights.That's just so special.Then I handed her a persent.I so glad that she seem very happy that day.I guess she had a great b'day.   Then at night,I met Mark online.Chatting with him made my mood become much better.Thanks for him so much.   But still...I just maybe need to change some of my irritating attitude.sigh....Hope everything will get better soon.
