Um, oh yeah.  Thanks for the calls yall...*cough cough* and a very true thanks to both Abby and Liz, even though I had to call and remind them to call me. Oh well, that's the way life goes.  I'm just glad to be home.  I hate Alabama.  And I left my cell phone there.  Grrr.  Maybe I'll be happier next time I post.
