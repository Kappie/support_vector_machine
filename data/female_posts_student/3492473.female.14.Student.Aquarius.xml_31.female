I can't tell you exactly what happened and what I lied about because I'm afraid it would ruin everything that's left. But I'm admitting to you guys that I screwed up and lied to certain people.   I woke up early compared to usual. Ate breakfast, attempted to do crunches but my body wasn't awake enough yet, and then came online. I wish I didn't. That's when it all went downhill. So I have this little habit of reading everyone's a/m's and profiles when I have nothing else to do. So I hit the "Guys" list on my BL and who's first? Chris, obviously. Who those of you who don't know, Chris is my boyfriend. I read his a/m and then glance down at his profile.  BIG MISTAKE.  For the past, I dunno, but it's been awhile, he's had "!!!I LOVE LOR!!!"  But today, he didn't.  Me, being, the type of person who freaks out at tiny things, (go figure) started freaking out. I IMed Erica to talk. I thought maybe I was being too worried. Once I told Air what happened, she said, "Sorry, I don't wanna lie but Chris was talking to me about you last nite... you should talk to him and not me ." Then I was telling Alecia what happened. For those of you who don't know, Alecia is like my sister, we call ourselves, "other halves." She was like, "TALK TO HIM!" So I'm waiting until I talk to Annie to call Chris. And guess what? I realized something else that sends me more downhill.  He has a Buddyprofile.  So I went and read it, seeing if he took out everything about me. And guess what?  He did.  My birthday was out of the count down area but most importantly, he took out something in his "Me" page. It used to say "but most importantly I love Lor more than anything."  Now it says, "I love football and wrestling more than anything else."  Yeah, pain... a lot of it ... I'm gonna go call Annie and then I'm gonna call Chris. (gulp) I'll fill ya in later.
