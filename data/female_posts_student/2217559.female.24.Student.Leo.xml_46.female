I am ask the same question wherever  go albeit in Mexico in a Taxi, in Mexico in a store, on the Ship after ihave already told everyone - I am from Texas.  In Acapulco today, again. It was a gorgeous day and I went to villa vera until I got very rudely interrupted by all the dumb ditzy blonde dancers who I can't stand. These girls make ME, yes ME, want to puke.  Rumors have spread around the ship that they are carrying STDs like a plague and most all of them are sleeping with some greek officer. I can't stand them and now they are in my department.  Fortunately, I am in more of a supervisory role than them. I was a villa vera resort for 30 minutes before they ALL showed up with their greek boyfriends...prancing around in tiny bikini's screaming, "Aww, Don't - I am fat. I don't want everyone seeing how fat I am."  4 Words for these girls - EAT A PIZZA BITCH. Ugh, I was so irritated that I stayed for an additional 30 minutes and left when I had planned to stay all afternoon. It was disappointing, but oh well. I then took a taxi to the beach and decided I would try that option. I walked for about a 1/4 mile before I ran into some friends. I stopped and plooped into the sand. Watched the waves crash,ate some great garlic shrimp, and headed into the water.  While Iwas there, a huge tidal wave sucked me under, filled my entire swimsuit top and bottom both with sand and I think I had a rectum cleansing. I was spit out on the beach shore where I discovered that this tidal wave crashed into my handbag getting everything covered in water and sand. It was fiasco I swear. Nontheless, I was able to get some of the sand out and get in another taxi to come back to the ship. I am hoping to go out again tonight for dinner but I am scared to dath of what might go wrong this time. Hahaha. Aww, I am sure I will survive.  I have gotten a dark tan in the last few days. My hair is getting much blonder and I am happy to report that I have lost almost 15 pounds. Ship life is good. Very good. Hehehehe. I have many photos that I would love to share but I can't figure out how to post them on this site. I guess they will have to wait.   Many hugs and kisses and lots of hellos to all my friends at home. May 29th will not be here soon enough. Hi Paddy.
