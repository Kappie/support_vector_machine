Like where fairies and gnomes live?  Cpt. Nixon: (walks up) I swear I thought I could smell a fire. (sees fire) I did smell a fire. Are you out of your mind?  Richard Winters: Well, we're in a dell.   Warren Muck: I swam the across the Niagra once.  Alex Penkala: Yeah.  Warren Muck: I swear. On a bet.  George Luz: What in a barrel?  Warren Muck: No, God... I didn't go over the falls, George. I swam across the river. Ten miles up from the falls. I tell ya, that current is damn strong, it must have carried me at least two miles down stream before I made it across. But I got across. Now, personally, I didn't think it was all that stupid. But my mom and my sister Ruth... they gave me all kinds of hell.  George Rice: It looks like you guys are going to be surrounded.  Richard Winters: We're paratroopers Lieutenant. We're supposed to be surrounded.
