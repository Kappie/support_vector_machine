Ah, fire, smoke, and of course, CONFETTI!!!  It was all over everywhere.  Who knew confetti was actually more than a mess?  Anyway, lots of fun; Whitney got a T-shirt.  I was going to get the Newsboys one with Cap'n Crunch on the front (they have a song called "Breakfat, so it does make sense) but then I remembered that I was pretty much broke, so I didn't get it. It was really cute, though.  So, rosie, how was the 'shroom?  And may I ask what (and I quote) "toe food" is?
