Not Chris Hanel, no no...Chris Hanel's MOM.   All I have to say is...duba-u tee eff.   I mean really...the woman doesn't even know me, fuck, she hasn't even met me, and she decided to call me a ho.   Niiiice. I can see my reputation at '2k is a beautiful one. *shakes head*  I found it humorous, I mean...not initially...when I first read her statements about me, I wanted to cry, because I mean...what the fuck, she's judging me on a few things I said in the past.   I've changed, and we all know this.   I'm in a relationship where neither I nor the other plans on having sex before we are married.   I have decided, on my own accord, that I would save myself for when I got married.   My reputation preceeds me, apparently.   Meh.   If she chooses to think those things of me, so be it. I can't make the Hanel's believe one thing or another.   Atleast Chris doesn't view me like that. That's always a plus.   In a way, I'm glad she said that to me. I made myself proud, 'cuz I didn't fly off the handle.   I didn't even call her a bitch, go me!  Greg on the other hand...he was PISSED, lol. I mean I was upset, but he was P I S S E D. I would never talk to an adult like that, let's just put it that way, lol.  Anyhow, that's the end of my talking about crazy parents.   Expect a random, philosophical post later, I like those :)
