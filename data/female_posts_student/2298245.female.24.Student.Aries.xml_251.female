In reading for Evidence, I came across the case of   urlLink United States v. Owens  , which deals with an appeal based exclusion of evidence of prior out of court identification by the witness of the defendant as hearsay.  The relevant Federal Rule of Evidence provides that such evidence (an identification) is admissible if the person who made the I.D. is a witness at trial and subject to cross-examination.  This is a very long winded discussion, but I felt it was warranted, because after my  urlLink dismal performance on the Evidence quiz  yesterday, I feel the need to prove that I am learning something in this class.    Now, onto my point.  Justice Scalia wrote the opinion in the case, which held that the witness being subject to memory loss does not mean that he is no longer subject to cross-examination, so long as he still takes the stand and is willing to answer questions to the best of his ability on cross.  Anyway, those of you familar with Scalia will know that he fashions himself a literalist and prefers to say what the interpretation of a statute is by looking only at the language of the statute.  It is a noble endeavor (if not always practical), and it is one of the things I admire him for.  That makes his language in this case rather odd, for he actually relies on the Advisory Committee notes accompanying the rule instead of just the language of the rule itself in reaching his decision.  The Advisory Committee notes are not part of the text of the rule, and serve as scholarly interpretation of the rule only, though they are often cited with approval by courts.    To Scalia's credit, he later repudiated this reliance on Advisory Committe notes in his concurrence in a case entitled   urlLink Tome v. United States  .  He did not join the part of the majority opinion that made loving reference to the Advisory Committee Notes in support of the decision, and wrote:  "I have previously acquiesced in, and indeed engaged in similar use of the Advisory Committe Notes.  More mature consideration has persuaded me that is wrong."
