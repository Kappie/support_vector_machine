They would then walk home eat left overs or things cooked the night before and study the bible in silence and reflect on their lives or visit friends, neighbors or family. Now we rush to make it on time sit through class and service all the while wondering how fast we can get out of the parking lot to beat the "baptists" to our favorite lunch spot. Even while you eat your constantly thinking of what the day holds who has to be where, when and how long instead of just slowing down and enjoying your familys company. Sunday was once a day to relax and reflect to rest up for the next week to prepare yourself spiritually, mentally,and physically. Thats 52 days a year that they had to rest and relax. Sundays for some is just another day to get caught up on work or other activities not god or self reflection. We no longer have "time" for that in our fast pace world of self indulgence and greed. No wonder everone today is stressed constantly we have lost 52 days of rest and renewal! thats like 520 days in ten years days that are wasted when they should be used for god... maybe its time for us all to reflect and reverse
