I must stress at this point that no other decisions have been taken so far on this issue e.g. the area involved, the consultation process etc. Furthermore, as there are CPZ's either side of the area in Leyton and along Hoe Street it is more than likely that these will be re-visited in conjunction with whatever is proposed for the Bakers Arms area. At present I also have no timescale for the project although it is proposed that the issue will be discussed at a Community Council before the end of this year.  The new CPZ consultation process (agreed by the Council last September) is in two stages - the first stage concentrates on the residential roads within a short walk of the centre of congestion.  If a majority from this area are in favour a second-stage consultation is then carried out including roads up to half a mile from the centre - which may also be affected.   I am sure a new CPZ will evoke strong feelings either way for residents and I will update the blog as I hear more details of the timescale for the consultation process. In the meantime if residents want to email me their comments about the idea at  urlLink cllrs.creasy@lbwf.gov.uk  or discuss them on this blog I'd be interested to hear.
