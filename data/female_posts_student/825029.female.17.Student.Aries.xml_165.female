This last week of school totally blows- I have so much to do in every class and I’m very impatiently waiting for it to finally end.  I didn’t go to school today... I’m not sick, just needed a break and some time to catch up on schoolwork.  I made Area, so that’s another thing I have to worry about... gotta practice a lot over the Christmas break.  I’m afraid I’ll keep putting it off, so you should crack down on me and send me lots of IM’s telling me to go practice!  And Leah, I’m counting on you!  You and me are going all the way.  Or, at least just you : )  A special hello to my friend Habibi!  Hello Habibi!  Made a cake with Charles this past weekend... it was slightly a disaster, but fun (and tasty) nonetheless.  I recommend it for all you bored people that don’t know what to do with yourselves.  Also, we saw “Something’s Gotta Give”, that new Jack Nicholson movie.  I totally loved it, although it was a little slow at first and the ending could’ve been shortened down a lot.  Still good, though.  So, really, my life is consisting solely of school right now.  An essay, test, and lots of homework in Spanish.  Lots of essays and stupid interview projects in Challenge.  OH!  And a project for over the Christmas break.  Mr. Griffin decided to split up the history test into two parts so I have the first part this Friday and need to learn 52 ID’s by then.  And Pre-Cal just sucks.  I’m kinda lost and it’s just... a boring class.  Honor band is touring the middle schools this Thursday so I get to miss school... but it means more make-up work : \  Also, the big Ireland fundraiser night is Thursday, so that should be fun, except for the fact that I have an APUSH test the next day, so I have a feeling I’ll be leaving pretty early.  Everyone come, though!  6:30-10 (I think)!  I’m very disappointed with the plethora of Gilmore Girls and One Tree Hill reruns!  What is up with that???  I make it through each week knowing that on Tuesday, I’ll get to watch my favorite shows... and for the past 3 weeks, they’ve all been reruns.  Stupid WB.  Oh well, life goes on I suppose.  *laughs at Saddam*  teehee.  Sucks to be you!  Alrighty, well that’s all for now.  Oh yeah, Charles is the bestest!!  Cool song alert!!  relient K – “12 Days of Christmas”  Have a fantastic last week of school, everyone!
