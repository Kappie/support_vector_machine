So far, my life has been going wrong with barely any highlights.  Maybe it's to pay back for something i've done in my previous life.  I wonder who i was...a philosopher? No.  I might have been something totally different than what i am right now.    Time flies quickly when you're having fun?  Does that imply that life itself is a game?    What are accomplishments?  Is it the stuff that lasts for only a while such as publishing a book at the age of 9?  Or, is it the lesson learned through loving which continues on forever?  Is it really the point to know everything?  No human can learn everything..why?  Because we are mortal.. If i was immortal i would know a lot of things but not everything..  After all..what is knowledge?  Academic knowledge such as mathematics, languages, History and geography can be learned anytime.  But.  No one can ever LEARN common sense and logic.  Take some time to think about it.  Life is such a puzzling and complex maze.  It seems that we are the mice trying to find our way out, desperately rushing through though the key is to stop and try over and over again.  Life is a beautiful road.  Do not rush past for you might never see it again.  Stay to breathe in the air, taste the sun and smell the life.
