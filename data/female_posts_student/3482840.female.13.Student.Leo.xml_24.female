Since mom's cash is running low and the job aps. aren't workin out, she's actually considering us renting out the house and moving to KIWANIS! Thanx, but slumming is not included in my interest category... NEway, we were just @ my cousin Danny's in KL and I saw Jason. He finally cut his hair! That was a shocker.  Mom invited Mimi  Lydia over 4 a cookout 2morrow. Great isn't it? Yeah right. Just how I wanted to spend 2morrow after being w/ Lyd ALL weekend. Ah well, nothin I can do about it. So, I g2g. TTYL!
