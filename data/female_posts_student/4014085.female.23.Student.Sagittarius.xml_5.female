So Anthony has graciously agreed to design my site in exchange for food and I am happy. Today I register the domain name and buy the hosting service. Also, I've decided to take the general concensus and write a book. I'm hoping to be able to just write bits and pieces at a time and set it up like a collection of short stories about my life. We'll see how it comes along. Anyway, I'm at work right now so I guess I better earn my pay.
