I had gone up with my friends and it was a blast! The most fun I had in the longest time. I wish we could have this moment back and continue it on from here now and forever!  Anyway, like I said....I've had a lot of good days...i'm waiting for the better to come along! But alas....when it comes...I'll be posting more....and hey, huey....your negatives....my positives. lol  love ya sweety and miss ya!
