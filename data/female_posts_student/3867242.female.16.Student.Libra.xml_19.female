So I took my own advice and voila here's my blog. I didn't work today..so after Rachael got home from teaching swimming lessons..I got to drive for awhile. Unfornuately..my driving is going nowhere..and I feel like I'm not going to drive on my own until I'm 80!! But I called some driving school place..and I have some lessons next week, (yeah, Daylin I used the phone..aren't you proud of me?).  Then I called Ashley and told her I can't come to her house until 8..because I am working tommorrow. So yeah, tommorrow I'm going to Ashley's..and Mike, Daylin, and Jake will be there..yeah. And then on Friday I'm finally going to see Spider Man 2!! Then this weekend I'm working at the wonderful REC.  Work is going o.k...some days nobody shows up..and other days there's too many people! The staff party on Monday was fun..I got to hang out with Harmony, Ian, and Drew. I played in the baby pool..and Drew and I went down the water slide pretty fast!! Then after those guys left, Rachael, Lucas, and I went home.  So yeah..I know that's long..but hey I have a lot to say! Life's been pretty busy for me lately..with work..and stuff. I hope I have enough time next week to watch I love the 90s! (Finally, a decade I actually remember what happened!!) Anyways that's all I have to say. Oh..wait I finally got AOL! I only have like 6 people on my list..so add me..will you? it's stephc0687. See ya...
