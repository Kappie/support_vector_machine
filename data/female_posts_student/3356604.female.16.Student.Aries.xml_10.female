When she came to pick me up, she helped with the cleaning a lot, then we drove to Hidden Valley to pick up my cousin. We went through Kilmore, and when Annie stopped to get petrol, I saw that Adam was in the video store there. I went and said 'Hi' and then we went on our way. Ellie was telling me about the lamb they had adopted, aptly named Patch for the black spot around its eye. When we arrived we saw that there were two black lambs as well, which I wanted to name Montague and Capulet. When we came back to them a few minutes later to feed them, Capulet (he has a white 'cap' on his head by the way) escaped into the paddock. Also, because the lambs are quite old and not used to humans and therefore bottle-feeding, the only way to get them to drink the milk is by cathing them round their forequarters, holding their bodies with your knees and forcing their mouths open until they realise "Oh, there's milk in this..." Multiply that by three, add some T.V, good food and a book and you've got my day until about 12 this morning. I tried to assist my cousin with making her hair curly, but all we got were some fetching waves. With my hair, it's like for instant curls, just add water! Then, when Dad and I came home at about 1, we found that our dog was missing. After searching our house, our property, the road, the local pound, ringing the vet and calling his name constantly...we got a call from a lady who lives 5km away saying she's found a dog that reminds her a lot of ours. Stupid dog, turns out he had walked, or ran, over 5km and ended up miserable and alone in Reedy Creek. The lady reckons he had followed a jogger or something. Oh well, I shall sleep easily tonight knowing he isn't either dead or becoming swiftly responsible for the death of other local animals.
