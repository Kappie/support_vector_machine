But I will do it just to let my father know I am multi- tasking, if not, he will disallow me to use the comp. Don't know what was wrong with Blogger this afternoon. Almost all other blogs cannot be opened and I spent 20 min trying to open and in vain... Anyway, I am trying to finish my packed dinner, GTG !!!!
