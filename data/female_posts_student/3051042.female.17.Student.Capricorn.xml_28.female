I need coffee, I need to talk with Michelle, this shit on my mind is no good. Or atleast no good will come of it.   Last night was the most depressing night of my life. In some respects, I should have gone home. My mom was right. I had fun, I guess. A whole slew of the guys at Fiji, Mike, April, Nick, Henk, Melissa, Josephine, Todd, the list goes on... we went to the park and got drunk off our asses. Henk and Jeff got stoned. I took two hits and I was through. Nick was trying to convince me to get stoned. Maybe that state would have made things with April and Nick seem insignificant. I know he'd never do anything with her but her on his lap was enough for me to go into Jeff's room and strip down to my tank top and jeans and dance on his coffee table. Remotely trying to have a good night. Desperately trying to have a good night. I sometimes don't understand the actions of others. I really don't understand why Mike didn't take control of his god damn girlfriend. And I sat in a corner for what seemed like too long waiting for Tiki or someone to care and come to find me. Desperate. I'm SO FUCKING DESPERATE!!! Blah... I don't know how many times I fell down. Nick tried to get me to kiss him on his cheek. I said no. I'm done. So then I'm hanging out in the hallway. And Nick and Jeff go into Jeff's room to talk. On their way out all I hear is, "If I was 17 it'd be great... but I'm not." I don't know who that was directed toward, but I'm going to assume it was directed toward me considering the fact that Jeff and I sat outside smoking a cigarette and talking about who we wanted to kill that night. I didn't release the information that I really wanted to stab Nick in his fucking heart so he could feel what it's like to care about someone and then be completely let down. I did hint at the fact that I was upset at Nick, but I didn't explain. Tiki understood and that was enough for me. Maybe if I wasn't so closed off or shy I'd be able to do the same as April does. But Nick has nothing to worry about with her... I think. I'm not pissed, I'm just really upset, or disappointed? I unfortunately cried myself to sleep on Nick's recliner after he passed out while I was mid-sentence into my whole family problem situation. AHH. I wrote lame poetry and stared at the ceiling. Finally got to sleep around 3:30-4am and woke up at 7:30-8am. Sleep is for the weak. Hahah... weak. To tell you the truth, I should have slept with Paul. Where's my punching bag? He woke up around 9 and I went out to smoke, he shortly followed me out but left after his feet got cold. I tried my best to play everything off as okay. I don't think I'm going back up there next weekend. I don't thing I'm going back up there ever.   Time for fun lyrics....  I'm not in love, so don't forget it. It's just a silly phase I'm going through. And just because I call you up, Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made. I'm not in love, no no, it's because... I like to see you, but then again, That doesn't mean you mean that much to me. So if I call you, don't make a fuss; Don't tell your friends about the two of us. I'm not in love, no no, it's because... I keep your picture upon the wall. It hides a nasty stain that's lying there. So don't you ask me to give it back. I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me. I'm not in love, no no, it's because... Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me. Ooh, you'll wait a long time. I'm not in love, I'm not in love... - Tori Amos "I'm Not In Love"  You'll never see -- the courage I know  Its colors' richness won't appear within your view  I'll never glow -- the way that you glow Your presence dominates the judgements made on you But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights  The shades and shadows undulate in my perception  My feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights  I understand what I am still too proud to mention -- to you You'll say you understand, but you don't understand You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye But never is a promise, and you can't afford to lie You'll never touch -- these things that I hold  The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own You'll never feel the heat of this soul  My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown -- to you You'll say, Don't fear your dreams, its easier than it seems You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high But never is a promise and you can't afford to lie You'll never live the life that I live I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night You'll never hear the message I give You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights The shades and shadows undulate in my perception My feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights  I realize what I am now too smart to mention -- to you You'll say you understand, you'll never understand I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why I don't know what to believe in, you don't know who I am You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry But never is a promise and I'll never need a lie - Fiona Apple "Never is a Promise"  Can I become more pathetic than this? I think not.
