This DAMN sound in my ear doesn't help either! It's constantly bubbling, and I can't hear out of it! But it's sooo cool... it's like the sound of the ocean constantly! Wow, I have a ocean in my ear! Oh well... on to my search for veruca treatments! (First I have to check how to spell it!) I'm really really sure you don't wanna know how this goes... so I'll be running away *don't worry, I have socks on!* Not really... muhahahaaa.
