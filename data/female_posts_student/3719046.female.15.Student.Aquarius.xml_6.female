Anyway, if you want to join, it's very easy to be in my club, all you gotta do is tell me you want to be in and you're in.   Send me a damn email:  urlLink Cfreak123@aol.com   If you're still skeptical about joining my FREE free club, here are some reasons why you should join.    It's free  It might be fun  ME! C'mon, you like me, don't you? DON'T YOU?.....  It's totally free  The club will get better with time and more people in it  You will be able to say you joined a club and didn't even have to do anything except email somebody   It's fuckin free!  You will break my fragile heart if you don't join...   So there you go. I know you want to join. C'mon, maybe we'll all get free candy and little flags and a parade! Or maybe not. But so what. Well, later.
