(He clearly has NO concept of what I put up with every day.)  I had to open the box and at least tune it before I worked out.  So I'm tuning the guitar (keep in mind I haven't held a guitar for more than 10 minutes in my entire life) and on the last string, it breaks.  Just snaps right in my face as if that's God's way of saying "See?  Told you you should have worked out, fatass."  Well, David says that on Thursday he's going to stop hanging out with the 16 year old long enough to teach me how to fix it, and maybe play a cord or two.  We'll see.  I don't know where that boy's priorities are.  (Nookie.)  What I do know is that he could do much better...I don't know what she looks like, but the voice is annoying as a certain basenji bugging me to let her out at 5am on the only day of the week I get to sleep in.   Rob is my new internet guru and I'm going to make what I'm sure will be a failed attempt at html code  urlLink here   we'll see if it actually works.  Lots of new updates to come.  Kimmie switched her whole website to blogger, but that's far too much computer geekage for me.  html is dandy, but geocities is quicker...the need for instant gratification rears it's ugly head.
