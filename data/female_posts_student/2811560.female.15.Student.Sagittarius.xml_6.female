So I've been trying to get online for the longest time and it just wouldn't let me on. I tried for like an hour. I did the whole repair thing, restarted my computer, everything. Then, I realize I've been typing the wrong password in the whole time. DUH!!! Man, total blonde moment. So anyways, my day started out really well, wind ensemble was good today, and I got a call back for Anything Goes. Plus, I got a solo in Wizard of Oz! I get to sing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", which is really cool because everyone in all 4 choruses in the school got to audition for it. Nice, huh? But then, I was supposed to go to the Computer Lab for gym, but I forgot my god damn ID at home, so I couldn't go. I was sooo pissed. But anyway, the rest of my day was ok. Went to callbacks after school. Those are so much fun. I swear, that entire play is about sex! Its crazy- "All through the night, your love brings me ecstasy!" Thats a sample of some lyrics from the show. Man! I had to like snuggle up to this guy John who I was singing with. And then I had to read with Noah and he had to be all like "I love you and I want to marry you!" Oh man, it was sooo hard to keep a straight face. But I think I did an okay job. There were 4 girls who tried out for the same character I did, Hope, and I think my only competition is Kelly Reuter. My best friend, Kelly Reuter. NOT! I honestly don't know who will get it. She probably will just because she's older. Damn, I hate that. We'll see. I have to wait until Wednesday to find out, because dance callbacks are tomorrow. I want that part so bad! If God loves me.....
