The lesson started at 10.30am but i reached around 11.30am. lolx. i was scolded by my hubby. :( but i know he wants me to go to school. lolx. He finished school pretty early today so i met him at amk hawker with si min cos we're having our breakfast. We headed to Amk NTUC for shopping. lolx. cos he said he's going to make me potato, wadever it is. :x We seems like married couple and shopped for home groceries, eg: Potato, cream and hams. lolx. It was fun k? envy? :X Cost us around 12 bucks and we took cab back to his house to put those groceries in his house and we went to chinatown due to he lost his 2 knifes(chef's knife  shaping's knife) at school while someone broke his locker and stole it. Serves him right, ask him not to put his stuffs and end up got stolen due to his laziness :P Walking ups and downs at chinatown due to no sign of the shop of his knife and i perspired like hell with no water either. So sweet of him bought me 100plus to drink. lolx. After that, it's around 3pm and we heading back to his house to cook potato!!! hee~ Both of us have reached home and we're preparing our foods and i did company him awhile and i feel pretty weary and i took a "SHORT" nap. He brought in the potato. He said the potato not fully cook, i was like LOLX. But it's tasty and i ate the hams with eggs only. After that, i followed him to the kitchen and helped him up. I recalled of potato chips and i asked him to fried for me :x He placed 2 slices in and got burnt straight away. lolx. The fire is too big and he turns lower the heat and end up NICE but a bit too salty cos i added too much salt. lolx. Got scolded by him and his sis said too salty. lolx :x I dun mean it pls. :~ We slacked for a few hours and i had my dinner at his house and i ate a lil bit cos im dieting. lolx. :P We watched tv until 9pm and i went to his room to slack for awhile and who knows, both of us fell asleep  and i woke up at 10pm and i needa go home cos im tired. He sent me down to get a cab and his mum just reached his house bus stop and was asking me "going home already huh?" I was like "ya" and i took cab home. Din quarrel with hubby today of cos happy. lolx. missing my hubby but i reckon he is in coma right now :x anyway gotta slp soon if not cant wake up tmr for sch. ^-^
