I mean yes I know "no body said life was going to be easy," but fuck how in the great glorius world could so much drama and shit happen to me. Let's see... Both of my brothers suffer from different forms of schizophrenia along with depression, my mom has MS and refuses to use her crutches even when she's in extreme pain, my father is so fucked up he doesn't realize others have feelings and has so many money problems I don't even want to think about it. God, you know, sometimes I look around at people and think why do you have it so fucking good? Who said you could have everyone worship you? I have an idea next time your MOM HAS TROUBLE WALKING OR IS HAVING SPASMS YOU CAN TAKE THE DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL TO TAKE CARE OF HER? HOW 'BOUT THAT UH?? You know WHAT AND THE NEXT TIME A TEACHER SAYS THEIR TIME IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN MINE I CAN TELL THEM WHAT I'M GIVING UP TO BE THERE, because you know what- they've had their parent's their parent's have supported them, but what about me? ASS HOLESS, ASS HOLES!!! ALSO NEXT TIME I WORK MY ASS OFF AT CHURCH I HOPE EVERYONE NOTICES THE SHIT I GO THROUGH FOR ALL YOU PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I WORK SO DAMN HARD TO GET THE MONEY I GET, SO DON'T WHINE AND BITCH ABOUT HOW LITTLE OF A PAYCHECK YOU GOT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT MY PARENTS DON'T HAVE THE MONEY YOUR FAMILIES HAVE? SO TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL THE FUCKING THINGS YOU HAVE THAT YOU HAVE THAT I DON'T AND YOU KNOW WHAT, STOP BITCHING ABOUT HOW YOUR PARENT'S SUCK BECAUSE ONE DAY YOU will need them more than ever, and you know what they'll be gone. Why am I sitting here writing such an angry letter to the world, a huge part of it is because I'd like to be said "goodbye" to or invited to go along with some of you guys to the things you do? You know what I don't hate you, I'm jealous of everything that you have that I don't. Lisa- I'm jealous that your dad cares about you enough to look at you, and that people are constantly taking care of you, even though this is also a bad thing. Sofie- Your slimness, and occassionally your humor even though it can be brutal. Miranda- Your so sweet,and kind and I think you really do love yourself deep down. Sara G.- Your parents even though you hate them soooo much they are able to be REAL with you, and tell you what they think, oh and lets not forget that its good to have our baby fat! Karen- Your ability to keep a secret, and hold it... I will finish this later.. I do love you all but please realize I'm human too... love,Nikki
