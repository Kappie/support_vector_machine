I'm just hoping that everyone is alright with spending a little bit of $.  If not, they can always make up an excuse not to come.  Either way, my party will be fun.  I'm still thinking of who to invite.  I'll invite those who are nice to me within the next week.    I haven't got much to say besides that there was a drunken hobo on the bus today.  God it was creppy.  He got on near the dairy queen with a bag and cans of beer.  The bus driver got pissed off,  took the hobo's beer cans and told him he'd give them back when he will get off.  I was scared at first.  There was an intoxicated being yelling and scaring everyone away.  My fear then turned too laughter.  The hobo took out a harmonica (Vanessa's friend assumes that it was stolen from a little kid) and started signing and blowing in it like a stereotypical hobo.  I could not stop laughing.  A lesson has come out of this bus ride; Drunk people are fun to watch.
