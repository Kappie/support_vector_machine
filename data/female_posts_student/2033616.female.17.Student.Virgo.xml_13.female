Thanks  On a side note, i hate people that say "hello, i'm different" just to say "I'm different".  People need to do something b/c they want to do it.. not b/c everyone else is not doing it.  Having your own sense of style is one thing, but there is going to be someone out there who is just a little like you.  Call me a lemming?  lemming my foot... I'm doing something that  I  want to do b/c  I  want to do it.
