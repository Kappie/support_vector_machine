Don't have to look at him and make myself sad!  2) He isn't there walking there! No more depressing reminders on the way to class! No more watching him restrain himself from groping other girls when directly in front of me! 3) He isn't there walking away! Even fewer depressing reminders on the way home!  4) Don't have to listen to his retarded comments and convince myself that they are indeed stupid! Or remember when I thought they were funny!  5) Don't have to watch him humping anyone's leg outside the classroom! (this is, of course, a crude and metaphorical denotation of what actually takes place, but the sight is nonetheless both disgusting AND heartbreaking!) 6) Don't have to talk to him when he thinks it's appropriate to discuss dates we went on! Don't have to listen to him bugging me about whether or not we went to this or that movie! Don't have to listen to other kid snickering at me bc he's so insensitive about it!  7) While i'm at it, I don't have to talk to him, period! No more acting like seeing his face doesn't rip my heart up in new ways and put me off food for several hours! No more polite ceremonial conversations!   I AM FREE.... or at least freer than I was last semester. He's still in band, which is where he acts  more like an ass than any other class, but at least i'm free of him for one more hour every day.
