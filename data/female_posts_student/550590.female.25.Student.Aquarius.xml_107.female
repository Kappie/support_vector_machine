I'm kind of excited, and I think I'll be more excited once I stop stressing out about everything I still have to do between now and then.  I'm especially excited that over the next 2 weeks I'll get to see Ryan, Avi, Jodi, Matt,  urlLink Elyse , Andrew, urlLink  Kimmie ,  urlLink Thomas , and tons of relatives and friends I haven't seen in  years .  I'm not sure how much I'll get to post while I'm away but there will definitely be pictures galore once I get back!
