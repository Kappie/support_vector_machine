I want you I want to be with you.. forever  See, even I can write sappy love songs...  Haha. To bad I stole the title from someone else. Haha.  Alrighty.  I can't decide what to do with my summer.  So, I was making my Officail SUMMER CALENDER. And I only have 3 open weeks my whole summer.. and one (or at least part of that one) is being taken up by Mandy. Hmm..  What to do.  Because I want to be  on summer leadership with church but I also want to work at Royal Ridges..and I can't possibly do both.  Hmm... I htink I will probably be a counselor at RR, thats what it seems like God wants me to do...  but then today at church Scott said that he wants me to apply to be in Summer Servants...then I would do like everything all summer with the church. Which seems fun and I really want to but I just don't know what to do... Ladedadedo.
