And the best news of all?  He's LEGITIMATE!!!  It's the first legitimate baby we've had in 12 years.  The last one was Whitney.  Everyone else (there have been 9 since her) were either adopted or were illegitimate.  How redneck is that for you? Oh well, I'm excited, and he was named for my daddy (Wayne is my daddy's middle name too), so as to continue with tradition (every second male child in the family is named after my daddy.)  Anyway, I gotta go.  I'll tell you more later.
