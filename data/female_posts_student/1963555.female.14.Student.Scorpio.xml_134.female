They add so much to the "experience" there are many classic moments that stick out.  *Sitting with Dillan, the stoner- Tiffany and Sam *Rent-a-senior Day, half the guy population in dresses *All the really big, tall, hot guys singing in the halls  I'm gonna leave the rest to memory. So today, I talked to Dacia. She said to prove I'm her best friend, When I get the new Taking Back Sunday cd in Florida, I can't open it until I see her.  Oh didn't I tell you, I'm going to Florida on Vacation, It will be cool, I'm going for like a month. I'm gonna miss my mom and dad, and sister, and Dacia. I'm especially depressed I won't be able to listen to the TBS cd. This sucks! Mabey I can talk her into another thing like, I'm not alowed to sleep, or eat or somthing! I can't live with out TBS! Ugh... oh well there goes the drama queen in me...
