It usually takes us by surprise and seems to strike where we are most vulnerable. To us it often appears completely senseless and irrational, but to God none of it is either senseless or irrational. He has a purpose in every pain He brings or allows in our lives. We can be sure that in some way He intends it for our profit and His glory." -Jerry Bridges   "I am His by purchase and I am His by conquest; I am His by donation and I am His by election; I am His by covenant and I am His by marriage; I am wholly His; I am peculiarly His; I am universally His; I am eternally His. Once I was a slave but now I am a son; once I was dead but now I am alive; once I was darkness but now I am light in the Lord; once I was a child of wrath, an heir of hell, but now I am an heir of heaven; once I was Satan's bond-servant but now I am God's freeman; once I was under the spirit of bondage but now I am under the Spirit of adoption that seals up to me the remission of my sins, the justification of my person and the salvation of my soul." -Thomas Brooks   "The implications of the name "Immanuel" are both comforting and unsettling. Comforting, because He has come to share the danger as well as the drudgery of our everyday lives. He desires to weep with us and to wipe away our tears. And what seems most bizarre, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, longs to share in and to be the source of the laughter and the joy we all too rarely know." -Michael Card   "The army of Israel looked at Goliath through the eyes of man and said he's too big to beat. David looked at him through the eyes of God and said he's too big to miss." -Wally Carter   "When God saw that many men were lazy, and gave themselves only with difficulty to spiritual reading, He wished to make it easy for them, and added the melody to the words, that all being rejoiced by the charm of the music, should sing hymns to Him with gladness." -John Chrysostom   "Never before has the world been so desperately asking for answers to crucial questions, and never before has the world been so frantically committed to the idea that no answers are possible." -Edmund Clowney   "It is as if God the Father is saying to us: 'Since I have told you everything in My Word, Who is My Son, I have no other words that can at present say anything or reveal anything to you beyond this. Fix your eyes on Him alone, for in Him I have told you all, revealed all, and in Him you will find more than you desire or ask. If you fix your eyes on Him, you will find everything, for He is My whole word and My reply, He is My whole vision and My whole revelation.'" -Anthony M. Coniaris   "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."  -Jesus (Matt. 6:25-34)  I like the way The Message puts verses 30-36 of Matthew 6: "If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers--most of which are never even seen--don't you think he'll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you? What I'm trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with getting, so you can respond to God's giving. People who don't know God and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met. Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes."  ~  Whoever you are, wherever you are, as you're reading this take a second to pray for any unsaved friends you have. In youth group we have that board of names of people we're praying for, but I think sometimes it is all too easy to write down a name and then forget to pray for them. I know I'm guilty of it, at least. So right now, let your heart break over the same thing that breaks God's heart - ask Him to draw the hearts of our unsaved friends to Him. Ask for them to have a desire to seek after Him, and ask Him to let His light shine through you. I know that I want to be Jesus to the world, and what better way to start than with your friends? I think that sometimes we forget that yeah, we're going to die someday, and not everyone is going to heaven. Just because our face to face meeting with Jesus seems far away doesn't mean that we can ever ever ever EVER give up praying for our friends who don't know Christ. It is so important to be steadfast in our prayers, because prayer does make a difference. You may never know what kind of an impact you're having. That also applies to sharing the Gospel and standing for what you believe every opportunity that you get... you never know who's listening, and you never know what kind of seeds you might be planting in the hearts and minds of those who are. Just... always, always remember: your prayers do NOT go unnoticed. Patience is everything - God's timing is not the same as ours. Wait on him, because he's not going anywhere.  Matthew 9:37-38 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."   Matthew 21:22 "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."   Romans 12:11-12 "Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer."  Philippians 4:6 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."  1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 "Be joyful always;  pray continually;  give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."
