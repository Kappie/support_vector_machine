I spent the night at Missy's the night before it, and Missy's brother Dusty spent the night at John's the night before, so John and Dusty rode their bikes to Missy's in the morning and john and I then walked to my sisters and she took us out to lunch at Chili's and then back to my house so I could change and then we went to the movies and saw "White Chicks" It was Hilarous!!!!!! John and I had such a great time. things just felt so right and we were happy and together, and even though through out the day we had argued. *the day didnt start out too well, but I dont want to get into that* Anyways, Our anniversary was great and we're great and I couldnt be happier!!!  I LOVE JOHNNY JAMES MCGRATH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Gotta go. Love ya'll!!!!!!  ***Happiness, comes to those who wait***
