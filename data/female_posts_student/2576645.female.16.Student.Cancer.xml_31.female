St. Patricks Day over-commercialized?  St. Valentine's Day?  Yes.  Halloween?  Yes.  Christmas?  Hell yes.  But Good 'ole St. Patty's Day?  Nah.   I have concluded that this particular day is not over-commercialized because of one thing:  There is no 'St. Patty's Day Sale' at ArtVan.  ArtVan has a 'Presidents Day Sale', 'Easter Sale', '23rd Anniversary Sale' (23 years? Big whoop...), AND a 'Low Interest, Low Payment, No Icome Tax until the Year 2078' Sale....but dear Pat is just left out in the cold.  You can determined how over-commercialized a certain holiday is just by watching the ArtVan commercials. For example: Christmas is the most overexposed holiday, concluding that ArtVan's commercials for their 'Holiday Season (....by saying Christmas would be politically incorrect..) Sale' seems like it sarts to air in October.  Anyways.... I must journey forth and do my English homework.  TTTTAAAAALLLYYY HHHOOOOO!
