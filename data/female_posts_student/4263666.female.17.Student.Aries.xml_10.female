I used it for research, catching up with friends and screwing around. But never once would I be the type to put myself out for the world to see. I like being me and being without judgement.  I'm sitting with my back to a re-run of Sex and the City. My mind is in a wondering state at the moment. I'm beginning to think that I'll never get to where i want to be. It's weird. I have realized that for most people, life is an everyday struggle. I dont want my llife to be like that. Sure, I expect sadness and tragedy because heaven knows i'm not immune to it. But I want to be happy. And i feel like the only way I can be is if I live this house and this town and be on my own. It wont be forever or anytime soo for that matter. But I dont want to be fifty years old and have regrets about not following my dreams. Seems a little dramatic, i know. But i look around at the adults in my life and most are not happy with the lives they have created. I never, ever wnat to be like that.  -j
