I don't even know where to begin, hopefully the developed pictures(hopeully by next week) will tell the story better than me.  It didn't even matter what medals I recieved or certificates I was awarded. The greatest honor was getting JT's old congress notebook. . .god, I'm going to miss that kid.   This years end was emotion incurring enough- I can't even imagine how bad it will be next year.
