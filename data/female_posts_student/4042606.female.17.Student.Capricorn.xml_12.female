We were walking down Church St. when we see these people, and Jackie turns and says to me "Why don't we just give them a dollar?" At first I thought that, those kids must be pretty poor to be playing a cardboard violin on church street, when while Jackie is tossing the money in, I catch a glimpse of the kids mother. It was like she was Steve Urkel's white cousin.  Jackie tossed the dollar in and started to stand back up when the Hitler lady gave Jackie the look like the money was an insult. It probably didn't help that she was wearing my "I don't drink water, fish fuck in it" t-shirt at the time either. So, Jackie decides to toss in a 10, luckly I was there to stop her and we were able to continue on our way to Pac-Sun.  The mom probably was pulling some hustling gig on her kids... Clearly humanity is in trouble.
