It's like that Billy Joel song... it's either sadness or euphoria... actually that may be too pessimistic. I'm okay, really I am. But anyways I just got a replacement CD for the Billy Joel Greatest Hits I lost, and now I'm all happy. And a cool stipey hat with earflaps and pink pom poms. What could be happier than that? Hm... actually one may recall Catcher in the Rye... shit. Minus the pink pom poms. Hehe.  Blarg and then there's the Jason Mraz concert on Thursday, and I need to scrounge up bus fair (think I'm gonna drive myself and get lost in Seattle??? Just driving in those crazy streets are enough) so I can still buy a t-shirt and what-not... But anyway, it was a half day today, I had sushi with my sister and walked around in Target (cds!!!) and got hit on by strange man at the camera stand. *Shudder*. Well, there's no school tomorrow, that means I have to fight (for my right to paarrrtay) to get someone to sleep over tonight. Even though I got about 3 hours of sleep last night. Eh. I love days like today, cloudy rainy wonderful. I know I always say that I when I go off to college in the scarily close future, I want to leave, spend my college days in sunny California, or anywhere else. But I would miss days like this, Seattle days.  My old Nintendo system is calling me.... you know, I've never found any games on any of these new fancy systems as great as they made them for Super Nintendo. And I can still kick all ya'll asses on Mario Kart. (Hahaha, Zack, you thought you could beat me, but you were sorely mistaken!) Guys always think they can beat me at video games. Looks can be decieving. I may play the girly card but that doesn't mean that I didn't sell my soul to Super Mario when I was 5. Mwahahaha.  Wow talk about stream of conciousness. Hope that all made sense. I'm gonna sit by the phone and play Mario All Stars. Call me. IM me. Anything.  Lyrics of the Day:  Well they say there's a heaven for those who will wait Some say it's better but I say it ain't I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints Sinners are much more fun... Only the Good Die Young -Billy Joel
