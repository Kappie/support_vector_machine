It seems as though the month of May were a blur... Essentially, all that actually took place was, indeed, a blur.   A blur, you ask? No, I mean not massive listening of the music of the favourite band, I only mean a Blur.   I'm not sure this month should have even happened, save for the fact that the end of the school year created a solid mezzanine to stand upon as opposed to a desperate spiral moving in reverse from what I'd like it to.   Hmm... how about that?
