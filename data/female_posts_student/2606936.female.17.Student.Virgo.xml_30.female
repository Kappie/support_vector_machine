Hoping for someone across the world to read it and smile.  And leave a comment.  there are a few types out there. There are those really fabulously talented people who made it popular (see  tequila mockingbird, bellow , and  indiscretions ) and get read over and over daily. there are the ones who write down everything they had to eat and how many times their children pooped that day. there are the ones who use it as a place to post inside jokes and talk to their friends in asian baby slang ("it ish now jowk! I em not keedin, peepul reelee tock like dish online! azn_prYde for everyone!).... and then there are ppl like me, who aspire to be blog geniuses and so must refrain from ranting about food or whatever, unless it's interesting (to normal people).   and.... i had a point.... oh yes.  so. What got me here was how Julia of  TM  hasn't posted in a few days and is driving us all nuts. I was thinking, "what, did she die or something?"  and then i thought, "Oh. what if she DID die?"  What if someone who blogged a lot and was part of a big blog community died in an accident? I mean, none of their friends or family would know how to get into the blog and tell people they were dead. They probably wouldn't even know it existed, due to this whole anonymity thing. How weird would that be? Can't you just see the comments piling up and up....  and then what if one of their actual tangible peeps found it online, and read thru all of it?  It's kind of a theoretical reality check. Like, the internet can only go so far in connecting people. Ya know?
