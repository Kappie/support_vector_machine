I made honors!!!!  I think I am gonna jump up and down now.  LOL!  I worked so hard, I derserve it but I am still worried about if I can still make honors at the end of the entire semester.  I found out my math quiz mark and it was actually kind of bad and well I felt bad at the time and well felt like crying but I didn't thankful and well when I was going through the quiz with her she decided she was actually marking kind of high and gave me a higher mark so I felt a little bit better about that.  I was kinda scared about what I got on the chem test but I got a 61%.  I guess that isn't like amazing but I DID EVERYTHING I could to get that.  I was thinking of maybe to re-write it but I mean I did my very BEST on it to begin with and what I did on that test is my very best.  I hate to think of 61% being my best but only I know how much effort and time went into preparing for that test.  At least I didn't fail cause I know lots of people that did and well I was kind of scared about it cause I failed the two quizzes from that unit.  Hopefully it won't affect my average too much and well I have to keep in mind that there are other quizzes, other tests...more marks that go in for both Chem and Math.  Oh and well I think next term I am going to drop Physics.  The thought of taking physics keeps haunting me and if it is anything like Chem then I don't think I can deal with that.  I want to take Active Living 20 instead because that is what I origionally wanted to take but I did not have to room to fit it into the schedule.  I think I want to do that and I am almost positively certain at this point.  I felt pressure before cause my parents kept wanted me to do Physics and now my mom said "Do what you want" and well I want is to do Active Living.  Yesterday I wateched the game.  YEAH EDMONTON!!  Yeah they won!!  And well I went shopping earlier and got some new jeans and this new sweater and some bras [yeah girls need those] and well I bought my dress for winter Eve.  I looked everywhere but then I walked into this one store and looked at this dress on the manican and I said "That's the one"  It instand captured my attention and when I put it on I don't think I have EVER and I mean EVER looked so damn hot in my life.  All the guys are gonna think I am hot on Winters Eve lol....and the guy I go with man will he be in for a surprise.  I can't wait for that dance!!!  I think I am also gonna get my hair done professionally this year cause last year it didn't turn out the way I wanted it..so yeah.
