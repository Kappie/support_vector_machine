If you can keep secrets, then I'll tell you mine. Remember a promise you couldn't hold on to. Though it brings me to tears now, I need you to know. Look in my eyes boy. Nothing like yours now. It seems like a lifetime is passing us by. So open your eyes.  This is forever but it won't last long. This is a memory that fades away in neverending. In the death of all that's long been said and done before, we'll wish that you were something more.  Stop wasting time boy. You're late all your life boy. They won't have the patience for someone like you. Your memory's fading. I'll love you forever. I'll try to remember. I'll try to hold on. You're standing alone boy. Waitng for dreams boy. Waiting for someone to make them come true. Don't ever leave boy. I'd miss you too much boy. I'll never forget you, as long as I'm here.  ...I'm becoming addicted to this song.  http://nothingandnowhere.com/flash3.html
