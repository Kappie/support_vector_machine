NO 3 OR 6 YEAR OLDS!!!   tuesday was another wondering around day.  wednesday we pulled into montego bay, jamaica. this is where it gets fun. we took lik a 30 min. ride to chukka blue and we waited around a lil bit. then we got onto the horse we were gonna ride. we rode for about 45 min. until we came to the beach and then we rode bareback into the ocean! it was really cool but then one of the horses shit in the water and my mom got all pissed. but I  had a good time.  thursday was grand caymen. we shopped around until about 10:30 and then we got on a bus to this resort thingy. then we boarded this boat and rode for haf an hour to stingray city. you might have already gessed-we swam with stingrays! some people are scared but stingrays are soo cool and so huge! so anyway that was fun and i think it was my favorite island.  and then came friday. that was cozumel, mexico. we didnt have much time to do anything else so we went straight to the meeting place.thats where they gave us tickets and lil bracelets for chankanaab national park. when we got there (it took about five min.) the tour guide showed us around the park and then took us onto the beach. here is where we got lockers cuz we cant take our stuff in the water to swim with......dolphins!! it was awesome! i mean i have done it before but it doesnt get old like other stuff.  so then it was that night that lauren showed how dull she is. mark, christy, and me were going to see meet the parents in the arcade and we invited lauren...because we had to. but of couse she didnt go because she just wasnt quite boring enough! ok so we had fun at the movie but mom and bobby were stuck with lauren.. and she was bored and didnt want to come to the movie cuz she said we didnt invite her (BS).  and so she was a little freak who should have bin shot! at least if i had to put up with her so much i would have wanted to.  so that was all the fun stuff we did really i mean, sunday night we all played ping pong (well i didnt do so well) but at least we tried to play ping pong and that was pretty much all the good times on the ship and thats as detailed as i get so if u didnt think i did a good job                   ::.BITE ME.::
