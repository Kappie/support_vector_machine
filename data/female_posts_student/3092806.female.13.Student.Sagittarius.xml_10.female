My head is stillspinning even though we left the park almost exactly three hours ago. I feel like I'm still on one of those roller coasters, dropping to my doom. The amusement park was wicked, the after effects, though, I'm not too crazy about. Before we arrived at the amusement park, things were pretty bad too though. I almost died of sleep deprivation. I couldn't even lay my head down because Sarah was talking to me a mile a minute and I felt that it would be really rude to close my eyes while she was speaking.   Anyways, let's skip ahead to the actual time spentat the theme park. We left home at around 9ish and arrived there a little before 11. When we got there we bought our tickets and all, got inside, grabbed maps, and headed to the nearest attraction, The Boomerang. The Boomerang, in case you couldn't guess, is a roller coaster. Okay, it brings you up at least a hundred and twenty feet in the air, drops you, you go through a corkscrew, then a loop, and then you do it all over again, BACKWARDS.I was terrified out of my mind. I mean, Inearly fell off Space Mountain when I was six years old and that wasn't even all that bad. How could I survive a roller coaster that was definitely at least three times as bad as Space Mountain? Ihonestly don't know why whenever they asked meif I still wanted to go I on I said yes. Imust havebeen crazy. Or perhaps I wanted to face a fear or experience something new or whatever...Anyhow, I sat next Sarah. Just before they dropped us I thought my heart hadstopped. All of my fears just came together. I suddenly wished I was watching them ride it without me. Well, those thoughts quickly left me half a second later when they dropped us. To tell the truth that first drop was totally AWESOME! I loved it. It felt so good. I didn't like it all that much with the corkscrew or when we did the ride again backwards but other then that it was great. It felt really good to overcome my fear of roller coasters.   Everything else there was pretty fun to do too. My favorite ride was definitely the mystery ride. It's a lot of fun. See, it's like a scramble ride, if you know what that is. Well, it's a bit different then a regular scramble ride, actually. The entire ride is in this large, green dome. In the dome, they have some dim lights on when you enter. Well, you all get in to the cars (2 people per car) and they start spinning you. They play heavy metal music throughout the entire ride which is a lot of fun to scream and head bang with. After a little while it sort of gets boring. I mean, you're going really fast and you're almost smashing into other cars and the walls but it's nothing seriously fun. At about that time, the lights go out. You start spinning faster and faster in the dark. It's getting kind of creepy but yet exhilarating. Suddenly, these bright strobe lights turn on and off. It makes everything go hazy and you start to get dizzy. Then the strobe lights disappear and everything does dim. A red search light (it looks like one from a light house except red colored) turns on. It flashes across the room. Then these really weird pictures on the walls light upThe light and the pictures stay illuminated for a while before going out. You're left in the dark again. Slowly, the ride comes to a stop and the rides over with. This was my favorite ride out of the entire park. It was positively thrilling!   The only annoying thing about this adventure was the fact that everyone always wanted to stop to get food. All I wanted to do was explore the park more. It really slowed our time down. We didn't even get to explore Splash Water Kingdom which totally sucks 'cause it was getting very hot out and I really didn't feel like fainting because of the heat. I guess it's a good thing that they made me eat 'cause I probably wouldn't have ate anything at all if it had been up to me.   Sarah, won a gigantic Care Bear from an arcade game. I am totally jealous because the Care Bear was my favorite, Wish Bear. Ugh, guess what, she named him? JEFF! Jeff? Poor thing, it was renamed... I tried to win one but seeing as how I've never won anything in my entire life, I failed miserably.   My least favorite ride that we went on would either be the roller coaster, The Comet, that bobsled roller coaster one,or that stupid swinging ship. I hated the Comet just because it was just so damn rickety. It wasn't a bad ride I'll admit though. The bobsled roller coaster justhurt a lot. Each time it shifted or locked into place, it hurt you. That was definitely the most painful ride I went on.The swinging ship ride wasokay thefirst time I went onit but after a second time I instantly hated it. It made me feel way nauseous and jittery. I didn't like swingingback andforth, it made my stomach twist andturn into these horrible knots.   Besides the rides in Splash Water Kingdom, I wanted to go on two other rides that we didn't get the chance to ride on. One was the Merry-Go-Round and the other The Rainbow. The Rainbow looked cool. It was like the swinging ship but instead of just swinging you back and forth, it brought you all the way around... Anyhow, it sounds stupid but I really, really wanted to go on the Merry-Go-Round. I've never been on one before, at least I don't believe so, and it just looks fantastic. I like the veryunique, sculptedponies, horses, donkeys, mules, etc... I'm "too old" for the ride now though which completely sucks if you ask me. I wish I wasn't...   Well, that's all the main highlights and low points of my adventure to the theme park that I can think of right now. If I remember something significant, I'll write it in sometime later.   Austa!
