Pouring over photographs, I'm living in your letters. Breathe deeply from this envelope - it smells like you and I can't be without that scent, it's filling me with all you mean to me Continually failing these trials but you stand by me nonetheless and you won't let me sink, though I'm begging you. I don't ever tell you this distance seems terrible. There is no need to test my heart with useless space. These roads go on forever...  There'll always be a place for you in my heart. So I'll hit the pavement, it's gotta be better than waiting and pushing you far away cause I'm scared. So I'll take my chances and head on my way up there, cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten." -Dashboard Confessional, "Living in Your Letters"  "I'm dying to know do you do you like dreaming of things so impossible or only the practical, or ever the wild? or waiting through all your bad bad days just to end them with someone you care about? and do you like making out, and long drives and brown eyes and guys that just don't quite fit in yeah do you like them...? So yes, I'll see you there." -Dashboard Confessional, "So Impossible"  "Sooner or later this cold It's gonna break and our hands will be warm again But all I want is not to need you now And sooner or later this cold It's gonna break and our words will be heard again But all I want are vows of silence now." -Dashboard Confessional, "Turpentine Chaser"  "I'm starting to fashion an idea in my head where I would impress you with every single word I said. I'd come out insightful, or brave or smooth or charming, and you'd wanna call me, and I would be there every time you need me, I'd be there every time. But for now I'll look so longingly, waiting for you to want me, for you to need me, for you to notice me."
