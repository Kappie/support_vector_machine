Slightly new news is that I think I'm gonna apply for a cleaning job @ skl, on the basis that if it all becomes too much I can jack it in, for I am of a delicate disposition obv! Also, as weekends and hols r tr√©s tricky for me, this is better + cash would come in v.handy for uni stuff/driving. Also the fact that sponging off my Mum feels crap and I hate it! lol. It's also ok coz fun fun work can be done Sats and Suns and Mummikins leaves skl at 6ish neways! Wahay! Let's see if I get a job first tho... I'm sure u can't wait to find out! Ooh it's just like Eastenders! dum. dum. dum-dum-dum-dum (cliffhanger music u fools! lol) xx
