I'm not sure why, but it makes me think of my grandma's white flower cap she used to wear when I went swimming with her when I was a little girl. She was a PE teacher, and she taught me how to swim, and I learned all my strokes from her too. She was my special grandma, and because of that, I have a deep affinity for all things grandmotherly, and I feel the need to own that swim cap, even though I rarely go swimming and not really much at all this summer, so far.
