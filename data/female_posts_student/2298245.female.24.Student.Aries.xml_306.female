This is the normal insanity brought on by stress beyond all imagining.  This I can understand.  Hell, I can even empathize with it.  There is much ranting going on below this point.  If you are not interested, please stop now.  If you do start reading though, please read to the end, otherwise it wouldn't be fair to the point I am trying to make.  No, I'm talking about that thing about law school that turns people, no matter their age or maturity, into 8th grade girls.  Or perhaps law school just attracts people who are prone to petty and childish gossip.  Either way, it's annoying as all get out.  Everyone talks about everyone else, as if there is nothing else worth discussing in the entire world.  People form cliques that are impossible to penetrate.  And then there is the competition.  A lot of people in law school seems to think they deserve much more than they actually get.  It's always the same with the complaining.  I can understand a healthy dose of complaining - we all suffer from life's disappointments, and things do not always turn out the way we have expected they would, and all of us like to get those things off our chests by moaning about them to our friends, or anyone else who will listen.  But if you are complaining in anything but a joking manner about anything months after the time has passed, then there is a serious problem.  I'm sick of hearing that you should have gotten an A in X's class, you should have gotten the job that Y got, or that you should have made law review.  And while I'm (tangentially) on the subject, I've noticed that everyone in law school seems to be getting really good grades, by the sound of self important tones in people's voices - "I'm doing so well."  Considering there is a curve, this strikes me as darn near impossible.  Very few people are honest about this.  And I'm not saying that if you are pulling straight Cs you should announce it to everyone.  But don't talk like you're making As.  Perhaps people all have different definitions of what doing well is, though, so perhaps I'll let this slide.  Though when you add the haughty tone, it makes it sound different - like not only you are proud of how well you are doing, but that everyone else should be too.  Again, perhaps this is a matter of perspective.    But it isn't even the hardcore competition that you hear about.  Probably because it's St. John's.  But I'd prefer that - at least it is out in the open, so you can be prepared, so you know who to avoid.  It all becomes clear so fast that way.  I've been stabbed by the cutthroat forces only once while I've been here, and that was a complete and total shock to me, and it still isn't even widely known, because the news of it came out of left field to me.  Stop with all the pretending already.  If you want to backstab your way to the top, fine.  I'm told that is often the best way to go, and at the very least, Iif you are willing to sacrifice your self-respect, it is at least as good a way as any other.  But at least try and be semi-honest about it.  I'd certainly respect you a lot more if you cut out all the two-faced crap.  Sorry.  I've been wanting to get that off my chest for a while.  Perhaps this is not the best place to do it, but what the heck.  I'm fed up with the way some of the students act here, sick of the feelings of entitlement that permeate a good portion of the student body.  I'm sick of the way everyone always knows everyone else's business, and more, most people think that they are entitled to know everyone else's business.  That said, most students here are not like this.  Or at least not most of the ones I know well enough to know.  This is an albeit small category of students, but I can imagine and tell that there are other normal, laid back individuals out there, who have the normal law school stresses but aren't complete and total nutcases like the rest of the student body.  For all I know, it may even be a small minority.  But it seems larger, perhaps because it is so vocal, because it constantly needs attention and devotion, because it alerts you to it's presence at every possible moment.
