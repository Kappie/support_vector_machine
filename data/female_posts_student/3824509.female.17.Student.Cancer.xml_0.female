So even as we speak I am buried in furniture, plastic, and nails all to get to the wonderful computer. Fun stuff let me tell ya! i also discovered I have an amazing ablity to sleep through people putting a roof on. Personally I think that is amazing. You know I wouldn't have slept that late but I have had issues going to sleep. I didn't fall asleep till like 5 am. Maybe something is wrong with me. Speaking of having something wrong with me I had to get a MRI today of that was fun.....NOT, that thing scaried the crap out of me. I know feel really sick. Think it is all the radiation? lol But there is a good point today! I just found out I get to go to a Hilary Duff concert. I know people don't like her but thats ok. Since she is my twin *hehe* I have to see her! lol Ya I know I am a dork. But that is just me love it or leave it!
