She would just laugh and tell me I need to get a life because my confessions are nowhere near as good as hers are.      So I will take this time to tell no one a little bit about what is going on in MY life right now. Pertinent Stats: ~Finished Brave New World today. Now I just have to read Brave New World: Revisited and Portrait of a Lady in the next 20 days or so. No sweat.   ~Still working at ALCO. Gotta love it.   ~Got hit on by the guy making my sandwich at Subway yesterday. The SECOND time that has happened! Different guys, different stores, but both were making my sandwich at Subway! Maybe I should go there more often...Nothing can be as bad as the freak at the library (who later showed up to hit on Tiffany when we were in Hastings; THAT was beyond weird)   ~Still in love (from afar) with "Eddie" (I can't put his real name on here because I have this blog address as my MSN name, and three people on my MSN know this guy. Unfortunately, I don't have  his  MSN :( )   ~MacGyver is hot.   ~Seriously.   ~I am seriously considering having my hair straightened. What do you think? *dead silence* Right.
