I think that at the moment I am 'greatly interested'. I am confident that I will soon pass greatly interested, zoom through 'incredibly interested', hop past 'looking forward to with happiness', and arrive safely at excited with in the hour.      I am concerened about the scary factor though. I really am scared that I will scream or make a fool out of myself in some other fashion in front of my friends. However if I do I will pretend it wasn't me, ignore them for the rest of the night then purge my brain of the memory.    -Driel
