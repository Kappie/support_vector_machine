I also realized that I am a workaholic, since I considered “oversleeping” to be getting up at 6:15 and getting to the office after 7.  Very bad.  Apparently, my alarm sounded at 5, as planned, but I turned it off instead of waking up.  At 6, I rolled over and looked out the window to notice that it was light outside.  This meant one of two things:  North Korea had figured out how to activate its uranium rods and had blown up Crawford, or that I had slept past dawn, which would make me late.  It was the second option, so I rushed around without time to remove the “water-based” paint that Sabrina swore would wash out of my hair easily.  It has not washed out, but it has worn off to the point that instead of paint, it just looks like head lice.    Rico, as a punishment to his owners for not being home 24 hours a day to accommodate his manic/depressive whims, had scattered everything on the “keys and bills” shelf across the living room.  My glasses also live on this shelf, so after I felt around on the floor long enough to find them, I gave Rico a loving goodbye punt on my way out the door.    As I walked to the driveway, I felt something cold and slimy running down my arm.  Paco’s tacos, which Sabrina left in my refrigerator (two-day rule; I ate them for lunch), were leaking grease on my blouse.  As if those damn quesadillas hadn’t taken up enough of my life while we were waiting 1.5 hours for them at George’s, now they were making me even later than I already was.  I finally made it here, before 8 but in my mind very late.  Luckily, I’ve been fairly busy all day, which will hopefully take my mind off of the fact that I’ll be here until 6.   Informal poll:  how many of you knew what a fluff girl was when you were 19?
