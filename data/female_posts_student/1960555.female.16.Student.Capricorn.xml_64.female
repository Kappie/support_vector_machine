We'll, it could always be better, but none the less, I'm good.  Coke and cookies.  Not quite the conventional after school snack that it used to be, but what ever.  Would someone please explain the point of Stripperella to me.  Is she not a cartoon, thus making any fantasy you might have about her completly wrong and creepy??  Mmm, Cheezy Domino's Dots, that would be really good right now.  I must say, Shane is improving at this whole drumming thing... he's not half assed anymore.  And woot for Maimes being able to play Ode to Joy!  And I'm gunna go now........ -glare.... scowl...-
