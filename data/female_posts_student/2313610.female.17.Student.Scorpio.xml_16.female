Funny I would write one of my more... I guess you could say depressing entries so soon after my great achievement of peak pinnacle happiness. What goes up must go down.   Now, to actually explain my quote. It isn't good for man to be alone. The scribe who wrote that was very correct. It isn't. It's not good for woman to be alone either. I've been alone for over a year now, and when I had a taste of what I had been missing, it only made the pain of loneliness more acute.  It was truly my own fault. The fact that I thought I was different from other girls and could handle casual contact. I couldn't. I got caught up in the moment, and I became stupid.  I doubt it'll happen again.   Faylinn out.
