Today I was at the grocery store on my lunch break, picking up a box for a mid afternoon smackerel of something, when I saw this putrid, little beast clad in sweatpants swipe a box off of the shelf in front of me and belch forth the following disgusting phrase (I've sounded this out phonetically to help you get the gist of this mongoloid):  "Mommy, can we get these Pet It Ecoli cookies?"   First of all, its more like "peh-tee eh-cole-yay", but thats neither here nor there.  Had this scourge to humanity acutally read the package between her chubby fingers, she would have seen that here in America, its clearly translated in english underneath to read "The Little School Boy".    So before you go thrusting these delicious chocolate works of art down your gullet, I want an honest answer:  Are you going to eat the entire cookie?  Or are you gonna be a fatty-in-training, like momma and pick off only the chocolate and discard the sumptuous, buttery biscuit beneath?    Bleh!  Die!  Those cookies should have been mine, fatty.
