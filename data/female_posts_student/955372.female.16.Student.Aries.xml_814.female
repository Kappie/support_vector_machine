Last night my sister comes into my room and is like "I'm scared I can't sleep, I had a bad dream" I'm like "alright whatever." so i put a couple blankets on the floor and gave her a pillow. THEN i remembered that she can't sleep with the light off. Which meant I had to wait for her to sleep until I could turn the light off and go to sleep myself. I was up till three. Then I woke up at 10, couldn't get to sleep again so i came downstairs. I noticed a note my mother had left me before she went to work instructing me to take my sister on a walk around media so she can find things on her stupid scavanger hunt she has to do for school. so not fucking up for that. Worst morning in a while. goddamn you FAMILY.
