For example, from looking at the responses of certain genes to promoters, one could infer the hair color and eye color of the person. Skin color cannot determined since people do tan and change easily.  Unfortunately, I lack the basic knowledge to understand the scientific diagrams of the pigmentation cells so that was pointless. Poopy.  Here's the one thing I learned today: there are 4 kinds of albinism so one can't say a person is an albino because they look light. To truly know, one must look up the family background of the person and determine the difference.  Point that I think I understood and found was new: red hair and hazel eyes could be signs of albinism... I think (I reiterate).
