After that our family and the Pulliam's went to the Edward's lake! First we went tubing. Anna and I did it at the same time and it was really fun! :) Then David and Anna tried to go water-skiing, and now that I'm home I wish I would have, cause I think I would have done better then I thought I would. Anyway it was fun, but today my arms and back hurt! :)
