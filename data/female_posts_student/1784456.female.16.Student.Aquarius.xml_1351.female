Found the funniest game in the whole world!  urlLink http://www.wedu.com/sledrun/tobogganrun.php  Toboggan jump! Yeah! Just the kind of stuff we need, being near test time and all. It's so fun! Oh, I'm reading MARS at the moment, just incase you were wondering. (I've gone mad!)  urlLink http://www.fetchfido.co.uk/games/menu/games_menu.htm  That place has some of the weirdest games! WOW! A flea circus!
