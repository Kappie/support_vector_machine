Never look at what you have lost."   what does this quote mean exactly? to never take advantage of what we got? cause i mean, face it guys..no matter how bad it is, it could be worse. and there are always things in life that keep you going...love/friendship, right? i mean, honestly, i couldn't live without my friends. today we did speeches about life lessons we learned. many of the lessons were to not take advantage of what you have, because it could be gone in a blink. this made me think a lot. if i could, i would go to everyone i love and care about and say it to them. ha, but that would be weird. but for the record, i really love all my friends.   Emily- you dont know how much you keep me going. our daily chats on MSN, to our weekly hangouts of pure talking. you give me the best advice...you're happy for me when things are good, you are sad with me when things are bad. you lift my spirits high and give me hope that things will be better. you compliment me when im down, as well as you try to make me laugh. we can be soo serious with eachother which is really good, but we can be stupid freaks, like in my basement. haha good times. i wanted to let you know i love you for that.  Zoe- lol we're like sisters we're so close. we could talk about anything without feeling embarassed. thanks for all the times you've helped me when i felt like giving up, and thanks for the 2 hour talks on the phone. thanks for all the gossiping moments lol and letting my spill my feelings. thanks for being there for me regularly, thanks for caring. i love you!!  Katie- you're my sister, friend and cousin all at once. you're always soo happy for me when things go good. i have so much fun with you, you never let me be sad. you'll just be your goofy self and make me laugh because you're stupid :o). haha jokes! you write me notes to see how im doing, and you're always there. you're again sad when im sad and happy when im happy. we feel eachothers emotions. although sometimes i may seem like your mother more than your cousin, you know i love with every inch of my heart and i always will!  Shauna- i know sometimes we dont get along, but sometimes (most of the time) we are just so close and have so much fun together. we laugh until we feel like we have abs of steel, and on the occassion we pee we laugh soo hard! lol but we have so much in common. we're both stubborn, which most of the time ignites our arguements. but i think we learn from them, even if they are stupid most of the time. im glad we met and become close over the summer! i love you!!  Sarah- we've known eachother for a long time. we can go from talking seriously to just being hyper and stupid and having a fun time. i think we've learned a lot from eachother from our thoughts and opinions because we both know we have lots of those. at times we can be completely oposite, but that may have even brought us closer. you care so much about problems i may have and you are always willing to listen. i thank you for that...i love you tons!    anyone else i didnt mention, i love you too!!!
