"Beaner" -Phillip "The White Boy"  ~lol hahaha he calls himself the white boy because...he is. The only one in the school.   Hey Katie, guess what? Orlando Bloom is the hottest!!! :) Well, hope you had a great year and maybe I'll see you in AHS :) Take care, never change." -   ~Mandy's cool, she has an unhealthy obsession with Mr. Bloom. ^ ^  "Curse you! Curse you as long as you live. Curse you until the end of the world. Curseyoucurseyoucurseyou CURSE....you're lucky I'm tired now. Have a good summer." -Hunter Huang  ~Insider joke but still very funny.  "Hey Kate, You are a strange person, but in a good way. Have a good summer have fun and don't do anything I wouldn't do." -Brain Mejia  ~Omgomgomgomgogmogmogmogmg ....wait? Don't do anything he won't do? Very short list.  "Hey Katie I'm gonna miss you and Squirrel Man." -James a.k.a. Lil Buddy.  ~Squirrel Man knows all!!!!!!!  "Hola Katie, have a good summer and keep up with the guys. P.S. U r a strange person." -Chris Ramos.  ~Brian's cuz, he's cuter. With his lil pink sk8board....he's not gay. Thankfully he's punk.   "Hey Katestah, Have a great summer fo' shizzle." -Danny Yu.  ~0_o ....Yeah.....whatever, he's cute.  The other ones were generic "Have a good summer" "See you at AHS" (Alhambra High School) meh...  ~Kata the Mexican chic who can't sk8 without falling.
