I had to say that Will was dead "for all intents and purposes", and have that translated as a death threat before he actually allocated a comment to the BLog.  Tomorrow is "Speak Like A Pirate Day", kudos to wonderful, talented Abby. So I expect everyone to be full pirate tomorrow, because I sure as hell will. Just watch me bust out the parrot and eye patch and cutlass and rape and plunder and everything. It'll be AWESOME!  Hoo-ah! Congratulations!
