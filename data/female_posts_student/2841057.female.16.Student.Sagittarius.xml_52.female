Here's a funny article about loving something, this is how it goes.  The Original version: used to be this:  If you love somebody, Set it free... If it comes back, it's yours; If it doesn't, it never was yours in the first place.   But the Pessimist's version is this:  If you love somebody, Set him free... If she ever comes back, he's your. If he doesn't, well, as expected, he never was.  The Optimist's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  Don't worry, he will come back.  The Suspicious' version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, ask him why.  The Impatient Person's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he doesn't come back within some time limit, forget him.  The Patient Person's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he doesn't come back, continue to wait until he comes back...  The Playful version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  *If he comes back, and if you love him still, set him free again, repeat*  The Lawyer's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  Clause 1a Paragraph 13a-1 in the second ammendment of the Matrimonial Freedon Act clearly states that...  The Bill Gate's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, I think we can charge her for re-installation fees and tell him that she's also going to get an upgrade.  The Statistician's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he loves you, the probability of her coming back is high.  If he doesn't, your relationship was improbable anyway.  The Possesive's version:  If you love somebody don't ever set him free.  The MBA version:  If you love somebody, Set him free... instantaneously... and look for others simultaneously.   The Psychologist's version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, his super ego is dominant. If he doesn't come back, his IQ is supreme. If he doesn't go, he must be crazy.  The Marketing version:  If you love somebody, Set him free...  If he comes back, he has brand loyalty. If he doesn't reposition the brand new markets.   Here is my version.  If you love somebody, you will care enough to share your life to help, to give, rather than to get or to receive.  If you love somebody, you will begin to invest more of your time, listen carefully to what that person is saying.  If you love sombody, you will rejoice at that person's success.  That's what the real issue in love is all about. And that's the right perspective.
