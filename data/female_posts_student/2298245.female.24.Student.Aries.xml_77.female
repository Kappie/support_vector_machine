I may not always agree with Hitchens, but he is one of the most thoughtful and intelligent and biting writers I have ever come across.  He really cuts through it all and gets to the point, and doesn't constantly take knee-jerk reactions to things based on his politics.  For more stuff written by him, go to  urlLink The Christopher Hitchens Web .  As for the Kennedy mystique, I'm not sure it's totally gone yet, but I did notice that on the 40th anneversary of the assassination that just passed last month, there were some serious revisionist documentaries on TV, not the fawning fare of the past.  And I suspect as we get even further removed from the 60s, this trend will probably continue.  Perhaps, one day, we as Americans will even be able to let the 60s go.
