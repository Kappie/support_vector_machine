Half way through we all had to go out because nextdoor they were doing this show, and they forgot to put the smoke covers over the fire alarms and they had some smoke or something *breathes* Then two fire engines turned up, and this lady started taking photos so I started to hide. YEAY! It was really fun though! It was my brother's girlfriends thingy, but he didn't turn up till late cause he was with his friend at the hospital who broke his leg. *aww* But he ended up dancing really stupidly with his friend, then the rest of his friends started doing it, got a bit crazy. Then Lynne requested YMCA at the end, and I did it backwards *took a lot of brain work, at least I'm doing something with it!* Uh yeah... isn't this pointless? Never mind! It's damn interesting boring! YEAY! Let's all go eat erm... bourbons! *drool*
