Yes he drives people crazy and yes he does say some of the dorkiest things, but he is papa.  I was thinking of how our lives would be if he weren't in it and I think a huge part of us would be missing.  It is so nice to have him back home.  I am a bit tired and have to get ready for my scholarship luncheon.  I am excited but tired.  Plus I think knowing that it is in a nice country club makes me nervous because I am just so opposite of all of that.  Call me Plain Jane.  I better get going, I am stalling and then the next thing I know I will be running late.
