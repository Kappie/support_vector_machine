(by the way, i'm not talking about a large number of people...just a handful that i can't seem to comprehend).  now, call me crazy, but i don't like this whole "do as i say, not as i do" stigma.  as a matter of fact, it pisses me off. people think that just because they say it, that makes it true, make it un-do what's already been done. in general i would have to say that i value only 2 core enteties,if you will, in any given relationship.  i like to think i can put up with a lot of shit but these 2 things really stand out to me.  trust and loyalty. that's all i ask of in a relationship, friendship, whatever. that's IT. 2 little tiny things and whodathunk they'd turn out to be so hard to find?
