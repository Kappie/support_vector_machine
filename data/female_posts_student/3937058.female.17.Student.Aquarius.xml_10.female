As many of u r well aware, as u r practically worshippers of my life and blog (stringy...u know its true) I have been in France for a week, it was hot and sunny and there was many a museum, and historic monument to see but more importantly... phwoar! A tres tres tres fit hotel owner...ooh la la, i would have had him right there behind the desk if it weren't for my extended family and said guy being far too sexy for me. Tho his english was soooo hot and i chatted to him en francais. Omg, I feel a tad flushed just thinking about him! Woah, I am so moving there (well france neway) and finding a hot dude. Damn fine! Neway on a duller, soggier, english note... I did my theory test today! Tho I did conceal it from you in a particularly devilish manner... and I passed! Wahay! No more theory!!!!!!! Finito! Then to celebrate I went and bought a suitcase... une valise pour mes vacances parce que la semaine prochaine J'irai au l'ecosse, pour visiter ma tante, mon oncle et mes cousines! Heeheehee (babel fish it lol) Anyway a bientot and a kiss on each cheek for u and ur kin! Lauren xxx
