Coz all of us thought that Rowena's mum would come  test the make up for us..But end up she came only about 7pm.. So we rotted in the room!! LOL.. Then there was this "xiang ba lao" (shan't reveal who) thought I DID NOT HEAR WHAT HE SAY.. "See now u know why I dislike her" Ok.. He was saying to his LOVER GIRL.. A girl who is not even his lover  only someone he likes.. HE ALWAYS STICKS TO HER LIKE GLUE.. Look at his freakin' hair  stupid specs.. Plus the childish shirt he wore .. ACTS CUTE YA SEE ..Can u imagine? HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE A "XIANG BA LAO"!!!!WAHAHALet's see... there was so many special numbers  stuff.. The group from Elim (Tampines) sang "We are the reason" .. testimonies from certain peeps .. showing the goodness of God .. OF COURSE .. the skit was a success .. Loadsa laughters were heard from the audiences (ponders *why*) Haha .. guess it must be because of the cast .. Well everything was fun.. everything was nice .. I walked with Jennifer  Amanda Quah to Potong Pasir station  only to realise ... THERE WAS STILL THE LAST TRAIN! We managed to catch it.. Thank God .. Jennifer dropped with me at Kovan .. walked to the nearest 7-11  got a cup of lemon tea(big gulp).. After which, we walked to my house  from there, Jennifer took a cab to Marianna's house.. wherease some other youths went to Esplanade instead..
