Yes, I have returned to the land of overweight, sweatsuit-wearing, 'rat-tails-are-the-new-mullet' people, all wedged in the  barren land (spare a few harsh, neon-ified buildings; i.e.: Meijiers, the Seaway Motel, Comerica Bank) known as Muskegon.  This is what Eve must have felt like when forced to vacate the Garden of Eden's premises.  Only.... my Eden was a placed called Naples.  Naples, FLORIDA to be exact.  Now, some may say that visiting your grandparents for Spring Break might not be cool....but you can bet that the ones uttering those words would be trapped in Michigan, and have surely never met my grandparents.   After all, anywhere away from Muskegon, especially with a tropical climate would be a haven for me... hell.... give me Haiti! (All that political turmoil could go on around me....what do I care?....so long as I am curled up with my good book, a safe distance away from the rioting...perhaps perched a-top a palm tree)  I don't know how I can possibly contain myself now that I have gotten a taste of sunshine, suntan oil, and coconut perfume.   Summer......          meet me at the airport.   Song of the Day: 'Bubbly Toes'- Jack Johnson
