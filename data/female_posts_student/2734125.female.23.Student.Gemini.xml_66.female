Now comes that quiet space where I stretch, and nap, and clean, and take a hot bath, and make a few calls, and shower, and get ready for more quiet.  During this time to come I think about what has been, how to process and refit my reality.  I read books that need to be ordered from far away, and I read books that are sticky with ink and pages that cling together like lost children, frightened to be absorbed into my mind.  And I plan to do all these things with a meditative glee, a joy of nothing and no one and its the first time its happened in a bit.  there is the space where I am sad, slightly frightened of the looming summer, the time to fill.  But I feel ready, because this year I found my self drawn to books I wouldn't have read before, and ready for looking and seeking.  I am going to volunteer- do something that I have not been asked to do by anyone, but that I joyfully undertake for the doing.  Sometime soon I am going to go out on a lake, maybe early in the day before others wake, while there is still mist and moist and dew glittering in the new hour, and I will glide silent, like I am in not on, and I will find that mystic past space that I dreampt about not too long ago.  I think that I will really feel my fingers touch my eye lids, and I think that I will really feel my feet absorb the hot off the black street, and I think I will really feel the cotton sweep the back of my calf, and I will really feel the sweat trickle down my stomach on the hottest night that's a crouching orange tabby somewhere in July.   I can tell that I am ready because I watched the water in the gutter for half an hour, watching the tiny rocks and bits of wood and the miniature dip of life.  Scale.  I was then sitting on a boulder and looking over the edge, and wondering, what makes that not five hundred feet away, and it wasn't my eyes, or gravity, or some arbitrary form of measurement- it was just me.  I tried to make it far, and I may have done it, but at that point you don't want to jump down.  Today is a deep cool breath pushing out need for more then now, and that is proper, as it should be.  I accept this invitation.
