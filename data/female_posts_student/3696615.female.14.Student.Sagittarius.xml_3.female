I'm going to take my stuffed animal frog with me everywhere I go (including the road-trip my family and I will be going on), so, soon a website will be posted showing all the places hes been to, and what hes done. Today it will be the beach. Hes gonna soak up some rays, but I don't think he'll be going in any water (he doesn't know how to swim yet).   Ok, I better get ready for the beach. Bye.
