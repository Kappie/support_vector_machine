But now I got a shit load of home work and I havn't started it yet. this blows. I was talking to Dacia today and she's like you need a boyfriend. I'm 14 and I've never had a boyfriend. It's not that I don't want one or that I'm a lesben or somthing like that, I just don't know how to talk to guys, I feel really stupid and get all retarded. So this summer I'm probably going to florida and I'm just gonna have to be more out going. It's like Jim in American Pie, I was born with out that part of the brain.  Have you ever felt that you wanted to go home while you are home? I know that sounds fucked up but like your in your house and you don't feel at home or that's not where you belong. I feel like that every day.
