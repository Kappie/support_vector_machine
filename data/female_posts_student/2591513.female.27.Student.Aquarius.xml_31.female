One day I hope she realizes all I have sacrificed for her, all I gave up for her, to help her.  I hope one day she turns around and sees her friends gone and realize she gave up her family for no reason.  Thank you for the early birthday gift...thanks for reminding me just how important family is and just how sad ignorance really is.
