Riz got kinda angry that i didn't trust him with derek's number. Well, i'm sorry but i'd rather u hate me than getting derek or u into deeper misunderstanding. derek needs to be alone...he has to cool down. so, i hope he'll not be disturbed by anyone, including myself. i believe he's old enough to think maturely. Anyhow, my stand is neutral. i'm not siding anybody. that's all i can say.  chatted with zhiyong last nite. i was asking him where is he and guess wad? he's talking to me in the Gents! he said he's really urgent. haha. he's really a very nice and funny guy to talk to.   hmmm....i wanna go for a swim!!!! i need to swim badly! cry. well, miss my sis...she went for a camp this morning. sighs.   Guess i'll stop here. nth much to say alrdy. GREAT DAY!!!!! PEACE!
