Hee hee~! Those are keepers. ^^   I'm sooo pissed. >:( Nika was trying to flirt with Nima on the bus! They were sitting beside each other (with the aisle between them) and she was trying to do draw on his arm or something. Grr...! She's lucky I wasn't on that bus. See? We're not even in high school yet and a girl goes flirting with Nima even though she is fully aware he's taken! Grr... Me angry!  I miss Nima... He's someplace... with his friends. Walking around Science North and checking things out. I missed him so much on the bus ride. All I could do was think about him. Missing him so much... I'm dreading going back on the bus. Don't wanna be kept away from Nima again.   I feel kinda woozy-ish from the bus ride... Ugh. Meh, I should end the blog entry here... I'm off...  Oooh, I forgot. On Tuesday after school, my mom saw that I was really happy with Nima and stuff and she just asked out of the blue what I'd do if he suddenly just broke up with me because he didn't like me anymore. Frankly, I'd be shattered... I'd rather DIE than know I can't have him... I can't stand being away from him. It'd kill me. Period. But of course, I didn't say that 'cos that'll scare my mom so I just said "It's okay I guess. I'd get on with life...!" and gave her a reassuring smile. Fake of course. I can't tell her that I can't live without Nima. I'm not stupid. Meh, whatever...  Nima's over there on the weirdo phone thingies... Meh, me blogging beside Ioana right now.   Caught a glimpse of what Moca was typing... it was about Poodle Boi. As usual... *sighzZ* I hope she's okay and that she'll really enjoy this trip. Before I left on this trip, I prayed to the LORD for His protection on this trip and yeah...  Wish I can spend more time with Nima... I miss him.  On the bus, I read a Manga called Kare Kano... Volume VI. Anyway... in the manga, there was something that really got me thinking. It made me know FOR SURE that I love Nima. It said that when the abscence of someone throws the balance off your heart and make you seem "lost", then that's how you know you love them. In my case, even one second without Nima can put me off balance... I love him. That was definitely reassurance... not that I needed any.  I love you Nima, if you're reading this... I mean it. Don't ever forget... it'd break my heart if you did.
