Even though we had some quarrel during the preparation, it endedwell.   Firstly, I want to mention about the “invitation card”. It was the most special invitation “card” among those I’ve seen before. It is a bottle with a piece of paper inside it.  “ Calling 4 our beloved PPS senior ’04,  Remember our Rendezvous?  Meet us at cool morning at AMC OLD HALL, 8:30am – 12:00pm, 17/07/2004.  See u there… !!!”    The programme wasn’t that exciting. However, I know that they have already put in a lot of effort to make it a success. Thank you, juniors.    An unforgettable incident has happened today. The senior lost in the competition. The junior group, form by all the librarians from form 1 to form 4 beat us. We have to face the penalty. The junior got a box of ice; they will put the ice into our shirt for 10 seconds. Every junior has a chance to do so. I was the one with bad luck. Every junior was looking for me to take revenge on me. Whole of my shirt wet. =-(  *Warning - Never bethedisciplinary mistress/ master.    I took a few photos with my juniors. Unfortunately, the photos are not so clear. I will take some photos again with them. Hope they won’t decline my request. Hehe… =D    P/s – Band final competition count down : 4 days.
