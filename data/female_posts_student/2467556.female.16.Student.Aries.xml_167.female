Wednesday: work, hung out, discovered that my Lauren Caldwell is moving to frickin Atlanta, Georgia and i didn't know about it....we're going to hang out before she leaves.  oh yes and my mom decided to be cleaning nazi. Thursday: went over to Nadia's house and spent the night with her and Stewie.  We watched the "Sunday Night Sex Show" and if you've never seen it, its basically this Canadian show where this really old Canadian woman gets on and gives advice about sex to Canadians.  And they're all from Toronto or Kitchener, Ontario with the occasional appearance of someone from Vancouver, B.C.  Its pretty funny.  Stewie fell asleep first, as is tradition lol, and me and Nadia were delirious until like 2-3am.  At those hours of the night, we tried to figure out if the word "bitchin" could be used as an adverb.  We could not figure it out, but we did have a good laugh over that stupid word.  For some reason everything we said was hysterical.  Don't ask. Friday: is today.  and my friend from Highland Park, Emily, is coming over to hang out.  We haven't seen each other since the end of the Dallas Stars' regular season (we have platinum club season tickets together, we sit next to each other every game) and we have loads to catch up on.  Bound to be a fun night.  haha i told Nadia i had this dream that i met Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter in a Laundromat.  We then proceded to make funny jokes about hooking up in a Laundromat.  I don't remember too much of it, because we were delirious, but i remember that she said things like "What kind of detergent do you use? thats sexy!".  lol good times.  i'm out, i need food.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
