She's   dead   nervous but I told her not to worry. I hope if tommorow goes well when I hand in my   C  V   to Primark and they ask me back for an Interview that i'll get a job there because then I can afford to within a month get my   Tragus  and  Industrial   ear piercings  . Whoo! Can't wait. I'm also thinking about getting my   nose pierced    again , had to take it out last time because Ian,   My Best Mate  , pulled it out by accident and   infected   it with bacteria from his hands. Boohoo :( I can't wait until I get my Tragus pierced though, I'm really    looking forward    to that. I really  want  a job too though, I think it would make my parents treat me more like a   grown-up   instead of a   k i d   if I did. They don't realise that's I'm    turning into a woman    already. Especially my '  Dad  '. Meh, he's just a big    fat arsehole    who I couldn't give two flying fucks about anymore with the way he   treats  me . It's going to be   great   in a few weeks aswell because i'll be   living on my own  whoo ! Even though my mum thinks i'll be  a  twat  , I honestly won't, I'll be really   mature   and probably    clean    the house because I know that no-one else will do it for me. That will make me mature quick :)  Yay!.  Anywho, I've written    two      songs tonight, I'll post them   after   this. They are basically different aspects of how I feel about certain people whether it's   how   I'm   feeling   now   or   how   I   used   to   feel   for   someone .                                                         Meow Meow Meep !                         xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx   Sadie   xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx
