I have a rehearsal Sunday for over 3 hours so hopefully that isn't painful to be at... if you know what I mean. So as of now I am at Josh's house. We just went Putt-Putt golfing at Dutch Village which kind of sucked. Josh lost his ball on the 3rd hole and I lost mine on the 16th. It was so dark that we couldn't see anything. Oh well, it was still fun. Then after that Josh took me to McDonalds and bought me a sundae, which by the way was delicious. Now I am sitting here. Fun stuff. I should probably go spend some time with Josh. I just wanted to write in here.. just because.      Love Always,    Tami         My thought of the day:  Karma is a bitch
