I heard a commercial on the radio yesterday for 8-oz cans of Coors Light.  Whose dumbass idea was this?  Why would anyone want *less* beer?  It’s being touted as “faster and colder” but I say anyone who can’t finish a 12-oz brew before it gets hot doesn’t need to be drinking beer anyway.  This just proves that Coors Light is for pussies.  2.	There is a sign I see every day in Cleburne that reads, “50% of our best!”  I’m guessing that before the storms blew away one of their f’s it referred to a sale, but now it’s more like caveat emptor.  I think we should get one in front of our office.    3.	I saw a very pretty, mature 6-point buck on my way to work this morning.  For a minute, I reconsidered my post-Bambi incident (see  The Deer Whisperer )vow to not shoot deer anymore.  But I’m sticking with it.  Plus, it’s always cold during deer season, and I’d rather be indoors watching football.   4.	Liberty dressing.  Last weekend at home Mom bought “Finally, American” salad dressing.  It actually says on the label “Not French, Italian or Russian!”  It tasted like water.    That’s all for now.  If anyone wants to call Arizona law and ask how their waitlist-ranking process is going, their phone number is 520.621.1373.  I think they recognize my voice now and I don’t want to piss off anyone who’s near my file.
