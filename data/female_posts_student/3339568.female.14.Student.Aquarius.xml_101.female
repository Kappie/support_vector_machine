It's plaguing both my generation (ie Lozza  Chris, Bec  Matt), and the younger generation (Beth  Luke). Of course, being 3-4 years younger than me, they're classified as a whole other generation. Now if there was some cross-generational dating, we'd have a church scandal. How fun, and perhaps inappropriate, all at the same time."    Hehe,  urlLink Rach  once again tickles my funni bone. Go the cross-generational dating! Haha. I say  urlLink Mel  should initate this, i mean she knows all the "older generation" well neway. ;) And isn't it funny how we classify such a short age difference as a generation. Quite interestingly funny really... But I'm glad the frigid non-dating church community, (whether it be Ernie Sr, Ernie Jr (which is beating Ernie Sr in the love stakes which is quite sad) or Rach's generation) trend may finally be breaking... Bring it on Ernie Sr! Come on we can beat those Jr's!!  Bring ooonnn the luurve
