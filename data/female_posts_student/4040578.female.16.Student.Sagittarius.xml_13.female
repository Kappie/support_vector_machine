I am talking about naive people who just are always that way. The naive I am referring to  is not only in their actions, but also in there way of life in decision making. It's amazing how people can allow to drop themselves so low and lose what standards or goals they had for themselves. But maybe, the Lord will break them and all will be put "put back together".      Moving on, today was frigid feelin'. I woke up around 11. Did the normal television watching and what not. I did decide to take a shower earlier than the norm, go me! But anywho, nothing much was done today. I did talk to William around 5:30 and asked him to be at my house at 9 so we could enjoy a nice fire together. Well in between the time I was waiting for him to get here, Leah and I went to Target and Hobby Lobby. I didn't get nothing, bummer. But Leah got what she needed. Finally we arrived home around 8:15. I started the fire at 8:30 cause I thought I might have difficulties getting it going. Well what do ya know, I didn't. So I was stuck babysitting the fire til William showed up. We had fun. We roasted marshmallows and talked. So peaceful. Then the wood was all used and it was getting cold so we came back in the house. He talked to my momma for awhile then before he left, he reserved the rest of his time for me. How lucky am I?! Well, his dad actually gave him a curfew tonight so he left around 11:45. Now that he is gone, I have time to sit and fill you in on my day. Now who is the lucky one?      Ok, it's late and I got to get up early cause I am having breakfast with William before he goes to work. But before I go, have I mentioned how happy I am? Hehehe, I think so. Well, my bed awaits me, so I am gonna get all snuggly warm in it, so I am outtie!      Music Playin' in The Background: Grand Theft Autumn(Where Is Your Boy)- Fall Out Boy
