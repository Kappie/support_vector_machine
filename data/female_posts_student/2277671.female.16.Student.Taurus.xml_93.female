Listenin to the BRITNEY Cd cristina let me b0rrow [ thanx bluh] Seein her and r0bert made me think. [ i kn0w i really shouldnt ramble 0n ab0ut  me  markus' relationship, but fuck it, i'm gonna. and if you dont care, just skip over this part...  well seeing them together reminds me of what markus and i  dont  have.  I mean c'mon now... we dont get a long, we argue, [ but wat couple d0esnt?] but he's only happy when hes getting what he wants... and like if i say something about how he acts, he'll be like what are you talking about, like he'll ignore me or be like ' get away from me ' and hella act like he doesnt wanna be around me, that shit hella makes me mad, and hes just hella shut-offish toward me all the time and wont talk about anything, and then if i get mad he finds a way to put it all on me, and i gotta all ask for hugs and all and we were on the phone and i was asking him hella questions about how he felt about us and alla this and he was like ' oh whatever i dont wanna break up with u na na na , then i asked him if he liked being single, and he was like yeah , when we dont get along, and i was like how long has it been since you can say we've gotten along, how many days in a row have we argued? he was like , we argue everyday and i was like what'd be so bad about us being apart, and he was like i'm used to the routine, what the fuck is that!!? you feel i'm not happpy in our relationship, but i know that i woulndt be happy if we break up. I mean we sit on the phone , from like 4 - 10 and talk maybe about 45 minutes out of the whole time. Hes sweet when HE WANTS TO BE. when he feels like it, and really , i'm tired of it.   Well anyways.. that shit just pisses me off so i dont know what to say/do about it.  So i'm wearin my glasses right, and it makes my computer look hella clearer.. its great , well i'm out... bbyez
