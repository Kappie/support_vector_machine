So that when I'm not really talking, and I'm sitting there, and saying "K" and "haha" and "Mhm.." It's not because I'm a bitch, and it's not because I'm busy. It's because I'm sitting there, and thinking wow, and I so badly want to say ( in some cases type) more, and have a conversation with you but it's like I don't have the energy. I don't see the point. If I have a big conversation with you it's not going to change the fact that all I can think about is how bad I want to be..Yup. It has a lot to do with the fact that I'm EXTREMELY stuborn as well so when I start being a bitch and ignoring you and you say i'm being a bitch and ignoring you and I deny it, I cant go back and say sorry, cuz I'm a bitch.... Anyways. Yes. So I'd like to appologize to all of you who've called me/talked to me on msn and I've been a stupid annoying stinker. :) That is all. I've now completely vented and I'm readddy to talk fully to you in full..converstaion mode.
