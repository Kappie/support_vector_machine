I just had the wierdest dream...  i was asian, and i was in the rainforest with my asian family and i was SUPER pregnant... and we were trying to hide from all these animals and run, and then we ran into the chinese mafia and my daughter had some scar on her hand and one of the guys saw it and was like "OH ! THE CHOSEN ONE!" and they took my daughter away and then they decided they didnt want me to have my baby so they put me in this room behind a stone wall.. and i was like "are you stupid? im still going to have this baby no matter where i am, i cant keep it in forever" but they didnt care and they put me behind this st√∏ne wall. And then my alarm went off. And there was probably a bunch of other stuff but i dont remember.  lol.  thats it. Good morning.   ~abby
