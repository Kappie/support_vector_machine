Yesterday, I celebrated the birth of a miraculous man. I cannot prove that he was the son of Godde, but I feel that particular truth down in the depths of my bones. However, he is not the only truth in which I believe nor does my belief in him negate or make impossible the existence of other esteemable tenants.  I consider myself a Celtic-Christo-Episco-Pagan, who follows the teachings of Jesus and pays homage to the Goddess. I believe in the existence of faeries, Santa Claus, elves, unicorns; all forms of magic that can only be found by paying attention, by listening to that child-like voice that lives inside of me, a voice that has the potential to disappear if we, human beings, do not guard it with care and love. I hold the words of Buddha close to my heart and I have a penchant for Islamic spiritual poetry. I follow the religious path of the ancient Celtic Church. I use my rosary for prayer and meditation.  I believe that evil exists, but I also believe in the overwhelming nature of Good, of Godde. Godde speaks to every man and woman, through every race, religion, and creed. Godde is not reserved for one nation or one brand of theology, but embraces and can be embraced by all who walk this planet. Beauty, happiness and fulfillment, can be found in every tradition.  Regardless of your path, I wish you a Blessed Christmas and a Happy New Year.
