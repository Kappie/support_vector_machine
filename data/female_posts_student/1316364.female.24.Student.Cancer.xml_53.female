Danielle kept on saying to me that I would make a wonderful mother. That made me feel good. I just feel so natural with kids. Hearing that from her just made me with that I had a baby of my own. We had been talking about starting a family, it would be nice. Jesse and I will have been married for one year April 19th. I can remember our wedding day like it was yesterday, the "I do's" are fresh in my mind.   Wow, one year.   Jesse is trying to get to come home in the summer for leave. that would be the most wonderful thing if he could come home.  We are shooting for sometime around the 4th of July and my birthday. Jesse said when he gets to come home we will try again to conceive. I am a little scared but at the same time I am ready. Oh well only time will tell.
