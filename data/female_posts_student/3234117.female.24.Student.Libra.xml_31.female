I'm very excited. However, paired with excitement is a little bit of negativity as my mom's sister will be in town. She's kind of odd so I tend to stay away from her. If it wasn't for the ribs,having to administer atestor my sister's beckoning to be there with her, I wouldn't be going home.  Although it's not like I have much else to do since as you all know, I'm broke. At least I know that my plans of studying, writing, and reading for class haven't been affected by my financial status. That sucks!  Well, I'm off to go home.
