My cousin is amazing; he never fell off his horse (even when Sam got excited and galloped a few arena lengths before calming down). I fell off twice in September (after taking the summer off), that's all. One was stupid; I simply slid off the saddle after a jump (the ground was uneven so I was unbalanced). Tango's hooves hit my head (bless my helmet), and he stepped on the back of my leg (it was the coolest bruise ever, hoove-shaped!) The second, it was my horse who stopped so abrubtly I went flying over his head and under the fence (it's just an electric cord), hit my leg on a metal bar and landed on my back (my shirt was all grass-stained). Since then, I haven't fallen.  Anyway, here's a cute video of Shadow that my sister took with her digital camera! He's 28 months old now (2 years, 4 months), a quarter horse gelding, and if he's got some white fur it's because of his mother, who was an Apaloosa. His mane is the softest I've ever touched... I luv Shadow.  http://membres.lycos.fr/shakiramaxwell/vid.MOV
