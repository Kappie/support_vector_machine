So let's see what my mother will do when she sees my brother's handphone bill for OZ. Actually, I used to signed up as a trial member when it just started its Singapore online game. It was FREE at that time! Remember? Hang Ten used to sponser it and all their shopping bags are printed with OZ. Haiz... it IS a good game. The characters are nicely dressed and you have to fish to earn money and buy clothes to cover your NEARLY NAKED body.... *laugh* No need to worry, you just go to another virtual world to make friends and the boys there really LOVE talking to girls. What's more? you have a attractive body regardless of male or female, really, very, fun...  --- Uni looks good---   You are Aivilo_Pilut the Uni.  You are my very first neopet.  You are the leader of the pack and the smartest!    urlLink   Which of my Neopets are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
