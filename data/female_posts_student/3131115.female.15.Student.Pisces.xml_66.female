Well I know the words but I can't really speak them To you And I hide all the pain that I've gained with my wisdom From you  and I'm eaten alive  by what I hold inside all the things that I live with I can't easily hide and Im left here with nothing nothing to live for but you  Its not easy to hide all this damage inside and I'll carry you with me until Im not alive  When you look at my face does it seem just as ugly to you  I can't seem to erase all these scars I have lived with from you  Im so sick of this place this taste in my mouth cause of you I can figure what I'm all about  and Im left here with nothing nothing to live for, but you  and its not easy to hide all this damage inside and Ill carry you with me till im not alive
