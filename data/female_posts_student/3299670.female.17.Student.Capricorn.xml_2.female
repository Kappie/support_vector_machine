I don't deserve such ego boosts. Since i don't want to clog up my storys with authors notes, i've decided to do the proper ones here, to thank reveiwers. So here goes,  H:TNG, Chapter 14  -  Elebereth  - thanks a lot. i promise i will try to update much more often. I'm sorry it took so long the first time.  yaoi-is-gay-13  - i love that word, 'spiffiness'. i may have to start using that! i'm glad you like it.  Sowen  - i'm glad you managed to catch up, i had a feeling that would happen so i tried to keep that particular chapter within a very short time-space. i promise to try and not keep you waiting so long.  Stardust  - it's to your review the others owe their thanks. if i hadn't have got that i may never have revived the story in the first place.  Thanks, thats all the updated stories i have for today. I will try to get a new H:TNG chapter up ASAP, maybe tonight. Also, 17Whatever will be updated soon. Angel and i are already working on the latest chapter, but seeing as it is in fact co-written, it will take longer than one of my own.  Also in the planning stages is a sort of buffy/harry potter crossover. If people are interested in that, please comment and let me know.  Akasha xxx
