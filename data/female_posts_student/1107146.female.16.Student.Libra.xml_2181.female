Thursday and Saturday were really good and Sunday was absolutely hilarious.  So, it's all good.  Maybe now I can go back to my normal routine of doing nothing.  God, now I actually have to see my parents.  Before, I was able to go days at a time without seeing them...or seeing them very briefly.  It was nice.  Anyways, class is over, so I suppose I should head to Jerry's room now.  Wahoo.  Yesterday he made fun of everybody because of what we ate (or didn't) for breakfast.  I had a smoothie...he'd never heard of those before and determined from my description that no normal person would eat pureed fruit.
