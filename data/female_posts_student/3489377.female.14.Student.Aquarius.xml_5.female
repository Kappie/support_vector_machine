I don't ave any ideas for drawing something..I have the depressed feeling but nothing comes to mind right now..Maybe laters. No one to talk to..He is watching Tech T.V. because there is something about video games on. It's not X-Play, which I kind of wish it was...Adam and Morgan are always funny. Neopets is getting old again. Then that time of the month doesn't help either..*cramp* Oh well, maybe I can write some of my novel tonight. I need to find it first o.O Heh..It's a romance...Im so sappy. I can't help it though..Wish I had Samauri X, but it's at my boyfriend's house..Along with Kingdom Hearts. I miss him..GOD DAMNIT! IM SO FACKING BORED! I need a hug..*hugs herself for comfort..like always* Well, I only hug myself when im alone and scared. Switchfoot is playing..It calmns me down. I think they are christan band but who cares..I like some songs. Im Pagan and I don't give a fuck about who says something about me..Im sick of it and I just don't care anymore..It's not something I want to kill myself over anyway..*holds her Neopet tightly* If only you were real..Im still trying to get him from McDonald's..Nothing yet. Im sick of burgers..Greesy..Feh. I need to get ready for the Ren Fair. Im a pirate! Mah name be Luffy..I got it from One Piece. I was reading Shounen Jump and was thinking and there it was! So, I be Luffy..Heh...I feel so tired and bored..I miss my brother o.o
