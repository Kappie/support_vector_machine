I actually have a respectable tan (for me) but I'm going to have such a bad halter top tan because my 2 favorite bathing suits are both halter tops.  Oh well, it doesn't bother me too much.  We had chicken fingers and carrot cake on the beach too.  Yummmmm.    Today, I've mostly been hanging around but I've actually been really busy. I had to fix my itunes. but now I have about 420 songs on my ipod so that is super fab.  I really want to go CD shopping and get some Counting Crows, O.A.R., and Guster.  I am officially a legal person- no more illegal downlaoding for me.  But I've never illegally downloaded, only thought about it.  Riiiiight.  I will only use iTunes.  Hopefully.  I need to call those cool friends of mine.  I haven't seen them in a while.
