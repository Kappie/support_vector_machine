Granted, that doesn't sound that extraordinary, but the first four are the people who tried out for concertmaster. But then again, I am ever inclined to feel so guilty about it. Okay, so I've stuck around for a while, and it appears that Benson does seating not only on ability and attendance but also on how long you've been in CVYO. And then there's the possibility that I'm only sitting so close up because Mom's in charge of the Chinese New Year program, and the orchestra's playing in it, so is it a measure to save face? I just don't think I am worth it. The stand immediately behind me is Josh and Hank, and I know they're both good and more serious about violin than I am. I know that behind me there's Sean (who's still hoity toity about things) and Sherman, etc.--very, very competent people. And it's just ironic that this is the first seating audition where I haven't had a teacher, where I haven't been so terribly nervous about things. I just cannot believe that my violin playing is improving without practice and without instruction, so that raises an eyebrow. But it just so happens that Ellen (the older one) is my stand partner and won't be around at rehearsal until practice, so I get bumped up to the outside seat. I don't know if I want this: it means that the people sitting in the first few rows of the audience can   really   hear you now, that I can't hide behind the arms of other people and that I have to learn the top part in the divisi sections.   Well, any way you put it, I'm pleasantly surprised but I still doubt myself. And it means a lot of practice and counting before rehearsal next week.  b) second majorly good thing: I didn't get picked for Spanish orals today. You see, in comparison to period 4, period 2 is a very wimpy class. We've long forgotten about   la vela  , we complain audibly about the increasing difficulty of Bruckner's class, and to put the icing on the cake we're short of volunteers for the oral final where period 4 just has half the class valianty offers to go. At any rate, I could potentially screw up in that class and I wasn't ready for the orals today, so thank whatever higher deity there is that I didn't have to go lie in the middle of the road and prepare to get run over, figuratively speaking.  Got a death threat today. From none other than Tiffany. "IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO MY EMAIL I'LL GO AFTER YOU AND KILL YOU MYSELF." Sure signs of maturity, I'll say.  I honestly don't care how this darn thing turns out anymore, since it's petty and silly and Tiff is obviously exaggerating the severity of the situation. The only thing I remotely miss is being able to talk to Ryan, but then again that is sure to end up in complaining and scholarly discussions and ultimately silence once again. So I shan't tempt myself.
