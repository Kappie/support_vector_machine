I just took a HUGE test and I feel like writing other things, things that aren't for a grade, things that won't be read by anyone I know.    My man came to see me yesterday eve.  He's very fine.  Fine in the face, with a killer smile and nice hands and almost black eyes.  Many months ago, when I first met him, I thought he was a cutie.  It took me a while to wonder what else he might be.   Before this new thing, I was infatuated with a barista who works at a trendy coffee place downtown.  One of those bad boys with long hair and a leather jacket, wears sunglasses even when it's dark.  I vaguely knew him from a class, and I knew he was into English because he was always lingering around the shithole building where all the literature classes are booked.  He walks like Robert Plant and he wears decidedly uncool pants.  I like guys that don't give a fuck about fashion.  Makes them seem like they have better things to do, signifies a little lack of conformity.  KU looks like a batch of clones sometimes.  Anyhow, it's no thing now.  But how I used to pine for that guy!  I dreamed about him all the time.  The thing is, I could have had him, I think.  I saw the way he looked back at me, and I felt it.  I could have, but it was the longing that I liked, not the actual thing.    Before I came along, my man was dating someone else.  Living with her, even.  I call him a Love Child.  Since he emerged from the womb, he's been cosseted and fawned over and pinched on his soft cheeks.  I do it, too.  It's terrible.  He's had god knows how many lovers, lost his virginity at an age when I still thought boys had cooties.  Always dated older ladies, and it shows.   He knows what not to say and he can cope with all matters feminine.  He's a hell of a lot more savvy about that stuff than some of the older guys I've dated, guys who thought they'd get vaginas if they went into the goddamn MiniMart to pick up a box of tampons.  Sometimes I wonder about his past, but I don't particularly want to discuss mine, so I don't ask.  I have a bit of a history, actually.  Only 3 bona fide boyfriends, but between the ages of 17-18, and a little of 19:  Wow.  I was kind of wild.  Not as wild as some, but definitely wilder than most people would think.  (I look very wholesome and I dress like a librarian.)  Is that even relevent anymore?  I mean, by now it's like ancient history.  I heard this poem the other day, and it goes:  "It is important to keep old hat in secret closet."  I don't know who wrote it.  In any case, I am really bad at lying, so if it comes up, I will have no choice but to tell.  I am honest, but sometimes I think some things are better left alone.  Big expositions outlining every goddamn sinful thing are rarely anything but hurtful.    Whatever.  Now I get to go home and take a nice bath and call him, then probably stay up all damn night finishing a revision for tomorrow.  It's the last thing I have to turn in!  And then it's nothing but loving life after that.  I'm going to start counting the hours.
