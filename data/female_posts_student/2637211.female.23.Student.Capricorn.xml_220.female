And I always feel like I've worked through my issues, and I understand myself better after I talk to her. We're totally going to Disneyland for graduation. It'll be awesome.  Gotta rough draft/outline a paper today, meet with the teacher about the paper, and go to exit counseling. Then I'm going to go shopping with Liz and possibly Melissa in Roseville, and I spend the evening studying with my classmate Jessica. And Friday I take my final and I guess go home to Oakland, I suppose. I have to talk to Jerm.
