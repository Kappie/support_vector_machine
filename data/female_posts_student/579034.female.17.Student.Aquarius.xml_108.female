Friday, Erica and I got into a scuffle with mall security ("So since your like a rent-a-cop, do you get like half the doughnut and half the coffee since your not the real deal?") Then Saturday at the meet, it wasn't all too bad. It was a good time and coach and I had a funny convo of like phrases in different laguages. Don't knwo what we said really but, it was good. Oh, and she told us she's going to Australia and New Zealand over the summer and if she finds love there she's not coming back. Let's start praying now.  LOL Just kidding. I dunno coach kinda grew on me.  Then... oh man and here's the killa.  I went to Erica's that night and we raided the liquer cabinet. Now, if any of you know me and Erica, you know we don't drink. It's just something we don't do. We went down in her basement, and took shots of a few differnet things lol. Um, I don't remember which ones we did but the Peach Shnopps (sp?) was the best. Then like we went upstaris to make chocoalte soup and I was like, dizzy. It was really funny. Then, we made the soup and hadda good time eatin/ drinkin it and then we played a few games of pool in which I won all b/c Erica kept gettin the 8 ball in. It was great. Lots of fun. Not something I'd do all the time, but it was okay to do every now and then. Whats funny is it took so little to even get us dizzied. Then we went online and I knew I was bad when I cuddnt even type. Like, I could, but I was like messin the words up. Then today I headed to the mall w/ mom and Joe and that was an adventure. I got new pants for Valentines Day (night) and new leather jacket.  And that was my fun filled weekend. Hope yours was just as good. 4 days till Mickey. x0x
