Basically, it snowed a little overnight, then it froze rain for a while, and now it's raining like mad and +5C.  Not quite the blizzard they told us to brace for, but what the heck.  It's February.  Might as well have some fun with the silly ol' Canucks.  I am doing nothing today.  Well, that's not quite true.  I did a load of laundry (big woo-hoo) and I'm watching the series "The Thin Blue Line" with Rowan Atkinson from 1996-7.  I taped it off PBS then and still have it, pledge drives and all intact.  Good day to stay inside.  Got the grading done yesterday and ran out of room for any more work in my bag so that's all I have to do until Sunday.  I can deal with that.  More to come...
