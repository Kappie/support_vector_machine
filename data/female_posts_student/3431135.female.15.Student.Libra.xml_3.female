I don't think i have d reason for making this... but i just don't wanna lie to you 100 percently (haha) therefore now i'm saying dat i'm kinda inspired and i kinda know what's my true objective on involving to such a thing like this and i think it's kinda awkward doing this in an awkward time of an awkward day... It's just bcoz of my self-made criteria: 50% for fun and 50% for some sort of things that pushes me to finally show my feelings, experiences, views, etc...         Suddenly I think there should be a side of me who can at last reveal my long time (not so long..hehe) suppressed self... I realized dat i'm already racing near to the next stage of life and that made me think that i should already begin adapting myself into the grown-up ones and avoiding my childish ones... I think this may seem too serious but i realized it's not! It's just the reality... and nobody could escape from this reality. Instead, we should stand firm and face this "reality"...
