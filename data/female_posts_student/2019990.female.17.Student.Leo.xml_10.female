I found a cool little boys Gator BasketBall shirt, with a number, and name on the back and everything.  Lola found one too, so we're going to wear them to the after prom party.  Exciting stuff!  Wren even made me a duct tape coin purse on the way home, because I don't have a wallet, and am using a plastic bag.  She's too cute.  We got some good interviews, and we got Wren trying on a wedding dress with Dorthy esque ruby slippers.  It was awesome.   I also watched Requiem for a Dream tonight.  I'm officially never taking drugs.  (Since we all know I was going to before I saw it.)  But oh man,  that's a really depressing movie.  It scared the poo out of me.  I can't decide if I'd remcommend it or not.  Definitly not if you're faint of heart, but it was really well done.
