Our culture has, over the past hundred years, and noteably further back in history, become more and more open-minded. Such a label as being 'open-minded' is in general association with liberalism in today's society. So, in correlation with this association, is conservatism close-minded?  I would personally consider myself moderate to liberal; riding the fence while leaning to the left considerably. In no way a radical, but in  no way  conservative. So the question remains: is there room for conservatism in a liberal society? Conservatives would obviously argue that liberalism is simply one side of the fence, and that society itself can not be liberal. But how is society  not  liberal? Our world is relying more and more heavily on youth, change, and radical movement.  Perhaps it would be easy to ramble with case after case, example after example as to why and how society is liberal. But I think the best example of society's leftism is in education.  While visiting the college I plan to attend, a woman commented that the small, liberal arts college was 'a bit too liberal' for her and her daughters. I was taken back by her statement, because I wonder: how can education be  too  liberal? There are very few institutions of higher education that aren't leaning toward liberalism these days. And education should be open-minded, a bit radical, and, well, liberal. Education makes the generations, and generations form society.  Even conservatives are becoming liberals. The far-right conservatism of the past really doesn't serve the same purpose (or even appropriateness) in society that it once did. Modern conservatism is fusing with moderation and blending with the open-mindedness of liberalism.  For that matter, society as a whole is fusing into one giant, liberal community. Social acceptance of all issues is on the rise in the world today, from gay marriage to pro-choice to feminism. Truly, of course, no society can realistically stay too far left. We are not in an era where society is swinging left, but rather, an era where society is coming to a slow rest in the middle. In the past several hundred years we recovered from far right society, and are soon to peak far to the left, if we have not done so already. We have learned from the problems facing a radically conservative society and also from the problems facing a radically liberal society. Conservatism, to put it bluntly, is facing a sharp decline. And in our current course, liberalism may very well do the same. Our society is headed for moderation.  So why would I spend my time contemplating the fact that society is headed in a general direction of balance and well-being? Because of exactly that. It is my theory that balance is the key for a completely distopian society. Our society, our economy, our future as a growing, excelling race is based upon radical distinction. Radical separation. The direction of restitution in society that we are heading for is in no way a positive middle ground. Balance in such a way would be the downfall of the economy, the downfall of productive society, and the downfall of an excelling race.  So what is this liberal trying to say? Within the next 100 years, it is necessary for conservatism to make a rebound. Conservatism is vital to society. We must continue the swinging pendulum between leftism and rightism. For the sake of our economy, for the sake of our society, and for the sake of our race, radicalism is vital. -Shauna Zajac
