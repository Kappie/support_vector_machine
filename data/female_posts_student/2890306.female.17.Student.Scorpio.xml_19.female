I know I am going to have a great time becoming better friends with those two.  After dinner, we went to Laura's house and watched  Cold Creek Manor , which Geoff and I both forgot we had already seen.  Already seen TOGETHER, might I add.  Tee hee.  Well, I'm talking to someone on the phone, and after that I'm off to bed.  Later, lovelies...  P.S.  If you care to, take the quiz I made.   Clickie here to go to it.
