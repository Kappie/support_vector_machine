Whether a writer is considered good or not, depends entirely on who is reading the writing. At the moment the only people that read what I write are my family, and they are not exactly unbiased. A few of my friends of read some of my stuff, but they also are not the most reliable source for a fair assessment.   I have already come to the conclusion that any attempt at poetry will end in a disastrously, uneven piece of sap. The stories I write how ever are different. Despite the harshest criticism that I can personally lay on them, I am not convinced that they are bad. I can not even convince my self that the are only alright. In fact there are a few I think might actually be good, or perhaps very good, I shy away from great though, few things are ever great, and I do not believe I can compose anything that will fall in to that category.   So I am left with the same dilemma I began with how can I decide if I am a good writer? After pondering for a good ten minutes (I would ponder longer but this is a very uncomfortable chair) I come to the conclusion that I must try to publish a book. If it gets published and people like it, I will say I am a good writer. If it doesn't get published and nobody likes it I will say, " Well, at least I wrote a book what do you do?"   -Driel
