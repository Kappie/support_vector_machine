It's a short review of Quentin Tarantino's  Kill Bill :   Kill Bill is just another run of the mill revenge tale dressed up with lots of martial arts action and blood. The Bride (Uma Thurman) is the one out for revenge.  On her wedding day, her husband-to-be was killed, she was beaten up and her unborn child was stolen from her womb.   After waking from a four-year coma she sets out to even the score with the five people responsible: Bill (David Carradine), Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Copperhead (Vivica A Fox), Side Winder (Michael Madsen) and California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah).   What follows is a fairly typical Quentin Tarantino bloodbath. By the end of it all youâ€™re left is numb and bored.    It's nice to know not everyone in the world is enamored with Tarantino's style.  I have never really been able to get into his movies.  I admit he has a certain style, and is certainly very consistent in sticking to it, but I categorize him with Oliver Stone - both of them make very competent, but somewhat hackish and brutish films.  I guess I just prefer more subtle work, and while this is not a universal proposition, there is something about those two directors' particular unsubtlety - perhaps the fact that is is beyond unsubtle and is instead like being assaulted - that I do not care for.  That said, I haven't seen  Kill Bill , either volume, so I say nothing specific about the merits of that particular film.  Perhaps someday I can bring myself to watch it.
