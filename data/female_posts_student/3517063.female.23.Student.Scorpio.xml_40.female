Of course I had to phone everyone to tell them the good news, and of course my parents pointed out that somewhere along the line I had lost two points (I believe they were joking, but still...) Looking at the answer sheet, I realized that three of the four question I answered wrongly were on the last section, which was logical reasoning. And that I could have scored a 180 had I answered two more questions correctly. In short, had I concentrated harder, I would have had a 180.  But seriously - I'm ecstatic. Couldn't be happier. Stayed up until 4:30 AM playing Trivial Pursuit with my boyfriend on my Xbox while getting wasted. I lost a lot. But I scored a 178, so things will be fine.  Good times, good times.
