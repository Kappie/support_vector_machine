Maybe I should buy Hello Kitty instead of borrowing. At least I can say it is mine and look after it well. Not like some readers who went and glued the pages together and cut out some cute pictures they want. It is so damn outrageous! Down to these people! If I really like a particular picture, I don't cut it out, I will photcopy it at Toa Payoh Library where they provide Colour Photocopy service. Hiaz... Library Books are for all to share and care, not to conquer it and say it is yours. Anyway, I managed to found one particular picture in the H.K. magazine and it is similar to my blog's wallpaper! The H.K. don in a blue gown with her crown. So gorgeous! It cost about 5000 Yen for a large one, which is about S$75. Whoa!
