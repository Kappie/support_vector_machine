Kevin and Allie found out they're having a little baby boy... and Kev is the sweetest person in the world and told me he would seriously consider naming the little guy after Michael... or Someone Michael or something of the like so long as Allie doesn't throw a fit, which I doubt She would.. Allie is the most wonderful person on the earth... aside from Kev... they deserve each other very much.  Chris and Nancy found out that they are having twin baby girls, hooray for Nancy who is naturally going to name one of them after me... poor Chris *L* Little Kelentina and Krisarley just to keep everyone happy... Hey, at least they'll have unique names! (What I want to know is if Ethan and Joaquin sound like golfer names... are the girls names going to sound like.. what... tennis names? actress names? russian dancer names? hehe... ) Chris wants Michelle - as a female play off of Michael - which is even sweeter... I think Chris was a lot closer to Michael than anyone knows or realizes... which makes me happy to know someone was as close to him as I was..  2 days left! Woo what a countdown. Heres something entertaining... My creative writing teacher has asked me to bring back for her.... of all things... shampoo.... I nearly didn't believe her until She brought the bottle in for me to see. So for Ms. Perley-Waugh I shall bring back shampoo... rocks for my friends (seriously, they want them) and some british teen mags. Fun stuff. Who's keeping the list for me? Anyone else want anything?
