Miracle: the Disney flick about the 1980 US Hockey Team.  The Good: The Hockey… as a novice fan I really enjoyed the hockey. The feel of the film was right. It felt like the 80’s – and the current events were well organized and the background for the time period was just right. It looked like 1980 in the movie…which still looked like the 70’s really so they hit the nail on the head there. The technology was right and everything. Kurt Russel as a hockey coach - a new kind of role for him really…and he jumped into the plaid pants and ran with it.   The Bad: Disney missed out on a great soundtrack here. They could have done A LOT more with it. The portrayal of the Russian team was fairly one sided. The director missed out on a lot of chances to create more interesting and plot moving parallels between the two teams and coaches.  There is a hint of it in the final game…but not enough to actually achieve anything. The last game of the Olympics isn’t shown…the US team didn’t win the gold after beating the Ruskies…they had to go on for one more game and beat another team. This was a key element in the story…and I feel it should have been shown. At least more than just a blurb. And, the plot line was a little typical. I mean, how many “coach as pseudo father figure who rallies the players by challenging them” movies do we really need? Plus the role of supportive, somewhat neglected wife/mom who provides strength gets a little tiresome.  The Ugly: Kurt Russel’s suits. I mean they were the worst of the worst for the time period but that’s not really my complaint. He doesn’t wear them well. They all looked new on him…not well enough worn.  Some of the hair and mustaches in this movie may make you want to run away.  The volume. It is a loud movie. Loud as in lots of cheering, buzzers, and general ice hockey noise. This is not a movie to watch if you are sneaking around after curfew or someone else is sleeping nearby. There is a made for TV movie titled Miracle on Ice, another movie titled Do You Believe in Miracles, that were both made about the 1980 US Hockey team…a while ago. Hello lack of originality in subject matter.  Overall: Rent this movie! Rent it for fun. Rent it with a sports fan. Rent it to get into the Olympic spirit…rent it for a flavor of the world in 1980. You can even make a quadruple ice-sports movie feature: Miracle, The Mighty Ducks, The Cutting Edge, and Men with Brooms.  Bonus: check out this ice skating movie database for any movie that even slightly has something to do or a scene with ice skating in it…cool! http://www.eskatefans.com/movie/index.html  Bubba Ho-tep: a Bruce Campbell (Evil Dead series) movie about an Elvis impersonator and JFK impersonator living in a convalescent home who discover that their fellow residents are falling victim to a soul eating, cowboy looking, ancient Egyptian Mummy. Yeah. This was one of my hubby’s choices.   The Good: Ossie Davis does extremely well as a black man convinced that he’s JFK dyed brown after the shooting to hide him out. Bruce Campbell does a great job with his Elvis impersonations. Peanut Butter and Nanner sandwich just rolls off his tongue. The Script: although it made me squirm occasionally to think of things I would rather not consider…it was extremely well written, original, creative, and made good use of inner/outer monologues. The editing: although unexplained there is a fast forward, clipped images style to some of Elvis’s views…these are done well. There are some great characters in this movie. And it was nice to see a Matlock sidekick (the young pup lawyer he takes under his wings in the later TV Movies…) playing a bit part as a funeral home employee. The acting is the gem in this movie…you really believe that they are Elvis and JFK – they so thoroughly believe it and the audience just wants to go along. The best of the good: the way they played with the cuniform. From the bathroom stalls to the subtitling I loved these concepts.  The Bad: This movie can’t decide whether it’s a B Movie, a horror movie, a character study, or a mystery. It doesn’t truly succeed as any of them so it makes it difficult to appreciate in any light.  The pacing of the movie is slower than Elvis with a walker. Not even the good acting can save it. The elderly pace doesn’t seem intentional to make a point about the world/lives of the characters either…it just seems badly done.   The Ugly: The scenes with the Scarab. Although my hubby says they are probably awesome for the budget they were working with, I was just waiting for the chainsaw to come out (See Evil Dead series to get this reference.) The mummy. I know he’s supposed to be ugly but still. The make up on Elvis is the ugliest thing in the movie though. Bruce Cambell is a young man…too young for this role. The sideburns are down right scary and badly done.   The Interesting: Some of the discomfort the movie conveys is very intriguing if not enjoyable. There are a lot of close up detail shots of ordinary object in this movie. Interesting.  Overall: I found myself searching for the nail clipper out of boredom half way through the movie. This was due to the pacing and my general lack of B Movie love. I want a t-shirt that says “I survived Bubba Ho-Tep,” and rent this with a B Movie Fanatic, with a dude you want to impress with your “Non Girly Movie” flexibility, or if you are wanting to have a Bruce Campbell Triple Feature or something (god forbid.) Mr. Campbell does have quite an underground cult following as I understand it. Way underground. Check out his autobiography for an interesting dose of life as a B Movie actor – “If Chins Could Kill.”  Chasing Liberty: starring Mandy Moore as the president of the US’s daughter who is tired of being babysat by the Secret Service and takes off for a trip around Europe with a stranger with a secret of his own.  The Good: This movie is funny! Its fun to watch! Mandy Moore is actually a talented actress – and I am looking forward to “Saved” which is coming out soon to see if her ability to choose movies and roles has improved. The film is shot in Europe so you will get a nice dose of great views, awesome architecture and accents. The Six Million Dollar Man references seriously cracked me up as random humor. The President is well played and subtly we all know he’s a democrat (with a few Clinton references to boot) without the movie actually saying so.  Left me wondering if the movie was based on a real life adventure of Chelsea or something.  Two great performances were also added by the two main Secret Service agents on Mandy Moore’s tail. The president’s daughter’s traveling companion is well done too – he’s a hotty-geek sort with a great british accent and a brilliant dead pan…what more could you ask for? They were interspersed in the action well, had a nice secondary story line, and were funny in their own right. Also, as a bonus, the soundtrack is REALLY AWESOME…with no obvious sign of Mandy Moore on it.  The Bad:  A little typical at times, but nothing overwhelming. The cut scenes are to be avoided like the plague…there is a reason they were cut. Mandy Moore’s costuming is seriously lacking and relatively blech-worthy overall. It doesn’t really take away from the movie too often…but it doesn’t add a thing and sometimes just doesn’t seem to work.   The Ugly: Ummm…I am trying to think of something to put here. Erm ...her hair in the beginning of the movie…bad wigging! That is definitely ugly. The love parade seems fairly un-authentic and way too much like MTV Spring Break, and the British punk-esque backpacker that they meet is a little over the top although still funny. They try to pack every stereotype possible into that character but he somehow still manages to come through all right.  Overall: Better than average teen coming of age movie. Funny as hell. My hubby admitted he liked it better than Bubba Ho-Tep. Watch this with anyone, alone, or in a triple feature of Mandy Moore – A Walk to Remember,  How to Deal, and Chasing Liberty. Also keep your eyes peeled for “Saved” in which she plays the “villainess” who is the ultimate bible thumper.  So that’s the movies in review recap from earlier this week. We have been catching up on the movies we missed in the theatres and other rentals we have missed.  There is still more to be reviewed in this blog. This is why a long recap is troublesome.  Girl With a Pearl Earring: Scarlett Johansson and Colin Firth.  A period piece about a young girl working as a maid to support her family in the house of Johannes Vermeer.  The Good: Scarlett and Colin do amazing jobs with their characters. Definitely keep your eyes open for their future careers. The color of the movie is really well done and nicely handled.  Scarlett plays a maid, and she does the work of a maid in the movie – unlike some movies where they just skim through that sort of thing. She is very authentic in her portrayal of emotion and interest and love and frustration and innocence. Yet another great love story, in which the lovers do not consummate their relationship. The tension is excellent, the emotion is raw, and the torture of what is forbidden is amazing without being in any way over blown.  The Bad: It is never explained why she keeps her hair covered ALL THE TIME. Is it religious? The ending is a little clumsy. The audience wants to know if she ends up with Piotr. It’s left up to interpretation…with nothing there to interpret. The delivery by the teary eyed head maid at the end also raises some questions. My hubby wondered at that point if it meant that Vermeer’s wife died. That thought didn’t even cross my mind. Translation…this is highly unclear.   The Ugly:  The soundtrack soars with horn segments and trumpeted announcements. Its far too loud. Its downright out of place at times.  Great touches: the paint mixing and coloration – most people have no idea that paints didn’t always come in tubes. The ice and cold and weather – little details like this make the movie feel more real. The lighting – amazing cinematography really. Did it win an Oscar? Was it nominated? The wife of Vermeer was portrayed as being a really beautiful woman. I liked that. She was a character with flaws…but she was a physical beauty nonetheless. The mother in law was well done and well played…the relationship of the painter and his family with the Patron is well explored with interesting results.   Overall: Rent this, its just a great movie with a great story, that is just really well done. It was worth seeing in the theatres by all means…but it never came to my small dinky West Virginia town.  THAT’S ALL OF THE MOVIE REVIEWS UP THROUGH THIS WEEK’S VIEWINGS. *pant pant pant*  Still to come soon: The Company – a dance movie, The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai – a B movie ala the Sci Fi genre, Harry Potter III, Van Helsing, and Connie and Carla.  For now that’s all the news in fits of print --Mack
