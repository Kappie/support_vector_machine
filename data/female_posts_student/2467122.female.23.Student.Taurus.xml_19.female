Why can't you just go to classes when you feel like it?  I would do so much more work if I actually felt interested in the course content.  Alas, such is the life of a college student- it is a hard path to hoe, but I'm doing the best I can...  In other news, this Spring Break was not all for naught.  I went to the  urlLink Foxy Lady  in Brockton (for those of you who don't know what that is, use your imaginations- or click on the link, DUH!) on Saturday night.  It's amazing what you can see pierced there, and I am somewhat inspired.  We can just leave it at that.  Again, you may use your imaginations.  Just looking for a way to kill time between classes that is more interesting than doing actual assignments.  It's not easy being a world-class slacker, but someone's gotta do it!  I guess that nothing else of interest has happened lately, besides my eventful trip on Saturday.  So I suppose that I will leave it at that.  ttfn,  *me*
