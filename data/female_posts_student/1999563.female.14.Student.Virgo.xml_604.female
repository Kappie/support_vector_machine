My CYT friend Erin came so I just hung out with her and we talked about Tim for like 2 hours...it was odd. I was being really open! Cheers for me. I told her like my life story. Like about he-who-shall-not-be-named and every guy who has ever won my heart. [well..like all 2 of them]   It was nice. I barley even know her but I could tell her everything. I am make steps in the right direction!!  See, I trust no one. I think it's because I have been hurt in the past from telling my secrets. but now, nothing is a secret, I am an OPEN book.  Read me.    TABLE OF CONTENTS  Chapter 1- The importance of me being born in a subaro Chapter 2- I run for president of the United States at age 6 Chapter 3- I begin turmiol by registering at CAM Chapter 4- I start highschool Chapter 5- My heart belongs to Tim Chapter 6- I become a rock star Chapter 7- My album becomes platinum Chapter 8- I marry Tim [i can't forget that chapter!] Chapter 9- I become the first female president of the United [Whoaaa.blonde moment. It took my like 30 seconds to spell that word...sad... :) ] States Epolouge- I die!!   Wow.  What a great book!  Ok, I was totally kidding.  My life will probably end at chapter 5.  Well, my future will end, I will just become a homemaker longing for what I could have been.  Oh well. I least I will be raising godly children!  So, tomorrow I have to go to CAM to get my yearbook. I think I am going to die. That place gives me nightmares!! But, you all HAVE to come at 11 so we can hang! yippeee.  Dude, After having like 3 inspiring posts in a row I kinda have to write something that acctually is meaningful.  hm.  I will think of something.  *thinks hard*   Hebrews 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.  This is a powerful verse.   Just imagine your at the olympics. You qualified for the race and you have trained for years. You put for feet on the starting blocks. "Bang!" the whistle goes off. You try to run like you have practiced a thousand times but you feel suddenly jolted back. You loook and you are tied to the blocks!! Can you win the race?? I don't think so.  As Christians we need to untie all the knots from our past life that we are still tied in. We can't run when we are tied down! For me, these knots were trying to have clothes in style and having lots of money. Everyone strugles with different things so I can't really generalize.  But we are tangled in sin! How can we run the race God inteded for us when we are held down by the sin of the World?   1 Corinthians 9:24-25 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.  Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.    Don't you think its well worth it guys?! I mean I am not gonna deny that it brings satisfaction to have a pair of 100 dollars jeans but that satisfaction doens't last long! If we give up the joys of the world and chase after God's eternal joys we will have WAY more sasfaction than clothes or riches will ever bring you. And God's joy lasts FOREVER!  Have an awesome week you all!! I am heading to cannon beach for a couple days so I might not be able to update. I might walk to the library or something. We will have to see how it goes!!  I love you guys SO much.  Your buddy,  Laura
