(ok, so i've "seen" him once since then *today) but he's called a bunch, left a message yesterday, then today i see him...just so happens he works at one of my favorite stores so there's no way to just not go there (hello, stay away from target? not happening! lol) so now i'm feeling guilty, as if it's for some reason and i'm avoiding it or wutever..but i don't know what that is! i say i don't like the kid...cuz i don't know him, maybe i'm SUPPOSED to get to know him or something, but this is not wut i need rite now! i need some time to relax and get myself together, i mean it's summer, and i choose NOT to have summer romance, ESPECIALLY not w/him! i mean, i hear he likes some other chick so i'm not worried, but then somehow i am worried cuz wut if he doesn't "get the hint" and cease to call...and then wut if i keep seeing him around, i can't act like i don't see him forever! i can't act like nothing happened forever! i can't be like...well, he prolly forgot! as you can see this is distracting my thots quite greatly, and all i wanted to do was write a summary on the colony at roanoke!! so my thots r out, the jury is as well...we'll see! changedfish
