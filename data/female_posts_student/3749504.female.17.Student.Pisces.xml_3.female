Plus, Zach is on vacation, so he hasn't e-mailed me lately. I miss him immensely.  It's hard to find good people online that you can talk to. I certainly haven't in years, if you don't count Dane, who isn't fun to talk to anyways, and I just put up with him because we go to the same school.  So I want to make some "new friends" to chat with, because I'm pretty lonely when I'm online now. I mean,  She  is gone, perhaps forever, and all of my old best online friends are never on any more.
