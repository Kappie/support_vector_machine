I guess I'm ok with that, I wasn't fanatical about the movie anyways and I'm supposed to stay home to practice tonight. I just needed to talk to someone to erase that horrible feeling. I'm actually dressed in something un-pajama-like; relatives are over and I was told to get dressed for dinner.  So the dream went something like this: Austin picked up a phone call for me and pretended to be Lydia. He said a whole bunch of crap, and then someone called me teling me that Jess was mad because I said something horrible to her. I didn't know what she was talking about. I go back to school and everyone accuses me of being homosexual (?) and of cheating and of being a generally bad person for not showing up to anatomy physicals tomorrow. Something like 42 million people turn against me, and the only friends I have left at school are my counselor and Mrs. Battaglia. I cry and cry and cry, and all the while the soundtrack to Gone with the Wind is playing. Cut to a scene from Anatomy: people are getting ready for physicals day. Somehow Charlie's there too. We work through the night and in the morning we're still there, ready to go to the hospital. Bowman has a trailer called the "Expensive Vehicle"--It's written on a license plate, though now I realize it couldn't fit. Another scene shows Austin, Grandma and me at the curbside of one of the houses in this community and we're eating their discarded food. The matron of the house turns into her driveway in a red sedan (I remember she's blonde) and gives us a menacing stare, but nothing more. And then both Mom and Grandma pop their heads in the door and tell me to get ready for dinner by 7:30. PM. I thought it was morning already.  This just goes to show you how much of dreams are picked from snippets of everyday life. The homosexual comment was from a conversation with Wendy last night:  Me: I have a habit of liking people too easily Wendy: Really? I never noticed Me: yeah, it's bad Wendy: Well, it's ok. Otherwise I would have thought you were homosexual. j/k  Something like that.  Cheating comes from my general hatred of cheaters. Anatomy physicals day is tomorrow. I'm vaguely afraid of Jess's sensitivity and try not to irritate it. I probably have 42 mil in my head from Earth Club facts today. I was told Bowman's daughter Shelby was adopted today. I saw Charlie in Earth Club, he's started wearing a hat. Please don't, Charles. Eating was probably from a sign I saw at the gate about some community fiesta whose blueblood revelers will shame my parents in their social awkwardness.  That's another issue. We're studying racial writers in English, and there's a selection by Amy Tan called "Mother Tongue" in which her mom speaks bad English but is educated at the same time. I think of my own mother and her imperfect English. Yes, sometimes I'm a bit ashamed of it and I wish she wouldn't be so brusque or inarticulate, etc. Dad's simply quiet, I really have no problems there except the occasional badly-worded email. As someone who values communication so much, it annoys me particularly that my parents don't speak good English.  Wow, that wasn't particularly articulate.  It's going to be a slow Friday night, I know it. Fun.
