So yeah, I was totally all confused yesterday, but this morning when I woke up it was just like "why?". I couldn't understand why it seemed like I had so many options to choose from yesterday, when I had made up my mind over a week ago! My mind is made for the moment, and I'm not going back on the decision. That wouldn't be fair to anyone. I'm not going to let this get me down, so hey, be happy, right?    Right!
