I just realised, the next best thing to oldies [for music] is very very soothing music!  - Time to Say Goodbye - Only Time - You Raise Me Up etc.  and Jamie Cullum is FANTASTIC!  Enough about music. I love the fact that i'm not addicted to blogging anymore! See! 3 days without a single entry! YaY! =D
