I brought a deck of poker cards for the lesson but we end up performing magic tricks instead! They were quite amazed(i tink) by some tricks i performed! Hee.. Managed to take a few photos too(visit my   urlLink webshots  ). There are also clips i've recorded but there is no way i could find to post on the net so for those who want them, feel free to find me in MSN and I'll send em to u. Too bad for 406 we had the party there n i tink it's pretty messy for their lesson later. OoPs! =p     Updates at 8.45pm!  Had lunch with SaiLam n went around Comics Connection n other shops... After tat went to play basketball with 2 Ivans, Guo Wei, Zhan Yuan, Yi Ren, Yi Peng and Jian Long. Really exercised a lot! In de end only Ivan, Guo Wei, Jian Long n me left at the CC playing with other people. Saw Dominic there too! Well anyway, i had a fun time there. Tml still have to go to Mr Kelvin's wedding. Almost forgot.. Hehe.. =p  Lucky Jason reminded me. My sis got discharged from the hospital earlier than expected today! In pretty good condition, only cannot laugh too much or move too much, or the back will hurt. Hehex.. Well then.. Gotta surf around den off to bed! Oh ya, 6 more days. Thanks to all visiting my blog here! N thanks to those who made comments here.. I'll continue to update it~    Birthday Cake   Quote: The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate.
