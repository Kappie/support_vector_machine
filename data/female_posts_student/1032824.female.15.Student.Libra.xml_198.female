They play the guitar - acoustic, bass, you name it they play it. The piano, the drums, etc. Like WOW! Hahaha. ;) I totally adore them. Of course there's  urlLink Avril Lavigne  who plays the acoustic SO well on MTV,  urlLink Michelle Branch ,  urlLink Liz Phair  and  urlLink Lillix . GIRL POWER! Hahaha. They are all such great performers! * Dreams dreamily * I wish I could sing and play the guitar like them. Hee hee..  My sisters, Mika and Cherryn's boyfriends are coming over later to watch the Euro 2004 Match. That's a terrific idea because the past coupla' nights have been YUCK, really cannot fall asleep, what to do?
