So I have two days before classes start, and need to spend them getting ready for the new semester and writing a grant proposal.  Wheee, fun.  And it's weird, because it's for a $500 grant, which isn't much,  but they allow you to write up to 5 pages for your proposal.  Which seems a LOT to require for what is kind of a puny amount of money.  But, I'll just have mine be shorter and hope it's okay.    It was soooo nice to have a break... and I didn't even pine after the internet/IM.  Sweet.  Of course, I suppose it helped that the couple times I did log on, there wasn't generally anyone else online, anyway.    Supposed to snow 12 inches today.  Yay.  And I need to grocery shop, too, so I hope it doesn't start until later.
