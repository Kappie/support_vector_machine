Since Spinner/Netscape Radio finally let me down I have come to put my faith in VH1 to get me through the workday (even MTV's online radio pales).  So what am I supposed to do on a day when the VH1 site is down and I can't get into it?  I can't get my radio fix!  I can't find out what's new, who's singing with who, who sings what song... instead I am now stuck listening to Staff favorites on MTV.  The radio gets me through work at a nice pace... today is going to be very very slow.
