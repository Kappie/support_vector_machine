Gosh, this is beginning to scare the shit out of me. Hope that I won’t shit on my pants if I read it once more. Damn Sakdary. Bad Sakdary. Bad bad bad Sakdary.   Here is what he wrote:  HERE IS THE POEM FOR YOU: SADARY My lonely eyes shimmer oh so quietly. As your picture perfect frame graced my presence I heard you walk pleasantly by my way. I completely absorb every inch of you into my curious mind. The intoxicating smell of your sweet perfume, Spell bound me like extreme insanity. My idle thoughts ran like a broken record: "Hello Miss? Is it me you've been looking for?" Yet I could not open my lips to tell you: "I want you", “I need you" and most importantly " I am oh so deeply in love with you". I am like a mentally un-bloomed rare flower. That needs your soft touches and your light caresses. You are the butterfly that always passes me by. Without a second thought, you fly pass me I wish you would just perched your body on top of me. Use your skillful tongue to taste my inner core. This nectar is oh so sweet and oh so rare. Feel how long it's been waiting, wanting, and wishing. Make me spread my delicate petals out as far as I can. Feel my limbs and stems shaking uncontrollably. And feel me burst out with all unmentionable joy. As I bloom into sweet extasy. Feel the never-ending explosion with ever breath you breathe into me finally...Blooming into a beautiful flower on top of you... I hope you like it..hehehehe    I have just realized that I, Sakdary have the actual power to turn SOME GUYS upside down. Just here to mess around, have something on the side but this isn’t want I was looking forward to. This is truly not my mentality. I didn’t persuade this to happen. All I really need are true friends just to chat with. However, this has gone out of hands. I am just an infatile child what can I say.   This guy is a very handsome man and very nice. But elaborately, this isn’t my plan for all of this to happen.  I am not looking for anyone at this time. I’d better disconcerted myself out of khmer connection before things gets worst again. Never ever will I be on khmer connection as Sexy-Sadary anymore. Good-bye khmer connection.    Guys, if you are trying to impress me, please do not sweet talk me down. I wont fall for it but I will eventually push you very far away. My completely intentional is challenging because I have an opinion and decisions to make. I have a life and my freedom is very valuable to me. So don’t try and push the button.
