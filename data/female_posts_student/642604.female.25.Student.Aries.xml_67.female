FINALLY! I swear I keep watching because every once in a while the show catches my interest again but I cannot wait till its over! Finally I can give up watching a show I watch mostly out of tradition... now if only Friends will take the hint... OH AND Buffy is probably over after this year because Sarah Michelle Gellar doesn't want to resign. Now that will make me sad. I still love that show to this day... Angel better get better because it's the only substitute I've got... how sad is it that I am totally addicted to teen television? Damn my sister. If it hadn't been for her wanting me to tape that Dawson's Creek premiere back when it first began I wouldn't have gotten into that or Buffy which happened to come on right before... NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!
