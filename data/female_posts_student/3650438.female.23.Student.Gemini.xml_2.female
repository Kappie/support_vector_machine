However, I will leave it up there for the time being, since he seems to like it so well.  Mostly I hate the glasses, they're Ian's, and I've made fun of them  since the day we met, but this my best attempt at a Top Gun impression, and I'll admit it does have a secret service quality to it.  And besides, Top Gun ... the volleyball scene, need I say more?    So as you might have noticed, I've kept the Eminem theme alive, although it did necessitate finding my Eminem CDs,  but I'm kind of a theme person, so I have to run with it... and as often as I write in the blog, he'll probably have another album out before I run out of titles.  (just hope he doesn't sue me)
