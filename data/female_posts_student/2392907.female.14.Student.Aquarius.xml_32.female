I just wrote the words to fit... but you're very spontaneous and fun in this!)   omg omg omg what am i supposed to wear? Which perfume? Will I have to wear foundation? But I don't even like foundation! It dries my skin out.  Janey thinks... although she knows that worrying is completely futile. She calls up Nazrene in search of advice. "Hello?" "Hi Naz, it's Janey!" "Oh cool! So you coming to the partay then? We're gonna be having a ROCKING KINKAY TIME!!!" "Err.. maybe. It depends." Pause. "Depends on what?" Pause. "Err.. well actually, that's why I'm ringing you. I need some advice." "Really? I'm good with advice, me." "OK. Well, you remember Adam? Wait, you weren't there..." "Who, Adam Levine?" "Wha..? How do you -? Wha-? Where did you..." "Oh Janey Janey Janey... have you not taken any of our undeniable psychicness into account? Sure I haven't met the guy.. but badaboom I know him!" "Err... OK. Anyway -" "Omg, are you going out with  Adam ?" "Well.. I guess." "Then you can come to the partay!! Perfect!" "Yuh. But I need your advice on what to wear. he is so funny and amazing.. and he has his own band!! But I don't want to seem too... desperate.. and I dunno. He's so... random. In a wonderful way. And I've never met anyone quite like him. What am I supposed to wear? Do? Say? He's so.. different. I dunno what to do." "Hmm." Janey can hear Naz's brain tick. "How about that pretty little purple dress?" "The one I got from Prada?" "yuhuh." "You mean the one with the silk straps and the white.." "..embroidery with the little holey things at the bottom. Yes, that one." "How do you know about that dress?? I only just bought it yesterday!" Janey says, confused and scared. "Janey Janey Janey." Nazrene taps her nose, unaware that Janey cannot see her, "The psychicness!" "Oh, that. You know, you must stop doing that. it's scary."  "Ok." Nazrene shrugs, still unaware that she is on the phone. "Right.. so the purple dress. Isn't that a bit low?" "Don't worry darling.. It'll be fine." "Er.. ok." "And don't worry about the rest. It'll just come. Because he should be deeper than that.. and anyway.. it's a first date. You've already made a good impression. What else?" Nazrene says knowledgeably. "Ok. well, thanks for your help." "Byee!!" Jane puts down the phone, worrying about Nazrene's freaky psychicness and her "date".
