I will give a lil recap of yesterdays events    Monday 26th July    nothing much happened really...met the girls for our usual walk to school, got to school didnt do much really and i actually did work in classes but all i seemed to learn throughout the whole day is "u dont make friends with salad..." or chris, tim and zac for that matter hahaha...thanks to chris i had it stuck in my head and stupidly enough started singing the little tune around my baby sis...thanks to u guys i got woken up this morning (tuesday) to her singing it.. ARRGGHH!!!!. wat a great way to start the day aye lol..anyway back to yesterday, i dont really remember much of it except for the eating of the crushed up oreos at break  HAHAHAHA  and our walk around alllll the way to the back of our school grounds, its quite a hike, where we met the smokers and an asian that likes to grop people *cough*  FHIL  *cough* (btw im not blonde he just tells me to spell fhil that way)...anyway the day continued on with design and tech being the last and longest period of the day....i walked alll the way home with jenny cause her mum was too tired to pick jenny up....lol..jenny had a lil whinge hahha silly girl...i went home and sat on my computer for i duno how long discussing the geography assignemnt my group was doing but not actually starting my part of it till about 11.40 hehehe.....oh well ...and yes i watched the big brother eviction..even tho it really wasnt an eviction because they were taken out of the house and then told who won...so that kinda defeated the purpose lol..but good on ya Big Trev,..u deserved it!!!....i finally ended that day by going to bed at about 12.30ish which was kinda the next day but yeh thats beside the point.  So that leads me to where i am now...in today hahaha...i got rudely woken up by my sister singing that stupid lil song (thanks chris) and got a lift to school with jenny...suprise suprise while is at there alone as she was in an SRC meeting i actually did some work on my SGP and D design  *shock horror*  i can actually do work!!! ....once again when peopel started arriving i was reminded that u dont make friends with salad and then i headed off to first period to a teacher who think im lauren severino and i have problems and ...lauren is Erin Wood with major issues, including a heart condition...i think he is a hippy and needs to be fixed... QUICKLY ....the rest of the day was just as boring excpet when i got attacked by hassan on the way to class.... that was horrifying lol...that arvo we finished at 1pm and we went to hurstville and did our hanging thing but this time we only had beau and no chandu and we had to hear again all about their fight which is just sooooo stupid it isnt funny...but yeh they will get over it sooner or later...btw have safe travels in New Zealand bobo and watch out for the mutton dressed as lamb..haha u get it casue they have lots of sheep...ok well im amused lol...after hurstville i had to go to work where it was soooo busy....i finally finished at 11 after this islander group came in and bought like the entire store...i reckon they had the munchis personally casue they were talk about if fish fly do they become chickens....like WTF hehehe yeh well that ended and i came home to here...where i am sitting now all hypo eating icecream, oreos, mnm's and chocolate fudge...i wont be sleeping for a while..thats for sure!..thats it for now..im watching the OC on my computer lo...thanks sooo much Ralph mwa...
