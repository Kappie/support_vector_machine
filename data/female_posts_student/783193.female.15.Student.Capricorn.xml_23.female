It was because I watched the Two Towers right before, and I have to think about movies like that after I watch them, and then Jesse came five minutes early, and my hair was wet, and I had to do it in my room.. ugh. The Two Towers was actually.. not as good as everyone said it was, I think. I thought the first one was better. The battle at Helm's Deep was pretty cool, though. A lot of it had changed since the book, especially compared to how accurate the first one was. But still, the whole Pictionary thing was fun, especially with all the obvious word-picture things. I must say, the "bum" thing was pretty awful. Baahhhh.. now I'm doing the December newsletter, and trying to come out with a whole new layout. It's taking up too much mindpower, and I can't concentrate on this. Later..
