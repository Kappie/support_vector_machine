We practiced our openers, the different dances went up in front of everyone to show what they had worked on during the whole semester. Our dance came up in the show order...my group went up to meet in the middle of the floor, only to be greeted by two members of the e-board who felt that we needed to cancell our dance's show. I was bummed, we all were, but then I became outraged. Four out of the seven in our dance wanted to cancel our show...I and two others  wanted the show to go on.    I convinced the others two girls that we should be bold and continue on with the show...if the others didn't want to...that was fine, but I was going on with the show. That was monday night, by tuesday we had chosen our song. We had atleast two-thirds of the steps written down...and we were still pretty confident. Wednesday we were told we had to perform in front of the others...eek. It went well...we had changed up some of our moves. The outcome was that atleast we were still being ballsy, still going on with it. Thursday was our dress rehearsal, and our first practice at the auditorium, on the stage...and without music for a whole day...we had worked out all of our dance steps. And we were nervous as hell.   Friday, (yesterday), was the first night of the show...boy were we nervous. Atleast it all went well...there weren't really any flub-ups. Tonight, the best and final night of the show, we went out there and kicked ass. Everyone loved it, they all thought it was cute, and most importantly as Ashley's mother had noted "we did a a great job, not to mention having to get it done in three days." Way to go Ashley's mom. lol. I guess everyone loved us tap-dancing to The Beatles'  Help!  wearing some really loud, crazy shirts and long swinging scarves. Ha! How great was that! Totally awesomely great! That's what!  So now we're pooped, tired, and ready to learn more dances. But hey, when's the next time that dance troupe is going to have two rookie tap dancers (that didn't really know much about the dancing at all) and one several semester girl, up there on stage dancing as a trio and putting it all together in only 3 days before the show. You gotta give props for that.   Whew...well, going on with the show totally fulfilled my new year's resolution to  "be more brave, be more bold".  I totally beat that resolution down in less than two weeks into the new year. Rock on!
