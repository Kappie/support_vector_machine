I'm not going to say anything about the movie,  per se , because I dont want to ruin it for anyone, but do have to say that I was most fascinated by the whole psychological struggle of Peter Parker.  Poor Pete.  I mean, I think I'd have some serious issues too if had a super hero alter ego, wouldn't you?!  After we got home, I watched Barbershop 2 on DVD.  (heh. It was a night of sequels, I guess...)  It was only alright to me.  There were some definite plot holes and the story was basically the same as the first, Ice Cube could give up his principles and give in to 'the Man' or he can 'fight the power'.  YAWN.  I think the funniest part was when Latifa was going off on Cedric the Entertainer.  Oh, can we talk about Cedric for a second?  How and why does he get billed as Cedric THE ENTERTAINER??  Okay, so Latifa isn't a Queen either, and technically Ice Cube has a real name... okay I have no point here.  I realize this now... I guess we just think Cedric's stage name is more obnoxious than the others.  I mean, hell, if he doesn't entertain me, can I just call him C?  Hmmph.
