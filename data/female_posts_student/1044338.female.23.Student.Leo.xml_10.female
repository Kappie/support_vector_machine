Anyhow, at Roz's soccer game, they were playing the #1 team in their division, whom they had previously lost to 7 to 1.  After the first 5 minutes, Roz's team was down 3 to nil, and things didn't look too good.  They quickly rebounded and got a decent goal, then two penalty kicks got the game tied at the half.  To start off the 2nd half, they fell down 6 to 3 and we thought that the game was over.  They scored with about 15 then 10 minutes remaining, but had troubles controlling play for the majority of the remainder.  In the last minute, they sent out their #1 line (Teresa, Roz, and Christina - the power line) and Teresa brought the ball down to the offensive half, evaded some tackles, passed it through the crease, and Roz slammed home the tying goal with exactly 1.2 SECONDS remaining.  It totally rocked!  Amateur sport is equal or better than professional sport.  The only things that are missing are they hype and promotion.  Next weekend should be pretty fun as we'll be watching some U of A hockey, then taking a trip on memory lane, going drinkin' at the Plant, where we had MANY great and memorable nights.  later
