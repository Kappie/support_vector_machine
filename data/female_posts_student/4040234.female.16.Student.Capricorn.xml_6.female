Ya today is just blah... It's been a bad effing week.  I had off yesterday, so i wanted to go to sandcastle w/ M-Dizzle.  Well Nate was suppose to go too, so that just made me extra excited.  So we get their, and set our stuff down.. 5 mins later it starts to pour!!! We didnt even get to take our clothes off... I was so pissed, I spent $10 bucks to sent my bag on a chair and get rained on, thanks alot.  So we went to see a movie, and we saw 'The village', it as extremely lame.  It was good watching it, but afterwards it was like that was a bad movie.  The theme or plot was bad, I was very upset.  So then my parents pick us up aftewards, and I tell my dad what happened w/ sandcastle and he starts flipping out on me.  Why didnt you go till 3, its your fault, blah blah blah.  whatever.  I was like DAD!! ITS NOT MY FAULT IT FUCKING RAINED.  and it's not my fault we didnt get there till 3.  It's not like your lazy ass would drive me or anything.  And he keeps on going, oh well its your fault.  whatever fuck you!  anywayz he paid for it, he gave me a 20, i was gonna give it back but i said fuck it, u just lost 10 bucks not me.  So then last night Nate calls me, and says he's gonna take a shower and call me back.. and he was like dont go to sleep.. so i was like ok... ya well he never called back i was just a lil upset...       Today i had to work at 10.  Usually my dad drives me cuz he's up and whatever else not.  No not now.. He found a bus pass so now I have to get up an hour early and catch a bus while his fat ass sits at the table and eats.  AHHH he makes me so mad.. Works sucked as usual.  I sprayed myself w/ the hose so i was all wet and it just gets worse.  But i did make a $3 tip... then it starts to pour when i get off..  fuck it I'm not catching a bus in the rain so i call my pap.  And i tell my dad this, and he starts again that it's my fault shit.  Why did u call pap, blah blah... It's my fault that it fucking rained great!!! He said something else, and I was just like shut up, I dont want to hear it, It's not my fault i dont control the fucking universe.  Notice the more upset I get the more i use fuck... Yay!!!         Yup thats my life... hows yours.  I mean it's not bad, I just get aggrivated w/ it sometimes... Cant wait till I'm 18, I'm OUT!.. kinda like right now .. peace   P.S.  I seen Piccola today.. havent seen him since 8th grade... it was cool I guess.. i love seeing old friends.  :)
