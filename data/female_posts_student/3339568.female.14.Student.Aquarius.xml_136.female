But while Mel and KC and I were waiting at the bus stop this white car drove up 2 us, and it was Laura (Yr12 from our school) and she told us 2 hop in and gave us a lift. It was extreamley funny and cool. She goes - "So I see you guys r not wearing your blazers" And we're like - "Umm..." cept she goes  - "Haha, nice work, keep it up!!" And we had a big bitch about Roseville and all the teachers there. It was hilarious. I was practically choking I was laughing so much. But of course Mum doesn't know I got a lift in with her or she would go off at me. Meh. Her prob. But its better if she doesn't know!! She still doesn't know bout Rob driving me 2 the beach. Haha. She is so clueless. Sorri, but she is. Neway, man I really love this CD that Ash gave me!! Thanx Ash! :D Mmmmm.....school kinda still sux. Hammy had a physco at me  in English becuase Gem, KC, Ellen AND Ali (b4 it was just Gem) kept on giving me these sly suggestive looks weneva young love and love in general really was mentioned (we were doing presentations on Romeo and Juliet) Naturally I laughed at them, but Hammy failed 2 find the humor in the situation. Then we had 2 watch West Side Story, which is one of the worst movies I've eva seen! it was physically painful 2 sit thru it! Argh. Hmmm I'm feeling totally lazy. Lazy bum me. Some people seem 2 be acting differently  latley. Mmm..interesting...strange I'm sooo physced bout World Cafe!! :D Waitressing yeh!! And also bout Winter Sleepout. Yay! Neway I couldn't b bothered 2 type nemore, so i betta b off Beth
