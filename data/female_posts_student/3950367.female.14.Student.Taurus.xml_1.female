Enough with the corniness we must admit guys have really bad habits .. sometimes they really dont give a shit about anything --> slackers = beer all day haha but its fine but i say there are two four types of guys -->  THE GAYS , THE JACKASSES , THE ONE U WILL EVENTUALLY MARRY and THE ONES WHO R MEANT TO BE UR BEST FRIEND . But o well thats just my way of seing it , some people say there all the same but i dont believe that as i said every person is unik in its special way .*quote* we are all who we choose to be *
