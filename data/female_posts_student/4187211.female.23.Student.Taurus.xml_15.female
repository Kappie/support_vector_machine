Me and my roomate then proceeded to apply said paint to the wall at 9:30pm - not bothering with a coat of primer to help cover the dark purple currently covering the walls of my soon to be bedroom. Needless to say, we were tired, the purple showed through, and I realized how small this room really is. It shall be me, and my bed, and then the walls. Okay, it's not that bad, but it's definately the smallest room I've ever inhabited before! (It does, however, have nice big windows, a cool built in cupboard, and a funky old light fixture - having been designed as the dinning room). The colour is bright, but I think once I get everything in place it will be a happy medium.  I think that the idea of painting and choosing colours and decorating etc is always more exciting than the actual hard labour (big surprise there), and I am happy it's finished.  one more week and then we can be moving upstairs!  Yay for hardwood floors, a plethora of cupboards and shelves, a fireplace, and our own mailbox!  I'm planning on having a "moving up" party around then, so anyone living nearby who wants a nice dinner for the price of carrying a few items up the stairs, please give me a call. ;)  Well, it's time to remove the tape from the walls of my affectionately dubbed "medicine cabinet" room, here's hopeing no paint bled through!
