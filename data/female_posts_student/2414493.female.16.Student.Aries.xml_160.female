Listened to disturbingly loud iPod music in the media room. It could have been a dance party...only I was perched on the couch with notecards sprawled out on the ottoman, with Bailey open. Let the neighbors think we're wild children, yes.  Unusually quiet for 10:05, when I'm actually stirring to action on a normal day. It's a Friday night complex, when everyone thinks it's the last weekday and they're probably swarming the movie theatres and the restaurants and what have you. I like my quiet day, though. Tomorrow, I hope, will be satisfyingly noisy.  It's weird to see D with other girls--like L today. "Lydia, isn't it true that...?" I don't answer. D gives me a smile, like "I know the answer!" Goofy child. Maybe it's just overprotectiveness. Not possessiveness, I don't need it. Tiff made the observation that it was very interesting how he associates with similarly vapid, naive people.  Masochistic me--I'm pensively biting lips again and I didn't even notice until a few seconds ago.  And wait--I'm not done. Talked to Dorothy today, and I'm getting the same weird feeling I got from Wendy. It just really makes me wonder: am I equally dysfunctional? Stupidly captivated? Or have I just not seen enough concrete evidence to knock some sense into me? Character analysis is in order.
