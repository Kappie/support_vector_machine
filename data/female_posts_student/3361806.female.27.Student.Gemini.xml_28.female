Gary set up the tent for us since yesterday.. we are so lucky ;) When we walk in to the concert arena, first thing i saw is The Red Bull stage for x-game. Wow!! red bull, you are so good at marketing. And I see 2 big outdoor stages and many concert tents and lot of people all over the area.    And also see lots of shops and a big fun park which make me think about temple festival in Thailand.. I really miss that and feel want to go to see it again. Actually, every things that they provide in T in the Park is similar to temple festival. Except we can't set the camp in Thailand.   We start with the main stage,Franz Ferdinand concert. We are quite close to the front of stage. I enjoy to see they dance. Take me out, mathinee, etc.  Then we went to see lot of thing, fun park, drinking Tennent, eating pizza. I try to play the maching in fun park, just one. The result is I got headache after that.. ha ha ha .. stupid me ;p But I still enjoy staying there all day and all night:) We went to see the chemical brother and the last few songs of the snow patrol. Then play the bump car.. very fun but i got headache again!  I really hate myself about this kind symptom:(  In the cold windy night, we have just one sleeping bag which we though might be fine for wee people like us. But we ended up using one sleeping sheet to cover us and have to find some cloth to be underneath us.. MAN!! it's really cold!!! But hey, i'm ok.. it's a good experience for us ;) Next time, there will be 2 sleeping bag and a pillow for us ..  and i won't play that things anymore .. ha ha  We came back on Monday morning..  Get what .. while we were going home, the beat 106 DJ said that the ticket for next year will be available tomorrow!! and this year it was sold out in 10 weeks. Come on Man!, we don't even have any idea which band will be in the next year !!  We arrive home sweet home and sleep very comfy in wee bed..  Oh bed! i miss u!  xxx
