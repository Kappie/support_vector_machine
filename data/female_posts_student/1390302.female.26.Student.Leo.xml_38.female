Every single American has the right to be given an equal chance at success without the sad possibility of special treatment.  Affirmative action laws were written to protect the minorities: women, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and any persons who are considered to be a minority group in the United States.  As a woman, an American citizen, and someone who feels that she can stand on her own two feet and meet diversity head on, I oppose affirmative action.   When I moved to Texas in June of 1999 I got possibly one of the biggest surprises I had ever had.  I found that my now husband was unaware that women were not always treated equally in the workplace.  Being from Southern California and working for an employer who practiced such treatment of women, I was appalled to find that he couldn’t see it all around him.  His mother was a strong, independent woman who not only survived on her own but lived well and thrived.  With her as an example, his respect and opinion of women soared –making him perhaps a bit naïve to the societal problems women endure.  I make the observation that his mother, a woman who defeated the social norm, was a good example of how women are capable of making their goals with out special treatment or being looked down upon.  In this, his naiveté and his mother’s strength, I do make my point for all of the problems with affirmative action.  It is possible to overcome diversity, given the opportunity.  If affirmative action had been struck down as unconstitutional, more people would be forced to stand upon their own two feet and strive for their goals with more passion.  As it stands, affirmative action is a crutch for those who choose to lean upon it.  For every under-qualified person –weather they be a woman or an African American male- who is awarded with a position he did not earn and therefore does not deserve, we slap those who do deserve it in the face.    It is true that American has a long history of oppressing African American people, however we also oppressed the American Indians and Asians who choose to come here, and women as being a lesser part of “white” society.  Our past is filled with WASP leadership, yet it is not with out regret that these things were done.  Now, to grant minorities with affirmative action is to say that because they are not white and male they are not good enough to achieve higher standards by their own means and achievements.  This is simply not the truth.    Affirmative action is also a slap in the face to the so-called “majority” population.  For every college admission that is granted by race or gender, we are oppressing the other.  For example, if an individual is chosen for a college admission because of their color or gender and not their qualifications, we are oppressing the more qualified individual who was passed by for this affirmative action.  As a whole this issue is oppressive and no matter how we try to succeed at making life fair for all, someone is getting oppressed.  So now do we push for affirmative action laws for those oppressed by affirmative action?  In our society, however we may try to deny it, there exists those who are racist.  With affirmative action do we grant truth as a society to their beliefs?  These laws force everyone to look at life through colored glasses, force us to define and notice our differences in all of the most negative ways.  These laws grant to those who are racist the belief that everyone else is too.  It grants them the ability to believe that those of minority groups are automatically less qualified.  With affirmative action do we lend them truth to this claim?  Do we not breed less qualified individuals by accepting a lower standard and rejecting qualifications for the sake of gender or race?    The answer to all of these questions is yes.  There is nothing to be gained by oppression and racism.  There is nothing to be gained by affirmative action.  ~Kristyn
