It's so much funner and easier to listen to that book. It's deffinitly not my favorite. I think my favorite is book 4, then book 3, then 1 then 2 then 5. Yea, that sounds good. But, this book has some good parts. Right now the narrator is up to the part where Harry and Cho go into Hogsmead on Valentines Day. Who invited her into book five anyways? I'm a Harry/ Ginny shipper personally. Today was okay though. I put up chapter four on my web site (www.geocities.com/lauren_deb/). I think it's pretty good. My Sorting Hat song is pretty good, needs a little tweaking but oh well. HEY! Speak of Tweak, IM MISSING SOUTH PARK! Oh well, I'll catch the rerun a little later.  Any ways, Greg came over for a little bit today. We hung out on my porch and talked about how messed up our families are and his breath was terrible (lol just kidding!).  Well, that's about it for now. I'll talk to you tomrrow. (Florida on Saturday!) XOXOXOX
