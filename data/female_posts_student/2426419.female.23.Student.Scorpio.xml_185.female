Anyway, I'm posting in general terms. I like my life. I almost cried twice today because I am starting to realize that I'm going to grad school. I know that some people don't care or, rather, more school sounds like one of Dante's lower levels of hell, but for me, being accepted is pretty close to winning a Pulitzer prize or something in that manner. To be accepted . . . for creative writing . . . it feels like an honor to me. AND I know it's not some new or old ivy, but it sounds like a decent program to me. It sounds really nice.   The summer is good. I'm subbing. Selling candy (hee hee hee). Hanging out with friends that love me and that I love. I don't even really want a summer fling with anyone new. I'm not here but for the rest of the summer. I'd like to enjoy the friends that I'm really close to. Like Josh D. and Jaci and Auvrey. Maybe I'll even hang out with Meg, although it's easier hanging out with people who are single.   The word "subbing" looks weird.  Okay, I really should get ready for bed. I hate being exhausted in the morning. Playing on the internet is just so much fun. I don't technically have a job for tomorrow yet, so I should get off and call the computer system. Subbing is a pretty nice job. You won't get 40 plus hours . . . .it's not a full time gig, but if you want to work just a little and if $200 a week is enough for you (before taxes), then do it. It's not really work. I just bring my book and read the whole time or chat with the kids. I even met a senior who is going to be attending Oklahoma Christian in the fall. Okay, I'll try to go to sleep. I've checked my email and no new messages will appear tonight.   Let's play MASH. Or, as Ray Bailey likes to call it . . . CASH (c is for castle). cute, eh?
