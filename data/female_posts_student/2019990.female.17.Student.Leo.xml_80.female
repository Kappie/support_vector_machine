Finaly I had located everything except vanilla, and a mixer.  And I'm like whatever this is close enough to make cookies.  So I starte handmixing the dough, and was ready to put them on the pan, and I tasted the dough. It was pretty wierd, so I'm thinking, maybe the vanilla is a key ingredient in cookies.  So I searched for 15 more mins, and finaly found it, right under my nose.  I put them in the oven, and let them cook.  I came back to check them maybe 10 mins later, and they're still pretty runny.  I came back 5 mins later.  They have spread across the entire pan, and doubled in height.  I finally take the out, and they're kind of spongy.  Oh well, I put in the remaining dough, and promptly forget about them.  Twenty minutes later, I smell something, and remember that I was baking. I had to hrow those away.  They hurt my teeth.  Then I was washing the pan, and was using the sprayer.  Their sprayer has a bad temper.  I thought I had it under control, until I set the sprayer back in it's holder, and turned on the water.  Vengance usually isn't a common thing for apliances, but needless to say, I am now in different clothes.  Later on this morning, I had to go with my cousin to my aunt's ofice,(he didn't know where it was) to get his menegitis shot for college.  When we got to the hospital, we tried to take the elevator up to the fourth floor, we get in and push he 4.  The crazy elevator goes all the way down to the ground floor. We're like ok, push the 4 again, and it goes up one floor, and then back down again.  Finally it goes up to the 4th floor again.  Apparently this happens alot. Well this was a pretty long entry about nothing.  So I'm going to go.  See you all Tomorrow!
