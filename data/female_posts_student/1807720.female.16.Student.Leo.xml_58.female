We went sliding down this giant hill that connects to a road so like when you get to the bottom of the hill you just keep sliding down the road, but well you have to be careful not to get hit by a car.  And like this one time when we were going down the hill we were going like REALLY fast and like almost hit this guys garage door.  We keep going from the hill and starting going up the driveway and then we started to scream.  It was soooo funny and fun.  And then we had this big snow fight and me and Ash loaded up this sled and poured it onto Lenny.  And then Lenny jumped on top of me and we like feel over and then we started like rolling down the hill and then when we stopped I landed on top of him.  LOL.  He was like "Wow, that was some good fun but I got crushed by Vanessa's boobs" so yeah I guess they were kind of digging into him but after he admited that he liked it.  What a fun night.  On Friday the CALM carosel was pretty good.  Some speakers were really boring and others were interesting.  Like the lady from Best of Bridge was really good and had an interesting story but when that football player Mark Mcglouchlin (sp...?!?) came is was like sooooo boring.  And the phys. ed teacher there would NOT stop obsessing over him and kept telling us over and over again how many grey cups he was in and how many he won.  The first lady was really boring and I don't even remember where she was from, I think she might have been some sort of career counsellor.  And well the last guy was a student from our school which was pretty good and interesting, and he was funny but he needed a little bit of work on the public speaking.  The carosel thing ended a little bit earlier so I had some time to talk and so I talked to Matt about like me and Travis.  See like Travis always buys me all this nice stuff and pays for like everything and well I like that.  I like when I don't have to spend my own money and everything but like there are soooo many qualities about him that I don't like.  He is sooo not honest, I mean I am NOT stupid and I CAN tell when someone is lying to me.  Especially when I asked him why do you always lie to your parents, and he was like "I never lie, really I never lie, ever" and so I was thinking, ok so if you really never lied to anyone then why last monday would he have told his parents he had school.  That is what he did last Monday.  He told his parents that we did not have school just so his parents would not make him work and he could spend the day with me.  Like that IS a lie.  And he is failing CALM, how in the world does someone fail CALM?!?!?  Like that just really tells me that he takes nothing serious.  He is a LOSER, the big L - O - S - E - R!!!!  I mean he won't graduate if he fails everything.  It makes me think you know, doesn't he have goals...or dreams.  He told me he wants to be a mechanic and well I guess that is alright I mean if it is your passion and stuff but like at least pass high school and get a high school diploma.  I am surprised he hasn't even dropped out.  Me and Travis did make plans to go to the mall on Friday though and well I felt that maybe I will try one more time to spend some time with him but like we have no kind of "connection" and I have felt NOTHING for him so it kind of bothers me that he still sort of comes on to me.  Anyways yeah we were suppose to go to his bank and then go to his house to get the truck and go to the mall but well I decided to go home first cause I wasn't feeling good near the end of the CALM thing and realized it was the stupid T.O.M.  So yeah I went home and met him at the mall and we spend about like half-an-hour in the dumb electronics store.  Like seriously he waists all his money on stupid games for his x-box.  Knowing how much he works and how much he spends, he could have saved up to pay for like University or something but I am guessing that he might not go on to post-secondary education.  It is not that I don't believe in him, it is just how he acts not and the way he is doing in school there is a very slim chance that he would get in.  But yeah we went to the mall anyway but like there is STILL NOTHING THERE.  Like he thought he kind of liked me and I was never really sure I liked him but now that I know him more I don't like who he is.  He doesn't even have a relationship with his parents and can't be open and honest with them.  That is like the most important thing and he does not have it.  He can't tell his parents anything and I KNOW for a fact he lies to them all the time.  I don't care is he claims that he NEVER lies, cause that is pure bullshit.  And well besides I am sure just about everyone has lied about something sometime in their life.  I just don't want to offend him, but I don't even like him as a friend anymore.  He turns me off.  He is not the definition of the kind of friend I want.  And even last week he started to follow me around everywhere.  I mean no offence but like it kind of starts to creep me out when someone starts following me around.  Like on that one friday were I was at my locked and he came up to me and was like "hi" and I was like "how did you find my locker?  Who told you where it was" and he was like "I followed you."  No offence but like I don't want to be followed.  Besides it was afterschool and I just wanted to relax and stuff before I saw him and well nooooooo he shows up at my locker and I didn't even have time to think about things.  I hope he starts to clue into things, but gusy are slow when it comes to things like that.  I don't want to upset him, but I don't like him.  I want an intimate relationship but I KNOW that he IS NOT the one I want it with.  Not at all.  I want to find someone with goals and dreams.  Someone that wants to go to University and does take school seriously.  Someone that I can talk with and have a good time with and doesn't ONLY use money as a way of showing affection.  Money means nothing when it comes to feelings that that.  I want someone who is trustworty, open, and honest and has a good relationship with their parents.  I want someone who is responsible and that is about it.  If I had someone with all those qualities than everything would be perfect but like I have gone through a couple guys already this year which kind of stressed me out and this at the moment is still stressing me out but it makes me realize something.  It makes me realize what I DON'T want in a guy and it makes me more aware of the qualities that I am really looking for.  So far I have not found that yet, but yeah it is not like I am 32 or something, I would start to worry if I was but I only 16 right now.  I have many years ahead of me and there is plenty of time.  Anyways that is like only one of my problems.  My other problem is understanding my Chem.  I would give anything right now, literally ANYTHING just to understand.  I feel bad that I don't really understand some stuff.  I feel it's my fault I don't understand and I wonder if it is my fault.  But I know I am trying to understand and I read over the stuff today and did the practice questions that I could do, but there were others that I am confused about.  I feel bad that I always have to ask "How do I do this and how do I do that."  I feel stupid.  Why can't I ever understand anything on my own?!?  WHY?  And like alot of times I can't do something cause it realates back to Science 10 which I had a really hard time with.  Like I even remember the chem teacher saying "well you should know this from science 10, right" and yeah I agree cause yeah I "should" know it but I struggled with science last year I no matter how hard I tried to understand some of the concepts I just could not grasp some of them, even some that alot of people find very simple.  Since I couldn't understand some of the concepts from last year, obviously I cannot understand some of the Chem this year.  I don't know how to make myself understand all the concepts, if I could not "get it" last year and I can't seem to do it now then what do I do??  I don't know what I can do to understand some of the old concepts I should know and figure out the new ones.  No one understands how hard things are for me.  They just don't.  It's frustrating TRYING AND TRYING.  I failed my lasy chem quiz too.  If I wanted to fail I would have just done nothing but WHY did I have to fail.  I STUDIED, I STUDIED for all of the tests.  I feel like the chem teacher understands a little bit more of what I feel and realizes that I DON'T understand some stuff and she is TRYING to help but I should not keep failing.  Someone who is actually trying to understand the stuff and studies and does all of her homework should not keep failing!!!!  I have another quiz on monday and well I will probably have to go to tutorial though and get help with the stuff that I don't understand because I HAVE to do good.  If my chem average ever drops below a 65% I am not going to be a very happy person.  I want to make honours again come the end of first semester but right now chem is really one of my big concerns but I KNOW in my heart that I am trying my best.  All the times at the beginning of the year where I thought chem was sooo hard that I could never do it or pass the course, I even thought of dropping it and giving up my dream to teach science.  But I didn't drop it, I kept going.  If only anyone knew all the nights I cried cause I didn't understand, and the nights I cried because I got a bad mark.  I have to admit that I have found NOTHING in chem easy and I guess yeah it is suppose to be challeging but I didn't it would be as bad that I would cried like a billion nights in a row and fail more tests than I have ever failed in a course.  Chem really is the first course where I have failed more things that even beofre, so far I have failed four quizzes and usually I don't fail anything at all.  On the odd occasion I might fail maybe once or trice in a course but NEVER have I failed four things in a course.  That is why it is so frustrating.  I know how hard I try and how much effort I put it and hardly even does it seem to pay off.  It's like I am constantly being drainned of my energy and often I wonder for what???  It's hard, I won't deny that.  I am trying, but for someone who wants to do good soooooo bad I sure ain't doing to well.  I am trying to be positive in my thinking for chem but when I reflect on everything it upsets me.  The way I feel about everything it upsetting and how much stuff I have failed in chem is also really upsetting.
