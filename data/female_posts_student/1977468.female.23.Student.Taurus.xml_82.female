Your eyes are piercing, as if to say "I have a backstab ability of x3"!  My sight is drawn across this table, A man draws steel and fells his blade; Thrusting it into a microwaved burrito. No Dagger of Harrowing by any means, but more then enough to "down" his foe.  I glance around the room and hear the Tolkin metal. Blind Guardian, the bards of present day. Someone is reading the rule book again, protesting the game master; who is a rogue in more ways then one.  Greasy Dwarven hair, Elfish constitution. The daylight knows none here.  How could anyone give this up for sex?   Copyright 2004, David Agnor  My latest work. I just added the middle stanza.
