Everybody post lots so I can have something really cool to come back to.   Just now I went outside and did a snow dance, but I don't think I put enough heart into it. The forecast still hasn't changed. And the snow dance is 99.9% fallible too...oops, did I say fallible? Yeah, I meant it. Old Indian hoodoo isn't what it used to be.  Today was a really oddly good day. Today, I started following the trend in third period and began to sporadically "bust-a-move". So you might see me making some odd jerking moves pretty soon. Don't worry, it's no seizure! I was just inspired by Rob and the fact that everyday in third period, everyone but me is busting it out. So today I decided to break that trend and take the floor. Dancing is fun.  I hear there's dancing at the Progressive dinner?!?!? Dude. That would be killa. And I'll dance alone if Abby doesn't want to. But seriously, bust a groove sometime, you'll feel incredibly funny and well-liked, like the last pot of hot chocolate in the Starbucks in Antarctica.   Kapow!
