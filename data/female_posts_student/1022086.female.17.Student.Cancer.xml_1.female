I hate this stupid keyboard and the way it squeaks.  2. I hate that my grandmother won't shut up and leave me alone. 3. I hate that I can't move without someone telling me what to do or what I need to do. 4. I hate cold weather. 5. I hate television and the fact that there always has to be at least one on in this house. 6. I hate the stupid Spanish channel. Moreover, I hate the stupid Spanish soap operas that my grandmother just HAS to watch. 7. I hate having a perennially PMS'ing/ menopausing/ whatever her problem is choral director. 8. I hate the lack of encouragement I'm getting for my wanting to pursue a musical career.  9. I hate stupid mathematical mistakes. 10. I hate masochism. 11. I hate braces. 12. I hate tooth cement. 13. I hate bad, idiotical, no-point songs such as Good Charlotte's stuff. 14. I hate it when people are mean. 15. I hate waking up at 6.30 on most mornings. 16. I hate US History. 17. I hate falseness. 18. I hate being annoyed. 19. I hate being in pain. 20. I hate it when my cat starts meowing incessantly.  I suppose I should make an "I Like" list to compensate for the negativity I just released.  1. I like my hair. 2. I like cafe mochas and nearly every other coffee product. 3. I like music. 4. I like it when folks just logically get over things and cooperate.  5. I like to sleep. 6. I like astronomy. 7. I like feeling clean. 8. I like the song I'm listening to. 9. I like being with people I care about. 10. I like being cared for.  11. I like the rare, wondrous evenings in which I have no mandatory work to do. 12. I like the sea. 13. I like warm weather. 14. I like chemistry, sometimes. 15. I like feeling good.  16. I like extra credit.  17. I like tiramisu`. 18. I like not being at NHS. 19. I like deep, meaningful conversations that cause one to speculate the other party's inner thoughts and feelings, which are sometimes unspoken but always have the obvious tendency to characterize everything about that person. 20. I like the ceilings in my home. I wish I could turn the house upside down.      Hey, that really did feel better!   Today's been exasperating, and up until a few minutes ago, I was very upset and irritated.   But I feel better.   I woke up late but made it to school on time, beating my ultimate record and taking 15 minutes to take a shower and get ready.   So, I got to school and went to the chemistry room. Sarah walked in a few minutes later and said, "Francesca! You forgot rehearsal!"  Puzzled, I replied, "We didn't have rehearsal today!!!" "Yes, we did?" "OH MY DEAR GOD!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!!??" "Yes!!!"  I swear, Bizarth never mentioned there being rehearsal today. She really didn't. Sarah said that the only reason she knew was that Bizarth mentioned it Sunday at church; I don't go to Bizarth's same church.... -.-    I don't know just HOW everyone else knew, but I didn't. Anyway, I heard that B was rather ticked off and is evidently going to start kicking people out for being tardy. So, yeah, that. I'm the master of tardiness, but I'm upset that she is so mad about something that was HER fault. How can she be furious of my missing rehearsal if no one even told me we HAD rehearsal???   Besides that, I felt sick all day. Chemistry was all right, History was boring, and I need to work on a stupid project tonight as well as study for a stupid test.   At lunch, I found out that some folks I knew are proud masochists. I found that fairly disturbing.   Calculus was overly rushed, as Mrs. Dunn decided to throw a bunch of information at us all at once while talking even more quickly than she normally does. So, I shall have fun doing homework tonight.   I left early to go to the orthodontist appointment. The secretary/assistant lady had told me that half my braces would come off today last time I saw her. Well, she lied. I was expecting either the top or bottom half to come off, but all that's been liberated is my molar teeth, essentially. I know it's better than nothing, but I still have a week to wait, and my free teeth are still covered in cement that the assistant didn't bother to remove.   Egh. Just egh. I want a good day to happen, really. I took some pills, and I still feel pretty awful. I think I might go lie down for a little while, seeing as it's really starting to hurt now.    Mooo!!    "Vegetable"  by Radiohead   I never wanted anything but this I tried hard, worked hard I ran around in domestic bliss I fought hard, died hard  Everytime you're running over me Everytime you're running I can see  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself  I never wanted any broken bones Scarred face, no home Your words surround me and I asphyxiate And I burn all hate  Everytime you're running out on me Everytime you're running I can see  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself  The waters break, the waters run all over me The waters break, the waters run And this time you're gonna pay  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself...
