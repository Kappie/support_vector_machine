It's by time that we face the truth- the obvious reality. No matter how "supreme" we are as compared to the many animals and creatures living on this Earth, we have to accept that Mother Nature is the ultimate ruler of this world tht we call Earth.  Mother Nature frequently reminds us through her violent volcanic eruptions that express her anger and fury and her ground breaking earthquakes that convey her distress towards us. All these just question our continued existance here. We may one day also crease to live and inhabitat this world just as the dinosaurs did. We are probably just a small chapter in the might long history of the life of Mother Earth. Think about it.
