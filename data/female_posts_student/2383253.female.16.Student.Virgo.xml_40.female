Nick and I met Lauren for a litmag meeting at the Pannikin and we got a ton of stuff done.  Sorry that I missed hanging out with you guys, and sorry for not calling when my plans were redirected.  I'll make it up to you.  While I was buying coffee, the lady told me that my money was counterfeit, and I was definitely not in the state of mind to get the joke. I probably would have been pissed off any other time, but it was funny.  Afterward, I came home and chilled until Steph came over and we went to dinner in La Jolla.  We found this nice Mexican restaurant, Alfonsos, and I had a carne asada quesadilla, which was pretty damn good.  We wandered into an art gallery and I tripped out looking at all the artwork of the ocean and dolphins.  One of the artists was even there and insisted that he take his painting into the viewing gallery for us so that we could see it in the proper lighting.  I've decided that I should take every opportunity I can to get the most out of the people I'm around.  Convention got me in the spirit to start conversations with anybody and everybody, and I have to say I like it.  I came home and watched 'The Paper Chase' with my dad.  It's a pretty interesting film about this law student and his first year at Harvard.  Even though it was made in the 70s, most of the shots were pretty contemporary, minus, of course, the fashion styles.  It had a lot of good themes and my dad and I talked about it for a little bit afterward.  I really like that we can relate on films and have good conversations when there are other things that we never, ever talk about.  So after milling around the internet in some unresolved quest, talking to Leela, one of my favorite people in the world, and finally finding myself here, I think I'll be going to bed now.  G'night.
