It has the option to not only mail the hard copy or you can download the music right there to your computer and instantly have it for print.  This kind of thing saves you when you are desperately trying to record an audition tape for a certain school and the song you were planning on just isn't coming out right.  So you run to the computer and look up a completely different song and record it and it comes out AWESOME... not that many people have this problem.... but still.  It's worth a look for all you amatuer singers, pianists, and guitarists out there....
