Silly nuts! I love my friends.. I truly love their company. I can't believe how supportive my friends have been. Martini bought each of us fingers puppets cos the girls made him to! He also bought us those lil' red hearts with arms on his  own accord .   Still have history lessons tomorrow.. Woo! Hopefully it doesn't rain, so training can be held smoothly. Toodles kiddos! Peace out. xox.
