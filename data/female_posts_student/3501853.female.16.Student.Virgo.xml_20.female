All I wanted to do today was get through school and finals and that didn't fucking work for shit. My mind was just thinking of all the stuff it's been thinking about for a while so I couldn't focus. I ended up not finishing my chemistry finals and for english, I handed in the paper but it's suppoesd to be 6 full pages ya it was like 4 so who cares. And I get out of there and it seems everywhere I go in that school or every person I see, just takes me back to the past so I got away and went to clean my locker. After that I turned my phone on and I answer it cuz my mom called and not even a milisecond into the fucking conversation, she starts yelling at the top of her lungs at me! She was 2 hours late for work and she's yelling at me like crazy and it's like omygod I don't need this. I don't need you, the person I least want to be, yelling at me for the dumbest reason ever. All she knows how to do is yell and make me cry. I do not want to be the person that yells when she's frusrtated at the people I love. Cuz it's so hard to be yelled at. It just drains your heart out of everything. Plus, I dont' want to be like her cuz she makes it so hard for people to love her, she never learns any lessons in life, she makes the same mistakes ever again and she doesn't care whether or not she loses people she loves but I do. I do care if I lose people so much it hurts but before I didn't leran any lessons and I made it so hard for people and so complicated for them, I don't want or need to be like that man. Argh, I'm just very frustrated right now. With everything else too. Not just with her. I'm going insane. Nothing in my life is working out and everything I do is another mistake. This summer is going to suck..:'(..I just need to lay down or something b4 work.."I can't take this I come unglued I just need this to be alright I can't feel this another night I can't take this I come unglued I might breakdown in front of you necessary to medicate I'm not sleeping, can't stay awake but if you need me I'll be here 1/2 unconcious to escape my fears"-staind
