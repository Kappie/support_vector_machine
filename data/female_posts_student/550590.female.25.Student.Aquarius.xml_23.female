And I know all of the people on the cover (and in a perfect world you would too), that's how sick it is.  Judas Priest, Ozzy (Sabbath), Hatebreed, Superjoint Ritual, Slayer, Lamb of God, Lacuna Coil, Black Label Society, Slipknot - insane. Dimmu Borgir weren't at the shoot I guess.  My new favorite band of the week:  Devil Doll  Theatrical Italian prog-metal soundtrack music.
