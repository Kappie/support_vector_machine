So here goes:     T  stands for Tae Bo, which is totally awesome. I did a 45 minute version of it last night- twice! Exercise diva? I think so.     G  stands for Going away, seeing as I will be doing that starting on Wednesday. Thank God! However, I will miss everyone terribly but have promised to bring Sallis frostees haha.     I  stands for Internet- Amanda got an sn! Finally! Amanda is my best friend up in Chicago whom I saw over spring break. I shall soon invite her into the world of blogging. Muhaha.     F  stands for food- I have a new cookie recipe, and I am going to try it and bring it for all my soup kitchen friends on Sunday. Soup kitchen rocks. Even Brad the creepy waiter guy.    I wanted to post something on DOY today, but backed out and posted something else. Something about it just makes me nervous. I'll get over it. Oh and Sallis? I'm kicking yourass at Halo someday soon.     I could wait for all the hours    It could take to fill a day    I would stand the test of time    To get your heart    I would bravethe nastiest storm    That this city's ever seen    Just to hold your hand for a second    Yes, longer than before    We'd exist in symphony    And the notes would fill our ears    Beautiful sounds just playing    In the night    The stars would take a bow for us    And twinkle all the more    And the man in the moon there    Wouldbe smiling    The grass would touch our toes and feet    As we run along the bend    With a chance to change the way    Our worlds have been    No rhythm, no rhyme and    Time would not exist    Seconds simply tick    As we run into the sun    Just    Smile.    :)  Happy Friday to all!
