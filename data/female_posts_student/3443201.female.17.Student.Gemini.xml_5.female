I have to be there to assist. And yes, I was there.  It was too tiring. You have to do this and that.  Go here and there.  Walk up and down the stairs (1-4 room).  But anyways, it's for my mom.  Look who's talking...ME! As if I have my rights to complain.  Yet, I have saved some energy for writing here and waking early.  This is what I call an  addiction .  Typing the keyboard, facing the monitor, holding the mouse, and waiting for downloads is my morning business.  Alright, back to what I was saying.  After this I'll be on the hospital again.  Honestly, I don't like to be there.  The smell, the people, everything.  If only I have an option.  Duh!  For LOVE sake!   Know what?  Yesterday night when we were (Joan and me) returnig to the hospital we had encountered an ambulance.  It was really sad.  I dunno what happened to that person but i hope s/he will recover.  I have no time to see what's wrong or who's that individual.  All I can offer is a prayer.  My mom was fine.  She's recovering already.  That's why I'm not too worried.  Oh, I almost forgot.   The baby was gone.   I wanted to cry but no tears can fall.  So, till here...
