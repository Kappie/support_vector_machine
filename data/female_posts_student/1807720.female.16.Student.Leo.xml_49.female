And then she totally like spazed out and got like all mad and was like "oh vanessa shut up and stop accusing me" and well I just had my own opinion and she had hers but it seems that the more time I spend with that girl the more of a negative effect it has on me.  Infact I called her miss negative this morning cause she was being miss negative about every damn thing and after a while it starts to really rub off on other people and like I am trying to be happy and positive but she makes things like that so friggin difficult.  So yeah and well I am worried about that 70 in math and well I REALLY studied chem and REALLY knew the stuff but plain and simple - the chem test today I found really difficult but I KNOW that I know my stuff.  I just don't know why I found it hard like applying the knowledge is difficult and half of the questions I didn't know what it was asking.  It was really confusing.  And I am back again to wondering why I am not very good at anything.  Why are some people so good at school and subjects and everything and why NO MATTER HOW HARD I try or HOW MUCH I work on things they are still sooooooooo hard.  I want to know why.  I mean just WHY?!?  I mean I want to be a teacher when I am older but I have never heard of a teacher in my life that struggled through school and in their subjects....because there isn't such a thing.  I wish I had someone to relate to.  And all the teachers I ask if they were good at this or that always say that they ARE good at it or WERE good at it.  Either way they never had any of the difficulty that I am having.  I just wish there were an explanation, it would make me feel better if I just knew WHY..!  Like I didn't really understand how to do the lab write up for the last lab we did and the math word problem things I STILL don't know how to set those things up and it is REALLY FRUSTRATING because I REALLY WANT so bad to understand and just be able to get a right answer.  Honestly if I knew how to do it I would but the fact of the matter is that I don't and I feel like my continous efforts of trying and trying are getting me no where.  I am just falling into a big black hole where all my marks are falling in with me and everything else.  I want an answer to things.  Yes I want and I want and I want right now, but I only want know something.  I just want to know WHY...and forever I will probably always wonder why and wonder why there is no answer.  Why do I have to work at things so much more than others?  Why do I spend countless hours trying to figure out the material and studying something that I usually don't do good on anyways?  Why does everything usually take me longer than others?  Why does it seem like I feel as in I put in 100 times more effort than what I get out?  Just why??..!
