I was hanging out with the Kimble - Jutras clan last night on Grumpies back porch when the rain started coming down in buckets (while we were trying to grill in the backyard) and the thunder and the lightening and the wind... AND THE HAIL!  What was going on with that!  Needless to say it was still a good time and Bret got to see everyone before hopping a plane to Spain tonight.  Also - added a couple new blogs.  One to point out in particular is an old friend or rather kind of sort of friend is hich hiking his way around Central America right now.  Anyway, I love reading his website/blog.  It kind of puts things in perspective, you know?  Anyway, Alan sent me the link yesterday when I was bored out of my mind and ready to beat the guy I kind of/sort of work for.... Anyway, it's a good read.  Mike's Travel Log.  It's under the Blog Links.
