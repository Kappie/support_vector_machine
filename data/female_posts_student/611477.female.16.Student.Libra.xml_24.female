Pictures will be posted when pictures are posted.   I'm hoping to work on Mystery Whatever That Thing Is #5 tomorrow... there's really not much more to do on it, but it's at the point where I have to do a bit, try it on, see how it is, maybe undo what I just did and maybe duplicate it exactly for the other side... braining.    Trying not to get too settled in... heading right back away from home for a week starting Tuesday, so I should be preparing for that... but I want to just rest for a while after the... whatever relatives are.
