At least the week started off well. Today was pretty ordinary but fun anyway. I don't think I'm going to go to the marching thing tomorrow. I already have to miss a bit of school this week and it's really not smart for me to miss more than I have to since finals are next week and stuff.   Amanda and I decided that this weekend, we're going to get a bunch of guys together and go see, "Big Fish." It'll be lots of fun and..there will be lots of guys there so...again, it will be lots of fun. Lets see if it actually happens though...  I should probably go get started on my homework. Hmmm, I have a feeling my barrage of negative comments was a bit more entertaining than today's entry. Oh well. I prefer being in a good mood and I guess that's all that's important.
