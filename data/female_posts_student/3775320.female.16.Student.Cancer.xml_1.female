Unrealistic plot, but not Alternate Universe.  Fine with me if you hate it.  Just woke up one morning wondering what Spike would get for his birthday.  Then came up with all sorts of things ;) Written kind of script-like, not really comprehensive. NOTE: Mutant Enemy and Joss Whedon owns all the characters... etc.  SUMMARY: Willow finds out through Spike's slip in conversation that his 'Birthday' [William's b-day] is this Friday.  She makes a gallant attempt to organize a party for him.   -------[Spike's Crypt]-------{Spike, Willow}  SPIKE: What?! Look after the niblet this Friday?  You are out of your Wiccan little mind! [gestures wildly]  WILLOW: She'll behave herself.  [inconvincingly]  She's an angel really, if you don't count the kleptomania, or the sulking of never being in on things, oh, or the fact that she hogs the remote -  SPIKE: That's it!  I may be chipped and pathetic, but I'm not babysitting lil' sis on my bloody birthd - [freezes, but can't think of a cover for what he just let out]  [After a long silence]  WILLOW: Birthday?  SPIKE: [disgruntled] Yes, my *birth*day.  Not that it matters o'course.  To evil not-a-babysitters, deathday's the one.  WILLOW: [looks thoughtful] So what are you gonna do?  SPIKE: I told you I'm not looking after bitesize.  [beat]  'Less you're actually offering her as a no-migraine-attached bite.  [smirks]  WILLOW: No celebration?  Come on, don't you even have some demon friends over for a drink or whatever you do when you're not skulking around within 20 feet of Buffy's house -  Say, why do you do that anyway?  SPIKE: [indignant] I don't!  Now sod off.  No babysitting.  [beat]  And not a mention of the birthday thing.  [mumbles]  ...think I've gone soft.  WILLOW:  [thoughtful once again]  Well, bye then.  SPIKE: [looks surprised]  What?  No annoying insistance... nevermind.  Good.  Go.  [dismisses her, then sprawls out on couch, turning on tv]  [Willow smiles slightly as she exits his crypt]  -------[Buffy's house]-------{Buffy, Willow, Xander, Dawn, Giles, Anya}  XANDER:  Willow, are you out of your Wiccan little mind?!  WILLOW:  Whoa, serious dejavu here. [frowns]  GILES:  Xander has a point.  You -  er...you want to hold a birthday party for Spike?  WILLOW:  It'll be great!  I read before when I was a nerd and therefore read everything that if you treat someone bad really nice, they'll eventually become repentant! So this will be a good chance -  ANYA: Spike is not someone bad. [other's stare]  What I mean is he's a vampire.  He's *evil*.  BUFFY:  Someone with sense! And since when were you so nice to Spike, Willow?  WILLOW:  This is not about me being nice, it's about all of us.  He's still so reluctant to help and everything, eventhough he helps all the time, because we never make him feel welcome.  People, well personalities, like Spike hate being rejected, so they reject first so they won't be hurt.  We're bigger than that right? [looks mischievously at Xander]  Xander, you're man enough to be nice to Spike and buy him a present right?  XANDER: Of course I'm man - hey!  I'm not being nice to Spike.  WILLOW:  Well, it's what a true gentleman would do.  Spike's evil and even he takes care of Dawn.  DAWN:  Hey, I'm not that bad. [sulks]  [Willow looks pleadingly at Xander, though still authoritatively]  XANDER: That's it.  [beat and everyone stares]  I'm... uh... going to see what I can get.  [Willow smiles]  Hunh.  I'm not wasting more time on him that I should, so I'll just get it over with quick.  BUFFY:  Xander! I was counting on you to hate this idea to the end!  XANDER:  [sheepishly]  Yeah, well, man-calling.  BUFFY: [disgusted] Ok, everyone else hates this right?  [No one responds]  GILES: Well, even Xander's big enough to go along.  [Silence]  BUFFY: Fine!  I'm not going.  WILLOW:  No, please Buffy.  [looks at her pouty and beggingly]  BUFFY:  [looks at everyone menacingly]  Uh.  [nods]  WILLOW: Great!  I'll go plan.  You all get your presents, and just turn up Friday night at 6!  [rushes off]  DAWN: Where does she get all the time to worry about Spike's birthday?  I didn't even know vampires celebrated birthdays.  [beat]  I can't believe he even remembers his.  -------[Spike's crypt]-------{Spike}  [Spike enters from the basement, all foul and moody]  SPIKE:  Couldn't even take time off sodding kitten poker to come watch the telly and have a drink with an ol' mate.  [mocks]  "Oh! I've got a royal flush. I'm on a 20 kitten winning streak!"  Royal flushin' ponce.  [Stares around noticing unusual darkness, frowns]  {Buffy, Willow, Xander, Anya, Dawn, Giles}  EVERYONE OTHER THAN SPIKE: Surprise! [jump out from behind coffins.  lights go on and reveal confetti and other party deco]  SPIKE: [not suprised] Not in the way you intented. [furrows brows]  ANYA: Damn!  I told you he'd smell us.  Surprise birthdays don't work on va-  SPIKE:  Whoa, *now* I'm surpised.   This... is a birthday party?  DAWN:  What'd you think?  We just felt like surprising someone who couldn't even act surprised for our effort?  [disgruntled]  SPIKE: No, but I mean -  [stares accusingly at Willow]  You!  WILLOW:  [smiles apologetically]  I  know you said you didn't want one, but I figured you wouldn't mind a bit of company on your special day.  We won't stay if you don't want us to, but we all got you presents!  SPIKE: [looking quite touched and not knowing how to respond]  I... uh... well, blimey - [looks at Xander]  *You* bought me a present?  XANDER: [glances at Willow] Yes.  Happy Birthday Spike.  SPIKE: [even more baffled]  Well, normally I would gloat and uh, poke fun at your generosity, but... well, thanks.  BUFFY:  I can't believe this.  Is this like your first civil conversation?  ANYA:  Good on you too.  Friends at long last.  I'm so pleased.  XANDER AND SPIKE: We're not friends!  [looking daggers at each other]  DAWN: [mumbles through a small smile] There they are.  WILLOW:  [interupting stare down] Hey Spike, look what I have here.  [Everyone goes over to a table where a bowl of blood is placed in the middle, with a lit candle floating on top]  SPIKE:  Wow.  BUFFY:  Hmm.  WILLOW:  It's O positive.  GILES: What?  You mean to say you're giving Spike human blood?!  XANDER:  Are you out of your mind?  [gapes, then points at Willow accusingly]  You led us here to be his party snacks!  SPIKE:  [chuckles]  I told you before and I'm telling you again, I'd not bite you anyway.  DAWN: Will, where'd you...  WILLOW:  I got it at a blood bank.  No one died for it of course.  [to Spike]  You can be guilt-free, not that you feel guilt anyway, but you can sleep well ...  well, not that you wouldn't sleep well if-  SPIKE: Thanks Red. [beams]  So, I'll uh, put out the candle.  ANYA:  It's not fair.  We can't have any of the blood.  You should have just gotten a cake.  SPIKE:  Oh, you can if -  BUFFY: I don't think so.  SPIKE: [smirks] I'll just put this in the fridge for later.  Don't suppose you all want to watch me.  DAWN:  Spike, why don't you open your presents?  [over to pile of presents on a coffin]  SPIKE:  Right then.  [looks around purposefully]  This one.  [picks up a party bag]  WILLOW:  Oh, that's mine.  SPIKE:  I know.  DAWN:  Uh, the smell thing.  [he opens the bag and pulls out a bundle of black, staring at it baffled]  WILLOW: [rushes over, unravelling it proudly]  It's a sort of sun cloak.  I made it.  It's simple so you can wear easily and you won't have to hold it like your blanket.  And it can cover all of you.  See, hood here, and there's pockets inside too.  GILES:  You're um, encouraging him to roam around in daylight? [raises one eyebrow testily]  BUFFY:  Willow...  WILLOW: [looks hurt and guilty]  I just thought...  SPIKE:  No worries Red.  I won't use it for anything bad.  Or what you all would think is bad.  BUFFY:  Oh sure.  Spike is not gonna take advantage of this to be evil.  Because obviously, his evilness would stop him from that.  SPIKE:  Hey!  I said I wouldn't, and I won't.  I killed yes, but I have my honour.  I always fight a fair fight.  [to Buffy]  You know that.  [Buffy doesn't look at him] I'm saying I won't use this for anything bad, and I won't.  [looks at all]  Thank you Willow. [he holds it up slightly]  [Willow smiles brightly]  ANYA:  I think that's good enough.  DAWN:  Yeah.  Spike, open mine.  [grins]  SPIKE:  Alright niblet.  [picks up a flat box, inside is a dark forest green button up shirt which has a sort of sheen]  Wow.  [looks at Dawn]  You remembered.  DAWN:  Yup. [proud] I didn't steal it either. [after glances from several people]  I mean, Spike can steal his own stuff.   [glares from Buffy and Giles]  Not that he should of course, but, yeah.  BUFFY:  Remembered what, exactly?  DAWN:  Buffy, don't be angry.  I came here once - [catches her look] ok quite a few times, and once...  ===[previously]===  DAWN: Do you wear anything *other* than black? [roll eyes smiling]  SPIKE:  I wear red! [serious]  DAWN:  Well... yeah, but other than that?  [beat]  SPIKE:  I don't mind green.  Dark green though.  None o' that blinding lime stuff.  ===[currently]===  BUFFY:  You shouldn't have come here without me knowing  DAWN:  I didn't get hurt or anything.  Spike wouldn't hurt me.  [Buffy frowns, but doesn't say anything]  SPIKE:  Thanks little bit. [smiles]  Now, [reaches for a red envelope]  ANYA: [squeals]  Ooh!  That's mine.  SPIKE: [opens it and pulls out a fifty]  Oh...   XANDER: You gave him so much!  SPIKE: [looks up with a smile]  Thank you.  ANYA:  [beams] I read that it's a Chinese tradition for elders to give minors money on their birthday.  And you're obviously many hundreds of years my minor.  GILES:  Actually I believe that's for marrieds... but nevermind.  SPIKE:  [beams, knowing how much Anya loves her money]  Thank you, Anya.  [Buffy, fidgets nervously]  SPIKE:  [looks at remaining three, then picks up a box with string tied round]  No need to guess this is you Rupert.  GILES:  I, well, yes. [unsettled that Spike called him by first name]  SPIKE:  [unwraps it to find a collection of books] Oh!  XANDER:  [laughs and gasps mockingly]  Giles!  I had no idea you were gonna give him books!  SPIKE:  Thanks.  You... remembered too.  ===[previously]===  SPIKE:  So, this your collection huh? [scanning his book shelf at his house]  GILES:  Don't touch them.  They're very valuable.  SPIKE:  I'll bet.  [scans]  Oh, Maupassant.  GILES:  Yes, read him before?  SPIKE:  Um, ate him actually. [beat]  Wanted to.  Read him I mean, but never got round to it.  GILES:  I see.  Get away from my books now.  SPIKE:  I'm not eating your books!  GILES:  Don't want you eating any of the other authors who aren't dead yet.  SPIKE: Like I bloody can.  ===[currently]===  GILES:  Yes, well.  Hope you like it.  SPIKE: I do.  [Buffy frowns, then loses the worried look as Spike picks up Xander's present]  SPIKE:  Now.  [smiles as he unwraps the colourfully ugly paper]  What surprise will this contain?  XANDER:  Uh, I used some scraps.  Don't worry, I didn't spend too much time on it.  SPIKE: [eyes widen as he sees inside]  You... you too?  [everyone is interested, trying to see what Xander gave Spike]  XANDER:  I didn't do Spike research or anything.  [Spike nods]  I just heard from Harmony a long time ago, offhandedly of course, when you left her.  She was burning your stuff.  I just... remembered.  I used a coupon! [desperately]  DAWN: Since when do people want to sound cheap? [suppressing a laugh]  SPIKE:  [smiles widely as he takes it out, revealing a Sex Pistols cd]  I love it.  [Buffy looks flabbergasted.  So far everyone's presents have scored big.]  XANDER:  Um.  Good.  SPIKE: My thanks, Xander.  XANDER: [fidgets]  It'd be easier to have you be obnoxious about it.  SPIKE:  That's why I'm not. [sly grin]  XANDER:  [brightly]  Ah.  [looks darkly at him now]  [Buffy looks worried now.  Spike reaches for her present.]  SPIKE:  And now.  BUFFY:  Um, I didn't really have time... [lamely]  SPIKE:  [takes out a mug, a packet of little marshmallows and some cocoa powder]  Oh. [amused]  [Others stare]  ANYA:  [softly] He doesn't eat Buffy.  Even I know that.  And you're the Slayer.  I'm with Giles.  You should read The Handbook.  DAWN: Buffy. [frowns at her sister]  XANDER:  Whoa.  I won't say anything.  Except I can't believe ...  not saying anything.  [Buffy looks uncomfortable]  SPIKE:  No, I love it.  [smiles at Buffy]  You... you knew too.  [cocks his head to the side]  BUFFY:  I ... uh, mom told me you had that before.  SPIKE:  [Looks around at everyone] Many thanks to all of you.  GILES:  Well, it was nothing...  SPIKE:  [smirk]  'Course that's not to say I've gone soft.  I'm not gonna become Mr. Charity for you all now because of this. [looks solemn]  But, I do, appreciate all this.  WILLOW:  Aww. I knew you didn't hate us that much.  SPIKE:  Hey, this doesn't mean I like you.  You can't buy me with -  GILES:  Don't worry Spike.  This doesn't compromise anything.  Just something Willow wanted for you.  DAWN: [yawns]  So.  Now what?  BUFFY:  We should go.  I mean, it's late and I still have to patrol.  SPIKE:  I'll come.  Nothing like a good spot of birthday violence.  WILLOW:  You enjoy that more than this. [hurt]  SPIKE:  Well, it's different.  I suppose.  I enjoyed this too though. [beat]  Now enough of this sodding soggyness and heartfelt gratitude...  ANYA:  Oooh, heartfelt.  [Spike glares]  GILES:  We should go.  [After goodbyes everyone except Buffy and Spike have left]  BUFFY: I'm...  SPIKE:  If it's about the present love, then -  BUFFY:  It's not.  It's cheap and not appropriate.  I know that.  But it's my whole... attitude to you.  I realized how much of a -  I mean, even Xander knows you better.  And he hates you!  SPIKE:  I didn't think you'd come.  BUFFY:  Oh. [looks at the floor]  SPIKE:  You weren't going to come, were you?  [silence]  SPIKE:  You coming was the best present.  By far.  [Buffy looks up at him, not saying anything]  SPIKE:  So, demons then?  [Buffy nods, small smile]  --------------------------------------------------------  So, that was weird wasn't it.  The part I'm most proud of are the presents that each person gives.  I especially like the Xander one [Sex Pistols CD, the idea which came from Harmony during their bitch-fight, but can't remember the episode].  Also, Anya giving money, which is her most treasured possession.  Giles  very obviously  with books.  Dawn not stealing [season 6 stuff].  Willow giving him a bowl of blood with floating candles instead of a cake.  I'm so proud of myself.  Spank me =P  Bust my ego.    Comment   =D
