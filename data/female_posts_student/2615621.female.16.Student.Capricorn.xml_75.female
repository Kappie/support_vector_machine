I decided i was going to sit by andrew in 4th period to get the scoop, so come 4th period i put my stuff in katies seat but here comes katie so i had to move. oh well. She totally showed how immature and phsyco she really honestly is. she made this list of questions for andrew to answer like "do you still love me?" "were you happy when we dated?" and "Is there someone else who would make you happier?" just a bunch of lame bullshit. And andrew at one point kinda got all frustrated and made like "STOP GO AWAY IM DONE!" hand gestures..like throwing his hands in front of him...i dunno its hard to describe with words. haha but it wasnt good. I heard from Lizzie that she kept saying over and over "andrew it's now or never" like 6 times during lunch, she even had the nerve to sit by him. So in spanish i was like...katie, how do you go "OMG OMG WILL WILL!!" to "i love andrew" i said it where andrew could hear. she said "i didnt go OMG OMG WILL WILL!!" and shot me a look. i just smiled. :D kinda like that...haha I asked her why she wasnt in 1st-3rd period and she said "because i just needed to catch up on sleep..." like she lost sleep over her and andrews breakup. WHATEVER. If she lost sleep over anything it was her thinking up some plan to get more attention. Today i asked her how to say Pathetic in spainsh, because i wanted to call her that. And she said "Andres" (andrews name in spanish...duh) shes so stupid at times and to think im left with her for the next 2 remaining years of my high school education. I wont have lauren to make seceret plans with...:( lol and i feel  like a "mean girl" talking shit about katie behind her back, even if its all true, and then having to go be buddy buddy "aww katie its ok...it'll all work out..." to her face. Oh well, i do it to catherine HAHA but i like katie more than her. Sometimes im glad that people have turned their backs and decided they dont like katie as much as they used to. everyone used to just hang around or go places because of katie. Lauren and i were kinda left to ourselves. Now, people are going with us, and giving the eye when katie is told about plans. haha thats what u get bitch. hahaha ok...that just sounded good to put right there.   Today in drama ben came up to me and felt my boobies...haha and asked if i was going to his 18th bday party at a "tittie bar" in winston. I just laughed. He then told me that he was gonna open up his own tittie bar and i could be his feature presentation, but he gets to have sex with his f.p. and if that was ok with me. I just laughed and said sure ben, i'll have sex with you. haha Him and chris kept doing the head smack game and i could never get them back. Ben finally sat down by himself and i walked up and landed the best smack EVER in the history of the game on him. he got pissed off. UGH i mean, he was only hitting me forever and never got hit ONCE until then. I was like WTF?! cuz he was like steaming mad. And he said "we were flirting earlier, you cant hit me when we're not flirting" i didnt know what to say. I mean, yea i liked ben, and i still kinda have a crush on him, but not a major-think-about-you-all-the-time-crush. I didn't know what to say...i mean he just admitted to flirting...lmao i didnt say anything, i just walked away and felt like an idiot.   Now, another crush, the guy that does my nails...lol i know his best friend. He doesnt know that though and his best friend just found out that i knew him. Saturday night i was talking to michael (the best friend) and he was like, "want me to come get you and we can go to my friends house" and i said.."ohh whats ur friends name?" and he said "minh" ...my crush...haha So i said.."well im babysitting, sorry" OMG wouldnt it be fun to show up to minhs house with michael?! haha i would LOVE it! All michael wants to do is get drunk and screw...but hes hot...haha not that i would get drunk and screw, im just stating that he is hot, him and his friend...haha 3 some! JUST KIDDING oh and i think minh added me to his messanger...i hope its him at least...i dont know though, he doesnt have much of a profile, but the name sounds like something he would have...lol telling from the little bit i know of minh. haha maybe im just wishing...which i am.   My biggest worry right now is if im going to Hondorus or not. I REALLY WANNA GO. and i can, even with my knee and all, because the dr said it was ok. but thats not my worry...this is: My mom and john were talking about going. John already has gone and gotten his passport and his shots. hes done just as much as i have right now for the trip. Him and mom want to go down to Hondorus during my last week there, stay for about a week and then maybe come home with me or a week before me, just depending on the week they chose to go. Today mom said "u need to ask your dad for ticket money" HOLD UP. she told me she would take care of the tickets, my dad has already paid for my passport and hes buying all my clothes and stuff i need down there and giving me spending money. knowing my dad, he'll say "your mom needs to do something". now im afraid my mom will be like "oh well...too bad, you cant go unless he gives you ticket money" or that she'll say "oh you cant go becase of your knee" and her and john will take off and go on the trip ive been waiting 2 years for. Why do i think this? because i know she wont pay for me to go to Hondorus and her. Shes already been...i havent...i know it sounds low, but i bet you a million bucks i dont get to go. another factor that plays into it? shes been online looking for HER AND JOHN tickets but hasnt even looked for me. Im sorry, i know shes my mom and i know its almost mothers day (and her bday) but my mom is a total fucking bitch somtimes.
