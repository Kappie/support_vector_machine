Got nowhere near the sleep that I was hoping for, mainly because a friend talked me into helping her fill out information for online lesbian dating services. Because she can't describe herself. She seemed to do just fine without me before, because I know she has posted them before, but she apparently is sick of the kind of women she gets responses from. So I found her a totally free service that sends her her matches via email, and all she has to do is peruse them at her leisure. Now, I do not have a problem with helping someone out like this. I know what it is like to be sad and alone. I just don't care too much for the part where I get MY head bit off because she is tired of getting screwed over. My husband actually has the day off today.(Will wonders never cease?) So we are actually going to attempt to hang out as a family tonight with the kids. We'll see how that goes. I won't be too surprised if all hell breaks loose because so and so looks cross-eyed at his sister or something like that.That's what usually happens, maybe this time we will get lucky. I mean, I already consider myself lucky. Two divorces from very Christian(no offense to Christians, don't want anyone to think I am knocking anyone else's religion) men, and I still managed to come out on the better end of deal, full custody of the two oldest, and split custody of my five year old, and of course, my husband and I have the baby. (Okay, so he is not really a baby anymore, he is going to be two.) Several dear friends of mine don't even have the privilege of having custody of their kids, and they do deserve it. None of us is a perfect parent in this world, but dammit, they loved those kids, and they were making the  effort . I know a lot of people who don't. Well, time to go get another cup of coffee, I will be right back. Ahhhhh. Chocolate Velvet coffee.SOOOOOOOOO GOOD. Two of my addictions, taken care of in one shot.  Now I know what you are thinking. You are saying, Shan, why don't you go back to bed, now that the little darlings are all off to school, instead of sitting in front of the computer, drinking coffee, and trying to wake up, you poor dear? The answer is because I am a pushover. Now before you start thinking I have COMPLETELY cracked, let me explain. My friend T(the lesbian, whose name I am shortening on here only because she is aware of this blog, and I don't want her getting mad that I put her name on here for everyone to see), is asleep in my livingroom, and needs to be up at 9:15 to get ready for work. If I go back to bed, I will not wake up in time to wake her up, and she will be late, and the economy will collapse. Okay maybe not the last part, but she would be in a lot of trouble and I don't want that to happen. She just signed a lease on an apartment, and I would like her to be able to keep said apartment, because she is NOT moving back in here. Done that already, not going there again. Love her to death, cannot live with her. It is extremely difficult for me to deal with having her here as often as she is, which is pretty much still all the time. Here's the reason: my car went kaput. No idea what is wrong with it, need to get it fixed, don't have the money right now, don't know when I am gonna have the money. She was paying me gas money when she could, or when she remembered, or when I asked her outright for it, depending on the point of view and what day it was, in order for me to run her to and from work, which I did not have a problem with. When it is running, I am in my car more often than I am out of it anyway, so it is no big deal. Anyway, car goes kaput. Great. She lives on the same side of town that I do, but about 21 blocks away, with a major interstate exit between. She does not want to walk that far to work every morning. Now here is the part that I don't get, and I do not want to even broach this subject with her, because well, frankly, she has a bit of a temper(like me) and I am not going to deal with that. The place where she works is about ten blocks from a particular intersection. Okay..ten blocks, no biggie. My place is about seven blocks to the north of the same intersection. Now, she can walk from her place to mine, with a minimum of bitching about the walk, but she cannot walk from her place to work..because it is too far.  HELLO!  It is  three  more blocks! My sister said to tell her to take her ass home, and walk to work, because if she can make it to my place, she sure as shit can make it to work, but like I said, I do not need the hassle. I don't like fighting with people, and that is exactly what would happen. Like I said, I love her to death, but oh man...I think part of the problem is that she and I are a lot alike. We have both been through a lot of shit in our lives, and I don't know what I would have done if someone had not helped me out when I was her age. Anyway, she is going home tonight, after work, and staying there until at least tomorrow, so that is a good thing. I need time for my family and I, not my family and I and anyone else. I just hope she finds a girlfriend with a car that is willing to drive her to work soon! I am trying to break several habits all at once and I think the stress is contributing to my being loopy and tired. I am trying to quit smoking(the biggest and worst of my vices), trying to quit biting my nails(because they look like crap and for once in my life, I want pretty hands), and I am on a diet. Or should I say, I am continuing to be on a diet, because I have been on a diet for so long, that I will die while on it. I have to keep making changes to my eating habits, though, so that is why I am continuously on a diet. I have a medical condition(which I am not going to go into this morning) which requires me to regulate my eating, which is a HUGE pain in the ass, but I do it because I would like to live to see any grandkids I might have in twenty years. Anyway, now that the weather has FINALLY warmed up here, I am going to be outside in the fresh air getting more exercise, as well as starting a new toning program, so hopefully, I will burn the calories at an even faster rate, and get skinny quicker.Okay not skinny,because for me that is impossible. I despise toothpick people in the first place, and I do not wish to be one. Slimmer is the word I was looking for.  Well, I am going to get one more cup of coffee and a cigarette before I have to wake up T., so again, I will be right back. I have a pin my oldest son gave me that says, "I'd love to help, but I have misplaced my wand." I think that is what I am going to start telling people. I am tired of being the miracle worker, the one who saves everyone from themselves and their bullshit they have somehow managed to get themselves tangled up in.
