I've decided to link a few MP3's, of one of my favorite bands, 311.  I've been a fan for over ten years (damn. That makes me feel old.) And I've had the honor of meeting them, drinking beer with them, and being in their music video,  urlLink Creatures for awhile .  I'd like to dedicate the song  urlLink All Mixed Up , to an unusual person, who makes me feel kind of ... unusual.   Enjoy.    Trapped in a material plane,  she wants to fly and they think she's insane. But she knows what she knows, give that girl wings and that's all that she wrote.
