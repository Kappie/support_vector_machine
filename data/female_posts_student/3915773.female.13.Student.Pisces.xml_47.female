Along with this brand new series, VH1 hosts "Best Week Ever" and "Best Month Ever" as part of their channel reform. These shows include hysterical recalls of the previous week or month or decade by modern humorists.  Through all of these short history lessons, I wonder if Vh1 is going to far in recounting the past. Honestly, only so many stories are going to appeal to people, and if they have heard the same story about the same person or happening over and over again, certain subjects will die out. Or will we be forced to rehash subjects that have been critized over  and over again? As Ms. Harris, a panelist for VH1's shows, states "We all joke that these pop culture shows will eventually eat themselves...Soon we will be doing the 'Best Minute Ever.'" I have a tendency to agree with her about this possiblity. These shows are great now, but I consider the question,"How long can VH1 keep ahead?"
