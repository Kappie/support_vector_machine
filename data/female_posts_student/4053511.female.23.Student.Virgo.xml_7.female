Some are staying around to continue on in the last playground of life called college. I've been getting ready to start in a new program. Which in all honesty, makes me nervous. It was nothing to change from pre-med to political science, because I wasn't really specializing in anything. But now by going down this direction in the fork in the road of life, I worry that I'm shutting out the other opportunities that do not branch off of this. But at the same time I see so many fresh opportunities that can arise if I do well in the next year.    I suppose I look at my time in college as an entity similar to the life of a phoenix. The birth of something new out of the ashes of the old. My undergrad years were not as spectacular as I would have liked. They were filled with great times with friends but also setbacks. Which added fuel to my fire during my last year and a half. I had an amazing drive to be better than I had ever been. My one goal was to do well enough in my courses to make the Dean's List. I finally acheived that goal in my last semester by earning a 3.8 GPA. My drive to improve myself has not disappated. I feel that I am up to the challege of graduate courses. My goal for this rapidly approaching academic year is to make at least the Dean's List.   During the next few months I will decide what direction my life will take me. If I can acheive my academic goals, life may take me to John's Hopkins or Columbia University. Or I may decide to continue my studies at the University of Iowa. But only time will tell.   But I'm starting anew, with a clean slate. New life path, new attitude and approach to the hiccups along the way. I know that I am a woman with a inner strength and a strong sense of who I am and where I want to go in life. I must learn to look within myself and find my own ray of light because my life will shine only as bright as I make of it.
