I just can't this gawkey smile to leave my face I am so happy! And I got to talkto Rachel last night and she was happy to hear about my first date which made me really happy because no one seems to be showing any emotion for me. And it is really starting to get to me. But I really don't care about those people because right now I am insanely happy.
