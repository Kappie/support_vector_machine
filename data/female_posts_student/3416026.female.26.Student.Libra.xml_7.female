Like if George Bush were to say "Well, the thing of it, what I mean to say... is  urlLink 2+2=5 , which helps our troops all over the world protect  urlLink America's freedom " people would be like "Oh, ok.  That makes sense."  So according to  urlLink Scott Rosenberg's blog on Tuesday  the New York Times is all "Dude.  We totally got it wrong on the WMDs."  They claim to have been "taken in" which means... what!?  That they were "taken in" by Colin Powell's dog-and-pony show at the UN, where he showed some aerial photographs of those trailers that looked suspiciously those temporary restrooms on the Jersey turnpike?  Jesus Christ.  Anyhow, I have had it.  This is why I read the  urlLink Daily News .
