Holy crap i really must have lost it!After i marry Raab, Knoxville(hes gonna divorce his wife for me dammit!), Steve-O(whos like friggin 30 hes almost old enuff to be my dad....ew still gotta love him tho) and Bam i will take over the world....because i can and i am caroline you sons of bitches!!!You Know!!!!!!lol that was dumb, however i do not care because at no point in time have i ever had a weird bug in my ass for an hour...or an period of time for that matter. So therefore i am smarter than Steve-O. hahahahaha......
