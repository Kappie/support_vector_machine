Came home to find my $12 bottle of conditioner that I had used only twice two-thirds gone in the guest bathroom.  Loafing bastard...Adding that on to the list of ammo I will eventually use as leverage for a temporary place to live in Connecticut in August.  Had lunch with Thomas at Farrah's today and attempted to talk him into getting tattoos at the seedy place across the street where we parked.  We really need to start spending more than 1 hour every 3 months together.  This time I had to rush back to Orlando for my grandmother's memorial and palm sunday mass.  One would think that 16 years would be enough time for the anger to subside.  Not so much.  Well, sitting here staring blankly at the screen listening to Frank's roaring snore tells me that I'm about out of things to say for now.  More after I have "the talk" (not the sex talk, that should have happened YEARS ago) with my parents.  Wish me luck. :)
