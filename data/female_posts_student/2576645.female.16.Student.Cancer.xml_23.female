(Single's Awareness Day)  Well, I arrived in Florida expecting to get a tan, feel warm, have the sun shine on my face, and all that lovely shit......but to my surprise..its going to be crappy all weekend! WOO HOO!  The fact that snow doesn't get into my shoes is quite comforting but I am seriously in the middle of nowhere.... surrounded by old people that apprently like to invest in tacky lawn ornaments.  The highlight of my day yesterday was eating alligator (which, according to legend, DOES taste like chicken), and shopping at a Bell's Outlet (a cheap store where the people here like to invest thier social security).   Today was an improvement...I got to swim with manatees! You can go on a boat tour and go scuba diving off of it. I saw tons of the 'sea cows' and even got to pet one. It felt like leather. They like it when you scratch their backs...who doesn't?...so I happily obliged.  Oh! And get this....they have a 'Monkey Island' in the middle of the river. Its this small island where people stuck like 5 monkeys and put some ropes and shelters for them on it. The monkeys are scared of water and can't swim, so they can never get off.   How depressing is that?   My grandpa assured me (after I brought this to everyones attention) that the monkeys get fed 3 meals a day and are 'much better off' than in the wild.   Still.....I wouldn't liked to be held on an island and be turned into a tourist trap.  Ah well...maybe if it was sunny here I wouldn't be so bummed out.  Geez...I'll stop complaining....its Florida!!! Who wouldn't kill to be me right now?   All you up in Michigan do me a favor....do my share of freezing my ass off k? K.
