Too bad this isn’t your time,  This is a time Where honesty digs you a deeper grave, And lies send you to heaven.     But Hell still costs a heart, a body, and a tear. And you give up everything To pay a debt You never made,  To the hate too deep within you. It’s not knowing who you are, Its knowing who you aren’t. It’s when knowing knowledge that never lasts Is more important than thinking thoughts That make you care.  This is a time where You can bleed to death from a promise broken, And survive in a lifeless body In a world being suffocated by its own hands.
