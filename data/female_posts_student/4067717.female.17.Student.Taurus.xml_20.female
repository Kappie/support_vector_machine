I'll just have to content myself with reruns of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?', which is a great show.  Today I painted a tree on the wall at BGS. It was quite fun, and I think it looks really good. Afterwards, Dad and I went to Lyons to see Grandma and Grandpa. Had a really good pecan praline parfait at DQ. Yum!  Other than the tree, I haven't accomplished anything all night. Alas, I should be reading Portrait of a Lady or BNW: Revisited. Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have something interesting to write about after band camp tomorrow.
