We went to this really cool church...one of 917 churches in Rome. Ah, so many, but yeah, it had some beautiful art.   It was really funny at dinner. They had music playing in the restaurant and all of a sudden in the midst of all these Italian songs, Stairway to Heaven started to play. I just thought it was really funny.   I'm pretty tired but I don't think I want to go to sleep yet. I think I may go take a walk or something. There's so many people out this late. It's awesome.
