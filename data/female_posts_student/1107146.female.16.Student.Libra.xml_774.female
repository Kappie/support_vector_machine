I mean, wow, you would really suck and hate your life if you died to your ignorance, man. Well, then you wouldn't have a life, so I guess it would all even out. Paradox!  Dude, everyone needs to go out and get Freschetta Oven-Baked pizzas. They cost a billion bucks but they are damn slick. I had that for din-din considering my mom is a cripple and doesn't really want to cook. It was that or another round of fast food, and my anorexia is suffering.   Well, another pointless post created, my work here is done.
