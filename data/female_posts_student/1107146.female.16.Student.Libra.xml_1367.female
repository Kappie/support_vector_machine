Well I found this site where they have patterns and stuff so if one us can sew...we can garb ourselves at a lower cost....since we don't want nobility style either I'm guessing. Just a thought....I'm bored. You guys know how I said I never get sunburn...well I did and now tanktops are my best friends.....wow i hate sunburns and this one isn't as bad as Sarah's. She can't move without pain and if Gavin so much and tries to give her a hug...she isn't too kind to him. anyway see yall
