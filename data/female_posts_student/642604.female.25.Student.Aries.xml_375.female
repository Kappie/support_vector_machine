I got it for the purposes of my family's herritage but here is what I found on the internet:  The Trinity Symbol: Definition: The triquetra (often, triqueta) is a tripartate symbol composed of three interlocked vesica pisces, marking the intersection of three circles. It is most commonly a symbol of the Holy Trinity (Father, son, Holy spirit) used by the Celtic Christian Church, sometimes stylized as three interlaced fish.   This symbol predates Christianity and was likely a Celtic symbol of the triple Goddess, and in the North, a symbol of the god Odin. Triplicities were common symbols in Celtic myth and legend, one of the possible reasons Christian beliefs were so easily adopted by the Celtic people. The triqueta makes an ideal Christian symbol. It is a perfect representation of the concept of "three in one" in Christian trinity beliefs, and incorporates another popular Christian symbol, the fish. It is sometimes enclosed within a circle to emphasize the unity aspect.  In Wiccan and Neopagan belief, the triqueta symbolizes the triple aspected goddess (maid, mother, and crone). Some Christians have protested this "appropriation" of the symbol...however, ironically enough, the original Christian fish symbol was derived from an early symbol of venus, one representing female generative organs- making the triquetra perfectly appropriate symbol for a Goddess revival. The triquetra is also considered to represnt the triplicities of mind, body, and soul, as well as the three domains of earth- earth, sea, and sky.  The Celtic Knot: The ancient Celts believed that life was "anam turas", a "journey of the soul".  It has been suggested that the interlocking knot patterns found in Celtic art represent this journey and exemplify the interconnectedness of all life.  The Celtic knot is always made of one long, interlocking, never-ending thread --- the thread of life, and symbolizes man's continuous quest for spiritual growth and rebirth of the soul.  While Celtic in origin, the knot can have universal significance and meaning for all.  The Heart: Hearts are a rather recent addition to Celtic symbolism. Hearts as symbols of "love" date from the later medieval period but have become an established part of the contemporary Celtic repertoire in the last decade of the 20th century.
