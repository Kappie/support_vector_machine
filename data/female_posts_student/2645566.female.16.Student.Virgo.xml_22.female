Leaving Tennessee where the temp was around 97 with 100% humidity and going to Michigan where it's only 65...words can't describe how great it was. Okay, now I seem really dumb for talking aimlessly about the weather, but it's my favorite kind and well...I'm dumb I guess.  Anyway, I was there to see Molly. I can't believe that she has lived up there for over a year now. The memory of her leaving seems so recent and I still hate to dredge it up. So on with the good stuff. I got to Detroit on Tuesday (I flew Northwestern...seemed like the flight was abandoned it was so empty, and it was really short in comparison to the California trips that I am used to making.) Becky, Molly's sister, picked me up at the airport (oh, this airport, yeah...it kicks ass. It has a freakin'   train   in it!). Well, since I don't really feel like giving a day by day, I'll just say that I went shopping every day (ranging from garage sales, to Outlet Malls, to Old Navy, to Molly's drawers...lol). I came back with more stuff than I had ever expected to get while I was there. 2 purses, new underwear, a t-shirt, 3 pairs of jeans (all from Molly! How often do you get Banana Republic, Lucky Jeans, and Gap clothes from your friends??), a hat, a pair of flip flops, a keychain (courtesy of Molly's aunt), and earrings. I think that was it, but I'm not guarantee-ing it.  Sunday night Molly, Becky, Emily (Becky's 8-month old daughter...she's SOO silly! Such a ham. hehe), and I drove back into Tennesee. We left Ann Arbor around 8:30 and got into Nashville around 4:30. So we made really good time. Molly and I went to Smyrna on Monday where my parents picked us up. We had Toot's for dinner which was definately an experiance as it was just Molly, my mom, and myself. From there we went around Big Lots...but then there was the Firewroks a.k.a Fireworks stand. Good stuff. Okay, so you won't get all of this, but oh well.   Moral of this entry: it's been a long time since I have written and in the mean-time I had a really great time with a really great friend.
