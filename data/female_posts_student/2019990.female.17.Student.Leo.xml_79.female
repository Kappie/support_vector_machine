Yesterday I went on a delightful trip to Great Spoons with Mahinda, Lola, Leila, and Wonder Woman.  We went to the mall and I found a homecoming dress for $18.  Then we went to target and got some lunch tot ake to the urb,then we went to the thrift store.  That was fun.  I found books, and really cheap dishes.  I got salt and pepper shakers, and cups for under a dollar.  Lola found a rockin' alarm clock/cd player too.  It has gems for buttons, and it's pink.  And the clock face changes colors!  She named it Bitchin'.  That's one of the best thrift store purchases I've seen so far.   Tomorrow we have relatives descending upon our house.  I really hope it stops raining so we can kick some of them outside.  Our house is rather small for that many people.  We'll have seventeen people here.  That's too many.  Wish me luck, I have to get back to cleaning or my mom is going to suck me up in the vaccuum.  Have a delightful day.
