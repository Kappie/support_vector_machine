Anyhoo, sorry about the lack of posts, but I definitely have had limited time on the 'net lately, and I also refuse to write in online diaries during yearbook, so...  Anyway, had a great weekend. Friday night I did homework (so that wasn't the great part). Saturday was spent at a Girl Scout campout. It's called Junior Jam, because all the Junior Girl Scouts (grades 4-6) from the area come to compete in different kinds of games. I'm a Senior Scout, so I got to be a judge. I was an art judge, which could have been really cool, if I'd had better events. Little trivia quizzes aren't so much fun. Oh well, at least I got to see the winners of the other events. That night my troop left to go to Nashville (Indiana, not Tennessee!) for dinner. We ate at the Hob Knob, which is a homey little place that mostly sells soup, salad, and sandwiches. We also bought fudge :o), poked around in some of the shops, and played putt-putt. Unfortunately I had to go home that night, because I was at church ALL DAY yesterday and I didn't want to exhaust myself before then!  Nine -- count them, NINE -- days till summer! (And Amaris, no summer gym this year! YAY!) Oh I can't wait! School and life in general haven't treated me that great this year, so I'm anxious for a nice, fun, stress-free break from it all!  BURGLE! :o)
