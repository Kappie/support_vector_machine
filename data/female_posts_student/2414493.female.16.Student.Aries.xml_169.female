This time, it was a full moon and I could feel the gravel under my feet and hear Nige, Tiff and Chaddy and Andrew drive off. I don't know why it's so fantastic, it's just this feeling...I can't help but feel every day that I love the people I'm with. It's nice to know that I'm a normal human being now, that I have people I can feel at home with. And it was an excellent way to erase the memory of a busy, busy week. Oh man, they are just fantastic.  And I just opened my inbox: I made Bach.   Driving lesson with Jimmy. It definitely shattered a lot of my stereotypes of black people. He just talked and talked for the whole entire two hours, and I don't think I can count how many times he said, "Stupid girl." Not about me, but about this girl he talked to on the phone last night who had psychological issues. He was just unexpectedly open, just talking and talking about life and girls and how they're superficial and needy and emotionally ill. Definitely not as strict as Sarah, who yaps at me for silly things. Little things, I mean.  Properly sated.
