Can't stand that show. There's a second season of Last Comic Standing starting.. this Saturday, I think. I really enjoyed last season because of that one Vietnamese dude.. Dat Fan! Although his routines were more energetic than the other performers', I really don't think that he was as naturally funny as the other comics. I felt kinda bad for him because he was the underdog and was teased by all the other comedians. But he won in the end, so it was okay. Last Comic Standing is the only reality show that I can stand. There are just WAY TOO MANY. Back when it was just Survivor, I'd take time out to watch them walk around eating whatever they could find. Now that they have shows like, "Extreme Makeover" and "The Swan", I think television's gone a little overboard. "The Swan"??? It's a show where "less than spectacular" women go and get plastic surgery. Then they line the prettiest ones up and have a beauty pageant. WTF? It's an insult to the idea that true beauty rests within. But, I guess the ratings are good or something.
