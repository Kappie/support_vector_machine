Aside from the fact that I am so tired. I got a 92 on a math quiz! YAY! And I had fun study hall today so that was good. I'm not going to teen thing tonight because I just want to hang out at home and be alone for a while.  Tomorrow I am going to Kim's softball game in VVS and then going to Battle of the Bands at Mt. Markham! It's gonna be friggen awesome. I can't wait! My mom is actually letting me go because I'm going w/ Kim and Sarah! I'm so excited about it. It's probally going to be the best ever. I hope.  Right now I'm just sitting here listening to Rooney and being bored.  Song: I'm losing you, I'm losing all control Jus' let me be, let me be alone tonite Wanna be alone tonite Once again we've gone off track and lost our hope for coming back Its time to restart again, and try your love for all again  It's time to work, to work is useless now Oh, can't you see, your health is lost to me Wanna be alone tonite Once again we've gone off track and lost our hope for coming back Its time to restart again and try your love for all again  We've lost all hope for coming back We've lost all hope for coming back We've lost all hope(we've lost all hope)for coming back Lost all hope for coming back  Once again we've gone off track and lost our hope for coming back Its time to restart again and try your love for all again -Losing All Control- Rooney
