I worked yesterday for about 7 hours, but had to come home early b/c i was aboutt o pass out of it being to hot >_  Lots of things are driving me crazy lately it seems like I get so easily pissed off b/c for some reason I'm really stressed out. Which Isn't cool I'm tired of making people sad for something I say I don't mean to ever hurt anyone. I think sometimes I try so hard not to I end up doing so. Oh the drama eeck!!!  I got a call asking me to joing the youth chior at church they need a soloist or something like that my friend gave them my name with high complaments darn him. I would love to go I just can't get there, my parents drive me insane for little things like that.  Im still in trouble for wanting to drive, my mom thinks I'm just gunna run off and junk.  I get to go shopping sometime this week lol yay I like shopping!!
