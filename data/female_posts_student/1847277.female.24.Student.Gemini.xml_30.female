Being the last day before classes started, my goal was just to chill and ill, and I think I did pretty well at it.  Got up later than normal, talked on the phone for a couple of hours, read a book, went to the Chocolate Cafe with Matt, where I had some of the best hot chocolate ever made, made chili (by myself, which is a first... although Matt did provide nearly step by step instructions), and then ate and hung out with Allison and Margaret for a few hours.  Now I can spend a couple hours online and rock out to 99x.com.  Wahoo.  I'm guessing tomorrow is going to be wicked hectic and probably stressful, which is normally just the way I like it.  I function best under pressure.  I do hope, though, that I get the photo CD that Noah claimed he was going to mail last Monday, as that would at least be a nice end to the day.  And Matt might be coming home, which I suppose would be an even nicer end to the day. :)  So, yeah.  Nothing else to be said.
