I think the greatest part about her is that she is not afraid or intimidated to tell people what she thinks or feels; to me, that is the most admirable quality in a person. Life is too short to have people step all over you, and for a person not to do anything about it, and have their feelings crushed into the ground as if they were cheaper than dirt. And just by talking to her over the net for a while, I can safely make that judgement of her, and I love her so much more for it. She makes me smile, and unlike most of the people that are in and out of my life right now, she has never said an unkind or insensitive thing to me before.   On the other hand, I tried to call Heather to tell her that I can't go to the club tomorrow night, but she wasn't home; if she's not home, she's probably up at Hardee's, so I went up there and there she was. I succeeded in telling her I can't go, and succeeded in getting highly upset, again. I'm too damn sensitive. All she had to say to me was "Oh, can't you do something with Marie?" CAN I DO SOMETHING WITH MARIE?! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? I feel so loved; it was me or Dr. Feelgood's and they chose Dr. Feelgoods. A skanky nightclub with red glitter all over the walls and drunk guys everywhere. Incredibly fun, but I am so much better. I guess that's just me though.   A representative from Anderson University in Indiana called me this evening to say the college was "highly interested" in me. After looking at their website, I am "highly uninterested" in them. Get this:                Sexual misconduct is any violation of campus standards          related to sexual behavior, including premarital sexual relations and homosexual behavior. Sexual misconduct may include cohabitation, overnight visitation with someone of the opposite sex, or other sexual conduct not believed to be in keeping with university standards.          Pregnancy outside of marriage is the result of sexual misconduct and is a violation of campus standards. Students violating campus standards related to sexual misconduct are subject to disciplinary action, and are usually required to undergo counseling. Parents are informed when pregnancy outside of marriage is known.  This is YOUR CHOICE to make. Okay, I can understand the first paragraph... I believe it is up to the individuals involved, but I can understand it. But the second paragraph is completely out of the question. Pregnancy outside of marriage results in counseling and parental notification? What the fuck? An extremist Christian school for you.  Hahaha, the craziness!
