Yesterday Sara and I were going to meet the new teacher yesterday but she ended up having to work. Then Keems called me and we talked for a while until she had to go. Then Sara called me and we talked for a long time. I still have a good feeling about this year (knock on wood). Hopefully, that's true at least. I looked at my mom's old year books today. I realized some things: my uncle looked like a bum then, too, my dad looked a lot different, and everyone wore afros. Yes. Even my uncle and Dad. Aaahhh the Peace Pipe. And now I'm going to try and find something to eat. I doubt I'll find something, but it's time for lunch and I'm hungry.
