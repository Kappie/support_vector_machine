So I just didn't go but I know once Dacia gets home she'll call me up complain I didn't let her know I wasn't going to school bla bla bla! what ever I needed to stay home so screw it! OHHH!!! It's almost Novermber 1st which is almost november 25!! The day Simple Plan's "A Big Package For You" Comes out!! YES!!! Simple Plan is gonna be on IMX (Fuse) to let you guy's all know! But I'm not sure if it's just a repeat of an old episode but either way it's an hour on Simple Plan! I think that on my birthday I'm gonna fill out another quizy thingy... that's November 19th. Well I'll get back to pretending to be sick... *Cough-Cough* bye!
