We made less money than last time. Even though we had more fun: it wasn't raining! OMG! lol. So it was fun, except I am sunburned, even my feet. But I am also tanned. The high point: drying this car and talking to this hot dude that had egg splattered on his car. Courtney was jealous- muhaha courtney, lol. The low point: Getting a soapy sponge put in my bathing suit, thanks Clayton.  On Saturday we were supposed to have to march in the sesquicentennial parade for Karnes City. "The Mighty Badger Band from Karnes City Land" gag me. Yah, well, we woke up, it was pouring with rain and lightnening (is that a word?). I called Mr.Campbell, and guess what, we still had the parade on! So we drive into Karnes City (pick up Jenna on the way) and we get to the bandhall and Phileda gets her hair fro-ed out running around in her poncho-that-looks-like-a-trashbag. So then we go inside and Mr.Campbell says we have to wait until 9:00 to see if it has been cancelled or not. And then, at 9:00 we learn it's been cancelled. So Steffy, me, Elise, my mom, and Jenna decide to go see Mean Girls. And surprise, surprise, as we leave Karnes City, it stops raining and the sun comes out! Haha, but the parade was left cancelled. The first showing of Mean Girls was at 1:00 so we had some major time to kill (it was like, 10:00). So my mom dropped us off at Bealls while she went to H-E-B. At Bealls we decided to pick out an outfit for each of us, and try it on. In about 15 minutes, the entire populous of salespeople were gathered outside the dressing rooms all wondering whether or not to kick us out. So, I started talking loudly about "Do you think this would look like to much for the after party?" Yah, so we got out of there pretty fast.  Then we went to Pizza Hut for an early lunch. We ordered a pizza, and it got there (FINALLY) and Steffy decided to grab the first slice. Steffy grabs the slicer, picks up a piece of pizza and aims for her plate... and misses- slapping the pizza against her shirt instead. Her white shirt... Haha, we love you Steffy. OK, if you haven't seen Mean Girls go see it! That is such a good movie. Even guys would like that movie. After the movie we remembered that Travis Q had lost his cell phone. So we asked the front desk, who told us to ask the janitor, who told us to come back on Monday, but we had our sad looks on, so he looked for us, and we FOUND his cell phone! We were so happy. So naturally, we just had to return it to Travis ASAP so my mom drove us to his house. We then faced a dilemma: we couldn't choose between 2 houses. lol. So we went up to the first one and knocked on the door (we picked this house on my analysis that there was a dog outside the other one and Travis doesn't have a dog). Well, it was the wrong door. So then we went to the other house (by the way, it was a dog statue, nice job Phileda) and knocked on the door- BINGO! It was the right house lol Yah so we returned the phone and all. Then, on the way home, a bird tried to commit suicide by flying into our windsheild, lol. Steffy and Jenna spent the night (Steffy snores, lol, jk). Then we got up early to take them to church. I then went to Wal-Mart to find Mr.Cline sitting in the band trailer with about 1,000 Krispy-Kream doughnuts, so we got our 2 boxes and went home! Then the heart burn whatever shit started and as of right now, I haven't actually eaten very much... lol.  Yah, wow that was long.
