Okay, so it may not very much resemble an actual trial that you are likely to see anywhere.  But there is some wonderful acting in the grand old style of over-the-top theatrics, and it is at least based on actual events (The Scopes Monkey Trial), so it does have a modicum of reality about it, even if the courtroom dramatics are pure theater.  The movie does play a bit like a filmed play rather than a film in its own right, but I think this is because most of the action takes place in the courtroom.  And check out Gene Kelly in a decidedly and unabashedly un-musical and generally strange- but not altogether terrible - performance as a cynical and caustic journalist in the style of H.L. Mencken.    The title of the film comes from Proverbs 11:29, quoted by Spencer Tracy (in the Clarence Darrow role) at the end of the film:  "He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart."
