It's the one I've wanted to get for a really, really long time, just my mom wouldn't buy it for me, cause it was to expensive and I didn't have enough money.  But today I got my pay check, cashed it and then went straight to Kast-a-way Swim Wear. It's a reversible, polyester suit with pictures of zebra's on one side and zebra stripes on the other side. And its purple! :)       I love it soooooooooo much! And it's mine, not my mom's. :)
