All the regrets that i face everyday. i just cant help but think that years from now im gonna think back and say "what if". i dont wanna look back and think "what if". i wanna be happy. happy that i used this time on earth. a few days ago they had the model search thingy. i have no doubt in my mind that i would be good for it. ask any of my friends they'll say im model material but my insecurities kept me from doing that. and before that there was this backround dancer thingy for girls my age just like in the town over but again my insecurities and my fears kept me from that. i just dont wanna miss out on things because i dont feel good about my self.
