UGH! thats how i felt. a little shitty, used, pissed off, and kinda sad because i really wouldnt have expected that one. i guess it kind of showed when he had to leave the room to talk to his "best friend" at 4 in the morning and had his "best friends" picture on his computer screen. but hey i have pictures of my best friend right? haha well anyhow even though i've had numerous offers i think i will pass up someone hiring a hitman or someone breaking his knees or in my friends words "offing" him. lol you guys are so sweet and always cheer me up. I know that one day i will find a guy who isn'y shitty and actually likes me crazy porn hair and all...last remark Ryan, of course. Anyways thats just a little vent there i'm sure there will be some interesting ones coming up in the near future or at least i will find something to write about for you guys however many there are probably like five. but yes thats my current boy situation and no i am not a "pimpette" Love always you own maddy.
