Take Taffy over to the stables and work on jumping.  4.) Do some Latin. Damno Latine! 5.) See if I can talk somebody into taking me to see Fire Lily!    Well it doesn't seem like much, but it really is. I mean I'll be working at the stables for like 3 1/2 hours! Then I have to walk over to the self-care building and worm Taffy. Then I need to walk her back to the main barn, groom her, and set up some cavelleti, and so on, and so forth. Then I need to submit my Chapter 8 Latin Exercises, which take forever to type out. By the time I'm done I won't have time to see Fire Lily.  *Sigh*  I really, really need to work with Taffy. I have to get her into shape. Right now she's, um... "pleasantly plump". I want to enter her in the Emerald Valley Something Or Other Miniature Horse Show which is on the 29th-31st. So I have a lot of work ahead of me.  Which reminds me of my job this summer. Construction! I'm gonna be helping to build the new self-care barn. As soon as I make $700, I'm buying a cart and harness for Taffy. Maybe I'll buy a new saddle for Fire Lily? Oh, and a 4 1/2" low port curb while I'm at it. Hmm, the Canby Tack Sale is coming up soon.............  I better go get ready for a day full of stall cleaning. :(
