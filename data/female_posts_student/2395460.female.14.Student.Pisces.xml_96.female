The neon lining of these classic looking bags isn't justbright pink, it's an actual light. The bags are made ofsoft, supple leather in pink, orange, turquoise, and lime (as well as classic black) and just needtwo easily replaceableAA batteries.   Makeup tip: Nothing is as unsettling as beige lips; playing sick is easy as pie with a coat of  urlLink Quick Corrector . You may just score a few extra weeks of sick pay.
