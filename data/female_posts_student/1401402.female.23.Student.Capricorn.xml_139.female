I've never known someone so well and still felt there was so much left to discover... never been able to say "I love you" and have it mean something beautifully different every time. I've never known someone I could spend hours with and still long for time to share... never felt so close to someone in so many ways. And even though I know I'll never be able to tell you with words how much you mean to me... I hope you somehow understand that the love I fell for you is more beautiful, more meaningful than words could every say.   Andy, thanks for this lovely card, thank you so much for loving me but things will always remain the way they are.....
