Here's what he had to say about the issues that count (such as ice cream flavors, and wearing womens clothes)   Me: okay, dave... what is your full name? Dave: David Alexander Scarrow (no punching required, I know i'm a nerd already) Me: whens your b-dey? Dave: October 1st, 1987 Me: are you currently avialable? Dave: LOL Dave: .... Dave: that means yes Me: ah i see Me: well what do you look for in a potential signifigant other? Dave: Honesty is most important. She needs to be real. Intelligence (in more ways than one), understands my messed up sense of humour, and can handle being with someone as shy and clumsy as me. Me: hummm i see... well thats nice.. whats your fave movie? Dave: Independence Day... that movie rocks, and i'm not even American. Me: ha ha ha how witty Me: lol Dave: btw, I love this sophisticated journalism Lauren. Me: thank you Dave: so professional Me: lol what about books? Me: do you like to read dave? Dave: not really... but my favourite book of all-time is "The Outsiders: Me: oo tahts a good one Me: if you could be ice cream, what flavor would you be Dave: it sure is, sophisticated journalism Lauren. Me: lol lol lol Dave: definitley vanilla... definitley sweet, but simple. Me: what topping would you want? Dave: assorted sprinkles Dave: for undisclosed reasons Me: o0o0o0o do you have something to hide dave? Dave: next question, please Me: hummm Me: lol Dave: I refuse to be attacked like this Me: no wait i still have more questions! Dave: fine, fine... i'm sorry for that outburst Dave: continue. Me: okay Me: waht is your idea of a perfect date? Dave: not too sweet... if they're too dry, they lose flavour and- oh wait... you don't mean the fruit, do you... Hm, well... i'd say finding something in commmon that we both love, and enjoying the evening just having fun. Nothing too fancy, just a good time. Me: LMAO Me: i htought you were gonna say an acatula date like.. nov. 2 or something lol Dave: lol, that was a possibility Me: ooo lol Dave: I really like your sophisticated journalism lauren... do you have a sophisticated journalistic boyfriend? Me: no i do not dave Dave: oh, really... interesting Me: very Me: :: wink wink:: Me: lol Dave: ooh... i'm getting very turned on by this interview Dave: I mean... i'm getting very informed by this interview Me: lol  Me: im glad Me: okay.. moving along Dave: "Well... I guess we'll be getting off together er- I mean, going down together I mean er-..." "It's ok, i'll just press the button on the stimulator er- I mean, elevator"  God bless the simpsons. Dave: yes, yes... moving along Me: okay... if you could wear any womens clothes, what would you wear and why? Dave: i'd say bra... it would be nice to live an active single woman lifestyle and still get the support I desperatley need. Me: LMAOOO Dave: are you ok, sophisticated journalism lauren? Me: yes.... your just makein me laff rele hard lol Me: okay.. how does it feel to be a canadian? Dave: i'm like so proud, eh? I live in an igloo and spend my weekdays hunting, and my weekends playing with our pet moose, eh? I play hockey in my spare time, talk really slow, and that's about it. --> Me: lol well thank you for your time dave... i hope our readers feel informed after reading and delving into the mind of a male teenage canadian Dave: thanks for having me sophisticated journalism new-yorker-barbra walters but much younger and prettier- Lauren. BTW, I don't really live in an igloo...  I LOVE YOU ALL!
