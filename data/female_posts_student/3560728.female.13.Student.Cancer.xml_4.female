Loss of Belief  I've wasted all of my time thinking of you I've been making you up to be more than you are There's nothing that sets you apart  You created the illusion that you cared and you made me believe you but no longer can you catch me in the web of lies that you've spun  Deceitful and insensitive tonight is the last night you'll ever see me again and you'll wonder why you ever left me behind  At least I don't have to feel anymore because your faults created the nightmare that we're living  tomorrow's too late you can never take back the words that you spoke to me that I can't forget...  -End-  I think the poem speaks for itself.
