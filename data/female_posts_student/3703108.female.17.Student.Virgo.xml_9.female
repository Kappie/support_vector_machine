But I have been so busy lately. I'm hardly ever home. I'm at someone else's house each day. Tuesday I was at Maria's, Wednesday I was at Katie's, Thursday I was at Noelle's and today I'm going to Nicole's. And tomorrow I'm going to Evan's play. And Sunday I'm going to Allie and Joe's. I'm not really complaining, it's just very out of character for me to be so busy. Anyway, I have a funny story. Noelle told me that right after Becky called me the other night and I told her I couldn't hang out because I was gonna be hanging out with Noelle, she called Noelle and asked if she could hang out. I can't believe her! I had a feeling she was going to do that. She is really on a mission to get me and Noelle not to be friends. It's sick. Nicole wants to go to Six Flags today. I don't really feel like it. It's gonna be very crowded. I really feel like going to a water park, but no one ever wants to go with me because it's too expensive. That's true, but I really want to go. The only person who can ever go is Katie because she has a season pass to Hurricane Harbor, but she's always really busy. There is a carnival coming up soon. I'm excited. I'm gonna go with Noelle. I leave for Disney World in less than two weeks! I'm so excited! I can't wait! Well, I have to go get ready. Nicole is gonna call me soon.
