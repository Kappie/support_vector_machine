I showed my sister the photos from the archives of one of your other blogger groups--SMEAGHE TODAY maybe it. (What does SMEAGHE stand for?) You probably beat me in chess too. I might have a chance with Scrabble. However, my SAT vocabulary might not help me. I need those obscure short words to put me in the lead, and that's what I lack. But I kick gluteus maximus when it comes to air hockey and pinball. How do I create line breaks with this thing so my paragraphs don't  run together into one?
