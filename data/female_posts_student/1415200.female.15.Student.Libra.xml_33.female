We ran into Tom and Scott, and went sledding with them. Then we got cold and hungry and decided to head back. Then we goofed off for a while and ate some dinner.  I realized what I needed to along time ago.  Why am I the way I am? Why do I have to be the one stuck so depressed all the time, and why do I have to be the odd one out by the whole vegetarian scheme? If I was normal like every other ska-bunctious kid then maybe I wouldnt be such a problem. Thats all I am. A problem. While im deep in thought, im going to go listen to some Early November, and think about some stuff.  Nights are too long. Hope will never come.
