Don't expect anything - go out and get it! Okay... prep talk over, ok everyone? *how patronising, make your own dreams and drive!* Uhh I guess I haven't been reading enough to communicate through words very efficiently. Damn, now I'm using long clever words! One more exam left, then our GCSE's will have completely finished. By Thursday we'll all be free! So don't just bum around at home, live the life that's out there! Don't rely on other people to wait for you otherwise you'll fall behind. Make it so that when you go back you have a whole load of stuff to tell people. Yup, confused brain. Hmm... must remember the Battle of Little Big Horn was in 1876... then everything will be fine... Or it will when m brain stops singing in exams! Aargh!
