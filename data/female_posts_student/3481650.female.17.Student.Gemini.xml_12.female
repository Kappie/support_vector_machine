If I could just fill up my time with things to do, I wouldn't have to think about the fact that I'm bad at conversation, and that I don't have many of them with the people I want to. I'm so sick of this! My family is not interacting! The only thing going on is between me and my mom... painting a stupid floor! And my friends are running...forever. I'm the only kid out of four in my family who isn't gone somewhere right now. Ross is in Alabama with his friends... at Gulf Shores. Amy is in Oklahama with Johnathan and Zach. Mark is in San Antonio with... you guessed it, Sara. (A certain amount of time went by...)   I just    had a good conversation with Laura T. We talked about being shy and starting conversations...and changing yourself with who you are around...and the pressure of being someone in front of certain people...I don't like feeling like I need to interpret what people want from me. It's like I'm actually trying too hard to please, which sucks, because I don't like it when people are obviously like that, they seem so fake. I don't want to think of myself as fake...I feel like I've taken all the things I love and believe about everything from the world... It makes me feel like a thief, like I'm not real in some way. Maybe I'm not?
