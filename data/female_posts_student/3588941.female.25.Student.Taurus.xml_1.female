The concept implies a human-centered universe in which human actions are of paramount importance; the world is a place of conflict and difficulty, and human value and meaning is measured against individual effectiveness in the world.     To Aristotle, arete is explicitly linked with human knowledge. Plato repeatedly returns to the question of arete, and the evidence of his earliest writings suggest that Socrates, Plato's teacher, was equally obsessed with the question. The famous Socratic paradox, "Virtue is knowledge," is in Greek, "Arete is knowledge." This would be the foundation of both Socratic and Platonic philosophy: the highest human potential is knowledge and all other human abilities are derived from this central capacity. Aristotle also locates the highest human potential in knowledge: theoretical knowledge. If arete is knowledge and study, the highest human knowledge is knowledge about knowledge itself; in this light, the theoretical study of human knowledge, which Aristotle called "contemplation," is the highest human ability and happiness.
