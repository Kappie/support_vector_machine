They kept on saying obvious things which none I would ever understand. They knew it. But they STILL talk about it. They are so ever tactless!  Today once again, I go and read her blog. Suddenly, I found myself filled with disgust after reading her feelings. How do girls fall for guys so easily!? They are only judging by looks and they can go extremely crazy for them. Capturing photos, dwelling in the past, thinking about them. HEY! You all are dreaming, all right!? They're so naive! C'mon, it's time to WAKE UP! I thought there was something wrong in their psychology. Capturing photos... Wah. It's like nightmare. Now I truly understands what my brother meant by "making your favourites until they're so ever disgusting". Good looking guys doesn't make themselves perfect. Of course girls will naturally dream over good looking guys but not until this kind of madness and craziness!!
