It's like she has permanent PMS or sumthing.  I had mi first guitar lesson 2day after I taught myself it 4 2weeks. The teacher really liked me. Hs name is Andy. He's cool. Quite funny. He loved mi hands (long guitar/piano fingers, y'see?) and he gave me his guitar 2 use and bring home and practice with so I wouldn't have 2 use "Ivan" - mi younger brother's 3/4 size guitar. He was very impressed with how much I knew. :D  Coles Myer say they "would like to congratulate you (me) in advancing further in the recruitment process!"  Oh yay.I am quite desperate. I really need some cash. Trying2 survive on $10 p/w sure is hard!Well I s'pose any jobis better than Maccas's or sum other digusting fast-food place. Only if I get a job, balancing the million other commitments I have in my life will just become harder. Gosh, don't you just wish there was more time?
