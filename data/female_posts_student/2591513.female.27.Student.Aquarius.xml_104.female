I love Ed and again, can't imagine my life without him.  I wish he didn't have to to go Iraq, but know he has a very noble job to do.  So when I hear all these people knocking what is being done out in Iraq I am angered.  I am angered because as much as I don't want them there, they are there because they are US soldiers and doing what they are told.  We don't have to like what is going on there to support the men and women out there.  They aare the ones risking their lives, leaving their families and putting their lives in God's hands.  So all bickering aside, let's show these men and women the respect they deserve.
