How much do you hate Mel?  Gawd, she's so annoying!  All day she was lifting her skirt up and saying, "I'm Jools and I'm not a slut."  Possibly the most annoying thing was Clare + Charlotte pretending they thought it wasn't funny.  BullSHIT.  They found it hilarious.  You could just see their faces contorting when we were with them.  (Thanx, Pooj, for sticking by me in all my annoyingness.)  And Nisha, Amy, Rachel and the rest of them were all saying that Mel did it and Clare and Charlotte burst out laughing.  What's so funny about it?  I know I would say that, because it's about me, but what's so great about Mel flashing her legs and talking in a high voice?  It's really not that funny.  She can't even get her story straight about why she doesn't like me.  At first, it was because I didn't apologise about  everything  I've ever done (??) and now it's because everyone else apologised about this argument I don't even remember having.  I never  argue  with Mel - I blank her, or turn everyone against her.  I never argue with her, though.  And she really thinks I fancy Tom (HAH HAH) so she was going to pay him to flirt with her when I was there.  (But he wouldn't.  Mwuh hah hah.)  After French, she was going on about how he gave her a sweet, and not me.  So??  I don't give a DAMN, Mel, get that through your puny brain.  (Once she said, "Don't call me a slut!" but she forgot to say, "I'm Jools," and the beginning, so I was like, "I won't call you a slut, Mel, you're just the fucking slut-mobile driver.")  When Nisha, Amy etc told us that, we were like, "Oh, we won't tell them ..." and then as soon as we got outside I said, "I'm gonna fucking KILL them!!" and a whole bunch of Lower Sixthforms turned around.  They're such twats, L6s.  Like Luke, he is such a knob.  But that's a leetle bit off topic, so never mind.  At the beginning of French, Mel just came up to me and said, "You know, Elliott would never go out with you because you're a second year.  I asked him."  And I was just thinking,  No DUH, Mel, did you really assume I would ever think I could get my hands on fit fifth-year totty like him??  You must be dillusional.   I was watching him play football today.  Pooj didn't have her glasses on, so I was trying to describe what he was doing so she could see him, even if he was kinda blurry.  So it was like, "He's the one jumping up and down ... he's the one running ... he's the one ... spazzing?"  And before, we came down to the playground to watch him play, and Pooj was like, "Is that him?"  and I was like, "Yeah, he's the one ... pulling out a wedgie ..."  Lol, it's so weird if you just watch him for a second, because he's usually doing something really ... um ... yeah.  I can't  believe  he was on the America trip and I wasn't there.  But I suppose they did only get half an hour's shopping time in New York, and I wasn't allowed anyway because it was in Killington and my dad nearly died there.  (He almost died in  Kill ington - how freaky is that?)  Mel talked to him on the trip.  Of course, if I was there, he'd definitely know I fancy him by now.  He probably does actually - every time I see him I'm like, gawping at him, lol.  How  long  is MSN taking to load.  You STINK! I just wanted to see if anyone decent was online, but they're probably long gone now.  It's taken about twenty minutes, and it's still not done yet.  Oh, I hate being back at school!  So yeah, I get to see Elliott, and all the other gorgeous fifth years (cuz they are mostly fifth years.  There's one fit U6, and one fit L6, and an alright fourth year, but that's IT.  He's taken, anyway), but I've got Mel trying to get right up my ass all the time, and there's the rest of the slut-mobile to think about.  (Not saying anymore about that incase this is found, but Pooj'll know what I'm on about ;) if you don't let your MUM read this and get scared of me, eh Pooj?)  I'd forgotten how much I hate school.  I spend every lesson waiting for it to be over.  It's so CRAP!  My sister's leaving school at the end of this year, and 'tis not fair that I have to be there for another five years.  And then there's uni to think about, and my fees are gonna be a trillion times more than my sister's fees cuz of some new law or something.    Must go, have to write a bitchay bitchay email to Mel :D it's moments like this that make my life complete.  *~Joolsipie~*  Yes Sean, this is my current blog.  Don't tell my sister, or anyone who could tell my sister, about it.  It's your own fault you found the rest of them, lol.  Oh yeah, I didn't ask earlier but a)  why  were you talking to Luke? and b) what song is your addy from?  It's bugging me now ...
