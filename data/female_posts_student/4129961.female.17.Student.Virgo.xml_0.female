Benji was supposed to get online at 4:30pm but i guess he forgot or something. or else someone else is using the phone. but anyways, just wanted to mention some songs that i really like.       Meiko Kaji  - Flower of Carnage    Zamfir  - The Lonely Shepherd    Al Hirt  - Green Hornet    Electric Light Orchestra  - Mr. Blue Sky    Hootie and the Blowfish  - Only Wanna Be With You      that's all for now. i'll write back later.
