Tireness is a combination of its own reward.  Dont get through the day, but from the day.   No one is perfect so always keep up a good self-esteem.  Money must earn but principle is above all.  Death is not horrible. The horrible thing is dying without your consciences.  Here`s a few reasons why GUYS like GIRLS:   1. They will always smell good even if its just shampoo.  2. The way their heads always find the right spot on our shoulder.  3. How cute they look when they sleep.  4. The ease in which they fit into our arms.   5. The way they kiss you and all of a sudden everything is right in the world.   6. How cute they are when they eat.  7. The way they take hours to get dressed but in the end makes it all worth while.   8. Because they are always warm even when its minus 30 out side.   9. The way they look good no matter what they wear.  10. The way they fish for compliments even though you both know that you think she`s the most beautiful thing on this earth.  11. How cute they are when they argue.  12. Theway her hand always finds yours.   13. The way they smile.   14. The way you feel when you see their name on the call ID after you just had a big fight.  15. The way she says "lets not fight anymore" even though you know that an hour later you will be arguing about something.  16. The way they kiss when you do something nice for them.  17. The way they kiss you when you say "I love you'.   18. Actually ... just the way they kiss you...   19. The way they fall into your arms when they cry.   20. Then the way they apologize for crying over something that silly.   21. The way they hit you and expect it to hurt.   22. Then the way they apologize when it does hurt.(even though we don`t admit it)!   23. The way they say "I miss you".  24. The way you miss them.   25. The way their tears make you want to  change the world so that it doesn`t hurt her anymore.  I've got a new favorite song in mind.  I'll always be there for you by Angelina  I never met a person quite like you, someone that makes me feel love. I wanna be the one that you are thinking of the on that brighten up your day.  Because there's nobody else that can do the things you do. Forever I'll be there for you. So if you feel that you need the love, let me be the on that you are thinking of. Because I will make it so rite.   I've got to tell you what I feel in my heart. I wrote this song just to say nobody's gonna love me nobody but you. Forever and ever I will always be there for you. I'm yours from this very day, I promise I'll always be true.
