I had juz been through a horrible day, with exam papers coming back at a nerve-wrecking pace...and i was breaking up in cold sweat...thank goodness it's over...i think ppl thought i peeed in my pants cos i sweat so much!! Hahaha... Ok, cut the crap. After the ordeal, everyone got up and started comparing marks, and that really PIsSeD me off. "Wah...why u get so high?" "I so careless!" blah blah...hallo, people, wake up!! What's done is done! Juz forget about it and move on man! Enjoy your recess!! But of course, who listens to me? I'm like the only person who thinks like that in my nerdy class...well, except for some people :) Actually, what's there to moan about in the first place? We did very well for almost all the subjects, and there people not smiling but sulking. I tell you, my class is insane..they have way too high expectations of themselves...and that's stressing me up! And that's not all. When the teacher came in with the marksheet, everyone rushed forward like bees...i was like "come on lah...u checked ur marks like a thousands times already lor.." I couldn't be bothered. I juz slept. And I can't stand T anymore!!!! She's is so so irritating!!!She was the first one to rush to the dreaded marksheet and there she goes wif her arrogant voice saying "I am supposed to get A1 for physics...i got twenty-somethings for my past tests that were upon 25 and 30...A2 is impossible." And she keeps repeating that over and over again to every gal and guess what? I was next to all the commotion! Arrrrggggh.... I can't stand it...I can't stand everyone...everyone is only interested in academics!! Can't their blinded eyes see that RESULTS ARE NOT EVERYTHING?  P.S. Sorry I very angry today -_-
