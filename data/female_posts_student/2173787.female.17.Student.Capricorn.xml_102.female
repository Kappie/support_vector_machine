Generally its my time to be selfish and voice what I truly want.  Sometimes its for an event to occur or to change something about myself, and amazingly when looking back over these past wishes many of the ones I remember came true.   It never happens when I expect it or how I expect it.  When I was little I wished to grow up and guess what...It happened!! That's about the only one I am willing to share with the internet, but there were other one that came true that were more meaningful and more telling.  Having wishes makes me feel like someone out there is listening and working to help me achieve my goals.   Lately though I've been wishing for things that I know as soon as I say them that they will never come true, and its ruining my mind in some ways.  Knowing that my wishes cannot be granted makes me feel less like believing in anything.   (Its weird... What I call wishes are essentially prayer, but my mind rebels from calling them that.  I feel a distinct difference between my selfish whispers in the night and religion, yet I talk to the same thing.  And while wishes not coming true undermines my belief in the seemingly impossible, it does not seem to undermine my faith.)  But anyway, I saw the clock approaching 12:12 last night and began formulating my wishes in my head (they don't become the actual wish until said aloud) and had all kinds of plans for what I was to wish for, I wanted a specific event to occur or for me to find the courage to force it to occur, yet when the clock changed to 12:12 I blurt out: I wish for a pink rabbit, I don't care what kind as long as it is a pink rabbit.  Even as I said it I didn't know what I meant and I certainly don't now.  Part of me wanted to wake up and find one on the foot of my bed, just to prove to myself that wishes do come true, but in reality my wishes never work that way I wake up one morning and realized that it had come true and had come true a long time ago.  So who knows...
