You are fun and playful and enjoy being around people who are exciting. You always liven up a party and you make a great cheerleader for your friends! You are the first to say, "You can do it!" or "Wow! You did a great job!" You are also ambitious and know you must work hard so you can play hard!  Flip Side:You like to be noticed! While it's often a good thing to stand out in a crowd, you sometimes get pouty if you feel that others don't appreciate what you have done. You give a lot of praise to others, and you expect it back in return! Don't get your feelings hurt if they don't gush over how wonderful you are... inside they know you are terrific!  Yep,that's my sign..........Leo- The Magnificent Lion, she who rules all in the Horoscope Kingdom.........Oblivious to the evil plottings of Pisces.........Which are yet to be discovered soon.............
