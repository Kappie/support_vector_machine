I had an awesome weekend: sun, pretty college, boat, and a new friend.  Is it as easy as that? We'll just have to see.   Charleston made me happy with its pretty buildings and weather.  The trip was fun, who would have thought?  Cheer and smiles, services on the beach.  Our mini service was amazing.  Picture yourself standing on the edge of the water, waves almost lapping your toes as the sun sets behind you and the wind rustles through your hair.  Now add to that the comforting and welcoming melodies of Kabbalat Shabbat and you have a rough idea of it.  The wind seemed to carry our prayer, and our cares away, up to heaven.  It was truly a divinely inspired moment.  Time stooped, everyone disappeared and the moment overtook me.  Then suddenly it was over and we went home as if nothing happened. But back to happiness.  What is it?  Is it in the past, moments that flutter by and never return?  Or is it a constant, merely interrupted by bursts of unhappiness?  Is that why we rarely notice ourselves happy, that we only notice its absence?  Why do I complain so much?  I'm always whining, always seem to be looking for sympathy, do me a favor smack me the next time I whine.  My life is full of happy moments, but they are so easy to forget.  Next time I'm sad will I remember swinging on the dock?  Remember how I nearly lost my Rainbows over the edge?  Remember praying in the sand?  Remember the boat ride to Fort Sumter breaking every rule in sight and pretending to be King (technically queen) of the world on the bow of the ferry boat?  Or, will all I remember be the sunburn and being tongue tied on the tour of the college? I hope I remember the happy and for get the rest.  As Hurston wrote: "Women forget all those things they don't want to remember, and remember everything they don't want to forget."  I don't like having a selective mood based memory. When we were downtown last night some guys had their stereo blasting and were jamming at a stoplight.  In the middle of this crowded street and stoplight everything just kind of stopped.  People started bobbing to the music and one girl was in the midst of the crosswalk and started to dance around.  People heckled and cheered, the music played and the world stopped turning while it was caught in the moment.  Then as suddenly as it began the light changed and everything started up again.  Is that life?  Just a glimpse and as soon as you get in the groove its gone?  Or does it continue on in your mind and the minds of those around you becoming immortalized?    Driving home I'm watching the clouds, constantly shifting, constantly changing.  Nobody notices when a cloud  changes shape, changes texture, falls apart or gathers together.  A cloud is allowed to be free, allowed to change.  Why can't I suddenly change? Why must people be surprised when I do things, when I change my life, my clothes, or G-d forbid, my mind?  Why do I have a box, a peg on the wall?  Everyone thinks they know me, and I really don't even know myself.  I want to be a cloud, allowed to change, allowed to drift and then return.  I want to float away and be recreated over and over again.  But that can't happen.  I can't go back and don't want to rush forward.  I lived this weekend in the moment, forgot who I was supposed to be, what I was supposed to be doing and just lived.  I wasn't Elena: GPA of 3.5 unwieghted, 4.6 weighted, SAT score 1410, Co-president of SLA and Sunday school teacher.  Instead I was Elena: 17 year old girl at the beach.  Big difference.  No one cared whether or not I'm going to prom, whether or not I did my homework, what music I listened to.  The only future planning I did was in my imagination and the only writing was the exchange of contact info.  Because I was with people I didn't know super well I was able to release.  Did you know I could walk into the ocean fully dressed without thinking about it?  Did you know I could jump onto a moving porch swing?  I certainly didn't.  It was the most fun I've had in a long, long time.  I don't need a box anymore, I can build a new one.  But even as I write this I get closer to home and I feel my box coming back together.  Back to the mindset of school work and papers and deadline.  The clouds are going away, and with them goes the freedom and lightness that I felt.  One day they will return, giant and wispy, and maybe next time I will leave with them.
