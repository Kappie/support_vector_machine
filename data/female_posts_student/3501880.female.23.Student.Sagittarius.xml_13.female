I got home this evening, only to find that my cat had been locked outside on the porch. No, he's not an outside cat. No, not even supposed to be on the porch WITH supervision. But, lo, the beastmaster locked the porch door with poor little Snicklefritz out there and GOES TO SLEEP! Out of spite and revenge, when her stupid, goddamn, ugly-ass cat tried to sneak into my room to eat MY cat's food, I chased it out. It tried to fake me out and duck between my legs to get to the food, but I wasn't fooled..I hate the beastmaster and her pre-cryogenic freeze Mr. Bigglesworth! H-A-T-E, Find out what means to me! Sock it to her, Sock it to her, Sock it to her!  Deep, Cleansing breath....ahhhhhhh! Okay, on to more pleasant topics: the interview. I think it went well, and I really hope I get the job for the reasons explained in my previous post. The guy kept on telling me how I was the first person he wanted to interview. Then went on to tell me how he got about 25 resumes in a day from people with extensive and impressive resumes (apparently, mine was neither extensive nor impressive, I gathered), but he really like mine, cause "It actually seems like I might want to be a lawyer" (had to suppress laughter on THAT one) and he liked me because, "I actually seem like a normal person..." I don't know. I felt good about it, but then I remembered one job that I interviewed for a few years ago and I thought I had it in the bag. I didn't get the job, but I think the guy just wanted to bag me, cause he sent me a creepy email after he told me I didn't get the job saying, "If there is ANY WAY I can help, just let me know..." Yeah, there was one thing...You could have given me the DAMN job!  So, anyway...Keep everybody posted as I should know around Saturday if I got it or not! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I need the job!  One more quick note: Though I really don't care for basketball or most professional sports in general (with the exception of gymnastics and ice skating), I am secretly delighted that the Pistons beat LA in the NBA championship. My reason is that Karl Malone switched to the Lakers after spending his whole career with the Utah Jazz, just so he could have a chance at the Title before he retires (cause the dude is old, and practically plays with a cane!).  Well, Karl, you didn't get your ring, and now because you have deserted all your loyal fans back in Utah, you won't be getting any honorary street named after you like good, old John Stockton...Ah, the misfortunes of others.
