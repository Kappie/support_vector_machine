Now I'm going to have 4 interns--maybe 5 depending on if that last one decides to turn in her paperwork.  Then it's off to bigger and better things.  I'm telling Jason on Friday.  He's either gonna kill me or start crying.  The Garage Sale is going well: The dishes, entertainment center, and cappuccino maker are off the market.  I may auction the breadmaker, everyone seems to want it.  I didn't have time to go sell my clothes today.  That will have to wait since tomorrow is the Florida Association of Teen Courts meeting and we're hosting.  I'm gonna ask Mr. H if I can temp for him in the fall until I get a job up north.  I'm jubilantly terrified of my decision to finally get the hell out of Florida.  For the first time in my entire life, I've no idea what my plans are, where I'm going, how I'm going to live.  It's more exciting than anything I've done in a long time...you know, since I stopped smoking crack and all. :P  Time to eat and call Elyse anad make plans for my trip up north.   urlLink Buy my shit!!
