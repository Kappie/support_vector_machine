So after I talked to Gavin for like 2 minutes, I went around to the good colleges there and got some stuff and then left asap because I was so shaken up about seeing Gavin there. So I just got home and now I'm listeing to Pretty, Pretty by The Early November and talking to Jon.  Song: Early in the morning, wake up to a bright blue sky Lightning comes at any time to break it down and make it ugly I know that it's just for me  'Cause no one else can feel or understand That's alright because I can handle all that you throw down   CHORUS:  And I hope you find a perfect place Where skies are beautiful all of the time And it's all that matters, pretty, pretty And I know that's all you could care about There's no reason why you can't    It's all about the icing, and nobody cares about what's inside  You could see the outside face, it looks good, it must be great And I know that's all you see What would it matter anyway 'Cause I can see right through your pretty, pretty skin today   No reason why I should try to go on anymore   My reason's all gone, no reason why you should   Try to make excuses to make me feel alright   Excuses call for stupid reasons   And I know that it's not much that I can offer right now   Just give me one little second and I will try my hardest   To make you feel like I'm someone else  -Pretty, Pretty- The Early November
