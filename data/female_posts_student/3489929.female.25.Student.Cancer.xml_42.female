I'm tired of serializing my blogs. I can come up with a title every day. I think. And if not, I can cop out and just cut out titles altogether.    Jefe pisses me off. He is so far up Barbie's assright now, I fear he'll never see daylight again. He gave her a "special" parking space all her ownwith her name on it because she had a good month last month.One good month out of the fourteen she's beenemployed. Come on.  But what really pissed me off was his assertion that she had a better month than I did. I toldhim that was bullshit and he said he can't measure my performance because I do something different than everyone else. Ihandle only the return calls, not the first-time callers, and Igenerate70% of the accounts thatopen in the company per month. I keep track of these totals because he claims to be a "numbers" man. He ignores my numbers.  He and Posh have been sucking up to her all month. The bad thing is, I ammuch more consistent than she is, even though that's not saying much, and I have  never  gotten the public gratification they are heaping on her. Any reward I get has to be kept"quiet" so people don't getjealous. Well, they are certainly not being "quiet"in regards to Barbie's rewards.  Why am I so bitter?I got a raise last month.  But she got a bonus, and I didn't.   (Thanks for listening, Lisa... the rest of this rant justbecameunneccessary).   I really hate my job.   Thosepeople suck major ass.   Come get me,karma.
