He decided to call the four in and ask  them only one question. Their answer would determine which of them would get the job.The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table the interviewer asked, "What is the fastest thing you know of?"Acknowledging the first man on his right, the man replied, A THOUGHT. It just pops into your head. There's no warning that it's on the  way; it's just there. A thought is the fastest thing I know of." "That'svery good!" replied the interviewer.  "And now you sir?" he asked the second man. "Hmm....let me see. A blink! It comes and goes and you don't know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest thing I know of." "Excellent!" said the interviewer."The blink of an eye... that's a very popular cliche for speed."  He then turned to the third man who was contemplating his reply."Well,out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the house and on the wall there's a light switch. When you flip that switch, way out across the pasture the light in the barn comes on in less than an instant. Yep, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of." The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and thought he had found his man. "It's hard to beat the speed  of light" he said. Turning to the fourth and final man, the  interviewer posed the same question. The last man replied, "After hearing the three previous answers,  it's obvious to me that the fastest thing known is DIARRHEA." "WHAT!?"said the interviewer, stunned by the response. "Oh I can explain." said the fourth man. "You see the other day I wasn't feeling so good and I ran for the bathroom. But, before I could THINK, BLINK, or TURN ON THE  LIGHT, I had already shit my pants!" HE GOT THE JOB!!
