He kept getting himself stuck in all the little cubby holes in my desk, it was sooo funny! Awww! I want to have loads of little hampsters and let them live in my room and go exploring! Yay! Awww but Russell is the cutest hampster in the world! He's all friendly and adventurous and cuddley! And he's totally fearless to the point where it's stupid! Only that we erm... found out that  he  is actually a SHE!
