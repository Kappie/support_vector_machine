Personally, I don't like the squishiness of the thing, but since my dad made it, I decided I probably should try. Despite the texture of the mussel, the sauce my dad made tasted yummy. So it was more of eating mussels for the taste of the sauce. Meh. anyhow, I starting chewing on some hard stuff, which was a pain with my braces. Now, if you know anything about pearls, you would know that they are rather hard. So ouchy jaw. I never thought I could find tiny pearls in mussels, but I guess it makes sense since they are kinda like the oysters that made pearls. The way they eat is similar so the extra stuff oysters get to make pearls could be eaten by mussels.
