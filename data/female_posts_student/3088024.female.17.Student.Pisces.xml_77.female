I managed to be back for curfew.  For once...  I was worried 'cause I was cutting it close but I made it.  People at FACA are so wicked friendly.  You have no idea how many new people I met.  And the people I have met before all come up and talk to me.  I haven't been there since like January and they all recognize me.  The youth pastor thought I was from Texas.  I have no idea why...  Anyways...the reason I went wasn't there...so sad...  I wish things were different...my life is going to be an interesting one...i am definitely determined to make an impact...negatively or positively is something only time will tell.  i want to get married...tommorrow...i already have a wife picked out...and a house...and a job...
