Depressed, dejected Wanting to die Yet all I have the guts to do Is sit alone and cry  I can pick up the knife I can mark out the place As I start to dig Tears stream down my face  A cloudy fog of doubt Overwhelms my mind Incomplete and all alone My entire life goes blind  I’m pathetic I’m a wimp Can’t deal with the bloodstained thought Of my entire body going limp And crashing to the floor  So I sit here on my bed Trying to disappear Morbid thought fill my head All I wish is to be dead  To die would be bliss The pain sheer relief The sight of blood relaxing Yet for people I love just grief  I imagine the world through your eyes Finding me blood-covered on the floor I can feel your heart as it dries And sense your soul as it cries   But would you actually mourn for the loss Would you really cry for my pain Will you reminisce on the past we had Our endless wonders in the rain   I didn’t do it because of you It was a selfish deed I had to do it, had to get out My spirit had to be freed  But yet they are just wishes Of how it could be I wish I could not feel I yearn not to be me  The worse my feelings get The deeper I have to scratch I cannot let them heal They are all that is real  Scratching is as far as I go Because I stopped myself again Back to the beginning I always go Then round the endless circles again  One day I’ll be brave And my time on earth will end But I’ll keep my feelings hidden away Always until then  impressed?! can she feel anymore like me?!
