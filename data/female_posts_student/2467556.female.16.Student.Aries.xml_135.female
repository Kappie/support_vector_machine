Of course, Kubic made fun of me for most of the movie by saying Emma Watson (Hermione) is really hott as well.  Then after the movie, i announced that i was hungry and he was like "here let me buy you something!"  He runs ahead to the snack bar and i told my friend Allison (who was working that night) not to sell him anything!  Allison was confused.  I guess you had to kinda be there.  Then we went to Steak and Shake and joked around/talked.  Our server, who was a senior obviously, recognized Kubic as the older Kubic's (who is a senior) little brother.  When we left, i took a wrong turn and we almost ended up on the highway and i freaked out.  Kubic helped me get off the highway and everything was ok.  Then i took him home and he's like "hey here's my house! want a tour?!".  So i went in, met his parents, saw his ping pong table (thats pretty much the only room in his house that i saw) and then i called my dad and i had to go home.  Truly delightful night.  hmmm i dunno what i'm doing today....probably watching Miracle for the millionth time but with english subtitles like Brittany did so i can understand what everyone's saying in the movie.  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
