We've accomplished so much, but sacrificed so much, too!  I really need my college friends in my life.  I miss them incredibly.  My college friends were my rock, my sounding board, my encouragement.  It's sad that we're all so successful and yet, we all leave a piece of us at Kent State and a piece of our hearts with the other ones. -sigh- It's sad.  But what makes me thrilled is that all of my girls seem happy and successful.  Emily is the main (and only!) photographer for the newspaper in Port Clinton, Kris is enjoying her grad school life at Fordham in the city, Quesa is finishing up soon and has the coolest boy in the world, Jessie is going back to school for design (which will make her happier than what she was doing before!), Lauren is ending old chapters and beginning new ones in Germany (even though it may not be "for months and months"!), Alison is graduating in December and ready for the next step in her relationship (what are you waiting for, Daniel?), Teresa is a nurse at OSU, Petretti is a Spanish major and bursting with energy, Woods is engaged to Paul, Becca has two healthy babies, Alicia is getting into her real estate stuff, Julie Winn is still in marital bliss, Suzy changed her job to something she likes better...I'm just very happy for all my girls, happy that life is treating them well.  But I miss them.  I miss the big group of them and I miss each individual one of them.  I totally see why some people never want to leave...why leave when everyone you need is right there?  And here I was, thinking I was a cold, unfeeling person because I never felt homesick and I never felt the loyalty to any particular place.  Well, I think it's Kent.  I miss it, I miss the times, I know that I couldn't and wouldn't go back but I also know that Kent was good to me.  And it helped me be where I am today, and I owe it and everything that came with it a great deal.  -sigh-  Just feeling a little nostalgic today.  I'm still looking for the contentedness that I had at Kent.  I know I'll find it if I keep searching...I know different chapters in one's life brings different states of mind, and I'm waiting for the next chapter to bring one to lift me up again.  -sigh-
