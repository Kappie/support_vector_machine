And then after doing that, how about I just drink it. I love tea. But seriously who thinks of these things? Its just like the concept of milk. Either some pervert saw a cow and molested it, drinking whatever shot out, and found taht it was good; or someone clever saw that the baby cows drank the milk, and lived off of it, and thusly thought of using the milk to sustain themselves. I sincerely hope it was the latter.  I also ponder who thought homework was a clever idea. How about we make the kids come to school and do the work then send them home and make them do more of it. I understand the concept of reinforcement but can't we just reinforce it in class. And "practice makes perfect" but funny enough, no one is ever perfect at anything. And if they are near to perfect it means that they like doing it, which means that they weren't forced to learn whatever the heck it is they are near perfect at. Or let me say this, I've never met someone that good at something who was forced to do that thing.  But then again you can be 'a natural' at something. Which of course means you're really good at something and you never had to work to be really good at it. Like Finny from that book "A Seperate Peace". He was just really good at everything involving sports. He never had to work for it. I guess that was really the concept of the whole book. Finny thought that main character person didn't have to work for his good grades and ultimately (aha. recalled his name) Gene ended up hating Finny because he didn't realize that. See, Finny was just a natural at sports, so he figured that Gene was just a natural at his studies. So Finny didn't think Gene needed time to study, but Gene saw it as Finny trying to kill his grades. In the end its really what did Finny in.  Have you ever had two friends fighting, and each of them starts telling you about the fight? Person A says how annoying person B is. And person B is going on about how irritating person A is. And somehow you get caught in the middle of your two friends argument. But you can't take sides because you're hearing both sides of the story, and both of them are your really good friends, and you don't want to make either of them angry with you. Its really a very bad situation to be in. Oh see and then horrid things happen, people just shouldn't argue...the horror..poor dear..  I have this friend, and he feels really bad about himself, and I never knew. I understand now why he gets mad so easily when I poke fun at him...I feel very badly. I can't beleive I didn't notice and didn't care. How could I be so insensitive? Stupid..stupid me. God, I feel so bad....
