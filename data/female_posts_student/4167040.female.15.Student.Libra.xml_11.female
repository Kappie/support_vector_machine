I really don't know why either. I guess I just have a lot on my mind with starting school, tryouts, acupuncture, possibly getting my wisdom teeth out this up coming week, registration...and not one of those things I want to do. I wish I was able to just live a free and normal life...do what I want to do, but I guess everything happens for a reason. I'm waiting for Michael to call today...he said he would, so he should. Well...I guess I have nothing more to say...so I hope everyone that reads this has a great day.
