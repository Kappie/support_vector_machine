Now feels abit  sian  cos its ending soon as school starts but then again feeling a tad excited and nervous abt the whole new learning environment i'll be in for the next 5 months or so... Hmm... wat to expect now? Think i'm going to the lecture tmrw all clueless cos i seem to forgotten wat i've learnt already!! Ha! Hopefully everything, including e mind, will settle in as sch starts....      Called back home yesterday nite to chat with my mom and sis... called to say everything is fine and didnt seem to find anything i lack tat i want them to send over.... haha maybe i'm e type tat can just survive on e basic needs... hmm haha except maybe clothes.... have bought a few here ;p      Received the letter mom said she was sending to me.... dont know why... although i dont feel homesick but i'm actually kinda touched/sad when i read the letter... maybe i really do miss my family.... but esp my mom's cooking and e soup!!!      Got a really surprising piece of news from my fren today!!! Told me two frens who are together are getting hitched! Wow its really quite unbelieveable for me.... someone i actually know is getting married!!! Wow....tats really kinda exciting but too bad i didn't witness e proposal. But i feel really excited and happy for them :) Congrats!! Haiz... i wont be able to see them getting married cos i'll still be in Perth.... haiz...      Guess i keep missing e good stuff now tat i'm not in SG! Unfair!!! Heard there's this fireworks festival at Marina where contestants from ard the world put up fireworks display.... sob sob... so sad i cant get to see them! Fireworks are my fave..... haiz not to mention i'll miss e live fireworks display from my home on National Day.....      So... it's off to start a brand new chapter of my life tmrw.... 1st day of school in a real uni campus!
