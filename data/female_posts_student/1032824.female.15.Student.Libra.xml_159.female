When words are both true and kind, they can change our world."  Words, the even slight misunderstanding or the misinterpretation of them can make someone either happy or sad, can throw our mood in exuberant joy or in incredible despair.  Anyways, I'm in a rather good mood now, chatting with my lover Fiona (Oops sorry Geets!), Taufiq and Zu, currently typing out a proposal for something exciting for my sec 3 kids. *Smoochies*Everyone seems so stressed lately, even I myself feel the pressure already. I think it's awesome that the holidays are drawing nearer. Although we would still be attending lessons everyday, it would be less exhausting. I strongly believe that it is an incredibly deserving short break for all those who have been mugging productively during the past 2 months.   Til next time, keep loving. =)
