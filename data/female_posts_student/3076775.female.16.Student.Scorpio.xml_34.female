Me and Chelsea figured out that I was having a panic(or anxiety) attack. Yup, that's what it was. But now I can't catch my breath, and it's bothering me. I talked to Nick, and I'm now thoroughly convinced that my worries about him were for nothing. I love him so much, and I hope he knows that.  As for Chelsea, I'm happy for her being able to go to camp this summer. Even if it means that I don't get to see her for a while. I was just worrying over nothing. And I'm also glad that her and Barry have started going out.  Well, that was my first panic attack. I don't know if I want any more. lol, okay, well, I definitely don't want any more panic attacks. They're not very much fun. Well, I'm going to bed down now.  Love, Shannon "A.D.D.......the silent killer." --Shannon Brown
