Unfortunately, no guns or violence mentioned, and just a bit of prostitution.  Ok, so not too much, but it carried over from Kelly's class.  For the most part just boring.  Especially the second time because I'd already seen it once.  But I guess the first time I saw it for you, Josh.  And no damnation!  I wish I'd thought of that.  "I'd be honored to serve as your student body secretary.  Damn you!"  Eh, not quite.
