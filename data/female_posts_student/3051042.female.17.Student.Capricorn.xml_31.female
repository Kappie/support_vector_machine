Idiots w/ Pens is dead... I mean, DEAD. Like how Ms. Seigel is going to be when I bitch her out on Monday for not forcing the U of M students to come back.   The carpet cleaners come today, oh yay... Nick, Jeff, and some others are coming down to Ypsi to watch Kill Bill Vol 2 tonight (or tomorrow morning, depends on how you look at it). You know it's going to be canceled. No one is going to want to make the 45 minute drive to watch 1 1/2 hours of a movie. Maybe Nick... I would too. God, Kill Bill was awesome.   The piano turner is here. Turns her stereo to full blast. Oh yeah, eat Chemical Brothers you bitch!!!! Just kidding....
