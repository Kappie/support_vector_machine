ice cream! so i curled up in front of the big screen with my ice cream cone and watched "when harry met sally". i thought i might b able 2 at least hear some fireworks goin off somewhere even if i couldnt c them, but i didnt. at least not till midnight, but they were just illegal ones in the neighborhood. but i felt much better after the movie. that is until i talked 2 tony. or rather, until i heard about his trip. i was glad 2 talk 2 him again, but i dont think he felt the same. but thats a whole other story. so neway, i still have the house 2 myself. i have since friday, and i will till tuesday. it's been awesome. except 4 2day. i kinda wished they were here. but bsides all that, its been pretty sweet. except they barely left nethin 4 food. they did buy some stuff when they came home 2day b4 leaving 4 newyork. but they didnt get ne toilet paper! plus, im kinda gettin lonely. the only human contact i've had in the last 2 days is at work, and lets face it, thats not exactly positive interaction. even tho i am gettin 2 know the ppl there. most of them r pretty nice. 2day i bagged 4 pedro. he was just transferred from another safeway. he's really funny. he's the 1 who really got me 2 loosen up, cuz i've been so shy there since i started. but once i started talkin 2 him, i started talkin 2 most of the other employees. at least the cashiers. cuz the other courtesy clerks dont talk. except alfred. he's cool 2. he showed me around 2day, cuz my bosses sure didnt. jerome's cool 2. but he duznt like me bagging 4 him, cuz he feels like some1's tryin 2 tell him that he's not goin fast enuff. 2 tell u the truth, i dont c the point of baggers. its easier 4 the cashier 2 just stick the stuff in a bag than 2 reach around and hand it 2 some1 else 2 put in a bag. but o well, just a thought. but right now im gonna get goin cuz im exhausted. and i need 2 sort out some feelings i never thought i would b feeling about a person i never thought i'd b feeling this way about. does that make ne sense at all? prolly not. but im long past the point of making sense now. sleep...
