Billy Bob Thorton was there... haha... no joke. "of all the gin joints"... eh? god, why couldnt' it have been someone exciting...sigh.. the story of my life. he's actually short did you know that? got a new girl friend apparently... very apparently. i've seen more BB's tongue than famous ppl in my life. These girls ran into the gift shop and were like  OMG! OMG! Lets go talk to him!AHH! Dont bother him! YES! COME ON! ug...its not like he's that great ppl. he's so ugly.. that chin? sigh. whatever was angelina joli thinking? we all make mistakes though don't we.  i need to practice. and omg, english project... that phrase is beginning to sound common place. sigh. i dont have time to do a portrait!... je ne sais pas. my bro and dad will be gone golfing tomorrow, so maybe i can get some work done... my brother is an artist. maybe i can get some kinship intervention.   Now I know I can handle this I'll close my mouth and clench my fist I've lived this day in a thousand ways But there's a flaw to add to your list Go on and squeeze a little more 'Cause if you scream I'll just ignore you But I've rehearsed this scene in a million dreams You're getting closer to my core I'm so damn frustrated Losing breath and now I'm shaking Gotta keep myself from breaking down Someone get me out Tear don't you fall, eyes dont you cry Need to get me round this corner I can't break down, break down Pride don't cave in, head don't fall off While I'm open you can read me I can't break down,  Blocked it out for long enough Got really good at playing rough now I've been prepared and not really cared But being brave is getting tough Chin don't start to quiver Hands now don't you shiver Gotta keep myself from breaking down Someone get me out Someone let me out You smile like the cat who's got the cream I'm vulnerable and I know you see me There's so much I wanna say But this lump in my throat makes me walk away Tear do't you fall, eyes don't you cry Pride don't cave in, head don't let go Tear don't you fall, eyes dont you cry Need to get me round this corner I can't break down, break down Pride don't cave in, head don't fall off While I'm open you can read me I can't break down,   DMB:4 months, 23 days...sigh
