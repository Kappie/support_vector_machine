But I beat her 6-2 so it was happppy! But, during the game, I pulled a muscle in my leg and it hurts reallly reallly bad and i can  barley walk :( Sad times. It might be better by tomorrow.   By tomorrow, these pictures are supposed to be all printed and everything so we can put them on the poster board in english but our printer WONT WORK. Grrr. And its a group project too. Ahh!  Tomorrow we have a spanish test..yuckk!  :(
