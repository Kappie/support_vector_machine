I'm not sure if with your eyes you see, How distant I have seemed to be. But if you loved me,  I'm sure you'd know, This is all the further I want to go.  The clock is tick, tick, ticking away, And I don't feel like wasting anymore days, On a love I feel isn't going anywhere. The dream I have enjoyed has now changed into a nightmare.  And though my heart is aching, Ties with you I am intent on breaking. When you journey off into the sky, You won't be leaving just me behind.  Set me free before you go, Leave me to wander in the snow, You spread your wings and I'll spread mine, And we'll partthe waves to see what's to find.  The night sky will never be the same, And when I look at the winter clouds I'll feel a certain pain, That's there in my heart just for you, And wonder where we ever went to.  And even though I'll miss what we've become, I just can't keeping hanging on. The air below has become quite clear, And I can see the ground is getting too near. It's time to jump, It's time to fall, I just hope I'll survive it all. Goodbye for now, We'll make it through somehow. The stars are getting closer, I hope we find our answers. The clouds are thinning, My head is spinning. My heart is breaking, This is how it's going to end.  Things change every day, April slowly drifts into May. Like the clockwork death of the lonesome butterfly, June will tip toe into the doorway of July.  -Written @ 2:00 AM, July 19th, 2004. I call it..Time's Farewell to The Voyaging Soldier. You aren't going to be the focus of my blogs anymore, I'm going to bury you one way or another, and get you out of my head, because this is just how things were supposed to go. I smell like raspberries and sleep in the morning while you smell of smoke and you just can't touch me whenever and wherever you want to anymore. I can't be with you anymore because I can't give you what you want and you can't give me what I need. It's really that simple. If you ever read these, I hope you'll smile and see how much I really did love you but not harbor any bad feelings toward me. Because I know I don't have any for you. You were my first kiss and you're always going to be my first love but first loves aren't meant to be long. Let it stay special and let's say goodbye. Goodnight, We'll see how things go my next post.
