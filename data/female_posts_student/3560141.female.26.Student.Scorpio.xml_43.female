Positional Interpretation   Five of Wands, in this position, suggests the importance of the cliché "be prepared". There is a process that needs to be followed in order to become successful in whatever you chose to do in your life. "Winging" it, waiting for it, or hanging on the sidelines, can’t offer the same interaction, training, or practice needed to learn to work well, or socialize among your peers, with those of the same gender, or within your field of interest. It is important to get out there and do it, not just talk about it. Getting hung up on petty annoyances only serves to waste or scatter energy, and might tend to make you irrational. Victory comes from skill, direct experience, perseverance, focused energy or adrenalin, healthy rivalry, and readiness, not luck. Excess within control.   Five of Wands. Card Interpretation   The Five of Wands is Strife or Practice, and it can represent the unrest or a turning point that can lead to confrontation, which can result in either altercation or renewal. Specific examples of this can be seen in children whose play has become rough or hurtful, in shoppers at a major sale, in a couple whose roughness turns to passion, or in the mental work that drives you to conquer, overcome, or get carried away. By the same token, it can be seen in the control and efforts to imitate that can foster growth, learning, or maturity, such as the "play" seen in young chimps as they try to mimic their elders.  The Five of Wands asks that you recognize that everyone has issues, is different, and may need Grounding from time to time. The question is; do you want to get in the middle of the fray, or can you do something to bring organization, clarity, or harmony to the situation? This card also suggests that turning to outside council or advice could keep you from being caught off guard.
