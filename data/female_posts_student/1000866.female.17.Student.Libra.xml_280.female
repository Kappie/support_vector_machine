I give you my destiny I'm giving you all of me I want your symphony singing in all that I am  At the top of my lungs, I'm givin' it back  So I lay my head back down And I lift my arms and prey to be only yours, I prey to be only yours, I prey To be only yours I know now, you're my only hope...  I know this is odd, but this song just started playing. I guess it was on my playlist. I didn't mean for it to be, because usually when I hear it, I start crying. It's not that I really like Mandy Moore. In fact I don't like much of her music, but It's the first song that...I don't know, it really impacted me after my grandma died. It's the first song that made me cry over her. Like, I didn't understand why I wasn't crying. I was upset, just not crying, and when I heard this song I just burst into tears. The song's not even really about that. The song would be about me dieing. But, I just listened to this song so many times after I first heard it, and truly admitted to myself that she was gone. It makes me wish I could just give her ONE last hug. Just one....and talk to her one last time, and have Christmas Eve with her just one last time, and see her happy and carefree just......one last time.
