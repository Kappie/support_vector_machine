Friends drifting away, guys, ex-friends being fucking retarded, my dad being an asshole that favours my little brother, people looking down on me like they're better than me because I'm different from them. I'm fucking sick of it. And I'm also sick of trying to resolve everything and make it ok. So I'm just going to give up, quit trying to fix it all. I'm going to give up, sit back and watch my life and relationships get ripped to fucking pieces right in front of me because no one ever gave a shit. I've tried before, but people either don't listen, don't care, or don't give me the time of fucking day to talk to them, so FUCK IT. There's no way things are ever going to change now. It's not like these situations are new to me. This has been going on for years. This is why I stopped being a prep. This is why I'm the way I am now, a fucked up chick who does stupid shit and skips school. This will be the death of me. I am thankful for the select few who don't judge me or look down on me constantly, because without them, I wouldn't be here right now. Around them it's like I'm a whole different person. But when they're gone, it all fucking goes to hell and I become the person I regularly am. So, thanks.
