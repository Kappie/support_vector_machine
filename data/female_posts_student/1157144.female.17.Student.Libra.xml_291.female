I understand that you are upset and you have every right to be upset, but I think you are using that as an excuse to blow us all off and i don't think it is fair. We've all been mad at each other so just get over it and move on.  - I might regret this post later, but right now I'm slightly perturbed and in true Billy fashion i wanted to get this off of my chest
