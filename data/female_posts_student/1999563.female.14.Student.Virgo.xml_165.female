Ugly formless its color is gray, nothing of care, nothing of beauty. Clipping, kneading, rolling with skill, stretching, forming, and pinching a shape. The Master is molding it to His will, the clay has nothing to say about it. Delicate features immerging now, taking shape before His eyes. Color and details starting to show, back into the fire for another round. When He looks at what He has done, admires the colors and glaze. In some ways He and the pot are one, it is a reflection of Him who made it. Empty and formless without direction, in a lot of ways that clay is me. Through the Lord was a resurrection, molded and formed in the Master’s hand.
