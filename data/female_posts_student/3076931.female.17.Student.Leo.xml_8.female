It was all the little things that made me happy today. It all began with a wonderful Wednesday morning when i get to sleep an hour extra..rock on, i love my sleep. English went well, it was a fun class. Then in ap bio, spencer gave me a pack of big bunny chalk! Which totally rocked my face off! That was so sweet of him to do! THe little things are what counts! and that was awesome! thanks spencer! you are the coolest! SOooo of course during yearbook i went outside and chalked up the school's sidewalks...hope i don't get in trouble for that, oops.   ANd it's not just today that made me happy. Last night during work, megan handed me the cutest little note ever that made me feel all warm and happy inside ( and maybe misty hahahahha). It made me so happy. I love the little things people do. And i know that i need to do little things for other people too. I don't need to get absorbed in my own little world like most teenagers do. I'm going to make it my goal to do random acts of kindness everyday. Oo and compliment people also. And when i say compliment i mean compliments that actually do mean something, not just a compliment that someone says just so they have something to say to you. Because what if someone is having a crappy day. So many times i've been having a crappy day and then someone will do a little something and it will just make my day and makes me happy. SO i must return that favor. It's all about the karma. RIght? i hope i used that right. The little things really do matter. I think i began to realize this when i had surgery and was on crutches. The little things that people did helped me SOOO much. I cannot thank you all enough. All the people who would stop by and visit me. It made me realize who all actually cared and who all didn't. And it wasn't just the people that would stop by and visit me. There were also the random people who i had never talked to in my life before that would help me out at school, like opening a door. Opening a door sounds like such a small thing, but when you're on crutches and you're carrying a 40 lb backpack, it is the nicest thing a stranger can do. It's all about the little things, people! I'm so glad i'm a happy person. If i wasn't a happy person...i would be mad. Haha i hope that makes sense. It makes sense to me, but i'm weird..  I was also happy because i finished my ap bio packet before 8! it was such a relief!! we were in the library for 3 hours! haha. O and i also found my purse! yay!   so.. the lesson here kids is : do little things. Make someone's day. Bah i'm so cheesy. it's okay i like being cheesy. ooo which reminds me, i had the best peanut butter today. I had like too spoonfuls of peanut butter and i NEVER do that. I don't even like peanuts.   ..i wonder how many times i said "the little things" in here...
