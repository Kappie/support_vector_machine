Well, a few moments ago, I was fabulous, because I found out that I have another job proofreading a law review article for a lawyer (well, I have a three-hour trial period, so provided I don't fuck it up, the job is mine). Again, really good thing to put on my resume.   Then, I just checked my summer grades, and I got an "A" in Legal Process! Hot Damn! From what I hear though, everyone gets an "A", and the grade I am REALLY worried about is my Evidence grade, which I am hoping I don't fail simply because I don't want to have to re-take the course!   Also, this morning when I got to work, I had piles of work on my desk from my boss. I was quite impressed with how I drafted a promissory note in about 30 mins., including my requisite "staring into space" time. I felt like a pro...But don't be fooled, folks. Drafting most legal documents is, like, what my sister refers to as "MadLibs for Lawyers". You have a form that you usually copy key language from, tinker with it a bit, fill in the blanks, and voila! Customized Legal Document that you can charge lots of money for! Sometimes, I really, really DO love this profession.
