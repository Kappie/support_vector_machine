I wish I could say the same, that not being able to live with out internet is kinda stupid [which it is] but internet is my only connection to the outside world, aside from my cellphone. Well, at least I think so.. After all, the only way I get to 'talk' to my friends when not at school is through chat, which technically isn't even talk. Thinking about it makes me feel lonely... Yeah, I'm lonely..  Gawd. How can one enjoy solitude but feel lonely at the same time?  I feel like my stupid internet connecetion; stupid, and always disconnected.
