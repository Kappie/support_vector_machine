So, I wake up Wednesday morning and go downstairs to find presents and cards all over the kitchen table. (I won't go into detail with the presents, but I got a LOT of DVDs and a LOT of money. Kinda.) $160 from my dad, $210 from my mom, and $30 from my godmother. All going towards my guitar. I'm hoping to get a Schecter. I still need more for that, though. So, I clothe myself and leave the house.  I get on the bus, and Cassie hands me a large-buttocksed bag (like my attempts at cutting down the swearing?), with two cards from her, one from her mom, and two funny as hell shirts. I love that girl.  I get to school, and we have an AM collaboration day. For you non-Hamtown-High-School-go-ers, they just means we have an hour of free time in the morning. The students do, anyway. So I'm sitting with my friends, and Shaina comes to school. She knows how badly I want a guitar, and she promised me she'd get me one. She kept her promise. She hands me a little box with the card written on the outside in glitter-pen, and inside is a little guitar case. I open it up, and, lo and behold, I have my very own 10 inch Fender Strat. It even has its own little stand you can put together. I love that girl as well.  Then, Vanessa went around the school with David putting posters up that had a picture of me two years ago, and said "If you see Maddie Lauve, wish her a happy sweet 16!" and so on...I love them as well. I love them too.  THEN, Kristen went around putting stickers on people that said "HAPPY B-DAY MADDIE!" on random people.  I just love my friends. ALL of them.  It was kinda funny, cause people I didn't even know would wish me a happy birthday in the halls.  Crazy.  Anyway, after school I had Fiddler rehersal, and then i ate with my family. THEN we went to the grocery store and i picked out everything i wanted for my cake, and got more sugary food to eat that night.  I also spent the entire day wishing people happy birthday after they did so to me. Cause when it's Maddie's birthday, it's everyone's birthday. It only confused about 98.12% of them.  Everyday should be my birthday.
