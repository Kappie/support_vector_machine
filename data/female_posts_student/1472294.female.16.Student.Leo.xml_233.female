The Coach  The coach  itself  was spacious and cold. The unfortunate part was that it was not the Horse Brand or the one that Moses Lim was advertising... Conclusion: Ok lah   The Driver and Tour Guide  Both of them are Malaysians and speak Hokkien. Which is so fustrating as I myself is weak in Hokkien and majority of the trip they are talking in Hokkien. Man, sometimes I hate the Tour Guide, sometimes not. He is so..... And the driver love to release Karaoke VCDs which features Bikini girls wlking around as if they are the most beautiful people on Earth... Conclusion: Sastifying   The Tour Group  They are a strong group of 24, with many kinds of people form all walks of life. Now let me slowly name them and in detail...   Mr Know- It- All And His Family  Basically, they are weird. The head, Mr Know- It- All was always talking loudly about how he know so much about Malaysia. Grrr. And even the Tour Guide sometimes ignored him. His family has a daughter and girlfriend as all of us were concluding, no, I mean, gosipping.   The Father And Son   Yup. The son is deaf, maybe partly- deaf. Boy, they eat a lot and the boy is trying to see that he is very studious. Reading newspaper early in the morning and writing in his journal  and  bringing a book to read. Grrr... He is trying to show us that he is damn clever and boy, I hate him. I am not jealous or what. Ok, maybe I am....   The Mother And Daughter  This is the older version of the one above. The daughter is obviously not on my good books. She complained and complained and took so long at the St Paul's Church just to take photos... Small eyes fussy girl!   The Hongkes  Sorry, a little rude but that is their common name, right? They consist of two daughters and their mother. Speaking Cantonese throughout the journey, I began to suspect if my mother should also come on the trip to tell them off that Singaporeans CAN talk Canto too!   The Big Family  The loudest and most talkative one at the back of the bus. Three daughters and their parents. Boy, the daughters are really B******. Sorry, but I am in the badest mood when I talk about my group. Yakking throughout the journey in chinese. Even my godmother commented that they must be from China... Haha...   The Indian Family  Actually only the mother is an Indian. Her husband is a chinese, so her three children are Malay- looking. The four of them, abscene of Father eveytime would always treat us some tidbits. But I always reject them. Coz I HATE her youngest son. Good- looking he may be, but boy, he was so hyper- active and talkative. He may be apple in everybody's eyes, but certainly not in mine. Oh, did I tell you that they can speak chinese, that is what make everybody   love  them...   The Photographers  Actually wanted them to be named Husband and Wife. But they are practically taking photos everywhere. And I really mean, EVERYWHERE. Even the most ugly places. Not the toilets. But I envy them, not the persons. It is the camera. It is so nice and sleek. Not the thin kind but that kind which has 3X megapixels, I think. And the zooming part is so whoa! I really want it. Could have steal it, IF it is not against the law and they are always wearing it around their necks...  Now you are wondering now they are only 21, where are the remaining 3? Yup, that's me and my 2 godmothers. I will not relate my 5 day trip right now. Maybe even forever. I want to keep it personal. If not, what if somebody from the Tour Group reads it? I will be dead. At least they can suspect but will never be certain. And if I continued onwards, I will be sprouting all the vulgarities right now... Yeah, I really don't like the Tour.
