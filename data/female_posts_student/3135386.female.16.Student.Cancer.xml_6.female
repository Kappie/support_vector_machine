( prioritizing was never my strong point)  Just a list to remind myself though  * Going to a school Rave in the next town * Going shopping with my friends * Going to Regina on the band trip. * And of course, updates on my exchange.  Let's just say, it's been a very interesting couple of weeks. *eyeroll* Understatement of the year. I've had such a blast. Well, appart for the whole vaccination drug side effect thing. *shudders*  Anyway, going to bed now, I might work on my fanfiction a little more, and check the Rotary message board one last time.  Tchau!
