She (okay, since she is the only one that reads this, this is a dead give-away) posted about Love, and how stupid and pathetic it is, and how it's not really anything in particular.  She says that Love is just something that hardly ever appears, and/or that it's the delusion of a sick and twisted mind. Am I painfully optimistic and naive, or is she cynical?  I can't decide.  It's like Don Quixote and his servant... the idealist and the realist.  But I WILL NOT BE SWAYED from my ideas on Love, as stupid as they may be. "Love is like oxygen, love lifts you up to where you belong, all you need is love!" -Ewan McGregor, Moulin Rouge. Yeah, that's kind of how I see it.  Don't get me wrong, I believe that Love is one of the most completely terrible weapons out there.  I mean, really....  Ever notice how "hate" is not the opposite of "love"?  The opposite of love is APATHY.  Aaaannnnd you can't really hate someone unless you loved them once, or that person endangered someone or something you loved.  Soooo technically aren't love and hate two extremes of just feeling in general?  Anyways, the Phantom of the Opera really screwed me over as far as love goes. That stupid book really showed me what people are trying to convey when they say love.  It really explained the sheer magnitude of the concept....  The word LOVE encompasses rage, jealousy, joy, passion.....  All that fun stuff.  That's I guess why even thinking about love freaks me out.  I think (and I agree with allison on this point) that most people never even come close to what love truly is.  Most people experience some distant echo of that... whatever love is.  But some people get there, and I think it's good to keep trying.  But I'm going to save that goddamn word for when I really mean it, and so far I think I've said it (aside from little kiddie "I love you, mommy!"s) a grand total of three times.  Maybe.  Well, enough philosophical babble. TO... something else, now!
