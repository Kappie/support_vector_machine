And I actually did have fun. I usually get all irritated by stupid men and it ruins everything, but things worked out pretty well. We all kept a good lookout for each other and ran off the stupid men. The band was quite good.  Saturday Erin and I went to Long Beach for a Kings Kamp meeting. That night I worked on church stuff and read. Sunday I did the usual and then went to Golf N Stuff with the teens and some of their friends. I finished Taliesin Sunday night and literally bawled. It was an incredible book. It is so very well written.   Then Monday was more work and I donated blood. Didn't get so sick this time. My bro came and picked up the old table and chairs to clear out our dining room, which was really great! I stayed up late Monday working on a new website. It's now quite large. I fear I've put too many pictures on it. If you wanna visit it, go here: home.earthlink.net/~kdhiggins  This morning I got up and took a step class. I nearly passed out. I guess I wasn't ready to be so active after giving blood. Oops. :-) I scared a few people. I've felt pretty sick the rest of the day as a result. Tomorrow I should be fine. I've been able to work on various projects nonetheless.  I started the second book in the Pendragon series yesterday: Merlin. I'll probably read more of that tonight as I lie in bed.
