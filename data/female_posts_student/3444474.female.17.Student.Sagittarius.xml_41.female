Making a bagillion and a half fucking copies...      and I didn't realize that I needed to use three hole punched paper...but atleast I caught that after the third article I was copying...of course each freakin' article is like 30 pages long...*sigh* I need to find a three hole puncher.   In other news, Cameron comes home in 6 days, yay!!!  aaaaaaand I'm tired. But thats nothing new. I went to bed at like 10:30 last night, I was so exhausted. But I felt so much better this morning. Although I woke up, and I had duck lips for some reason. My upper lip was kinda swollen, it was wierd. //shrugs  Meh, it still hasn't really gone away, but whatever. Maybe I'll end up with Angelina Joile lips, that would be sweeeeeeet, lol.   My boobs will never be that big though, and I'll never be that tall...but hey, whatever, lol.   Time to go make more copies *sighs again*  More when I get home if I'm not tired like I was yesterday.
