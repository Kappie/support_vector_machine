I poured my heart and soul into creating the Maquinna Idols tape and Graduation Slide Show for them, and now I would like to do something absurdly nice for them.  So, after much deliberation, I have decided that I will buy enough tapes to ensure that they each get a copy of the footage from their graduation ceremony, which was also filmed by me.  So far, Christine is the only Grade 7 who knows about my little donation, so it'll be a surprise for everyone else.  I like doing good to good people.  It's worth it.
