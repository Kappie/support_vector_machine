Got an email from him too a while ago while I was checking my email. It's rare of him to send emails but yeah. Glad he did. He went home early cos he was tired and had to work on the speech too. *sighzZ* Grad coming up this coming Monday. So quickly... Too quickly.  We might be meeting up on Saturday again. Iunno... I hope my mom lets me. Bad news. My sister's friend saw us "doing something" at the back hill so yeah... I said "no I wasn't" to my sister and if my mom asks, I'll say we were "nuzzling noses" like we usually do. Haha... anyway, I gotta run. Blog later if I can.
