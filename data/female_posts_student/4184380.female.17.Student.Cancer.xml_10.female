So I got home last night from work, and got ready to leave for shopping with mi madre. I had a pair of pants that I had to return to Victoria's Secret but they wont take them back at the stores that are in the mall so the 'kind lady at the counter' told me that I will have to pay (more spendage!! yay!!) to ship them back. I thought about telling her where SHE could ship have them shipped to, but only because I've already paid close to $60.00 for these damn pants.       .So then we left. I went into American Eagle and saw all of the amazingly cute sweatshirts... but I was reminded of Marie's words about how sweatshirts dont look flattering on anyone so I didnt buy one... but not because I didnt think that I wouldnt look flattering in it. I buy sweatshirts cause they're more comfortable than anything else. :D But I already have a few... and... they were $50.00.       So then we go through the Bon in search of a bathroom for my mom when I found a clearance rack. YAY for clearance racks!!! I didnt find anything that I really wanted but it was still worth a look. So then we left.       We end up at Old Navy and I went crazy. I got... three shirts, a jean skirt, and a pair of pants. Hey I know girls out there are going "thats not even CLOSE to how I go crazy in a store" but see... I hate shopping to begin with. AND I NEVER buy skirts. Ever. And I hate shopping for pants... well I just hate shopping in general. So in all I got all those plus a courderoy coat at Costco and I spent under $100. :D Not quite as good as thrift shopping, but still I got a LOT of stuff for under a hundred. :D      Now I get to do the fun shopping. hehe.. shoe shopping!! I dont know how well a jean skirt and tshirt would go with bright pink conversish shoes... but I'll check it out. haha.    Today I get off from work an hour early... they have a dentist appointment, and then I'm going to the thrift store, the gas station, the bank, and the photo shop-- Knox. Spending more money!! yay!! BLEH. At least I get paid at the beginning of next week. Im going to do something with Cassidy tomorrow-- we still dont know what, and then on Friday my six months are up!! yay!!! Sorry I probably wrote about that yesterday and perhaps the day before, but it's exciting. To me. And to Andy probably- since it means we can take longer drives. :D      So- music. I know that some of you out there are really into music. DUH. If you're not then you're an insane (possibly republican) person. Ok so here's some good music to download. If you do not have the means to download then contact me through msn and I'll send it your way. Ok here's a list:       --  The Killers -- On Top, Smile Like You Mean It, Mr. Brightside, Andy You're a Star (maybe I just like this one because of the title--- I dont know if I'd like it so much if it was "Fred You're A Star" or something like that. Anyways-- moving on) a few others of which I cannot currently remember.    --  Elefant -- Good band- no idea where they are from or any info at all but I like them. They played at the Neubus too but I missed it. Ok: Makeup, Tonight We'll Dance, and Misfit. Misfit is my favorite but Makeup is rather good also.    --  Polyphonic Spree -- I havent listened to these guys to know too many of their songs, but I like "Light and Day" and someone told me that its on the soundtrack for "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" but I cannot verify that as I have yet to see the movie.    --  Modest Mouse, Postal Service  Death Cab For Cutie -- They are all in the same genre according to Rollingstone.com, but Postal Service and Death Cab for Cutie actually both have the same singer. Interesting eh? Anywho-- They're all really really good bands and so any song of theirs you download is going to be good. For Modest Mouse I would recommend: Float On, Ocean Breathes Salty, and well.. I would just recommend every single song on "Good News For People Who Love Bad News" and "Baron von Bullshit Rides Again". The latter is one that you can only BUY off of modestmousebootlegs.com but it is a VERY good cd. I love it.    .Ok thats it for now about music.    George W. Bush is gracing us with his presence in Medina. For those of you who do not know what Medina is, or WHERE it is, all I should have to say is this: Bill Gates Lives There. You may think 'Medina is hell then?' but what you SHOULD gather from that piece of info is that it is in Seattle. The portion of Seattle that all the rich foggies live. This is a community that refused to pay taxes for the local libraries or police force- because they have their own. HMMM. I think this is funny though because see... Melinda Gates wanted to sign up her two children for library cards at the Bellevue Library (I have spoken to the librarian she spoke with also which I think is hilarious) but they REFUSED to give her library cards, because Medina residents do not pay taxes towards King County Library System. So she was refused. There is a sign on the wall listing the "Gates Foundation- Bill and Melinda Gates" as a major donator to the Bellevue Library. But they still didnt get their cards. Because their community doesnt pay taxes.       These people are damn rich and they wouldnt let their taxes go towards the libraries. Payback's a bitch aint it Melinda??       Anywho-- sorry for this being so long to all of you out there. Ok so George W. Bush is gracing us with this presence in Medina. Im taking my eggs. Jamie and Andy have heard of this story--- ahem "plan"-- of mine. I'm going to take raw eggs to a George W. Bush speech, and just chuck it at him in the middle of it. I figure, I've only got a few more months in which to do it because I'm not 18 yet so... the law may treat me nicer if I get caught.... my parents support this also by the way. I think my mom thinks that I'm joking but now that he's in Medina--- how could I pass up the opportunity!?!?    There's a new name up there---  -Jaime--  my friend who shares my name, who I chat with about sex, books movies and music. We kind of just hang out whenever. He's in Whistler right now too. I know that Jamie deserves a much better paragraph than this about his character- but I have confidence that his character will come through in my stories about our adventures. Jamie-- when you get back we're doing the vodka/seagull thing ok? No but's.    So I guess that has brought me to the end of my rant for this morning. So far only have of my charge has awoken. He wants to go work on 'his road' by the 'woods' aka play boat. Talk to you all later!!    Favorite quote from yesterday: [Andy] Thats what I love about you.    [Jaime] That I'm a smartass?    [Andy] It's 109173841098237% better than being a dumbass.      Yay for Andy and Jaime conversations. LoL. Bleh I need to seeeeee Andy.  :( I didnt even get to talk to him last night... damn. Anyways--- kid got out skateboard. Must be off.
