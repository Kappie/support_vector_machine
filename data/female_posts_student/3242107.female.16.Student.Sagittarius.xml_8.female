O MY COW!  how messed up is that?!?!!? my dad knows how messed up i was after mandi got in that wreck. i was so scared that she could have died, or that christa could have since she wasnt even wearing her seatbelt. and then he goes and says that about my oldest friend!!! but what really makes me mad is that mandis older sis, erin, totaled her firebird when she was 16, and since then my dad was like ," you cant look back at erins mistakes and assume that mandi will be the same, just because theyre sisters" ok so he's like a hypocrite now, and hes telling me that im going to end up in a wreck totaling my car like mandi. and we're not even RELATED! well, practically we could be but we're not! ugh maybe its not spring and houston, or texas all together i hate so much.... maybe its just the way my dad treats me. a while back i was talking to clint and i was crying about how much i hated my dad. i told clint my dad treated me like crap , and he got really  mad because he thought he had hit me or something. but i told him about everything that my dads done to be an ass since i was like 12, and thats when i realized that my dad and clint's dad arent that different in ways.
