To download, go to  urlLink solid07 , so I won't be hot-linking again.:  urlLink go here .  And the official tracklist is supposed to be (I've removed the translations that I don't agree with, and slightly changed them.): 01 我的地盤 (Wo De Di Pan / My Territory) 02 七里香 (Qi Li Xiang / Orange Jasmine) 03 藉口 (Jie Kou / Excuse) 04 外婆 (Wai Po / Grandmother) 05 將軍 (Jiang Jun / The General) 06 擱淺 (Ge Qian / Stranded) 07 亂舞春秋 (Luan Wu Chun Qiu) 08 困獸之鬥 (Kun Shou Zhi Dou / Duel of the Trapped Beasts) 09 園遊會 (Yuan You Hui / Garden Tour Fete) 10 止戰之殤 (Zhi Zhan Zhi Shang / The Youth That Ends War)  My computer's fixed, and it's much better, I must say.
