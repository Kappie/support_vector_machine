So I thought I would alert ya'll of my major problem. I haven't gotten ANY e-mail for a LONG time. Not even junk mail! Usually Sephora or delias send me a letter a  day, but not anymore!  For a while I thought there was a problem with my account but I sent myself a letter and i got it so there obviously isn't.   BE A PAL!  Send ME an e-mail at shinymonkey56@hotmail.com  Rock on.
