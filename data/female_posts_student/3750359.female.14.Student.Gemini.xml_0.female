Indeedy anyhoo...today...what fun it was *rolls eyes!* Got up this mornin..a tad ratty..me thinks i went to bed too late!! So was very quiet on the way to school...stacey and paula were chatting away..while i was quiet..the only think i did talk about was the footie match last night, so after that i perked up!  P.E oh what a joy that was! *rolls eyes once again* Long jump OoOoO YAY!! *sarcastically* What fun that was standing outside waiting to jump while freezing your tits off..yeah the perfect way to spend friday mornin!! So i just stood there chatting to my mates..didnt bother jumping...wasnt in that kind of mood!  English.....one word.....SHIT! As per usual! Hennebry is such a doss and was soooo bored (well it usually it anyway!!)
