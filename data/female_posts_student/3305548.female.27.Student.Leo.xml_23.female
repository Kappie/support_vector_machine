Its most interesting to see what the rest of the world thinks (arg people blonde and busty does NOT always mean a 10 is required...ick) and how long ago the person checked their tally - a true contemporary exercise in vanity. "Did I get my 10 yet?" And then there is the reverse as well, "Lets see how low this picture will get." Also I sense some of the pictures posted are to exact retribution and revenge...exes in a non photogenic moment, algebra teachers that gave you a C, your boss, your bosses daughter...etc. Then I also kind of feel bad sometimes giving low/honest scores. I think, "oh their fragile ego." And then I remind myself THEY put that picture up there most likely, and that they are inviting my opinion.   As the faces to rate go by, I would start seeing people who remind me of people I know....and I give them biased higher or lower marks depending on how much I liked the people they remind me of in the first place. Bad me! The military pics get an automatic low from me. The uniform thing just doesnt do a thing for me - and a gun in the pic is like an automatic -10. Armpit hair visible regardless of gender will also scare me deeply. Any underwear shots (ack) will also make me skip the pics.... I think I am harsher on "typical" beauties, and "standard" handsomes...I have a thing for geeks after all...Take one look at my hubby and you will know its true. Ah yes, I know some of you havent yet even seen a picture of him. I will rectify this when a) i get a digital camera and b) we moved to morgantown. my husband is direly afraid that this blog will get discovered by someone who knows someone who knows someone he works with and it will spill the beans about our move and somehow end up fired or something. soooooooooo i will keep his anonymity (also explaining my anonymity as well...psuedonyms and what not...) for now at least we shall remain nameless and faceless. There are no pics of me - actually none taken within two years are in existence...plus, as of yet for I would rather send in a picture taken 8 -10 months from now. I am in my hamster wheel of weight loss.  I am also harsher on the girls than the guys...and by far harder on people who have a stupefied facial expression or are wielding a bottle. Beer featuring pictures doth not a hottie make.  There is that little somewhat vain voice in my head that wants to submit an old picture of me to hotornot.com....but then i think "oh but that will just be more affirmation that I once was hot and now am not"...i dont need that kind of reinforcement. Besides...what if I get rated a 4 or 3 or something...oh my fragile ego! Ha! Ironies will never cease.   There are some pretty skanky shots out there at hotornot.com...and shameless photos with kittens, puppies, babies, cleavage, posh cars, etc. in order to score higher points. And it makes me wonder does that cat really care if its "hot"? I would ask my resident expert but he's snoozing on the futon flicking his tail occassionally in his kitty dreams. I wake the kitty only if i feel like living dangerously.  Then there are the people you dont want to vote as hot but must...the "dude" with the IRA tatoo and holding a baby. We have shameless babyness, shameless bad boyness, and also blonde highlighted spikey hair, and potential armpit hair peekage...way overdone style. But in spite of all this he is still hot somehow. Then there is a girl who is in a prom shot that is in the black and white posh (not fashion) style...very posed, very primped, and reletively vacant looking...but even so she is undeniably hot. Not being blonde worked in her favor in this case. And what about the people who have obviously take their pic for the hotornot.com. If its quite clear that this is not some preexisting photo - thumbs down from me. And then once in a while you will come across a webcam shot so sincere and unposed...and authentic...not smiling...just viewing cyberspace as it were...and wondering "will this make me look hot?" Once in a great many photos I found some of this category.   I also had my first day of day camp training today. Some familiar faces, and many new faces too. Alot more counselors in general than last year. Some people I was glad to see, and one or two that I thought to myself, "did he/she HAVE to come back?" I know, I am a rotten person. And yes, I am still holding a spongebobsquarepants grudge over one counselor from last summer...who just generally annoys me to death no matter what anyways...  People were like, "Oh we didnt recognize you with your hair cut!" And I was sitting there thinking, "Yeah right admit it you didnt recognize me because of the extra 20-40 lbs." They werent fooling me. I know I look different. I know I say the same thing to people when they have gained weight. Ah well. Its a world of somewhat painful, somewhat dishonest, and relatively transparent politeness. Which brings this blog full circle to hotornot.com.  There are some pictures of folks that either a) are getting sympathy votes, b) are voting for themselves for hours on end, or c) have to be a joke or something. I mean I am not exclusively talking about the appearance of the person...there is also the quality of the picture to consider...the distance of the photo...and whether or not the friend the person may have posed with is hotter than they are. Hello, if you are 20 feet from the camera, blurred, and in 35 dpi or something how in the hell am I supposed to rate anything other than a 1? *tries to shake a couple pictures in particular from my brain* Hot or Not? Why would anyone care what a worldfull of perfect strangers thinks? Then again, I am sure that if I click through the photos long enough I will see someone I know.  here's to post political correctness era manners...  all the news in fits of print -  mack  ps. www.sluggy.com !!!! you will have some catch-up reading to do but there is a new viewers guide for all of the new sluggite converters. not that its a cult or anything. but any comic with demoic kittens called "the evil" is worth browse.    pps mystery rummy update: i kicked ass this evening. hehehe my revenge is exacted a little for totally getting skunked last night. whee!
