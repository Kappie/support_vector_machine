I found out that it isn't Spanish architecture, but "Northern Italian Renaissance." Haha. We met some people from Florida and Colorado who asked us if we ate at Lambert's!! Lol I don't understand why people are so infatuated with that retaurant! :-P  Then after that we went to the LSU Student Union and got tee shirts and stuff like that. Then we went to some nice store because my dad wanted to get some more polo shirts. And in the women's section they had SHOES GALORE! I'm talking tttooonnnnsss of Prada and Manolo Blahnik! Of course that isn't in my budget haha. Then we went back to the hotel and got cleaned up because we were going out to eat with some friends of dad's at the trendy sushi place! So we drove to their house at Lafayette... and WHOA!! I thought the people that we're eating with on Saturday have a nice house, but these people way outdo them. They had these secret passages in the bookcases and a  safe room  and a wine cellar and the house was brand new and really modern with these gorgeous verandas looking out over the river. It was soooo awesome. It was at least 20,000 square feet, no joke. The people who lived in it were friends of dad's. The wife, Martha, was a very good friend of his back in college. And she invited a friend of hers and her daughter to come to dinner with us, and they were very nice. The daughter is on a full scholarship from Wallstreet going to NYU!!! She's obviously very smart. And she was in all black and so hip haha, definitely very New York.  The restaurant, Tsunami, OOOOOMMMMGGG!!! This place was something right off of  Sex and the City!  It was really loud with all this techno music haha, and it was all dimly lit with tons of people packed in there. And it had this balcony lit with all these white Christmas lights. We sat in this booth thing where part of it was a booth and then chairs were on the other side and the booth part was really comfy and high-backed.  So first we get our drinks and stuff, and then we ordered sushi as an appetizer. I got some Sunset Rolls which were absolutley delicious! And they don't give you metal utensils. They give you chopsticks! So after Martha (who was just so sweet and hip) showed me how to use them I was a pro by the end of the evening! Hehe. Then after we had sushi they brought out salads and soups because I guess they're just supposed to. Even the salad looked cool. The soup was okay because I really don't like soup so I didn't eat it. But the salad was nice. Then they brought our entrees. I had shrimp teriyaki, and let me tell you, it was DIVINE! Ahhh.  And then Martha's husband, Pat, kept ordering bottles of wine lol, and one of our waiters thought I was 21 so he asked me if I wanted some so I was like SURE! Haha so I actually drank wine in a retaurant! I felt so cool haha. I'm such a nerd. :-P And the waiters were all really young and really cool, and the chefs were all these Japanese dudes who every now and then would get in a huddle and say some cheer and then take shots! Haha.  I was wearing a black open neck short sleeved shirt, with this knee length 40s looking skirt that's yellow with big white flowers and white ribbon at the bottom. And I wore my white leather stilettos with my white purse! Haha I truly felt glamorous.  Oh, what a mahvelous evening!!!!!
