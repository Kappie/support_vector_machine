Friday afternoon I went to Danielle's aunts house because Danielle and her family were camping out in the backyard for the weekend. Later that evening we went to Austins house because he was having his birthday party there. Afterwards we went back to Danielle's aunts house and went to sleep in a tent in her backyard. Saturday we hung out for awhile at Danielle's and shawn came over and hung out with us. Saturday night we went to the wentzville music pit cuz our friends band was playing there. I hate the pit ... i went there once before and it gave me a major headache and i didnt enjoy it. I tried to get some people to stay in troy with me while everyone else went to the pit but everyone wanted to go to the pit. which i dont understand cuz i know two of the people dont even like that kind of music. Oh well. Danielle and i had those little glow sticks that you put in your mouth and both mine and hers broke open and we ended up swallowing all the glowing stuff on the inside. No one cared about me but everyone was running to danielle to make sure she was ok. But i guess i am used to that kind of stuff by now. After the pit everyone went to Danielle's aunts house for Danielles birthday party. Danielle, ben, natalie, and i were all mud wrestling and covered from head to toe in mud but it was fun. I kinda didnt want natalie wrestling with us just cuz she is hotter than i am lol. oh well ... she did look good! everyone was gone by about 2 in the AM so danielle, ben, james, and i all went to sleep in the tent. ben and james stayed awake talking and i kept hearing them say my name but i was too tired to care. Sunday we hung out at danielles aunts house .. i was waiting all day for amy to call me cuz i was supposed to go with her and some other people to the river for fireworks and stuff. around 3 in the PM danielle checked her voice mail on her phone and realized we missed the call from amy .. who had called about 2 hours prior to that. I figured they went to the river and i was screwed so i didnt really bother too much with trying to get a hold of amy. Finally i did get a hold of her and went to the river with them. It was amy, rachel, chip, nathan and amy and rachels family. we parked on this sand bar (and boy it was huge .. lol) and shot off some fireworks and then later we watched the professional fireworks being shot off. It was awesome cuz it looked like they were coming right at me. I had a lot of fun that day. Sunday night i spent the night with amy and went home monday cuz i had to babysit my sisters monday afternoon. I ended up getting sick. monday and today i had a fever and a sore throat but hopefully it will go away and i will be good soon. Right now everyone is at the movies watching spiderman 2 and i really wanted to see it, but i looked like a lazy crack whore and wanted to be able to go home and change and stuff first. I was also sick and didnt know if i would be able to last through the whole movie feeling like shit. I ended up just coming home ... right now they are staring at a giant screen watching spiderman swing around .. oh i wish i could be there :*( . oh well. Hopefully amy will call me tonight and i can go stay the night over there .. but i dont know yet, well find out soon! i am going to bed, i am sick and should prolly get some rest.
