Just thought I'd let you know that today marks the chronological halfway point of our law school adventure.  Back on our third day of ILLP, already miserable, exhausted, and in search of excuses not to read (as I am at this moment), I decided to count the number of days from the first day of orientation until graduation.  In any case, my count is purely chronological, i.e., weekends, vacations, holidays, breaks, are included (I did, after all, have to read the burst balance wheel case that night).  The grand total was 882 days.  Today is day 441.  Good luck with the second half.   Perhaps some explanantions are in order for those of you who do not go to school with me:  ~Febs are what they affectionately call students who start law school in the spring semester at St. John's.  I believe this is because the semester used to actually start in Feburary, because exams were after Christmas in January.  This is, of course, no longer the way things are done, but the name has stuck.  ~ILLP stands for "Introduction to Law and the Legal Profession," which is a Pass/Fail class at the law school that basically clues you in on what this whole law school and lawyer thing is all about.  It starts the week before the other classes and its a brutal marathon.  I went into it with only two weeks between the end of my undergraduate career and the start of law school, and I cried and wanted to go home and wanted to give up.  And I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one who came close to it that first week.  Brutal, it was.  Brutal.  ~As a testament to how much I remember from that week, I have no idea what the balance wheel case is.  It is merely a vague recollection that rests in the back of my head that I once read something that involved it.  But nothing else comes to me.  Perhaps some of my more attentive classmates will refresh my recollection.  The important thing from this email is that I am halfway done.  This is much needed joyous news, and should do a lot to help me get through this week, which promises to be almost as brutal as the first one of law school.
