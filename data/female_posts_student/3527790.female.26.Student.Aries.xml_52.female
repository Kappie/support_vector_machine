And there are more argument for doing the race then there are against it. But for some reason I seem hesitant. Maybe I should take that as a sign?? I don't know. ARGH!  I was going to try and make my self make up my mind by the end of today but now I'm going to give myself til the end of tomorrow. I'm such a procrastinator!  The exciting news is that I am an Aunt! My big brother's wife had their kid. He was born yesterday at 6:30pm 7lbs 10oz; 21 inches long. I am dying to see a picture of the brat. I'm going to have to call an bug my brother. I wish with all of my heart that they were close enough for me to just take a day and drive down to see them. BUT that is NOT going to happen it would take between 24-30 hours to get there. SO...I'll have to wait til Christmas to see the brat! I'm going to go shopping on Sat for him. So much fun having a nephew to spoil.
