"So,how were you with chui wei they all?" "Oh..you want have a chat is it?" "Yup" "Wait ar..I go off the fan first" Then we start to chat.I can feel that she quite enjoy herself with chui wei,jia hui they all.They seem very friendly to her.Many interesting happens at city square.I can't just stop laughing.Then,we chat gossips,my old fren and us.It's so enjoyable chatting with her.hehe....I'm such a chatter box.We chat very long until my mum called me for dinner.Have no choice ,I had to hang up the phone.Hope can have such a nice chat next time ^-^.
