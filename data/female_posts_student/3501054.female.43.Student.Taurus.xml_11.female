I finally found some soy milk (I prefer it anyway) but later found milk packaged in plastic bags...so it can be frozen to prevent spoilage.... In the town in which I am living for this short time, there are two distinct classes of people those that have much and those who have nothing. The third class of people are the Mayan people descenant of those who built the pyaramids and whose Ancestors I sit and glue together bit by bit, scrap by scrap... the Maya eat from the trash of those who have so little. They have less than nothing. They are ignored, unclean, discarded and ignored. I have met some American students who have come with much needed antibiotics and medical supplies donated from a hospital in New Hampshire. Good mission. There are 17 church groups here, many churches, they sing and pray but do not bring clothing, medical supplies, money or supplies. the churches here include Catholic, Seventh Day Adventist, United Pentecostal, Mormon, Baptist (not in this town but near by)and a host of others. They do not build or repair houses (made of mudbrick and plaster). They do not donate time nor money to repair the broken water lines nor the outdated electrical grid. The electrical grid was built in part to support American Troops during the Iran/Contra affair.  There are no native people here who wear glasses. There is not an eyedoctor within 150 miles. No optical shops , no readers for the old folks. No wheelchairs for the handicapped. Infact, there are few handicapped. They have all died young with no medical care.  the children here wear much worn and torn clothing that is traded and was donated from America following the last big hurricane disaster. The Honduran Red Cross has little to assist with and their only 2 vehicles are on blocks in the front of their complex.  Abuse of women is about twice that as in the united states. I have seen it for myself, and had to fight with myself to keep from interveining. It was finally my own experience ...and knowledge that after the interveiner left the woman would be further punished that kept my eyes diverted and mouth shut.  Tourists pour into this town for their two day stays...drop what seems like a million dollars in a few shops and leave...content and oblivious to what I see. I live in a house in the city...I walk to work with the masses...I shop at the local shops, not the tourist dives.   The disparity of wealth is sickening. The injustice of humanity is worse.  The little children beg near our house for the rotten mangos that have fallen from our tree.  One of the graces I have been given in this life is the opportunity to have been raised with Appalacian grandparents who had nothing. That has allowed me to recognize that having nothing...does not mean you cannot live a happy and fruitful life. I know that as long as the children have some food in their mouths that 57% of all that are born will live to be 15. That is only 43% who will not survive. That is pretty good odds in a harsh environment. And their are also the rich here, of Spanish Conquest Descent who will live happily.
