You made me miss you too much!"  --------------------------------------------------------------------    One night, the moon said to me, If she makes you cry,  why don't you leave him?'  I looked at the moon and said,  Moon, would you ever leave your sky  --------------------------------------------------------------------  When i saw your love coming,  i welcomed it with open arms and let it enter into me.  People will ask,  'Are you in love?'  I will say, "No, love is in me. hunnie...you are my heart..you r in me  ------------------------------------------------------------------  Darkness isn't the absence of light... it's the absence of you.  --------------------------------------------------------------------  A priceless moment is when you right in my eyes to tell me that u have fallen in love with me more and more.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  every word I said could make you laugh, I'd talk forever.  I asked the sky just what we had, It showed forever.  If the song I sang to you filled your heart with joy, I'd sing forever.  -------------------------------------------------------------------  When I'm with you all my fears disappear.  So, I guess if you're wondering what my biggest fear is,  it would be losing you."  ------------------------------------------------------------------  In my heart there will always be a place for you  it will never change.  I'll keep you with me forever.  Wherever I am ... there you are.  --------------------------------------------------------------  They say the sun, the moon, the stars and other heavenly bodies are far away from us;  I believe they are always close to me whenever we are together, because I see them in your eyes.  The sun rises and sets in your eyes  -------------------------------------------------------------------  If I could put into words how my heart feels when I see you,  or when I think of you,  I would be talking forever  -------------------------------------------------------------------  Loving u takes courage:  fearing it could end at any moment  and yet having faith it will last forever  -----------------------------------------------------------------  I'll be dreaming of you tonight,  'til tomorrow  I'll be holding you tight,  and there's no where in the world I'd rather be,  then be sleeping forever having wonderful dreams bout u,my hunnie  hunnie...i am sorry....soooo sorry..god..please...please...gib her a dream tonight and please help me....help me to make her forget all the pain i caused her..hunnie..i love u tooooo much,...i never knew loving someone too much would turn out to b hurting them...i am sorry...aishiteru...sarangheayo...wo ai ni....i...love u soo much...goodnite.... the stars tonight is still sooo beautiful...even now at 4:am...is still sooo beautiful....goodnite...sarangheayo
