Soooo...last week consisted of our final author presentations to wrap things up. What a relief! Yep, it's finally over, Insha--we can breathe now. We're also finishing things up in band. I think it's vastly appropriate that we're playing "Fate of the Gods" as our final piece together during graduation. It's very fitting and it brings back so many wonderful memories of four years ago (when the band was still young). I'm just going to cry and cry. And I also worked out my Junior Honor Court/Band coinciding dilemma at graduation. As it turns out, I can go through the regular procession with the JHC and then stand up with the seniors later in the show, walk down to the band, and play in our final performance. Ah, tear-jerker. Today was actually our last and final rehearsal. I'm gonna miss it so much, I can't even describe the sense of loss I feel. Oh well, things change.  Also, thanks to Matt (:-D), I got to judge in last week's TP Idol competition. It was fun, and for once I got to criticize/affect people for real. Fun! And I also got rid of any guilt surrounding the Margo issue, because I went up to her and congratulated her on her performance. Now the ball is in her court, and I have no guilt on me whatsoever. Kind of a relief, to tell the truth.  This week.....I'm just trying to finish, finish, finish. Just have to clear things up with Mr. Fleischman in Physics with all of my un-stamped engineering reports, take a test in English on  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest / Fences , and take my Math final. Then I will be DONE for good! And Wednesday, I get to skip school, go to Nordstrom's at 7:00am, and shop all day with my mom during the annual Half Yearly Sale! YAY! Clothes, clothes, clothes, my love. Damn, I'm so materialistic. But I enjoy every minute of it.  FRIDAY will be the big day. Saying final goodbyes to the band, graduation taking place, JHC in my purty dress (hehe), and our final performance with the band. Then I have to drive home, get changed really fast, hopefully drive to RB to pick up Amber, and get ready for our "Senior-Only" Dinner that Insha and I planned at Fish Market. We invited around 18-19 people, and it sounds like everyone is going, so that will be a nice finish to our year. Also on Saturday, we're having a Potluck at the beach with the same people, but I don't know if all of them will show. But that's due to be a fun get-together, too. Ahhhhh this week is gonna kick ass. See y'all tomorrow @ Physics Table.
