But my dad now thinks its his garden that I do all the work on. Its really making me mad. When I was first making my garden my mum told me where to make it so I dug it all out. Then my  dad came home and he made me fill in back  up which was  a waste of time. I like the old spot WAY better than the place it is now. Now its covered by trees and they are always dropping crap on my garden. Then I was digging and and he made me dig it in a stupid certain shape. I WANT A SQUARE. He wants a circle. Then I had to dig the trench for the brick. I did allt hat and it took about a day. Then why I am at school my dad tells Jacob to roto-till my garden and ruins all the work I did on it.  It used to be a place where I could hang away from the earth. but now its turing into my fathers garden..and i don't like it.
