Dont you just love how emily is attracted to like any man over the age of 50?? i mean, for example, my unlce, my grandpa, richard gere and english men from love actually. does anyone else find this remotely disturbing?   Also, how she just lets them go (fluffs..) anytime any place. Does she not have  any  decencey? And to boot they smell. bad.  She also loves to try to be gangster. its so funny.  -"I'll bring tha alco!!" emily -"What's alco??"me -"haha, i'll bring tha holo!!"emily  OR how she is SOOO mean! i mean, sometimes shes mean secretly, other times shes just flat out mean to your face. like tonight, when she made fun of this band and the lead singers screaming. of course, she does an impression, and at that very moment the auditorium becomes silent and EVERYONE heard her. I  sure bet  she felt  STUPID !  Or when she makes fun of how stupid i am. and how she makes fun of everything i say..like when i sound like a valley girl without meaning to. then i pretend i meant to. and my singing...oh man she makes fun of my singing so badly.   Ha or when she talks in her mentally challenged voice. i laugh so hard, it gets me everytime she says my name. "CHEESSSEAAA!!!! LET ME OUT OF THE CLOSET!!"   OR dont you like how em and i think we're cool. and we try so hard to be cool, but we really arent. we're like the biggest dorks ever.   OR how she likes the funniest movies!! Swiss Family Robinson, Fred and Joon (IF thats even the name?), BROTHER BEAR!!!   BUT...regardless of all this...she is one of the most amazing people i know! shes so wicked and cool and i adore her! those things up there...thats why i love her so much!  P.S. emily says kafuffle!!!! hahahaha!!
