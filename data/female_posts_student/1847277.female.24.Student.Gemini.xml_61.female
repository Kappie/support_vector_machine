My Guster CD was stolen en route to Blaubeuren (either at Heathrow or in the youth hostel), so it's been many months since I was able to listen to such smash hits as "Fa Fa" and "Rainy Day."  Speaking of smash hits, the real Strong Bad Sings CD came out today.  Not worth my $12, but interesting nonetheless.  I had another productive day today, which was nice.  I have more to do tonight, but I'm coming down with a chest cold so I probably won't get a lot done.  Sleep is probably the best option.    Woo!  Woo!!  In seven days I will be done with prelims!  They will be over and done with FOREVER.  Never again!  Yay!!!!!  Of course, as I've mentioned, that means I have to start working on my Ancient India paper, which is going to be a bit of a pain.    Still no word on India.  Which seems to be a really bad sign at this point.  Screw all.    More high school kids on field trips to the museum today.  I can't imagine how a high schooler would find it interesting in the least, but at least they don't squeal about the "boobies" in the Native American dioramas.  Of course, some of them come up with more lewd comments which shan't be shared here.  Ah, the joys of having an office in a Natural History museum.    Off to read about Mayan households...
