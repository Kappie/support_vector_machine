I wish Enterprise weren't so cheesy. The horrible rock ballad intro makes me want to wretch, but the pictures are cool; I think that's the trouble with the show. Some things are terrible, but there are still a few remnants of Star Trek coolness that makes you want to check in on the crew. Damn them! I want my fully obsessive, addictive Star Trek back.
