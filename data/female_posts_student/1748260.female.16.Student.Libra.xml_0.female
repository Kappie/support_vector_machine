What do you expect? Proud enough ya? SEC 4B'S GOT SO MANY PROFESSIONALS ;) Their skit's like so funny, right before the dance..

Nila: Sheila Lion: Cheryl Angels: Amanda Quah, Yi Xuan  Janell Survivors: Raihanah, Sabariyah, Fezah, Angeline Su, Joyce  Haiz.. juz another tiring day. Hope tomorow will be better.. The angels are gonna change to wear something sexier!!! As Miss Low requested them to be? She says that all of them wear black seems abit weird..Janell's wearing black spaghetti strap! Amanda Quah told me that she's gonna wear some tight fitting kinda shirt inside  a red coat outside? About Yi Xuan I ain't that sure.. *Shrugs* What will they wear? I'll find out tomorow?   I juz wonder, if someone juz notices I'm ignoring their whole group? Ya.. can't be bothered anyways.. Haha..
