Besides from its normal lengh, I don't have much to say about it.  On friday, I came back from school, played the sims and then ate dinner.  After dinner, I picked up the phone to call Kevan and invite her to come skating at the rec centre with me (There was a teen skate that night).  Unfortunately, Kevan couldn't come.  At that point, I felt as if my night was distroyed and I didn't feel like going anymore but I dicided to go skating anyway.  The skate was awsome because there were only about 8 people that went (most of them I'm friends with).  At about 9, they shut off the lights and turned on these weird disco lights.  It was really cool because there were these shapes of light on the ice.  On saturday, not much happened.  I did my homework made eggsalad sanwiches (they were very salty) and bought prizes and goody bag stuff for Jasmines party.  Yesterday, I didn't do much.  I helped jasmine plan out the details of her party (I helped make a scavenger hunt) and finished up my homework.    To sum it all up, this weekend was pretty dull than usual.
