And Ben, I wasn't sleeping...that's not all i do! Haha, okay..so maybe i was. I think a bunch of cool people are at wendy's right now and that makes me furious because i'm missing out on that deliciousness! Dave is soo irate right now!Oh yeah, i took a bath today. I think i was in there for like an hour and it was really hot and when i got out i was steaming. But that might just be cause i'm hott. Pshhh (X to the Z Xzibit). Peeaaace.
