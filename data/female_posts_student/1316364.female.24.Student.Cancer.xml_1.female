I am a little scared of the whole thing and really do not like the idea of being away from Jesse. Our Christmas was wonderful and I am so glad that we got a chance to see each other although I am wondering if it would have been easier if he hadn’t come home, four days just wasn’t enough time. Having to say goodbye again was so hard. Now that I think back I am not to sure I actually said goodbye to him, I think I just said have a safe flight, I love you and call me in between flights. This is going to be so hard for me I hate it when he is away and this time he is going to be gone for the minimum of twelve months. We do not know where he is going except that it is somewhere in Iraq. While he is away we will try to save up enough money to buy a house. I hope we can get enough money saved up so when he comes home we can start the family we had been talking about.  Yesterday he went back to Ft. Bliss TX. We don’t know how long he is going to be there.   I think one of my biggest fears is that Jesse will come back different then he was. I know he will always love me, maybe even more than I think, but I am so afraid that things aren’t going to be the same when he gets home. I mean a year is a long time. We have only been married for eight months and I hate the idea that I will not be able to spend our 1 year wedding anniversary together. I know he doesn’t like the idea of being away on that day either.   April 19, 2003 was the day we were married. If I knew then what I know now about Jesse’s unit being mobilized, I would have still said I do. That day was so wonderful and that night was the first time I felt like Jesse finally belonged to me  that I finally belonged somewhere. We found out on the day of our six year anniversary of being together, November 14, that his unit was being mobilized and that was the day I felt the feeling of belonging being taken away from me. That was the day that our lives had been changed and our fate had been determined for us. I sit here and all I can think is that this whole thing isn’t fair.  But what can you do?
