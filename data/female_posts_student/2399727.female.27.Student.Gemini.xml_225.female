He will be touring a steel plant in Krakow, birthplace of Pope John Paul II and he will also have a three-hour tour of Auschwitz.  For some reason I have been protected from and shielded myself from hearing much about the concentration camps and from viewing most of these images, but the following is my exploration of some of the photographic information available on the web about these horrors.   The official website of the Auschwitz "museum" is available  urlLink online .  Until today, I was completely unaware of the existence of " urlLink Kanada " at Birkenau.  Stuart Nichols has a website called "On Every Day Since... A Christian at Auschwitz", so named because of the self-composed quotation that appears on his website, "On every day since I first saw Auschwitz, I have wept."  On his site, he documents with commentary and photographs his tours of Auschwitz and Birkenau.   urlLink Part Four  details his findings at Auschwitz; he also includes a  urlLink layout of Auschwitz .  Those interested only in his photos from the various places can find them  urlLink here  (which oddly enough were less painful for me to read than his descriptive and knowledgable commentary).   urlLink Alan Jacobs  has a similar photo site in colour.  This page is an  urlLink Auschwitz Alphabet  and details some of the medical experimentation and key words at Auschwitz/Birkenau.  Though I am sure there are other comprehensive sites, after I read some of the details at  urlLink The Nizkor Project , citing that between 1.1 million and 1.5 million died at Auschwitz (a fact confirmed by the  urlLink Auschwitz/Birkenau Museum website ), I was completely numb and had to turn off my search engine.    How anyone could do this to another living person is simply beyond me.  More to come...   urlLink    Gate that leads into Auschwitz urlLink
