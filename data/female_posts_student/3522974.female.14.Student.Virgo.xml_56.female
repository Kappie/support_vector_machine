It is sooo annoying! Right now, i have absolutely no idea where anyone is, my bro came home for 10min, and i was calling him, and he wasn't answering, and so i went down stairs to the garage, and lo and behold, the car is missing. Rejected a-gain. I was gonna write a recount of my supposably 'bad' day, coz i got such good responses from my last bad day, but my stupid lack of short term memory is making it dam hard. I cannot remember anything after last sunday. I used my intelligence, by asking Gemma what i did today, but proving that i couldn't remember whether i had a sex change or something, she answered, "..i wasn't there...". Great. So, i suppose you just have to listen to me babble on about nothing.... I think ur soo mean, i think we should try, i think i can need this in my life. I think i'm just scared, I think too much...  Bleeeeeeeeeeeeep. Wait! Something is coming to me! PD class, yes, yes. Future. O god, that's right! I was in PD, being the mature, sophisticated person that i am. I was writing, with the helpful aid of Hannah, a "Most likely to be a .........." list. Jess is gonna be an alcoholic, Annie-a sex slave (she suggested it), Julia- a councellor, Hannah-Mini Mr. Evil, Lauren-Priminister,  Jacki-a person behind a tourist booth, Mel-a bumb, Keira-prestigious author of 'Erotica', Volume 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and 12. Also author and illistrator of 'Spot'. Also there were other people and various mean tags associated with them. (eg. prostitute at Porkies, married to Johny Douglas Howard etc). Yeah well, we weren't trying to diss our friends or n e thing, we had every intention of showing them the list, but Mrs. Irwin walked up to my desk and snatched the peice of paper out of my clasped hand. "Can i see that?" she said, as she waddled back to her desk. What's with asking the question after you take the paper, she didnt let me answer! N e way, Hannah and I cracked up, as i realised she is gonna think im for real. She would probably send me and my porno group to the councellor, that is if she can read my droolish writing (unlikely). N eway, Hannah couldn't risk it, so at the end of the period, she snatched it off her desk and ran out of the classroom. Mrs. Irwin just tuned around to see hannah, jogging out of the rooom complete with the confiscated paper. She was just about to say sum thing to me as i jumped out after hannah, and ran off. Hannah and I laughed it off, while walking to the canteen. On the way back, we were walking up the steps towards the library, when we saw Mrs. Irwin standing at the top of the stairs. We silently screamed and sprinted into the rarely seen [by us] library. We retreited there for a while, untill we thought it safe to come out. As we slowly walked into the Yr 9 locker room, we saw Mrs. Irwin talking to some poor kid. We laughed as we snuck past. At that moment she happened to look up and saw hannah and i. Hannah ran away. I thought it was too late, and was about to surrender with Hannah, but i looked at my side, and saw hannah sprinting to the door. I told my self 'what the hell' and ran after her, to leave a fuming Mrs. Irwin with her latest victim. When we got back to the group, we shared the list around and all laughed. Friends r great.
