Early in the morning, I walked a short distance to school after a sleepless night. I've slept from 6.20 to 10.55, that's why I didn't blog yesterday! 'Cos I'm too tired to do it. Now I've the 2.4. Though not so worried as the others, I'm so excited about it. So we changed and went to the foyer to get ready. We stretched and then got ready for this very big challenge.  I was waiting with anticipation near the front line. We cheered and wished each other good luck and do our very best to cross over this huge barrier for 2.4km run. The whistle sounded and the boys shot off in a fast pace. My heart was beating faster and faster every second. I can do this! I knew I can! We wait for two minutes, each time trying to take a step forward and the time came, the countdown... 10...9...8...7...6....5.........4.......3........2......................... 1!!!  We ran off as if there was a dog chasing behind us. I ran, each step I tried to make it as bouncy and as quick as possible and I ran and ran and....I stopped. I took a few deep breaths and told myself I CAN DO THIS! and continue with a slow jog all the way even though I did stop a few times on the way there and back. I ran...all the way near the mosque, thn huiqian about to overtake me. Nooooooo!!! I can't let this happen!( haha. I doesn't really mean it all right?) I CAN DO IT!!!  (I can!!  Or else I will be failing ) So I ran all the way non stop with a faster pace until I reached the school foyer and finally took the card and sat down, my mind twirling... the image was blur. The breathing was quick and raspy. It was like the end of the world. But  I managed to pass!!  We went back to classroom, and straight away was a Geography assignment in 30min time. God. I cannot even think properly. I actually copied the whole chunk of information in the textbook. Then near the end, I was scribbling the points and then filled in everything and handed it in. Phew.  After that, thank god, was recess, which is the time that I can grab something to eat. It feel so weird after all the energy lost, I actually do not feel hungry. Instead, I bought a drink and it was enough. Next was two hours of lessons and finally was band time.  I felt the headache getting more and more painful each step I took. I really felt sick. A lot of people wanted to skip band practice because of this reason. This is the first ever time when there is a situation like this. Yingjie,qiuliangskipped band practice..What will happen to Jasreel!?Gee! Even that guy doesn't want to come because of napha,which I doubt is a lie (he got his napha on thur!!) and he got so many homework to complete...ahh.(During fall in time, Jaslyn got samula [back to the previous position] 6-7 times...haha) So I had no instrument since my clarinet is not working and I feel so out of place. When it's sectionals time, I finally got to lend Elaine's and Peggy's clarinet so that I can practise.  However, I feel myself getting more and more giddy. The energy was lost. My fingers felt so numb...I draw raspy breaths, as if I was going to vomit any second. I totally lost the will to strive on. Everything was twirling...spinning...like craziness. I stumped my way through the bathroom. I can't think at all. and I vomitted all my lunch out. I was sickening. But it was feeling better. I staggered back to the sectionals ground and peggy forbidden me to play...gee. Jaslyn said I looked very pale. Am I? I rarely felt this weak before... even after a run, I should not get sick!  The energy boosted through me as I smiled encouragingly. This is not the end of the world afterall. After that, I can only watch the conductor and spend my time glaring at the score...Ahh. Nizam. My way of thinking was getting stranger...he is so shuai (handsome) and so cute but so  childish .  And it's duty. All of them hurried me to do the duty sooner. Hey, what's the hurry!? Are they afraid to fall in!? Ahh. it'sso easy...hehe. I've been longing to fall in. haha. Falling in isn't thatbad afterall, you see? They sabotage me! In the end, Peggy and elaine kept me back to clean the instrument room!!!!! *groans* now I REALLY have to fall in. I ran through the way slowly, but my head is still aching. I came to a halt right infront of the Mr Ong and Miss Lim. *gulp*.I cut my way through them...=P. Then fall in! ha! (so shuang sia..) Then after falling in, I paid $15 and my wallet is like...empty.  Then on my way out of the gate, I accompanied Jaslyn to wait for her mother even though I really don't need to. I just wanted company...haha. So I waited and it was great fun to communicate along.   I bet tomorrow will be a better day!  *grins*
