Watching:   E! 101 Hollywood Secrets    Mood:   amaroidal   Well, I'll be damned! There IS such thing as an artificial sphincter.   An artificial sphincter consists of three parts:  A cuff that fits around the bladder neck (or anal canal for the artificial rectal sphincter)  A pressure regulating balloon  A pump that inflates the cuff   To treat fecal incontinence, the cuff is placed around the anal canal. To use the sphincter, the person will compress (squeeze) the pump to divert fluid from the urethral (or anal) cuff to the balloon. This action will allow the sphincter to relax so that the person can urinate (or defecate). The cuff will then re-inflate on its own in 3 to 5 minutes (10 minutes for the artificial rectal sphincter.  However, it does not appear that the need for an artificial sphincter arises from excessive anal sex (sorry, James!).
