This is gonna rock! Besides the fact that the people I invited don't really know each other too well. They are coming in groups of two, I mean, so at least they got someone there to hang with if things should get bumpy. But, woah, maybe I should have thought about this before my mom decided I should invite practically everyone that I know.  What the heck have I gotten myself into? Don't get me wrong, I don't want to un-invite people or anything. I love all my friends. The question is; will they mix well?? I don't know. Some of them represent a different time in my life too so.... wow.   I'm going to stop worrying. There's free food, music, and me. If they aren't comfortable then.. Idk. I'm going to have fun. And so will tabitha. Lol. If anything else, we will all be cracking up by the end of the night. Maybe the stars will peak out that night! That would be awesome.   Dude.. I need to buy some citronella candles or... something..
