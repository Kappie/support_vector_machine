It's been good, tennis was fun, I've played like once in the past month and that was 2 weeks ago and barely played at all this summer and I still hit the ball pretty well. I was moving a lot better than I have in the past, probably cuz of all the conditioning and activities I've been doing. Then I came home and ate some of our homemade pizza, and I must say it's wasn't to shabby, gets better everytime. Then I ate a tun of ice cream... it was so good (and it was fat free and no added sugar so i was aloud to eat as much as i did, atleast in my rules, lol)! Now me and my sis are watchin "Lord of the Rings : Return of the King" good movie but at home I don't have the patients to sit and watch the whole thing straight through, I always get on the computer or start walkin around.   I'm tryin to figure out how to put some of my favorite pictures on this site, I think I've got it but I'll get back to you when I know for sure. GOD BLESS
