Thursday night I was hanging out at Michelle's place when Ashley gives me a call and tells me how her date canceled on her for prom and that she tried calling other people, but they were too busy. And then, out of the blue, she asks me to go with Peter, Leah, and herself. I gratefully accepted. It was the best and worst of times all in one night. Grazi was awesome. We were serenaded at dinner, and the food was excellent.  Prom itself sucked. The music was mainly sucky, but everyone looked fabulous. Just hanging out with a bunch of people you may see once or twice more before they head off to college, taking a shitload of pictures, I should have spiked the punch.  Afterward, I was suppose to go the Harry Potter with Ashley and Peter, but I had to be home before the movie let out, so I went with Michelle to Elizabeth Cornish's place and chilled out in back, by the bonfire. Chloe made her Chloe Specialty (essentially a Jager Bomb, just mixed differently). Got drunk before I got stoned, but either way I was so tired. I headed home. I was terrified to drive but I concentrated on it, and all went smoothly. I took back roads back to my place, because it seemed like the best idea. I don't think I'm going to do that again.  Today I have Ashley's open house and I need to find Josh, we've been playing telephone/AIM tag. Must take shower... Eww.. I smell like a YHS prom and alcohol.
