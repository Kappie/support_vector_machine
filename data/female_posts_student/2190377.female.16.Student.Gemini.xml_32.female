I get comments like, "You're so fun to talk to when you're happy, cheer up."  This  could  be taken as a compliment, but instead I take it as me being nothing but a source of entertainment for other people.  It gets boring after awile, and annoying, because people think I'm being weird when I'm not bouncing off the walls and cracking 7th grade humor type jokes every 30 seconds.  Actually, if I don't do that it means I'm super comfortable with you and you should take it as a compliment... but whatever.  I'm so tired of miscommunications lately.  You'd think that for someone who talks as much as I do, I would be correctly understood, but no.  Same for other people.  Anyways, sorry for being a bitch to a lot of people lately.  I'm so apprehensive about my EEG results, I get them back next Monday.  This could change my life guys.  Hopefully he doesn't want to run any more tests.  I'm so tired of tests, in all facets of my life.  Someone told me they thought I'm stuck up.  That makes me sad.  Especially because I really have no self-esteem at all.  Because, just like I told Jeremy once, I'm not a pessmist or an optomist, just a realist.  I know what I am and am not capable of.  Or at least I thought I did, until recently when I began questioning the little intelligence/athletic ability/people skills/physical attractiveness I  thought  I had.    Okay I'm tired of writing and this probably isn't too much fun for you either.
