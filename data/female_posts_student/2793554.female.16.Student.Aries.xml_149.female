Pooie.  and then i babysat, and broke my cousins bike and so now i have to pay for a new one cause it was totaled. i didnt know you could total a bike, but whatever. so now i have to pay like $200 for a new bike. shitty. next ill be fat and gross and deny that i break things... and imply that it is other peoples fault. whatever. then ill be shit out of luck and have to move away somewhere like new york or louisiana or michigan. haha.  i dont know. im bored. maybe ill go to bed, i think i have to help my dad in the morning.  abby
