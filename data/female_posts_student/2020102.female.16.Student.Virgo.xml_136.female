It takes more faith to deny God than to believe in Him." -John MacArthur   "In this modern world of ours many people seem to think that science has somehow made such religious ideas as immortality untimely or old fashioned. I think science has a real surprise for the skeptics. Science, for instance, tells us that nothing in nature, not even the tiniest particle, can disappear without a trace. Nature does not know extinction. All it knows is transformation. If God applies this fundamental principle to the most minute and insignificant parts of His universe, doesn't it make sense to assume that He applies it to the masterpiece of His creation, the human soul?" -Dr.Werner Von Braun   "There are but two essential requirements: First: has anyone cheated death and proved it? Second: Is it available to me? Here is the complete record: Confucius' tomb - occupied. Buddha's tomb - occupied. Mohammed's tomb - occupied. Jesus' tomb - empty. Argue as you will. There is no point in following a loser." -G. B. Hardy   "For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries." -Robert Jastrow  "The most valuable thing the Psalms do for me is to express the same delight in God which made David dance." -C.S. Lewis  "Joy is not the absence of suffering. It is the presence of God." -Robert Schuller
