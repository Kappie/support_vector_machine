To update the internet stalkers who actually read this I am: *trying to use proper grammar and spelling (I don't remember why... I think someone was saying that it was too hard for me) *taking part in the musical "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" *My room is not clean, though it was a couple weeks ago, before I started packing for a trip to Quebec *I now know that I can survive below freezing tempuratures *Soccer was a blast *a new piano test is approaching *Courtney plans the best birthday parties *Homework is hell as usual *I hope I don't have such a depressing outlook on life as I did my last post. I'm actually quite a jovial child. I'm out of my awkward phase which is joyous indeed. Though, when you go to Castilleja, you're awkward stage lasts until the end of high school. I'm over my geeky phase in that case and I'm still awkward. *Even if my room is not clean, my shelves are. I spent a good amount of time arranging them today. I had new pictures to put up. Ok. Stopping with the stars. They're v. preppy-looking aren't they? Oh well... I don't think I'm a v. preppy person. Well, yes, maybe more than others. My clothing style is rather a mishmosh of stuff. I like dressing up. Pretty dresses are cool. I will wear the color pink. Though, I like purple better. But I'll wear pink. That's pretty preppy. I'm not popular. And I'm not full out punk.  I have purple hair now and it makes me happy. I forgot how dark my hair was. When it grows back to black it'll be scary dark. But I like it neon purple for now. OH! Would you like more on politics? Hmmmm... Well, the war is technically still going since there still is resistance. Wars start so fast and end so slowly. It's annoying. Of course, no weapons of mass destruction, so now they're searching for "programs" of mass destruction. That means that if some obscure person was just randomly thinking, What would happen if I started making nuclear weapons? He/She will be brought to the U.S. and tried for some random irrelevent crime (because this is what our government has been reduced to) and essentially executed for no apparent reason. Tell me again why he was chosen to be President? I still maintain he did not win this election. Bozo. I can't believe four years of complaining about Bush have gone by. Unfortunatly, it seems as though he will with the 2004 elections. BOOHISS. Kerry... well... I have nothing to say about Kerry. I wish Dean had more than fanatical grassroots support. Kucinich. I wish people didn't think he was so left. Mr. Blair was saying the other day, that in America sometimes the phrase "too liberal" is bad. Like a swear word. I think that more people should attend the liberal activists club. It's the funnest thing in the world. Except, we kind of have not gotten to the activist part of it yet. It's kind of hard for all of us to agree to do something. Everyone is so busy. Plus, now Chelsea and I cannot go because we have government meeting. Speaking of which to add to my preppy start list. I am not 1/4 of the social committee of the class of 2007. As our first act we canceled the Bellarmine social due to lack of interest. We tried to vote on either a bandnite or a dance and by some miracle 62 people divided into 2 groups of 31 and now we are stuck. I say bandnite. We really need to get profit and cost numbers from the sophmore government. Half of our class thinks that dances make $2000 bucks. I have news for them. Dances do NOT make that much money. They make just as much or less than bandnites. We will need to find real numbers. Got to go. Goodnight.
