She was saying that at her school, ALL of third grade had left this year, for one reason or another. That's a lot of teachers!  She was saying that it's really hard to work at these schools- and that it can be discouraging, because even if you are a fantastic teacher, you can't compete with the other influences in the kid's life- they feel that they don't make a difference. She also said that the older teachers seemed to handle it a little better, that they felt that they COULD at least provide a positive environment for the time when the child was at school (she also thought that maybe it had to do with the fact that the older teachers had thier own children, and had them to worry about, and knew that they DID have control over the quality of thier lives).   I also got some information from her about being a teacher's aide- I need to call the central office tomorrow to follow up on that.
