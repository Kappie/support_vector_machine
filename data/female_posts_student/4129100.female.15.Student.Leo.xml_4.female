"Then hurt me."- Bright Eyes, Lover I Don't Have to Love.      Dearest,    Sorry has been so over used that I dont think it has meaning anymore to anyone, so I've been looking for a word that means something more then a mere apology for something trivial. To be honest, I didnt come up with much so I'll just write what I'm feeling and hope you understand.    I wont take back what I said in the last post, because its what I've been thinking about and I don't want to lie to you by saying I don't actually mean it. It's not that our relationship isn't fun and what not, it's just that we're so serious about each other that it's not going to go well. Say if I wanted to get high with BJ, I'm sure that wouldn't go over too well, and I get uber jealous when you say you're even hanging out with  Lauren, even though I know nothing happens. Who knows, maybe I am just being stupid and us being this crazy for each other will make our relationship better then if we were just meaningless. Which ever it is, I still want to be with you, more then anything, but I have set a deadline for myself, because unfortunately, I cant wait much longer.                                                        Love you more then ever,                                                                         .:Sam:.
