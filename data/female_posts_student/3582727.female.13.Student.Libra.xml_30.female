I am including my answers from sixth grade.       For a person you loved deeply, would you be willing to move to a distant country, knowing there would be little chance of seeing your friends or family again?    Then:  Nah, I couldn't stand never seeing my friends again, and if some dumb guy's just gonna move away, he probably doesn't care that much, anyway.    Now: Before I go traipsing around the world with this guy, I'm going to make him part of my family. And once he's part of my family, this question makes no sense, so it can be ignored.       If you were to die tonight with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why haven't you told them yet?     Then:  If there is something that I want to tell someone but haven't, it's probably because it's somewhat secret, so therefore I am definitely not about to post it on the internet for anyone to see.     Now: Yeah, things that I'm not going to post online for those exact people to read. And I haven't told them because I'm afraid of their reactions.       If you could spend one year in perfect happiness but afterward remember nothing of the experience, would you do so?      Definitely.     I'm not so sure now. What's the point, really? Anyway, if I were in  perfect  happiness, I'd have to be pretty ignorant, wouldn't I? But if I were truly in perfect happiness that would mean that all wars and slaughter had ceased, in which case I'd take the year of perfect happiness if only because it would be a year's worth of people and animals who would not be killed.        If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the body or the mind of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?      I'd say mind, because having the mind of an old granny scares me, unless I'd be a cool old granny anyway, in which case I'd choose body, but then I'd look like a freak, and nobody would believe me about my age...I'd say mind...     I'm assuming that I could still learn and gather wisdom with my thirty-year-old mind, but just that I will always remain as sharp as a thirty-year-old. If this is the case, then I choose mind. Otherwise, I choose body.       What would constitute a "perfect" evening for you?      The beach. Or the woods. Hmm.     Hell if I know. Though the woods is good. Very good.       Would you rather be extremely successful professionally and have a tolerable yet unexciting private life, or have an extremely happy private life and only a tolerable and uninspiring professional life?      A happy private life, definitely, but I'd like both if I can wangle it.     I hope that my professional and private lives will not be so distinctly separate. I want one to affect the other, and I want them both to be wonderful. Or at least that's my way of getting around the actual question.       Would you be willing to become extremely ugly if it meant you would live for 1,000 years at any physical age you chose?      No way, I'd hate to live for 1,000 years under any circumstances. I'd just get too damn tired.     It has little to do with becoming ugly, but I'd hate to live that long. I would, however, like to check in every once in awhile. Just to see how we're coming along.       If you could wake up tomorrow with any new ability or quality, what would it be?      Hmm...I'd want to read people's minds...except I'm not sure I really want to know what people are thinking and what people think about me; I'm probably much happier not knowing. So don't tell me. ;) But really, I'd want to be able to become invisible. Yeah.     You know, I didn't even consider any  natural  abilities. Hm... I'd wake up tomorrow and be an absolutely brilliant writer.       You have the chance to meet someone with whom you can have the most satisfying love imaginable. Sadly, you know that in six months, the person will die. Knowing the pain that would   follow, would you still want to meet the person and fall in love?      Yes...I think.     Probably not. I don't think I could take that.       Do you prefer being around men or women? Do your closest friends tend to be men or women?     Depends on the occasion. My closest friends are all girls.     My friends are still all female. Guys kinda suck. At least at this age they do.       Have you ever hated anyone? If so, why and for how long?      I have never really hated anyone, and I don't believe that you can say how long you hated someone, because I think that hate is something that lasts forever, otherwise it's only intense dislike. I have intensely disliked several people.     I now have a new outlook on hatred. The way I see it, I can both love and hate a person, and it can come and go with time. People change. They're so complex, that it's impossible to love or hate every aspect of one of them. So, right now I hate in some way every one of my friends, family, and everyone else I know.        If you knew there would be a nuclear war in one week, what would you do?      I'd tell everyone everything that I've always wanted to tell them but been afraid to, and I'd do everything that I want to do but am afraid to. I'd have as much fun as possible.     I'd try to stop the nuclear war, of course. I mean, I've got nothing to lose...       If you knew you could devote yourself to any single occupation--music, writing, acting, business, politics, medicine, etc.--and be among the best and most successful in the world at it, what would you choose? If you knew you had only a 10 percent chance of being so successful, would you still put in the effort?      I'd be a great singer, definitely. I know I have less than a 10 percent chance of being so successful, but I'll still put in the effort, because I love singing.     I'd want to find some way to change the political world without actually being a politician. I'd be an activist, devoted to some important cause. Probably anti-war. And I'd love to write as well. Of course I'd put in the effort. What's the point of living otherwise?       Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be?      No clue. Probably whatever's closest, I don't want to risk anything.    Oh, gosh, I still don't know. Perhaps whatever's most expensive while still being easy to save, however materialistic that may sound. I don't believe I own much of any sentimental value, so why wouldn't I go for the thing that would cost the least to replace? It's simple logic.     When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?      I've sung to myself within the last 5 minutes or so, and I've sung to someone else in the last 24 hours, I think.     I just sang to myself a few minutes ago -  Imagine , by John Lennon - but I haven't sung to another person in quite some time.       If you could choose the manner of your death, what would it be?      Either doing something exciting, such as skydiving or bungee jumping, or murder, so maybe I'd make the news. Hehe.     Oh, dying peacefully in my sleep... But if that's not really a fair option, I'd die for a cause. I'd die fighting for what I believe in, corny as that may sound. And I don't mean in a war - I hate war, and most of them don't seem to be worth it anyway - but in a different way. Some different way.       Do you have any specific long-term goals? What is one, and how do you plan to reach it?      I want to be a singer. I'm not sure how I'm going to reach it, and I highly doubt that I am going to reach it. But I guess I'll keep writing songs and stuff.     No, not really. I'd like to have some, though.       For what in your life do you feel most grateful?      I don't feel particularly grateful for much in my life...except my friends.     The air in my lungs. But if you want something more sentimental, I'd still go with my friends.       If you could have free, unlimited service for five years from an extremely good cook, chauffeur, housekeeper, masseuse, or personal secretary, which would you choose?      Hmm...either a cook, a chauffeur, or a housekeeper...I'm not sure.     Hm... A chauffeur seems extremely unnecessary. A housekeeper would be helpful, but I don't really want anyone poking around in my stuff, and it'd probably be best for me to do that myself or else I'd be really lazy after the five years were over. A masseusse would just be...weird. And a personal secretary seems pointless. So I'm definitely going with the cook, even though I don't see myself as ever having or really wanting servants of any kind. I would like some good healthy vegan meals, though.       Would you enjoy spending a month of solitude in a beautiful natural setting? Food and shelter would be provided, but you wouldn't see another person.      No way, unless I could communicate with other people, in which case I would enjoy it.     Hm, kind of a  Walden , eh? I'd probably miss people pretty badly by the end of it, but I love solitude, and I love nature, and - please!? Oh, that'd be perfect!       Would you like to be famous? In what way?      I'd like to be a famous singer.     I'd like to be a famous activist sort of person, or a famous writer. Preferably both.       Which of the following restrictions could you best tolerate: leaving the country permanently, or never leaving the state in which you now live?      Never leaving the state, although that would be awful.     This one's tough. I really can't decide.       Is there anything you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?      There's nothing I can think of right now.     Again, I can't think of anything at the moment, but I'm sure there are countless things that I could list. And I haven't done them because I'm a loser. I never get anything done.       What are your most compulsive habits?      Being online all the time, but I'm getting better!     Hm... the Internet, putting off my homework until eight or nine at night, and shutting off my alarm clock every morning.       What do you most strive for in your life: accomplishment, security, power, love, excitement, knowledge, or something else?      Exciting, secure, powerful, knowledgeable, accomplished love.     Of the listed options, knowledge - but I want that knowledge in order to accomplish change in the world.        You are invited to a party that will be attended to many fascinating people you've never met. Would you want to go if you had to go by yourself?      If I wasn't doing anything else, then why not?     Probably not. But it depends on what is meant by "fascinating people" - if they were fascinating in that they shared my interests and beliefs, and therefore I was sure to get along with them, then I'd jump at the opportunity.       Since adolescence, in what three-year period do you feel you experienced the most personal growth and change?      Ahem, I'm not through adolescence...but anyway, the last three years.     That doesn't quite apply to me. And of course I'd say the last three years.       If you were happily married and then met someone you felt certain to bring you passionate, intoxicating love, would you leave you spouse? What if you had kids?      If I met someone and felt sure that they'd bring me intoxicating love, I obviously wasn't happily married in the first place.     Hm... Exactly how happily married am I? If I would clearly be much happier with the other person, then I might consider it, but not after a complete divorce. I'd never have an affair or just run off. If I had kids, then I probably wouldn't leave my spouse, as long as I'm happily married.       Who is the most important person in your life?      One of my friends.     One of my friends, still.       Do you support capital punishment?      No.     I'll still say no, though it's a rather complicated and tricky issue.       If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be?      Ahem, I'm still being raised...but regardless of that, I'd make dad pay more attention to me and my interests, and I'd make mom more responsible.     I'd stop my dad from favoring my brother, I'd make my mom more responsible, and I'd probably want a slightly nicer house. Oh, I didn't even think of this - my parents wouldn't be divorced. They wouldn't be divorced, but they wouldn't argue either.       If 100 people your age were chosen at random, how many do you think you'd find leading a more satisfying life than yours?      'Bout 70.     Probably around forty. Not that my life's particularly satisfying - quite the contrary - it's just that I'm sure it's considerably better than the lives of teenagers in third world countries. I'm actually rather fortunate, I guess.       Someone you love deeply is brutally murdered. You know the identity of the murderer, who is acquitted. Would you seek revenge?      Some sort of revenge, but I wouldn't kill them, because I wouldn't want to go to jail.     I wouldn't want to do anything too rash. Killing the murderer wouldn't bring my loved one back. But I'd try to find some way to get the killer convicted...       What do you value most in a relationship?      Fun, good conversation, and trust.     Deep understanding and shared values.       Do you judge others by higher or lower standards than you judge yourself?      Lower standards.     Lower standards, generally.       If there were a public execution on television, would you watch it?      Only if I had nothing better to do.     Of  course  not.       What things are too personal to discuss with others?      Things that I won't list here.     I'm obviously not going into detail here, but probably some deeper emotions, and a lot of doubts and questions that I sometimes have...       Would you be willing to do something very unsatisfying (e.g., clean toilets) for the next five years if you were certain that the experience would afterwards bring you a deep sense of personal fulfillment for the rest of your life?      For the next five years, I will be in school, which, frankly, is quite unsatisfying. So yes.     Well, there is the school thing, but I think I'll actually answer the question this time. Yes, I'd clean toilets for five years if I'd have a deep sense of personal fulfillment for the rest of my life. What's five years out of a lifetime, anyway?       How many times during the day do you look at yourself in the mirror?      'Bout five.     Four or five. I mean, really, it's right in front of the sink...       Would you prefer to be blind or deaf?      Blind, because I couldn't stand not being able to hear music, and being blind would make me less judgmental.     This is hard. Right now I think I'll go with deaf. The world (at least in it's natural form) is so beautiful, and sometimes I take my vision for granted. I'd hate life without it.       What does it take for you to trust people?      I don't fully trust anyone. My most trusted friends have been known to betray me and tell my secrets. Grr.     I wouldn't really know, since no one's ever gained that trust. I don't think you can ever fully trust a person. But you can trust them a satisfactory amount.       Of all the people close to you, whose death would you find most disturbing?      Probably one of my parents'.     I'd still say one of my parents', not because I love my parents more than my friends - I don't think I do - but because the death of a parent would affect my life so drastically. Once I move out and begin life on my own, I expect this to change.      Well, that's all I have. These are from  The Book of Questions , so I hope I don't wind up in some sort of copyright trouble. Hm.
