I haven't spoken to you since, what, the Saturday before I left? That was the 3rd, and now it's the 11th!!) My birthday is in seven days and *squee* I am soooo psyched.  I mean, it hasn't been my birthday for a whole year!!  (Duh ...)   Ach.  I reeeeally need to talk to Pooj! Where are you?  I've losted you!  (Like learned, only not.)  Oh yeah!  To kill time, I can go into my theory about feet.  Last night, while we were on the way to the restaurant (oh my God, we were in Malta then!) I started saying how I think we should have pods instead of feet. Like big suction cups, so we could walk on walls and ceilings.  We wouldn't have to wear shoes, so high heel-pain would be thing of the past.  So then Katherine said that pods would be so weird, but I said well, if we had pods, we'd think feet were so weird! Think about it, it makes sense.  I can't be bothered anymore.  I'll just publish this and *sniffs* more on.    Ciaow! *~Jools~*  By the way, it's my 13th birthday in seven days.  I said I was 13 already on my profile.  I can't remember why.  You probs can't use it if you're not 13.  So anyways, in seven days (or most probably eight, maybe even nine plus) I can correct it to be my real age.  So yes, I was born in the year of the goat, not the horse.
