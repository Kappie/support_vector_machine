That's because that's how my mind works. I've always ordered my friends, I've always kept a list. And there are ties sometimes, but I usually try to put someone ahead of everyone else. I mean, you could ask me to make a list right now and I could do it. It would be hard to decide number two and three, but other than that, I've totally got a top five. I don't want to think like this, I just DO.  My sunburn is STILL peeling, but it's doing it where I can't reach it now, in between my shoulder blades. Parts of my skin are REALLY dry and gross, I'll be doing some serious recon with my moisturizer later today.  School starts tomorrow. I've had my summer playlist on all day, I've added a couple songs to it. A lot of it is really hokey, but these are the songs that remind me of summer:  California by Phantom Planet Why Can't I by Liz Phair No Such Thing by John Mayer This Love by Maroon 5 The Boys of Summer by The Ataris Walking on the Sun by Smashmouth I Believe in a Thing Called Love by The Darkness Summer Girls by LFO Summer of '69 by Bryan Adams In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel Calling You by Blue October Stacy's Mom by Fountains of Wayne Hey Julie by Fountains of Wayne  That's summer. Any song on that entire list IS summer. There are some that are this summer in particular, but a lot of them belong to last summer, which in my mind was the perfect summer. Even though I didn't do anything, go anywhere, or change out of pajamas for two months.  And the perfunctory list of what I learned this summer:  -I can toss in Guard -I need friends -People can like other people and still like me (I'm working on this one) -HTML isn't THAT hard -I can't take on everything and still live -Sunburns hurt -I should probably trust people more than I do -I'm way cooler than I think I am -The best place to be is at home, on my computer, in my pajamas -I should be more open-minded about things, because what I never considered might make all the difference -Don't promise you won't get upset and then throw a fit -Don't get so attached to people that you get clingy (too late...) -The less you talk to someone, the more you want to -I hate updating my website, somebody please do it for me  OK, that's enough. I was starting to come up with stupid things just to lengthen the list, a sure sign it's time to quit.  And my schedule: AP American Trig/Precal (The last year of math availible at my sucky school) AP English 3 Physics (There's no AP, but I'm taking the test at the end of the year anyway. The school pays if your grades are good enough) Choir!!! Independent Study for ACE team Band (I need to make new signs for the Guard Room door, we aren't allowed to cover up the window, though. So no Guard Room sex.)  I have spaghettios calling my name, they're the kind with GROSS little hot dogs that I have to pick out, but that's not such a big deal.  Oh, and I woke up this morning and my wrists hurt so badly, I honestly think I'm getting carpal tunnel. My mom's paying for all my contacts, but I have to give her whatever money my dad sends, so I need to call and harass him for money. I feel bad, because that's WHY I'm calling him. But I do need them.  I should really start Dae's necklace. Any day now.
