I don't know what to say, but I am saying that your birthday is going to be celebrated at the party on the 17, and people, get the boy some decent presents.  What do you really want, Will?  It sounds like you've never had a really good birthday, and you are talking to the queen of birthdays.  I love them, whether they be mine or someone else's.  It doesn't matter.  Get a list together of people you want to invite.  I know a gourmet chef (namely Abby) that can cook ANYTHING you want, and it will be really good...wait, make that REALLY GOOD!!!!   Anyway, tell me what you want to eat, who to invite, what you want to do...This is going to be a party to remember!!!    If you need to talk, I'm here.  Don't ever hesitate to call or talk to me at any time.  I'm pretty sure I speak for everyone on this blog when I say that.  I know I speak for Abby because she's sitting right beside me, and agrees with me.    And most importantly, let me and Abby be the first to wish you (and I know we are because it's 1:32 am) "HAPPY 16th BIRTHDAY, WILL WHITESIDE!!!!!!!!!!"
