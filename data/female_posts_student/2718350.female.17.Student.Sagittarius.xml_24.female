(YAY!) and a cooking school in Italy (OMG) the only thing is this depends on my getting a second job because i really need to buy a car for work and school next year and i have no clue how i will get this much money. bleh Grades are up so thats cool i just have to work on English.    If you don't have Your liscense get off your lazy ass like i did and go here--->  urlLink    and get your permit! its super easy and takes very little time.
