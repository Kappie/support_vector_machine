The other guy, Brooks, called...he was sitting there worshipping me on the phone, so I know you don't like it and all, but I am dietic now. "O my Josh!" I love it.  My response to last night...."...". And just for the record, if you don't hear this from my voice first, I won the smallest boobs contest so piss on  all of you . Alex and I quite agree that girls are, in fact, the more perverted side of the species now, even we're not that bad, we just do crazy stuff like jump over mailboxes, expose ourselves, drink caffeine until we overload, watch  COOL  (and note that word in context) movies, and such. Guy gatherings are amazing.
