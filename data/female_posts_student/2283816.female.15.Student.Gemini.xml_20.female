And I am going to shoot some things if I don't find out what she thinks by tomrrow. Oh my Lord. I am getting nervous just talking about it.   In other news, I love my pretty new template. Alias isn't on this week. I went to Mass today. A seal died on the Arctic coast.   Paul has now sent me three Dashboard Confessional songs. They are not bad at all.   Wow, dude, I have nothing to say. I think I'll update y'all on the current state of my personalities. If this proves popular it will be a daily feature.   Regina: Lazing about. JJ: Looking bored. Tiffany: Knocked out with chloroform. Casey: Surfing the internet. Charlene: Setting fire to the convent. Marsha: Off shooting.  Jen: Complaining about how much leg hurts. Lolita: Hungover and playing with butterflies. Alicia: Tired from singing while home alone. Anamaria: Running the wheel and cursing. Laura Lee: Telling Regina to stop cursing at the butterflies. Amy: Prancing through the woods with rum and Inigo Montoya. Kula: Lazin with Regina.  CURRENT PROMINENT PERSONALITY: Kula.
