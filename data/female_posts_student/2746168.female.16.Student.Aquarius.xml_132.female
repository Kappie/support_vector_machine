I have officially read two books this entire summer! Yay! You'd think that I'd be reading constantly...and I am. It's just never  books  anymore. I'm too lazy to go out and get them ,  y'know? But Alafair had a copy of  Mrs. Dalloway  by Virginia Woolf, so I read that yesterday. And Laura was reading  Angels  Demons  by Dan Brown; I picked it up two days ago and read the first hundred pages, then finished it today.  Angels Demons  is the prequel to  The Da Vinci Code,  for those who don't recognize the name. Personally, I likedA better than  Da Vinci Code ...maybe because more people die. Like, way more people. In fact...*counts*...ten, I think. There were probably more that I can't remember right now. But at least ten.   My only gripes with the book are thus:  1. It's structured  so  similarly to DVC that you'd swear you were reading it over again on occassion. All the characters seem carbon copies of the ones in the other book, except that only Robert Langdon is actually the same person. The others are stereotypes:sexy sidekick braniac chick whose mentor male elder relation was murdered (grandfather in DVC,adopted father in A); stern, gets-in-Langdon's-way-a-lot head-honcho military guy; crippled guy who's really important to the plot; freaky-deakystrongman assassin operatingfor mysterious organization whois obsessive-compulsively devoted to his cause anddoes all the killing/grunt work;etc. There's even a "follow the clues hidden in artwork to get to the secret lair of ancient underground organization" thing...except it's the Illuminati instead of the Knights Templar or Holy Grail, and statues instead of paintings. It's more of a thriller, less plausible than DVC, and thusmore exciting...but still. A  lot  is the same.  2. What's up with Robert Langdon and younger women? I think Dan Brown's just fantasizing in bothA and DVC. I mean, c'mon - sexy genius chicks are not gonna wanna hook up with a 40+ art history teacher/symbologist, even if he is from Harvard. At least Brown got better at it...DVC ends with a scene wherein Langdon and Sophie pretty much decide their relationship can't work, and there's some unexpressed sexual tension. (At least, that's what I seem to remember.) ButA just ends with Langdon and Vittoria (that particular book's genius sidekick chick) shacking up. Actually, it ends with Vittoria making some stupid I-am-a-yoga-master-revel-in-my-thusly-awesome-sex-skills joke. *facepalm* So retarded. You're a little too obvious for me, Brown; Vittoria was too strong a character to fall for Robert Langdon. The guy wears a Mickey-freakin'-Mouse watch, for crying out loud!  OK, OK, enough ranting from me. Other than those two points, I advise reading  Angels  Demons.  I'll say about it what I said about  Da Vinci Code:  bad writing, good plot. Good  thriller  writing, I suppose, but as far as craft goes...bleh.   Anyway, I'm a bit red because I laid out reading for several hours and lightly toasted myself. I don't mind or anything - I did it on purpose, and I'm not uber-sunburned or peeling or anything. (Tanned! Tanned! I must get tanned!) I also wanted to go to the Petit Four today, but  Angels  Demons  ate my afternoon, so I'll just go tomorrow. Hooray for lax Mexican scheduling.   Well, that was the Books. "Bites" refers to the fact that Bruce got the tip of one of his fingers bitten off by a horse. And that's Reason #17 why I don't like horses.  Seriously, though...I don't think it's that bad, except for the fact that he lost the tip of his finger. I dunno if they saved the joint or not; he's staying the night in the hospital to make sure it doesn't get infected. It was too chewed up and gross to reattach, but hey, it could've been a lot worse. He coulda lost his whole finger or somethin'. (Will give more details when I get them. Actually, I know more than all that right now, but I'm too lazy to tell you.)  And "Boyfriends" would be Mike. No, not my dad; Alafair's boyfriend Mike. He came down today and is staying till...when? Sunday evening? Eh, I dunno. He doesn't look like I thought he would; neither does Patrick. No one ever described either of them to me, so I suppose it makes sense that they don't look like I thought they would, but still. I didn't get to say more to Mike than "hi," so I can't tell you about him. Ask Alafair. Or maybe just ask Mike. That'd work too.   *yawn* Well, I'm tired, and am going to bed. Or at least get off the blog. I shall see you at some undetermined point in the future. G'night...
