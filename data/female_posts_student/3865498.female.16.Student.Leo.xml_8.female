And thats tough for him, because I think (and so do others) that he's still hung up on me... so that makes things difficult. I watch over him like he's my brother, I make sure nothing happens to him or he does anything stupid. But again that makes things tough. I think he'll get over me soon enough... I hope. Anyways, G now knows what Max and I "did"... like bases and all. He was really surprised to hear we went to 3rd... He even said before, Oh did he steal 2nd? and I was like, well umm try one more base. L thinks that G wanted to be the first one to get to 2nd with me... well sorry honey too late, Max covered you on almost all the bases (no pun intended). Well I don't know what Greg was thinking, I mean I went out with a horny and very experienced 18 year old (when I was 16)... we were bound to round some bases in our relationship. And the weird thing now is that I'm more experienced one in the relationship-- G hasn't dated anyone since me the first time and we didn't do anything. So pretty much G is very clean, innocent and naive... too bad, it was always fun to be the less experienced... ha ha ha good times...   you know you love me
