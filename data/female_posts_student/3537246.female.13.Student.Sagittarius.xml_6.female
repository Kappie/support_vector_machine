We got to go inside the ship and look at all the things that were thre originally. It was cool, there was a spot where they had hammocks hanging from the ceiling where the soliders had to sleep. 40 men had to sleep and store all of their stuff in a small little space. It was incredible. I really liked it, but it scared me when I had to walk on the side of the ship because I could look over the railing and see the lake and I'm terrified of water so it was really scary.   Yea, so I got that call from Allie, we only stayed on the phone for ten minutes. It's freaky when she talks though cuz she sounds like my friend, but much older. But anyway, I got the call and it was cool, lol.   So, my grandma's over today. Not much is going on really, cuz none of my friends are home. Carolyn went to Europe and won't be home until about July 21st. So when she gets back, it'll be better cuz I'll get to hang out with her and stuff. Anyway, that's about all for now. I'm bored...
