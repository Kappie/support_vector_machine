I'm trying, clawing at yesterday, trying to go back to.. Well, everything. I think I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid to let go. I want to stay right where I am. I don't want tomorrow to come. I don't want to wake up in the morning, afraid of what is ahead of me. I don't want to move forward, I would rather step backwards, to when I saw Shawn everyday, to when I stayed after school every day until 5, doing what I love, to when everything was less complicated. I think I'm happy, but what is happy? It's more then a feeling, I know that. And it's more then a hollow smile. You are just happy, It's like jumping into water, Happiness just covers you. It embraces you. But what if you can't swim? What if happiness is an illusion? But I have been happy. Saturday, I was happy. When I was around Shawn, I was happy, and when I was managing the  Wrestling team, I was happy. I know I was. But how do I achieve happiness now? All those things are gone. Saturday- was the past, Shawn- hundreds of miles away. Wrestling- who knows if I'll do it next year? I want it to be Saturday soo badly again. I want to be hugging my hero again. I was to feel.... Overwhelming happiness. I don't think I'm asking a lot. I really don't.  I'm looking at the picture of me and John Ondrasik. And a smile graces my face. I cannot help it. I was soo happy then. I want to be like that again. I was to feel like I'm supposed to. I'm going to be 16 in eight days, and I don't feel like I should. I should be soo happy, but I'm not. What if I am never happy again? I know that I will be.. But what if? See, right now, life is passing me by. While I'm sitting here, sulking over my life, others are having the best times, they are out enjoying their life while they still have one. It's soo sad.  When I met John, instead of calling my best friend, I got on the internet, and told my best friend, and I posted about it on 3 message boards.... How sad.... This school yeah, I will be different, I will go out with friends, I will be social. People will like me this year, and **gasp** I might get a guy! Wow, Breena, don't get to ahead of yourself. ~~I have to change myself before anything else will change.~~ I  like the way that sounds. Alright, I'm done sulking for now ~~Breena
