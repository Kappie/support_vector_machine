I'm getting quite annoyed with trusting people and believing in what people tell me only to be let down. i feel like i have been let down a lot lately and that i have come to a point where i dont want to trust anyone at all. i mean, there are few (and i mean like 4 or 5) people that i feel like i can trust with everything    "life used to be life-like now it's more like show biz i wake up in the night and i don't know where the bathroom is and i don't know what town I'd in or what sky i am under and i wake up in the darkness and i  don't have the will anymore to wonder everyone has a skeleton and a closet to keep it in and you're mine every song has a you a you that the singer sings to and you're it this time baby, you're it this time when i need to wipe my face i use the back of my hand and i like to take up space just because i can and i use my dress to wipe up my drink i care less and less what people think and you are so lame  you always disappoint me it's kinda like our running joke but it's really not funny i just want you to live up to the image of you i create i see you and I'd so unsatisfied i see you and i dilate so I'll walk the plank and I'll jump with a smile if I'm gonna go down I'm gonna do it with style and you won't see me surrender  you won't hear me confess  'cuz you've left me with nothing but I've worked with less and i learn every room long enough to make it to the door and then i hear it click shut behind me and every key works differently i forget every time and the forgetting defines me  that's what defines me when i say you sucked my brain out the English translation  is i am in love with you  and it is no fun but i don't use words like love 'cuz words like that don't matter but don't look so offended you know, you should be flattered i wake up in the night in some big hotel bed my hands grope for the light my hands grope for my head the world is my oyster the road is my home and i know that I'm better  off alone" -ani difranco-
