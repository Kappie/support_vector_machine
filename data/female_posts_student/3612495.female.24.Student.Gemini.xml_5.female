Fortunately, it's good, the lecturer said that our power point are very nice, and our content are descriptive, actually, I dont know it good or not?! I just want to pass all the subjects only. For Credit, Distinction, I dont care. I just want to finish my degree here. For the study here is not the same as Hong Kong, as Hong Kong, I can thinking for getting higher grade, but here, I cant.  今天係我在新南威爾斯大學的第一個演説。幸好，做得幾好，而且個教授都說我們的動畫做得好好，還有好足夠的內容，但這樣唔知係好定唔好？我都只求合格的，有無最高份，我都不敢望。我只想順順利利完成個學位便可以。但澳洲讀書真的比香港困難，在香港可以容易取到好的成績，但在這裡不是容易的。
