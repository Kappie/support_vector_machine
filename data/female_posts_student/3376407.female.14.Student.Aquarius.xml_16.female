And guess what my parents might let me have a party to celebrate the Olympics and everybody can come over and we can watch TV, play games and eat! If you think this is a good idea, please comment cause then my parents might be more likely to let me! :) Also, I am sooooooooooooooooo excited for school to start! (for once) Usually I'm not excited, but I'm taking Biology and we have the coolest class! :) Plus we have Alaina as our teacher which should make it even more cool! My only issue with Biology is that I won't be good with the dissections (sp), I've gotten sick and fainted before in that kind of situation, so I kinda need a lab partner who doesn't mind that kind of stuff! ATTENTION THURSDAY CLASS PEOPLE: the final word on the state fair is that we're meeting at 2:00 pm on Tuesday August 17th inside of Edy's Grand Hall! I hope all you guys can come! It should be tons of fun! :) And I only have one more thing to say : Josh's Concert is on Wednesday!
