I still remember The way you talked with me By equal to equal And how much I loved To be treated that way  I still remember The way you talked about your life With a big smile on the face While remembering your youth And some tears on the eyes While thinking about the present  I still remember your smell I still remember your eyes But as time passes by It's harder to remember your silhouette Like if my brain Was under some kind of a spell  Now that you're gone And memories are harder to find I still trust in my heart As I know you'll forever be there Even if not in my mind
