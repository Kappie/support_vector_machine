So Nicole and I decided to go together too.  Then at the fair, we found the boys, and we were only there for 15 minutes because they close at 11.  Bummer!  So the boys were like, "How about we go to the 'Yoder's' house and watch a movie?"  And then Kayla, who was very tired, came too.  We watched "Shanghi Knights" witch was funny, but Nicole had to leave at midnight.  So then I put in a pizza, and we fought over who got to sit on the couch, and then I spilled pizza on me.  Then we had a pillow fight, and unfortunately, the girls lost.  So then, Opie, Ben and I all slept in the basement.  It was very uncomfortable sleeping on the floor.  But all in all I had fun.  I guess!  Buh Bye Now
