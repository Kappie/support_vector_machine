I had to be up at 7:20 this morning and so the fucking alarm goes off and i am so damn tired i don't even know its mine, poor miranda has to yell "KATIE!!". Smile about this man ..|..|.. 8 am is for crazy people that jog or do yoga not for people that are made to come to work and sit at a desk working on mind-numbing activites. The plus is I am only at this job till 1pm... a nice solid 5 hours ... then i get to go back to hell from 2:45-8:30 (9 if I HAVE to). Going to see Fahrenheit 9/11 tonight ...should be really interesting, im not usually the political message kinda of movie goer but i hear it well done and its going to make history so i figure i better get behind it before i get left behind. im sure ill have something worth reading about after having saw that, so sit tight ... there is more to come.
