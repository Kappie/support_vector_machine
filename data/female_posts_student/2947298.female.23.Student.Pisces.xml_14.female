I sold my soul one dollar at a time, and now I have none of it left. This hallow will never be hole, but I give me one more medicated moment. He did this, took all I had, still I pray never stray. And I don't want to feel this overwhelming hostility... but it's difficult not to feel a little dissapointed, passed over. I believed I could cure it all, for you dear. show me the way to forgive you allow me to let it go illuminate me i'm just praying  for you to show me where i'm to begin reconnect to you and I will not fall down lying all alone and restless. unable to lose this image. thinking of you my reflection wraps and pulls me under guides me safely in worlds iâ€™ve never been to heal me but i've been over this before been over this BEFORE  Mer De Noms  Metaphor for a missing moment Pull me into your  Perfect Circle   I do not regret leaving. I regret loosing the person I thought I had. I miss the person I met, not you. We all make mistakes, but do you put none of the blame on yourself? So I keep searching for the perfect somone I have so clearly in my mind. It is better to have loved and lost, but what if you never loved at all?
