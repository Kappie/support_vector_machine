For one fleeting second, I thought Reuben had died too and that we were wandering into the literary territory of the life in heaven stories, like The Lovely Bones. Jape Waltzer almost reminds me of the assassin in my dream. I am warmed with the stories of miracles, and see this as a very Kylan-esque book with the message that God is comforting. Reuben's dad shouldn't have died, but I suppose that's part of the miracle. Marrying Sara, I thought, was a hasty deus ex machina, but it was the anticlimax by then anyways. I'm glad Davy got away, but I remember that this whole thing started because of Davy's girl Dolly, and I somehow sensed that it didn't matter anymore. Enger is a master storyteller.  In other news, I had the worst dream in years last night. Perhaps I've been exposed to too many fictional accounts of assassins and killings, etc. but my dream last night was that they were killing off the Asian girls at school, and their families. I think that part came from the Kaiser in the Usual Suspects. I just lived in unusual fear. I won't relate some of the more disconcerting details, but the killer was a student at school, but nobody knew who he was. He had a gun. He even came into journalism and shot at people, but miraculously nobody was hurt. Nobody wanted to be around me since my family was getting killed off and they thought if I was near them, they could catch a stray bullet. It was bizarre. I awoke at 4:49 am and all I could see was the glow of the early morning sky peeking out from under the blinds. Without my glasses on, I could have sworn there was someone in the window. I imagined that he had a gun and was about to shoot me. To make things worse, the house creaked. You know, those normal noises that you just hear when the house is silent. So finally, I couldn't take this suspension in fear and went to grandma's room to sleep for two more hours. When I awoke, I realized how silly it was and how effective night and silence were in heightening my fears.  Last day of school today, thank goodness.  What's this story about Peter getting handcuffed at gunpoint?  It was Austin's promotion today. The little kid is amazingly apathetic. We couldn't find him for a while. Saw Mrs. B and Amanda and Coral, though.  I'll do more reading over the summer.
