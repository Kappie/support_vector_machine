She informed me that last night at the fair her mother said that if i didnt pay attention to her in public places i wouldnt be able to watch her anymore. Well i am pretty sure that i went with my friends purposely so that i could hang out with them and not babysit.But when my aunt saw me she said hey i knew where i found boys i would find you guys..referring to me and whitney. Then she said "well you have on more clothes than i expected" totally rude! in front of all my friends...that sucked real bad!  That is the main reason i didnt ride up with my aunt is because i wanted to meet my friends there and not  babysit...not that i dont love my lil cousin to death its just sometimes i like to hang out with my friends and just have to worry about myself ya know? i dunno i am not really mad i think that it is jsut that my feelings were hurt...i mean i was planning on riding a few rides with sammi jo but we rode round up and then went to watch the derby...after the derby we rode round up again  and then the people we went with wanted to leave..which in the end turned out to be a good thing because we sit in traffic for like anb hour and a half and didnt make it home until like midnight...well i think me and sammi are going to go chill by the pool after we straighten up the house....33 love always..ash x0x0x
