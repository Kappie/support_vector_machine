I've decided that i will rely solely on my photographic memory for the rest of the tri (which is only 6 more weeks!!!!) and not study or really do my homework.  I told this freshman girl in my BCIS class who was freaking out about gpa's etc that if i really did all of my work with my best effort and full potential then i would probably be in the top 10% or so......but i'm not because i don't care enough to waste my time trying.  I told her since she was Asian, she can do anything and she thought that was really funny.  She was like "omg i can't do Ap blah blah blah" and i was like "You're Asian, you can make it in the top 10% without thinking."  Yeah, so no more work for taylor......except in PreAp history and then after this research paper is done, no more work in PreAp english.  hurrah!  so i'm still in the predicament of my best friend planning her birthday party on my birthday......and then my mom told me i was having a family dinner for my birthday on that day anyways.....so yeah.    TOMORROW IS FIRST DAY OF STATE HOCKEY TOURNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tomorrow at 5:45pm we play the Woodlands......we're going to have to leave school quick!  Its going to be soooooooo awesome!!!  I love my boys and i know they won't let me down!!!  Oh yeah and Stars lost in double OT in Game 4.  Yeah and that stupid Marek Svatos of Colorado just got a frickin lucky shot!!!  grrrr..   So now the stars are pretty much screwed and it appears that this series will turn out just like the Anaheim series last year.  oh joy.  that means my Niko will either be traded or i won't see him for a good 4-5 months.    oh yeah and Emily wants me to make a sign to bring to state that says "Kiss Taylor, Its her birthday".......but i don't think thats such a good idea.  lol.  don't want anyone getting any ideas.....  3 more days man.....and then i can drive!!!!!!!!!  Love, ~~~Taylor~~~
