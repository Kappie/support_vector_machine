Repent and believe the good news!'"   It's a new thought to me that repentance is a POSITIVE thing.  It is portrayed negatively, for some reason, and people choose to "rededicate" rather than to repent.  What's the difference between repentance and rededication?  Rededication is a desire to try better next time, whereas repentance is a "dramatic and decisive change of course".  There is  action  inherent in repentance, whereas rededication is more like wishful thinking.    Yes, repentance is definately a necessary and ongoing part of the Christian life. Not only is it necessary, but it is GOOD and it shows God's loving nature. Afterall, repentance is a requirement of salvation (see Isaiah 30:15--"In repentance and rest is your salvation...".  When I'm on a path toward destruction, God urges me to repent to save me from the consequences of sin.  He calls me to "Repent and live!" (Ezekial 18:32) When I'm in sin, God warns me by telling me to repent.  An unloving God will allow me to do what I want and put myself in danger.  I God who loves me enough to warn me of danger.    How does one repent?  Repentance involves a "radical change in heart and mind.  It means that I agree with God's evaluation of my sin and take  specific action  to align myself with His will.  Again, the emphasis is on taking action to correct the deviation away from what is right.  So, repentance is 1) a mental acknowledgement that what I have done is wrong, 2) an acceptance of God's judgement, and 3) an action taken to align myself with His will. Note that is not a PLAN of action (that would be more like rededication), but an active response.  A desire to change is not repentance.  "The evidence of repentence is not words of resolve, but a changed life."  I can't tell you how good I am at giving God lip service.  At every girl's accountibility meeting, I tell everyone how terrible I feel about having a certain attitude or for doing/not doing such and such.  Then I go home and completely forget about my resolve to change.  I rededicate my life, but where is the change?!?  This means that I have not truely repented.  Honestly, I'm scared to even think about the things that I need to repent about.  I think I've become cynical about my ability to change myself, my attitude, and my habits.  It's not that I don't have enough will power (although that may be a contributing cause), but it's more like I'm not desperate enough to want change yet.  I know that God doesn't ask any more of me than I am able to give, so I think I should start small.  First, off I think that my relationship with M  D definately could use some improvement.  I haven't been good lately about calling them every week--maybe because I feel like we don't have much to talk about and they don't seem thrilled to hear from me.  But, I noticed that when I don't call, they notice. As a step in the right direction, I'm going to call them--right now.
