It's got incredible special effects and a cool storyline.  Plus, it's got two hot guys in it, Jake Gylanhall and Austin Nichols, so...they would make ANY movie good! I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone!  So, get up from your computer, call up a few of your friends, and go see "The Day After Tomorrow"!  You won't regret it, I promise!  I wouldn't even mind going to see it again!
