I just said that she said she was going to stop, but she didn't because after she said she would stop I read her journal and I saw more stuff about me!  So then she has her stupid posse call me and IM me!  Wow, they are so cool!  Really, they need to get a life!  I know they have much better things to do!  It's funny how they think if they insult me it's going to hurt me or make me cry because that isn't true at all!  I could really care less!  I think it's funny that they decide to waste their precious time on me!  Then she replies to a comment I made in her journal, a comment that was not mean or bitchy at all!  Wow, you are so badass!  All of you!  And then they make a point to tell me that Vanessa hates me and that God hates me!  Ok, I could care less if Vanessa hates me because I'm not all that fond of her either!  And about God, ... God is fake!  Not real!  So thanks for telling me that this made up person hates me!  It really, hurts? Ummm ... I love how the comment was signed by Britney, Rachel, Vanessa, Joe, and Kyle!  Joe really has no room to talk shit about me because he's done some stupid shit in his time!  Let's tell Stefanie we like her because we think it will make Ashleigh jealous and make her want to come back to me!  Haha!  And Kyle, well I'm glad to know how he really feels about me!  I mean considering a couple of days ago he told me that he would still be my friend even if Ashleigh does hate me!  Well, I guess that all changed because Rachel hates me and Joe hates me and such!  He has to be "cool" like everyone else!   I watched A Clockwork Orange today and it was such an awesome movie!  Actually, it was really confusing because I wasn't really paying attention until the end because that's when I got sick of doing anything else!  There was blood and it made me sick!  And I saw a penis!  It was scary!  I don't like it, (( Lori Knows! ))!  But next weekend me and Ryan are going to watch it together and yeah, then he can help me understand it!  I think I missed the whole plot of the movie, and that could be a deffinate problemo!    Bye Bye!  The End!
