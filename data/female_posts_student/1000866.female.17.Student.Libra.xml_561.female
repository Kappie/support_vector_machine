I sort of completely forgot about concessions until today. I was in the middle of calling Peter to see if he wanted to do something and then my mom suddenly calls up the stairs, "you know we have to do concessions, right?" Yeah, so...oh well.   Tomorrow I think I'll try to do somehing with people. I should study too. I know I wont but I probably should.   Anyway, I'm exhausted and definitely ready to sleep.   Keep chasin' that rainbow.
