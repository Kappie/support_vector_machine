As predicted, Nima didn't call last night but whatever. I told him to call Jordan first anyway since Jordan was looking for him. I knew Jordan can be and is an asshole so I didn't want to put up with his rude and disturbing comments. "get the fuck off the phone with nima" wasn't exactly the nicest way to ask me to get off the phone with Nima when we weren't even on the phone to start with. His mom was using the phone on a long-distance call. Jordan has some pretty nice manners, doesn't he?  To be honest, I'm not too comfortable with the fact that Nima and Erica are "close". I  think  they are close again, not sure. He put her back in his "Important People" section of his MSN so yeah. I don't know... I'm just uncomfortable with it. Don't know why. He's got 11 people in his "Important People" list and 7 of them are girls. The remaining 4 are guys. How am I supposed to feel about that? No idea. Whatever.   Sometimes I get jealous of Alice even. I know, Alice is Nima's best friend and it's unreasonable to be jealous of her but still, it's natural... can't help it. I mean, earlier, when we went to the school and they played hockey, why did Nima have Alice's keys? She had pockets and stuff but why would he have them?   At times, I even wonder to myself why I liked Nima. Why did I like him if sometimes he bugs me so much? Why? But I guess it's all in the feelings I have toward him.  I'm seriously really worried about high school. I try to not think about it but I'm afraid of losing him. There are gonna be a lot of really nice and really pretty girls in his classes. What if one day he starts falling for one of them like he did for Sara and other people? I don't know... I'm just afraid of losing him.  Another thing, I've come to realize that through all these years, things have changed so much. I mean, when I first met Martin, he was the kid who hung out with Rachel a lot and the guy I kept pinching and kicking. As we grew up, he's now one of my best guy friends. I'm really grateful for having a friend like him.   Also, I was talking to Ingrid on the phone yesterday... she said that sometimes she can get pretty possessive. I wasn't sure what she meant by that and she was talking about our older friends at church. People like Jay, Will, etc. She felt possessive towards them because Katie and Erica now talk to them more and they all know Katie and Erica but don't talk to us that much anymore even though we met them first and stuff. Sure it may sound childish but I have to admit that sometimes I feel that way also. Especially towards Will Ng. He's someone that I love and look up to. He's always been like a big brother to me and I couldn't help but have felt a pang of jealousy when he told me he went to Swiss Chalet with Erica and Katie after softball and stuff. Ingrid felt the possessiveness towards Jay 'cos it was the "GUMMY BEAR TRIO" who started the whole poking thing and then now Katie and Erica took over again. I mean, Erica even macks on older guys! Being with Sam was really wrong in my opinion but I just kept quiet since she seemed happy with him. I mean, he's 4 years older! Grade 11 guys (Nathan and Wilfred) were already a little extreme for our age, but Sammo?! That was a little crazy.   Speaking of Wilfred, I couldn't help but really think this... I've been hiding this for a long time but I seriously have to admit that I loved him... I did not regret ever being with him and I miss him. He was special to me and he was so different. It's just this strange feeling... I don't know...  sigh...   Well Julie's still on vacation and when she's back I'll still be in Hong Kong. That sucks. Will said that maybe we could do something together sometime this summer but I don't know when. Hopefully we'll really end up doing it and spend some time together.   I'm really disappointed and sad that this happened between Erica and I but I guess all I can do is wait for something to happen and... get over it.
