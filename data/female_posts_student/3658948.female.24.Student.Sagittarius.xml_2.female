It's not that I don't like Republicans; in fact, I'm related to a few of them, and the ones I've met are pretty nice. It's just the really hard-core ones that scare me (Tom DeLay, Bush administration, Ann Coulter....blah blah blah), particularly the ones that refuse to hear dissent and really, really hate dirt-poor minorities like me.  Anyway, post when you find me (even if it's bad, but if you fuck up your spelling, expect to be made fun of), and come on back when you can.
