Different  I'm not like the other girls With shining locks and golden curls I don't paint my nail a bright red I don't have pink frills on my bed  I can't wear a skirt nor dress My room is always, always a mess Not sexy, not pretty, not smart Not very sweet, more or less tart  Sure...  I may have tiny slanted eyes And dark messy and stringy hair The kind that dreams and sighs Don't have the ideal figure of a pear  But I'm proud of who I am And nothing can change that [Not even anime]
