Now, I´m here and I am really enjoying myself so far. Oaxaca itself is actually quite pretty. A lot of the buildings are painted very bright colors, and there are bars over all the windows that look much more like decoration than protection. My apartment is right in the heart of the historical part (and therefore the most touristy part) of Oaxaca, but it also feels quite safe. There is a locked gate in order to get into the building, and then we are on the fourth floor. It is one of the tallest buildings I have seen so far, apart from churches, and the view from my bedroom window is amazing. We are completely surrounded mountains, and you can just see the tops of cathedrals jutting out above the trees, and everywhere is very lush and green. The weather is really quite bearable too. We dont even sleep with our windows open at night. There are really two reasons for this. First, there are supposedly a ton of mosquitoes here. I have yet to see one, but my roommate has lots of bites. Second, it cools down quite a bit, and by morning, I am usually a bit cold.  So far I have had two days of classes at a local language school to try to get back into speaking Spanish. So far I have not spoken any English, and Im already thinking in Spanish again. However, I have forgotten a lot of my vocabulary and still need a bit of a review.  I have been given my assignment for the year. I will be working with an organization called ¨Campo¨ which, roughly translated, means the country. This organization works with nearby villages to create and implement development plans. Its not exactly human rights, but I think it will be very interesting and fulfilling nonetheless. I think thats about it for now. Hast luego...
