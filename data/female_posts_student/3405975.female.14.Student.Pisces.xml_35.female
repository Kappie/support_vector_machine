And anyway, by changing the dislike to like, it might even make her classes seem interesting instead of boring. She never really did anything bad to me...(now then I realise) so there's really nothing about her that shud make dislike her... Maybe she's being too bossy or whatever,but everyone  DO  have some bad points about them. She's still a human afterall... And just like keep disliking her for no reason seems a bit childish 'cuz it's not as though she killed my faimly *touch wood* or harmed me in any way... Hmmmm... (looks at clockz) Time to bathe! With the rubber duck (quack quack!) =P  Ast  - When there's love, there's pain... So babe, can we just go through the pain first than the love? -
