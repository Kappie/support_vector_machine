We picked my cousin Jayce up on the way out to my grandma's so that was fun haven't seen her in a long while. I practiced for my Deep water upgrade (which is tomorrow) in the pool. I found a brick and treaded water with it for as long as i could, i think about a min or 2. Then i practiced my laps (not hard at all) and then my cousin Katy came back with my grandma from the beach and she helped me practice gave me a few pointers, helped me out a little. Then i layed around for a while worked on my tan for a bit, went back in the pool and played toothpaste with the little bros and cousin. Fun Fun Fun. Swimming is fun except now my eyes are like freakin burning. Had a good day, I'll write some more later tonight. SUMMERLAND tonight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
