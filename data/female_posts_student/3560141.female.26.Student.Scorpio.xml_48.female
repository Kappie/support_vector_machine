Oh yeah, what i really wanted to write about..well, my choice in using simple scenarios fit for reality tv to decide if I think this is all a dream has proven successful...  first..i thought there's no way we could hang out without other people, for longer than a day, without getting bored, irritated, or smothered...the pilot for this show is so appropriately named..."Life after Elimi-date, When there's just ONE"+++++Ratings were ****, easily...not just four asterisks, but four stars....fabulous city things, we did from Broadway to the Yankees, to NYU bars and cute restaurants and shopping...station executives predicted a good first season...good ratings were in the future...I was still skeptical..because...after the fairy dust lands, how does the fairy tale end? After the flames would there only be ashes?      second...i thought even with the fabulous could he share his personal space, and more importantly, could we share our personal space (i.e. our city...Miami), could we potentially just fall back into old habits of him taking me for granted and me creating drama which would end things abruptly...the premiere episode also appropriately titled, "CSIO - Miami - Can't Slide Into Old Miami)...On it's debut, well, ratings remained in the ****1/2  realm....stellar reviews from critics, for romancing me in a city I thought I already knew...sushi, saki bombs, champagne, within the first ten minutes of this hour long show...the climax (haha) was reached during the scene on his pier, the resolution left the viewing audience waiting for more, but had the season started and ended with its premiere episode?  Had they already reached a plateau in the first week?  Now...      thirdly....remove active agent causing disinhibition (alcohol),  remove almost all outside contact, never go anywhere where entertainment or food exceeds 50 bucks (i.e. fairy dust), introduce the dreaded "my friend's wedding" into the intinerary, and I was almost fearful of the show being cut from the Fall lineup on CBS opposite Friends...This episode was called "The Simple   Life"...without Nicole Richey and Paris...or the pink pick up truck...it was replaced by a gray Dodge DURANGO...kid can you say, "HEMI?"....without the bikini clad buxom bleached blondes, the studio execs were fearful of the show's staying power, would old fans appreciate the characters maturing so quickly, and would new fans be able to appreciate the sobriety of the whole episode?  Ratings shot into the ***** 5 asterisk range, with over one million viewers.  The simple life gave me time to appreciate him as a whole person, never at a loss for words or laughs and finally tears, "What every good TV drama should milk from its audience...", raves  Rolling Stone  The sex scenes did not lack luster or passion since being moved from it's premium cable to basic cable status...critics wondered would sex in the city be just as HOT....not a worry ladies and gentlemen...the scenes have greater weight when you can replay them over and over again without empty blanks in memory due to alcohol, it's like you Tivo'ed this episode....there were no rifts or dissent sensed among the characters, everything just flowed smoothly, and the scenes where they just looked at each other, and talked about the next episode, trying to keep the audience guessing as to whether to expect a SEASON or SERIES finale...were amazing....altogether the best episode yet...I can't wait to see how this show holds up in the Fall lineup on CBS against "Friends."....With over one million viewers thus far this season...wonder if we could get some sponsors...some other investors who believe in the success of this show????
