       
      Nige, Nimo and Ryan Debbiny just left my house.  If anything, it's the spirit of summer. Or just spirit, period. I don't know what turns it on but it becomes a profound appreciation of the people you're with and just good times. I don't think I'll look at any of them again in the same way.   It's satisfaction. It's laughing and talking that just goes and goes and goes. I don't know how else to describe it.
