I understand how  technically  it would be violating free speech, and I know that if they made an exception about that then the whole U.S. government would go up in flames. But that's why it's disturbing. A society built upon who-knows-exactly-what that sees  porn (of all things)  as a part of freedom of speech. But I guess that's justice in some way or form. Thank goodness no one actually reads this because I don't understand half of the things that go on in the news. Well, I do understand all of it, but not on the level that I need to for Extemporaneous speaking. I understand it but I approach it in completely the wrong way--I approach it morally instead of analytically which makes me even worse at extemp. So that goes for one of my faults...Maybe I'll make a list. Didn't someone once say that as soon as you recognize your faults, you can address them; once you address them, you can overcome them? Or not...but it makes sense to a certain degree (I think...) Ok, so that's another one of my faults--I'm indecisive when it comes to things that I don't want to feel stupid about.  So here it goes (so far for today):  1. I address things morally instead of analytically 2. I am indecisive for fear of sounding stupid/uniformed 3. I am so shy that I can't even answer the phone/talk on the phone  By the way... Here's the address for the article that I was talking about (for some reason the link wasn't working): www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/29/scotus.web.indecency/index.html
