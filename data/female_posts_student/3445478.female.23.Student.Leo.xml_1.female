Austin (Nick's future uncle) tickled Nick's cheek and it made him smile so huge and even "talk!!!" Nick mostly slept during his 1st fire so he seemed to enjoy it. Shawn installed our carpet in the living room yesterday and it looks and feels like HOME! The carpet brightens up the place and draws you into the livingroom. Shawn did an amazing job =) Right now he  Nick are rocking on our rocking chair. Nick's eyes are rolling into the back of his head. They look precious together. I can't believe how much I am going to miss Shawn. He has been Super*Dad to Nick lately and the best husband. I LOVE having him home.
