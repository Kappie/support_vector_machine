So my day with deux and Kelsey and Devon was mediocre. I'll just give you a run down of the events: we ate Mexican((yah)), we saw Mona Lisa smile((gag me with a jagged spoon and feed it back to me)), we went to the park and took pictures((I'm the prettiest one)), I found out mompat pitched in for my guitar((I have to like her from now on)) ((mammaw says she's trying to redeem herself)), daddy told me he wasn't a deadbeat and he didn't ruin Christmas and he HAS paid child support THROUGH January and mom was a crazy bitch, I told mom this and she had a cow and called him and screamed at him, he hung up, and now I think I can relax. They've been arguing about child supports a ton the last few months... Stress stress stress.  Katatonia is cool. No, not catatonia((lol))  Everyone on my buddylist has thier away message on, I need to find more friends.
