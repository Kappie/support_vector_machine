I feel a little bit sick at the moment - freakin out in a rather large way as I havent studied one little bit for the exam 2moro and I'm suddenly come the the realisation that I have to rote learn at least 18 lectures by 2pm 2moro! Freakin heck i dont like exams for easy units that are worth what yes 80% of the entire unit !@#$%  Easy units confuse you well actually lull u into a feeling of well 'I know this crap its all common sense' - but when forced to regurgitate it to interestingly written questions - it all goes pair shaped. Ok I had better get back to it - the good thing about 2moro is that i get to try on a couple of dresses because I am going to be a bridesmaid in October! aargh
