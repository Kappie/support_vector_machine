I didnt find anything that i really liked today, jeans, thats all i wear so i went into wetseal.....its sooo colorful, i always feel weird in that store, cuz well i wear black and stuff but nothing compared to what francesca wears lol, i remember going into wetseal with her and it was just like she was this dark object in the middle of all this color. lol but anyway, tomarrow theres this new series coming on called 'The Days' it looks good from the previews, if anyone wants to watch it comes on Sunday at 10 on like, ABC or one of those channles. I will be watching degrassi again (the new one) because, i seem to understand things the second time around lol. Plus i didn't get to watch My So-Called Life yesterday. Tomarrow i have to go to a cookout accross the street. I dont wanna go but oh well,i'll live. I'm trying to act happy now, i read somewhere if you act happy eventually you will be happy..........i dont know if thats true or not yet but what the heck. I met a guy in the bookstore looking up psycology or something and we started talking about new age and how he probably wont find anything in that section, he was actually pretty cute. lol   Ok so i was reading this article in Twist Magazine how Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are at it again....so anyone who has a blog this question is for you: Lindsay L. or Hilary Duff?.......i heard from deidra hil was a bitch to her aunt, long story, and Lindsay L. just looks like a bitch so, im torn lol........ooooh or how bout Ryan Key or Sean Mackin...or Ben Harper?...that ones tough!    im seriously losingit. Go Emma Go Emma,,she kicked alex's A$$$$$$$ that was just tooooo good, i just need to watch it over again. Alex is a bitch so i dont blame lil miss emma kicking some booty,,,its about time the girls brought out the claws on that show. ok well, Renee, have fun at BAND CAMP!! dont be playin around with that flute of yours now lol j/k. hehe.
