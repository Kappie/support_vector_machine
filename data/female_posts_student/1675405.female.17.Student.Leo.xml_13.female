Which is better: a friend who you are close and intimate with, or a friend that you simply kick back and enjoy life with? Marie and I are cool actually however. We're getting closer I suppose. Her and her boyfriend, John, are pretty good together. I wouldn't know from experience, but hey, somethings you don't need experience to make a decision.   I've been having a lot of fun with Aaron and Jessica in our saxophone squad for marching band. I find myself laughing all too often at the small insignificant things, but I'm ahead for doing so. Because it's better to laugh at everything than to laugh at nothing. That's for sure.
