Meeting my boyfriend's eyes, smiling the smile we unknowingly reserve for each other, and returning to our own activities without saying a word.  The sound of Lorraine, Levi, Carrie, Susan, Mom, Dave, Jen laughing after they've surprised themselves with their own humor.  Watching the sun rise while writing morning pages.  Passion-induced cat naps.  Balancing the book and cup of hot tea while sitting comfortably in the bowl chair with my feet on the futon.  Finding a favorite place for the first time.  Walking into and out of the law school building.  Snuggling into my old bed in the basement.  Waking up in my bed next to the highway.
