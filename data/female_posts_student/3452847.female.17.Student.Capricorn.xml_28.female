Was that on purpose or what? But he didn't seem to notice it... Why the fuck have your ex girlfriends picture out? Why text her twice whilst seeing your new girlfriend wanting sex? Why not go to your girlfriend? Or someone random, not your ex!!! Makes me wonder what he feels or if he is hiding something, he didn't seem happy, or content, why when today they have been together 3 weeks and he has already cheated! GRRRRRRRRR Makes me angry as now i feel confused about him, makes me want him but makes me not trust him, and i can't concentrate and i have it on my mind constantly. Fucking tosspot, well i emailed him..  "but that's because i think your a wicked person, and unfortunately not everyone can see it, which is a shame becausepeople miss out on seeing whata funky person you are, and alsothen people could understand why i still think your worth it."  Just an extract of it... Sure i'll be posting more often now, Mum thinks i need to cut him out completly, but i just don't feel i can do it...  ~Lisa~
