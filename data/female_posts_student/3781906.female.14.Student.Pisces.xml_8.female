I;m going to a waterpark tomorrow with my friend Jessica, so hopefully I'm feeling better by then.  Between trips to the bathroom, I was able to get quite a bit of my story done. A very good thing! Now, I'm working on was little editing I am capable of. My plan is to have chapters 9-12 up sometime in the next week. How many of you think it isn't going to happen? *Huff's hand goes up* Well... You're wrong. *Slaps him acrossed the face with a dead fish*
