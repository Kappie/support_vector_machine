But, you will never know the truth, MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!   The pitch black consumed me as horrific laughter pinned my feet to the floor.  There was no escape.  I was trapped.  ***** 	An enormous sign loomed overhead, beckoning us to enter “The Circus,” just one of the many lands residing in Crazy Mike’s Adventure World.  The thrill of being 11 and at Saskatchewan’s finest miniature amusement park clouded my judgement, and with such distractions, I became reckless.  	My sister and I entered “The Circus” ready to face any ride that Crazy Mike could toss our way.  All day we rode stomach-churning rides, stuffed ourselves to the point that we resembled the blueberry girl in Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and embraced the pure joy of having no parental supervision.                With only ½ an hour left until we had to be home, we made a break for the ride with the shortest line.  “The Fun House” stood a menacing 9 stories tall, fully equipped with a gigantic blinking neon clown face.  I guess my excitement couldn’t hide my sheer and utter fear because it was at that moment that my sister remembered that I was terrified of clowns.  She assured me that it was a fun house and that there wouldn’t be any clowns in there.  Trusting that my sister would never lead me astray, I gritted my teeth like I was preparing to crawl into a clown car, and entered “The Fun House”.  Not even 2 feet across the threshold and I was bombarded with clown memorabilia.  Everywhere I looked I saw Pennywise’s cold eyes bearing down at me, and pictures of that damn clown from Poltergeist.  My sister pushed me further into the supposed ‘fun house’.  “Close you’re eyes or something.  The ride starts just up here.”  She ushered me to a man, 60 years my senior, who resembled the cantaloupe that I had once tried to dehydrate as a child.  “Come sit here, Sweetheart, and we’ll strap you in… nice and tight.” He said as he buckled my safety belt, his voice coming out as a matchstick rasp.           The ride started, shooting my sister and I forward into a pitch-black tunnel.  We sped faster and faster, the tunnel still unlit.  The air surged past us, until we slammed to a screeching stop.  I silently thanked the creepy old man for tying us in so tight while my sister howled in the pain of her knees hitting the front of the cart. As we attempted to collect ourselves from the shock of our sudden stop, we came to the conclusion that the ride wasn’t about to start up again.  We felt our way out of the medieval roller coaster cart, fumbling with the safety belts the entire time.  We stumbled around in the dark, hopelessly trying to get our bearings.  We decided that seeing as we were in a building, any direction chosen was bound to lead somewhere.  We headed off, but after walking for a few minutes in the monotonous black, I was startled to realize that my sister was telling me to shut up.   “What?”  I asked her, slightly irritated at her for being so rude.   “Stop breathing like that, you ape.  You sound like a freaking chain smoker.” “What the hell are you talking about?”  I hissed at her, now fully pissed off at her false allegation.  “I’m not breathing like anything…  And you’re the ape.”  “You’re such a little— Oh…” She trailed off, as we both realized that we weren’t as alone as we had thought.  The dark was suddenly filled with malicious, deranged laughter that seemed to echo off every wall.  I felt my sister take off at a nothing less than a sprint, and I logically followed suit.  As we ran for our lives, the lights flickered on.  Terrified and suffering the equivalent of snow blindness, we crashed into the old man standing at the doorway to outside.   “What are you girls doing out of the ride?  What happened?”  We began to relay our terrifying adventure to him.  How the car had stopped, how we had assumed that it was a clown trying to kill us, and finally, the laughter.  His expression grew increasingly more concerned as we listed off the wrong happenings.  Our temporary relief faded when he questioned us about the laughter we had heard.  My sister was trying to explain the horrific sound when the double doors behind the man swung open to reveal a blood stained clown holding a butcher’s knife, laughing the laugh that had nearly given me a heart attack not even 2 minutes earlier.  My sister screamed and I nearly passed out, but the old man just laughed.  I was more shocked at his reaction than at the clown. He winked at me and continued to laugh as I stared at him in horror.  “That’s Chuckles the clown.  Or should I say robot.  He’s a prop for the ride.”
