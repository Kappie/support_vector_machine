Sympathy   Stranger than your sympathy. This is my apology. I'm killing myself from the inside out. All my fears have pushed you out. I wish for things that I don't need. All I wanted. And what I chase won't set me free. All I wanted. And I get scared but I'm not crawling on my knees. Oh yeah everything's all wrong yeah. Everything's all wrong yeah. Where the hell did I think I was. Stranger than your sympathy. I take these things so I don't feel. I'm killing myself form the inside out. Now my head's been filled with doubt. It's hard to lead the life you choose. All I wanted. When all your luck's run out on you. All I wanted. You can't see when all your dreams are coming true. Oh yeah it's easy to forget yeah. You choke on the regrets yeah. Who the hell did I think I was. Stranger than your sympathy. All these thoughts you stole form me. I'm not sure where I belong. Nowhere's home and I'm all wrong. And I wasn't all the things. I tried to make believe I was. And I wouldn't be the one to kneel. Before the dreams I wanted. And all the talk and all the lies. Were all the empty things disguised as me. Yeah stranger than your sympathy stranger than your sympathy.
