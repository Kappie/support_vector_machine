I was over at their house a few days ago, and Val gave me the card for an executive chairperson or something for the Snohomish County pagent. If i called her, and even just helped out at the pagent, apparently I'd get to know these top people, for like theater and stuff. Part of me says, oh my gosh! that's awsome, if you know these people, you can do what you REALLY want to do- but the other part of me says, this is too good to be true, it's weird, i'm not a pagent person. So... now i'm faced w/ the dellema. Do I call, or not? I can't make up my mind, help, please!  -Ali
