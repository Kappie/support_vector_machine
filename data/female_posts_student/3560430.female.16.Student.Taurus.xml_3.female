Rogers videos is taking applications now, so I've printed up the old resum√© and am ready to get to it. Rogers video can't be as hard as catering was, not to mention it is a whole lot closer at hand. I have two around me that are rather close. I wonder when my shifts would be??? They can't be too close together. I hope that I get the one that's close to the mall, that would be really nice because if I had to go to work right after school I could easily bus it over. Or even walk if it wasn't too hot, too cold or raining (I have very specific requirements for outdoor exercise.) It would be nice to have a pay check though... SHIT I need a sin number! I forgot about that... And a bank account would be nice. Ok I have some things to do before I get hired. I will get hired, I'm a great interview. Plus I'm honest. It'll be nice to get a pay check though... Very nice.   Well I'd best think this over.   My mom's watching another one of her pathetic, none-real shows that were possibly popular in the early nineties. I need to talk to my bethie, I've got to annoy her before she gets too heavily into studying for History. Poor stupid Bethie taking that poor excuse of a course called history, BAD CHOICE! Nobody cares about the very slim amount of time that the board considers history. I mean it is history, but trust me there is a lot more of it, and that is way more interesting.   Well I'm off a running now. Maybe I'll post later. I'm only really posting now because I'm prolonging the event of me cleaning my room... Scary thought.
