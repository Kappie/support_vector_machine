I used to be her friend, until I got sick of her crap and she showed my kid brother porn when I told her not to, and even when he said he didn't want to see. What a great friend. She did apologize, but she starts so much crap that I'm not one to forgive her that easily. She told Dave that she had changed and accepted Jesus into her life to help lead her way, but that's just a load of bull. I caught her lighting up at the bus stop after I was dropped off. Way to be Linz, breaking the law. Fyi, being seventeen does not mean you can do whatever you want. She harasses people, does drugs, drinks, gossips, and sleeps around. She breaks numerous rules (both at home and at school), goofs off constantly, lies, and gossips. Did I mention she gossips? She tries to fit in, and that's about it. She's not worth another minute of my time. I try to surround myself with generally good people, and she is, was, and never will be someone I want to be around.  Here's to you, bioch.
