There was just too much laughter and too much food. One thing that was a killer was the ribs cooked in a crock pot. The best!!!! So tender and juicy. Maybe a little bit better than Andrew's juicy juicy mango. Sorry drew, it was really that good. What else did we have, Oh yeah,BBQ chicken cooked by Donna was excellent, very tender as well... Potato salads,heese bread,baked beans and corn. Delicious...yum yum. Finished off with strawberries on cookies and cream ice-cream. Double yum! hmmm if i do not start my summer training, I am going to be  miss big mama  by mid summer! My summer....well, still waiting to hear about my job at an italian style sandwich store,Panzella...can't remember the exact name just yet.
