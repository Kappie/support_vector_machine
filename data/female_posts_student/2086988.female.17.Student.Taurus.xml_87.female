Well, my stomach's still bothering me a bit, but I'm not going to let in ruin anything, it's not as bad as it was, so maybe it'll go away. So a little over 24 hours to go, woo! I hope we get there early enough so I can still see David, but I don't know, my sis was like, it'll probably be around midnight. So I dunno. Yay, time to pack! Great, now if I had any actual decent clothes...Well they're nice looking, just not on me! =p    Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game  On this endless ocean finally lovers know no shame  Turning and returning to some secret place inside  Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say   Take my breath away
