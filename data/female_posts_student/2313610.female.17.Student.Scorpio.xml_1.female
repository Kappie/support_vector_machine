A bit of background information maybe... I'm 16 years old in my junior year of high school, and I'm in the academic decathlon... Part of my problems... And in a bunch of advanced problems... Another part of my problems... I live in Arizona, and I love books, writing books, mythology and roleplaying, and swimming.  I really don't know what else to add for that so I'll just take things as they come. Now to talk about my problems, which everyone does in their journals.  I'll start with school. Like I said, I'm in Academic Decathlon, and it seems to sap away my life. I have ten subjects to study for, and I have my first scrimmage in three weeks. My teacher wants me to work really hard, so I can be on the team --he has an odd sense of faith in me-- and I don't want to let him down, but I'm starting to feel the strain of it all. I'm getting migraines again, and I'll have to give up all caffeine for the next month or so, since they help cause my headaches. I'm also in AP US History with possibly the coolest teacher ever. But Decathlon is causing my grades to slip in that class, and I really hate it. I can't afford to miss another assignment in that class for the rest of the semester. Then there are my trouble classes, which are math and English. Math is a given, I hate math, and I really suck at it, and it shows. However,  I should be doing great in English, but I hate my toad-like teacher and I hate the books and I hate the class all together, so I'm not doing well. Then there's Spanish, which is in a word easy. I have no trouble there.  School is only part of the issue though. There's of course the stupid guys in my life, who never cease to make me miserable. I have an ex-boyfriend, who is a freshman in college and is now going out with a freshman in high school, I think he does that to make me jealous, but it only makes me regret going out with him more. Then there's a guy in Chicago that I'm in love with and he, of course, isn't in love with me... Jackass... I'm trying to get over him, unsuccessfully. Then there's my friend from North Carolina, whom is only a friend to me, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't see it that way. Then there's a guy in my own school that I actually like, but he isn't interested.... Figures doesn't it?  Then there's the whole friends thing. I have five people I trust implicitly,a nd the rest are just crap that I hang out with. My best friend or now I guess exbestfriend has been lying and cheating and screwing me over since day one of our friendship, and she doesn't realize that I know, so she tries to bully me and make me feel bad when I lie to spare her feelings, which is complete crap! It drives me insane... I don't want to talk about the rest of my friend issues today...  Of course I have family issues. I have a sister who's a complete bitch, and a father who's a stupid ass who doesn't realize that we need a car to get around, so while he frolics around the country I can't even leave my house.  So yah... Life sucks doesn't it? But it's mine and I'll just live with it I suppose... Sorry for ranting, but no one want to listen to me,and I need someone to tell...
