Sra Wood called me this morning and woke me up wondering if I wanted to babysit.  Its a Saturday night which isnt my favorite time to babysit but its nice having some extra dough.  So yeah this week has been quiet.  I want to call someone but there's nothing to do and we would just end up being bored together.  I wonder if there's anything on TV....  O what an interesting life I lead.
