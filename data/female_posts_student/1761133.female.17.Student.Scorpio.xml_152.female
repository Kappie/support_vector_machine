There were four pairs of us modeling wedding clothes, cause in a Cambodian wedding you have to change alot. But we only showed off four of them. I got to wear the final outfit. Oh, and my partner was my broher. This was my day...(all times are approximate)  3:00 AM- Woke up and took a shower. After the shower I got dressed (duh) 3:30 AM- We went to this persons house (they provided the clothes and accessories). When I got there three of the girls were there. One was having her hair done, the other looked dead. My      hair was wet, so someone had to blowdry it. 4:00 AM- It was my turn to do my hair  5:00 AM- My hair is done, so we went home (my brother and I) 5:30 AM- Go to the sectional and pull out the recliner. I had to sleep sitting up cause of my up-do. I couldn't fall asleep either. I just kind of sat there with my eyes shut, listening to all the birds outside spaz about morning. 10:00 AM- Wake up, went to my room got some shoes and make-up 10:10 AM- Arrived at the temple. We went in and sat there for two hours while they were praying 12:00 PM- Met up with the others   Somewhere between that time and 3:00 PM I ate, put on make-up, watched everyone get dressed, then me finally getting dressed. I also took pics with the fam. Then at 4:00 PM, we all just kinda of hung outside and ate somemore, and listen to people talk, dance, and play instruments. Then at 5:00 PM ish it was finally our turn to go up and model the clothes. Then after that we took a shitload of pictures (Someday I will have them on devArt!) Then at who knows what time we finally changed. Then we walked around. Then I sat and ate somemore. Then I left to go change again for a party (I wore my corset and a skirt) Then at 9:00 PM I finally leave for the party. We got there, and I danced a little. Then we went home at 11:00 PM. Then I put my pjs on, tried to take every frickin bobby pin out of my hair (I swear there were more then a 100 in my hair), brushed it, tied it up, then went to brush my teeth, and went to bed.
