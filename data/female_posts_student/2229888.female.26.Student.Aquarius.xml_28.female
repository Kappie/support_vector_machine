I just don't understand how my mom thinks it is all so trivial!   if I am one day blessed enough to have a husband who loves me and children who adore me, and who i can love and adore, i will count myself the luckiest woman alive . . . it scares me to hope for such things in a world where these hopes are dashed everyday, and i confess, that it seems an unlikely prospect, but that makes it all the more valuble . . .  Why others don't see this, i'll never know . . . do you understand what i mean??? or am i just kerrrr-razy! lol
