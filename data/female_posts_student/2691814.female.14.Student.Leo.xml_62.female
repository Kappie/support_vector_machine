But....he wants things so badly and nags my parents for it and its so annoying because i don't ask for anything...except to maybe see my friends or go to the mall or bookstore. HMMM....leprechaun lol a TALL leprechaun. i can't get over that lol. its so funny...he had like red hair and a shamrock on his shirt. lol  Something is up with gabby and ralph. Not that i care about ralph...i can't stand him but something is wrong with gabby. She's acting differently. Yesterday i asked her if she wanted to see what alla the guys were doin accross the street and There ralph is standing like a body guard and said'me and gabs are hanging out'  i'll post more about this later. But josh keith and david just got back.....isn't it sad how i hang out with guys younger than me?.....well josh is 13 but still.
