Add the onion and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tender - about 7 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme, and basil and stir until fragrant. Add the tomatoes, broth, honey, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until reduced by a quarter - approx. 15-20 minutes. Puree in blender - BE CAREFUL as soup will be extremely hot and has a tendency to go everywhere if you're not looking. Return to pot and add cream. Heat gently and adjust seasonings. Good with soft French bread or grilled cheese sandwiches.  I love this recipe.  I love homemade soup on a cold and dreary day.  Yum.  Recipe from  urlLink Fine Cooking
