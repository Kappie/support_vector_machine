She just leaned her head over and chomped onto my arm.  So now I have a baby-hickey on my arm.  I told little Alison she needs to keep her mouth to herself.  I was like, that's not a boob, you realize this, right? Anyway. I bought 3 textbooks today.  I still have 2 more to buy, they are the more expensive ones.  Is it bad to have the first chapter read before class begins?  My comparative book is looking really good to me.  Or, I could start on the mountain of paperwork I have acquired from my recent trip to Omaha NE.  Yeah.  He sent me something like 6 articles.  I think I used a whole ream of paper printing them off (thank the lord for school, where I sneak usage out of the grad students printer...). I have an hour until work.  Hmmm... I suppose I should work on some of the articles for Dr. M.  Filing is sort of automatic you know?  Mindless drone work. I think I will listen to  urlLink this  work of genious while doing some of that.  "One thing" is my new favorite song.
