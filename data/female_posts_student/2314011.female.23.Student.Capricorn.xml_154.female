Our esteemed Torts professor (looking every bit the 2nd grade school teacher this morning) raffled off the heartwarming story of the courageous teenage boy, who, after being gravely injured while using a farm machine, takes on its powerful manufacturer and wins, to the class members who donated blood yesterday.  "What if you tried, but the flow stopped?"  I asked from the pews.  "Wellll..."  she waffled.    "I have the bruise to prove it!  I have a physical impact!"  I argued effectively, using her own concepts against her.  "Oh, if you have a bruise, you're in!"  "Damn right I am!"  And wouldn't you know it, the one person in the pool who didn't  actually  give blood walked away with the prize.    Balance is our friend, especially when it's slanted substantially in your favor.
