And now the poor baby is bitching cause he wants us to stop.  Get over it.  I just don't get it.  When did we get so old that we wanted to set aside fun for work?  I swear to God.  I watched Nip/Tuck last night and part of the story line was all about getting older and what you can do so that physically you don't look it.  I could kind of care less about the physical aspect of growing up, I don't necessarily give a shit about looking older since most of my friends are far older than me anyway.  But I do care about acting older.  I don't like the responsibility of it all and I certainly don't like the opportunity to have less fun and when we do have it our willingness to set it aside for more grown up matters.  Maybe I have a Peter Pan complex.  Maybe I'm just too scared to grow up for fear of finding out my life was meant for very little... I don't know.  But since I am on such a philosophical kick right now I will add once again this one little insight... Jeff is a tool.
