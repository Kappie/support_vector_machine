He died of cocaine and heroin toxicity.  He fucking overdosed on heroin and coke.  We all spent all these last few months trying to rack our brains on how he could have done this.  How he was supposed to be helping his other friend  kick  his heroin habbit and he himself was doing it.  Tonight is not going to be easy at home.
