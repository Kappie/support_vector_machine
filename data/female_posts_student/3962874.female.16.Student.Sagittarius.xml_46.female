She straightens her hair to a pin so it looks pretty cute but im just not used to the bangs, its wierd! Oh yeah jenny got the same hair cut also. I remember when everyone used to want to be matching all the time, gross. Dad went camping with Ann to Neah Bay and I have no idea when they are going to come back. They didn't even tell me they were leaving jeez I am way out of the loop over here.
