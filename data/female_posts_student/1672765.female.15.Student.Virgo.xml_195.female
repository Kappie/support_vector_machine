Honestly, before I wasn't looking foward to summer that much but it's looker more and more worthwhile. Aye yi yi. What's up with Tom Sawyer? He's so stupid! Why is he making Jim and Huck do all this stupid stuff instead of just getting Jim free in a day? What's the point? What's up with all this, "It's not regular" garbage. What could have been summed up in about 5 pages is drawning onto a hundred. Honestly.  I liked the book a whole lot but now that I have to read 90 pages in one night along with the essay we've been working on all semester - redoing half of it - answering the stupid questions on the thousand pages we have to read (okay, just 90 but it seems like way more to a slow reader), my stupid latin translation which I might just blow off alltogether, then I had to do this entire SOL practice test for Algebra II. That just takes the piss. But I answered letters that looked nice..."C for Curtis, D for Danzig, A for Adam, C for Carson, D for Davey" and so forth and so on.   I am on page 267 and still have to get to 293 so I've done a whole lot of reading but still.   I love to read,  Unless I have to.    As I procrastinate further so I'll be up all night with my homework I thought I'd write about something funny that happened just a little while ago as I sat down to write up this whiney rant on my homework.  My sister comes in all shocked asking if I smoked. I was like surprised, I don't believe in that at all but maybe I seem like the type of person who would smoke? I don't know. I don't know how I seem to anybody (barely myself). Then I remembered fourth period today when David said he was going to tell my dad I smoked. But he wasn't serious or anything. So I said, "Have you talked to David?" And when I said it it was like I was surprised because the thought just came to me - I just remembered 4th period and knew that had to be what she was talking about. Naturally my surprise was taken to the wrong way, she probably thought I was caught smoking by him. Hahah.  Man. So she was saying how it smelled like cigarettes outside the bathroom (which is right outside my room) (nobody in my family smokes). So I went out and I didn't smell anything.  I told her that I think  she's  smoking something, but it isn't cigarettes.  I better get to work...    Music: Armaggedon - Alkaline Trio
