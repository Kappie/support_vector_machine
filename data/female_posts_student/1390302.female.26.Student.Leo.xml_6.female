Having to describe the most significant experience in my life, I apply those four little words –better late than never.  In considering a life-changing event on which to write, returning to school has been inescapable.  While there have been many things in my life I consider life changing, going back to school is the most significant to the remainder of my years.  In my days to come, the education I will receive will be key to achieving the goals I have set forth for myself, in pursuit of a career as a novelist.  After graduating high school in the summer of 1996, I immediately began attending Victor Valley Junior College, in Victorville, California.  The fall 1996 semester found me half-heartedly seeking a college education I had little or no interest in pursuing.  At the request, and near insistence, of my parents I was reluctantly attending college.  They had agreed to pay for my tuition, fees, and books, as well as allowing me to remain living under their roof at no charge.  I think at this point I should say that as I had no interest in going to college, nor did I have any interest in undertaking any other productive venture.    Going to class when it was a convenient distraction or I had nothing better to do, I barely passed the first semester of college.  I continued to attend and continued to shirk my educational responsibilities never considering the financial investment my education was to my mother and father.  Then, in the fall of 1997, I began planning my wedding.  I was 19 years old and getting married, which left very little time for my schoolwork.  July 18, 1998 brought the happy –or not so happy- day, and by 6:00 pm I was Mrs. Michael Knight.  His lack of support for my education and my waning interest in attending college brought an eventual end to my sad college career not even two years after it began.  In those two years I had managed to earn less than 12 credits, my education had been going nowhere fast for a very long time.  Mike was a university student at the University of California at San Bernardino and his education proved to be more important than mine.  Dropping out of college and becoming a not so happy homemaker, I did not even look back at what I had lost in dropping out of college, nor did I care to. After a very rocky marriage, Michael and I divorced in June of 1999, ending an unhappy 11-month marriage.  Not long after filing for my divorce from Mike –which takes six months to complete in California- I met Matt.  Moving to Texas in late summer 1999 I started a relationship with Matt.  My divorce from Mike was final on January 16, 2000 and I married  Matt on February 14, 2000.    The consummate learner, Matt had decided to go back to school just before we married.  Following in his decision, I too decided to return to school. Giving school another shot after having dropped out the year before.  Matthew and I both began attending Texas State Technical College at Waco.  All was well for about one semester before I decided to call it quits yet again.  Matt was always supportive of whatever choices I decided to make, though he stayed in school.  For several long years I went to school on and off before I quit all together in the spring of 2002.    In May of 2003 I looked at my life, the fact that it had gone nearly nowhere and the weighing fact that I was about to turn 25 years old. I decided that it was finally time for me to do something to better my life.   With a knack for creative writing, but very poor grammar skills, I decided to go back to school to become a writer.  During my time away from school I had begun taking part in an online writing group.  This experience, coupled with my drive to return to school, and my husband Matt’s support for my education, I returned to school at McLennan Community College in the summer of 2003. I have been attending McLennan Community College ever since.  I have remained in school for the past year, this summer semester marking a very important milestone in my life, my ability to stay in school.  I have also been accepted to the English program at Tarleton State University.  With my dreams of becoming a writer just around the corner, my drive to learn and become educated has increased phenomenally.    School has become a very important part of my life and will continue to be until I have finished my Bachelors degree.  My past struggle with school and my driving goal in life, coupled with my newfound extreme drive to learn, have made me understand that I have weathered a very important turning point in my life.  Going back to school has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. For years to come I will always regard this time in my life as most beneficial test of my limits and self-worth I have ever successfully passed.  While I will never claim that it has not been difficult, I am willing to wager that every hurdle has been worth twice it height in experience, experience that I would never trade.  Experience that I have found is better late than never.
