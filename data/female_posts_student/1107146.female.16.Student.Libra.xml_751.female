I really don't want to sleep, is what...you know? I'm really tired and I think I'm going to die man, but it's just not in my card for me to go to bed yet. It's an odd, paradoxical feeling I thought I would share.  Anyway, my head is also buzzing with Arizona Raspberry Iced Tea (beats Peach Tea by a long shot...surprise!), which is manufactured in NYC, strangely. And also buzzing with Chester and his performance of  A Place For My Head . Seriously, palpatations, convulsions, spasms, laughing at the top of my lungs for about three hours since. My chest snapped as it constricted with Chester's awesomeness.  And dudes, what better, they're coming next month. I'm going, I asked Abby (kind of afraid of the pit...this is  a  pit, man, a real damn pit), we should all go. Damn, that would be slick. We would seriously all join the pit and get our asses kicked and love it. POD (big woop), Hoobastank (eh) and Story of the Year (who?) are opening. Damnit, I am excited. I should have never taken that CD when my dad put it in my hands. It's just too damn much. I haven't been this excited over music since I acquired my first old Metallica and wrote my first halfway-plausible song. It's that heavy. I'm going to shut up now, maybe it's the tea.  I'm going to bed, I think. Please forgive whatever the hell I said here, not even I know. I was needing myself to type some of the caffeine away. Farewell til Sunday.
