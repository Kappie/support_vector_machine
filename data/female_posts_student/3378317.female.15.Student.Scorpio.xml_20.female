YOU didnt get me in trouble. i got myself in trouble. maybe i shouldve called later when i was done.   damn, but i had to call.  shit happens, what are you gonna do.  shit i am never gonna tell my mom "a lie" or so she thought about whoever is on the phone again. i'd rather just say who it is straight up.  damn, i feel so bad. i mean, it wasnt that bad. but like, shit after she called me to her room and yelled. fck.       out.  noor
