We went to the ceremony, but they hold their's in an autitorium, and it can't hold all the people for the ceremony, so each child gets four tickets for people to invite in the audiorium, and the rest of the people sit in the cafeteria, where they wire in audio, and video for us.  My aunt from ND, my grandma and I sat out there.  That as one of the longest graduations ever, it lasted 2 1/2 hours.  The diploma presentation took 1hr and 15mins alone.  I liked it though.  I realy wish I went to their school.  People are allowed to go beyond what the entire rest of the class wants to do. (which in our case is absolutely nothing, well except drugs and each other.) Last night I had this crazy dream.  I drempt that my cousin Xenith was taking me to my dad's seed plant, and for some reason he knew the way better than me.  As we were entering the forest we had to go through, he changed into some sort of mouse (of rat size) and ran off into the forest.  The kanagaroo I was riding couldn't keep up, and had a lot of trouble with the steep hills, so we lost him, and he ran off into a nearby field.  When I looked to the side I had arrived at my dad's seed plant.  Now if I couldn't figure out what the dream meant that I had two days ago. There is no possible way I'm going to figure this one out.     Today is the final of packing for the Ukraine, we leave tomorrow morning after church.  I'm really looking foreward to it too.  It takes 24 straight hours of traveling to get to the town we're staying in.  After all the flights we had a 6 hour van ride from Budapest, and when crossing the border into Ukraine it's possible they'll try to take our stuff from us.  They didn't get anything taken last time, but sometimes the guards have to be bribed to let us through with all our stuff.  It's a little diferent than inter United States travel.  I had best get going, we still have a lot of packing to do, but I will talk more later.  I'm pretty sure at least.  I don't know if I'll be able to blog over there, we'll see.  Miss and Love you all.
