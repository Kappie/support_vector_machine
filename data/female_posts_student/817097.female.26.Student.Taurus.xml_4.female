Tomorrow is my last competancy of graduate school.  Comps are really just exams, but rather than writing answers down on a sheet of paper, you show a prof a skill.  Talk about a stressful situation.  The skill is usually a huge mystery until you draw a card and thus seal your fate.  It's stressful to put it nicely.  Got my feedback from my students.....had one tell me that I should be more approachable.  That's an interesting comment.  I've spent the majority of my adult life striving to be unapproachable.  I think that is the result of growing up an "Air Force brat" - forming connections with another is useless because they usually leave within a year or two.  I suppose I could work on that, but now isn't the time.......  Word of the day:  zavezan - tied up......interesting word choice for today...  Geez....it sounds like I could use a good shot of vodka, some chocolate ice cream and a good therapy session......
