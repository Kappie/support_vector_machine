This is perhaps the only job on the planet where you are paid $32/hr to do nothing except watch other people write things down, and occasionally to walk a 20-year-old to the bathroom and back.  Glorified kindergarten.  It wasn't all boring, though.  I had to laugh as I scanned the room and I spotted a young man sitting in the very centre of theatre, wearing a bright red T-shirt, who had long hair and a beard and frankly, he looked like Jesus. The fact that he stood out wasn't a problem.  It became a problem when I was scanning the room and I noticed that instead of writing, he was staring up at the front most of the exam, and we continually met eyes.  After this happened a few times, he started smiling at me.  As hard as I tried not to look at him, I couldn't keep that up for very long.  Eventually I would glance at him and see him with a big, broad smile on his face.  When the other TA and I passed each other, I whispered, "Jesus keeps smiling at me."  Knowing exactly which student I was talking about, she started to laugh and replied, "Jesus loves you."  I retorted, "Jesus is giving me the creeps."  Maybe you had to be there but it was my highlight of an otherwise boring afternoon.   More to come...
