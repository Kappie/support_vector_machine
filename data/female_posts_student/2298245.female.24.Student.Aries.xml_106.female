I only have internet at school, so when I don't post, it means I am crazy busy at school, or I am not there.  This weekend, I was not there.  I decided to work from home for the break.  I was not very successful in getting a lot done, but I did spend a lot of money eating out and seeing movies.  I also watched a lot of television, especially with the Christmas season upon us, there are always really sappy holiday movies on and I manage to get sucked into every one of them.  So this was how I spent my weekend.  It wasn't all fun and games.  I did get a fair amount of work done as well, so I guess I can hold my head high today and say that the break was not a total waste.  Just would have been a lot nicer to have been wasting that time at home with my family.  Oh, well, I guess the Rolling Stones were right:  you can't always get what you want.
