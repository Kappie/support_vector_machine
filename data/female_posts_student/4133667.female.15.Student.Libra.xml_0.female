SHE had probably told me she's gonna fetch her nannys .. nannys huh ? .. i didn't know she was fond of frenching nannys .. and the very last time she sent jee may home .. jace parked somewhere NEAR jee mays house .. looked at her and said .. come la .. for fun .. and they frenched .. great huh ? ..sucks doesn't it .. someone whom you trusted and givin chances .. tries after tries . and believing her fake story .. she told jeemay he missed the times they were together that it was peaceful and all that .. why did we even argue then ? why were we on a break ? .. it was because of she herself .. she lied about ju nn .. i never understood why she had to do it .. what exactly have i done wrong .. what part have i not played as her girlfriend .. i feel like a total idiot .. looking at her now is exactly the same as staring at a stranger .. i never knew she could stoop so low .. everything seems to be a total waste of time .. i never thought there'd be a day i'd say this .. but i regret this relationship
