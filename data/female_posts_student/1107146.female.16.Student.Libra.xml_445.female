But it should be ok...either you adapt or you die, whether you witness it or not.  But anyway..."pwned" is the L337 (a Counter-Strike language) version of the word "owned"...notice the "p" 's relationship in position to the "o". It was misspelled so much (and I probably just mispelled "mispelled"...eagh) that the kids adopted it. Thus, the holy word, P\/\/|\|3|). Some people are able to type whole sentences like I just spelled "pwned"  really frickin' fast .   So anyway...here's lookin' at you, kidz.
