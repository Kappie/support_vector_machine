The miles were zipping by and I was hefting tasks to an already sizeable list.  Other than unpacking and necessity-grocery shopping that is.  I would email this person for the first time in months, call that person, construct my new CD tower, reorganize my bookshelves, balance my checkbook, blog about the day's drive and its wonders, do a solid round of yoga and read the 2nd novel of the year (god, I hate that) until I fell comfortably and contentedly into bed.    Whatever.  Actually, the biggest tasks are complete.  The new tower is dead sexy and the books are breathing a bit easier.  The checkbook and long lost people will have to wait until tomorrow.  The only things I plan on reading is this month's Premiere and a free Rolling Stone.  And yoga might be of the deep-breathing variety.  At least I've got the blog-task on its way.  Don't ask me why I couldn't leave all this shit until tomorrow, when I have an entire day to get it all done.  Something about coming home and making a huge mess really grates; plus, it's a nice work-out, running around like mad, after spending the day in a particular seated position.    The drive felt great.  It's been a while since the roads, construction and weather have been cooperative and it makes quite a difference.  And as much as I would love to recount every milestone (no pun intended, I swear), my futon and trashy magazines are calling louder than the muse.  So, here are the highlights:  Sharing the trip's single stop with David Jack.  Seeing baby sheep.    Hitting "random" on the changer just outside of Idaho Falls and hearing the first repeat crossing the Latah county line.  Trolling, utterly in vain, the Post Falls Outlet Mall for the store in which I secured my first pair of non-matching thumb rings.    Thinking about the drive to Seattle Pride in three months.     P.S.  The Ogden trip was a success.  Found a new dead sexy outfit perfect for the wedding and indulgent weekends alone.  Plus, a few other choice gems due out this season found their way into the bags.  But, as Mom and I made our way through the Ogden Mall in less than short order, we realized:  Ogden is dumb.  We should just go to Salt Lake.  It's now my responsibility to remind Mom of this fact next time we venture to our neighbor to the south.  For this time, though, we made do with Layton, another SLC suburb; it has a mall of its own (all 40 minutes of it) and a Sam's Club, just to illustrate how far we went to find things in our backyard.  But my new clothes are worth it.
