He came home one day to find his roomate watching a video entitled "Cahokia Mounds". he laughed and said something to the effect of "Why does that sound like the title of a really bad Porn?"   Now, I am what you would call . . . mammilarily endowed. (Translation: I have big tatas.) For some reason, throughout most of our friendship, Joey has had this odd fascination with my rather succulent appendages. As a result of this, he has bestowed upon me the name of Cahokia Mounds because he feels that would be my porn star/stripper name if a.) I didn't have morals. b.) I weighed about 100 punds less and c.) it were a perfect world.   So, there you have it.
