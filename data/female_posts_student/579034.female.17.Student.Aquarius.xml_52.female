Mariana said something to me today and after she said it I could understand her point of view, but the reason  I had such a problem with it was the way she said it. She was just so bitchy about it all.. if she had just like said what she said in a I don't know, like, nicer way, the whole thing could have been talked out. But oh well. Yea, but I had like the whole long conversation and I had told him we should hang out but, I don't think I will be doing that right now. I think I am going to go to my dads. Don't know though. Blah... theres a dress down on Friday. I don't know, should I do it? Blah... I'll think about it. Yea... I'm gonna go talk to people... peace x0x0x.. oh and John is gettin kiked in the balls tomrrow.
