In light of my pending move to the Wheat State, I decided that my friends and family would be in dire need of news from my life, and that the best way to communicate these exciting happenings was a blog.  Kind of a one-size-fits all thing, like those annoying emails you get from friends who went abroad for the summer that all read, "Europe is sooooo beautiful!! and the people here are soooo cool and like Americans!!!!  oh, and the beer is cheap so I have to go now!  Hope your summer is awesome!" and so on.  I'll try to make the blog better than the summer abroad emails.
