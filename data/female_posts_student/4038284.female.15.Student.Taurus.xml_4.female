I have read all of his posts, and I must say, I am quite intrigued by them, so I will begin this post by introducing myself, what I like, etc.  My name is Kimberley Louise Wilson, and I am 15 years old. I live in the UK and I love to roleplay, write fiction, read and design web pages. I have a sister called Jessica, and five cats and a dog, Troy.  I have to mention my friends on this site, my best friends would be Wajeeha, Marc, Aksa, Priya, Ashleigh, Sheridan, Natasha, Matthew and Tom.  I also have best friends on the internet, ^^; those would be Soph, Vicki, Leigh, Ems and Darian.  And that is my first post, my second one will come quite soon after this one, telling you of my day today.
