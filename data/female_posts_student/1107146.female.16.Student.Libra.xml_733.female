Kind of an odd...way of doing it, but they did.  Hah! Penguins. They should have got you a real one, yo. That would be awesome.   Dude! I got my present from Abby tonite...wow. Wow. I love her. And man, I'm sorry for sort of not responding to any emails! Your email and mine have a problem communicating, it seems. I never get any you send. Hm...dude.   I'm just really blown away by all of it.   I'm going to Tempe in about five hours, so I'm going to bed. Until we meet again, friends!
