Yea, I rock, I know it. lol I had three study halls today too so that was awesome. And not to mention that a couple of people actually noticed my hair and said it looks so much better! I love compliments. They make me feel pretty. :) And I can't forget about how nice it is outside and that puts me in a good mood when I can wear my summer clothes.  So right now I'm listening to my 90's rock cd because I heart 90's rock music a whole ton. Later I have some stupid bridal shower for my cousin Greg's fiance Amy. I don't even know her but oh well. Atleast I'm not going to be to overly bored at home all day.  And I just want to say...."To boys for every girllllll" Right Danielle?  Listening to: [Hey Jealousy by Gin Blossoms]   Tell me do you think it’d be all right If I could just crash here tonight You can see I’m in no shape for driving And anyway I’ve got no place to go And you know it might not be that bad You were the best I’d ever had If I hadn’t blown the whole thing years ago I might not be alone Tomorrow we can drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take it’s place...hey jealousy And you can trust me not to think And not to sleep around  If you don’t expect too much from me You might not be let down   Cause all I really want is to be with you  Feeling like I matter too If I hadn’t blown the whole thing years ago I might be here with you Tomorrow we can drive around this town And let the cops chase us around The past is gone but something might be found To take it’s place...hey jealousy She took my heart There’s only one thing I couldn’t start
