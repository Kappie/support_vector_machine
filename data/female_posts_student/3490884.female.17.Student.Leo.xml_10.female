What am I even talking about? Well, it's complicated.  I was right about a lot of stuff, but I was wrong about much more. You'd think I'd learn by now. But, I'm just not that slick. Oh well. I don't seem to take the knowledge I gain from one experience and apply it to another. I'm going to have to work on that. I mean, I've had experience with this and I could have prevented my being totally mistaken had I just thought about what I learned before from the exact same situation.  Did I just think it'd be different this time for no reason? Did I randomly say to myself, self, this time is different because this time is later in time? That's dumb. This time is just like last time. The only difference is that this time I feel dumber. Why would I expect you to open your eyes this time when you didn't before?   Because I'm kidding myself. That's the only reason I can come up with. Old habit really do die hard. They just stick around, or at least, they stick around for me. I don't know if other people have the same issues. I sincerely doubt it. Otherwise, mankind is dumber than I thought. There have to be those people who learn from the past in all situations and apply the knowledge effectively to future similar situations.   Well, I'm here to say I'm not one of those privileged people. Clearly, I can't be when I just fell into the same mind trap for maybe the third time this year. All I know is that I can't wait until next year when I won't be able to fall into such traps. It will no longer be an option. If that gives you a clue as to how where when who or what I'm talking about, then all I have to say is: aren't you Nancy Drew? Well, I'm done. I just pretty much needed to rant about my stupidity.   I don't want to fall into the same trap again. This isn't even like the second time, so it's just messed up. Once the signs appear, I'll just steer clear. I'll ignore the statements and hints. I'll ignore the attention. I'll ignore the proposals. Then, I won't fall into the same trap again.   The only problem with that--I'm sure I've said that before too. Hopefully, I'll succceed this time.
