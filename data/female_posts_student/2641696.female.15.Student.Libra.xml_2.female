I am proud to know her!   Other news... would include I am sickeningly proud of my Garden Gnome piece I wrote on Monday for eng... (hahaha, I might even post that, because I love it soooo much).    ... would include I'm still struggling to come up with an idea for my privilege-themed short story. I wrote one on the snow day, but I'm not sure if it's good or not :S Therefore, no one can read it. I'm going to look over it again on Saturday or Sunday to decide if it's trash material or not.   ... would include I am absolutely inspired by Gwin Dier (or however you spell it) - since most of you suckers aren't in music, you'll have no idea what I'm talking about, so: the Furby let us have our music class off, and go to the PAC to see Mr. Dier talk about neo-cons, Iraq and Pax Americana, because the Furby (and me too, now) worships this man. He's a famous journalist/genius who got started in journalism just by accident - he started off as a historian! Man! This could be me! *ahem* Anyway, to be quick and cheap and easy, he has some brilliant theories about what's going on with the U.S. and this 'war on terror,' as well as a great writer (and speaker), AS WELL as a terrific sense of humour. To be even quicker and cheaper and easier, he is my idol. Along with Neil Gaiman. I will worship them both.   ... would include me considering taking up the harp again. That's right, folks, I used to play the celtic harp. Not one of those massive orchestral beasts, but a rough and small celtic harp, that brought to mind either Irish pubs or Irish fairies, depending on your nature. My old teacher, let's call him RE, just left a message after basically a year of no contact, saying that I'm really musical, that he's always there for me to talk to about music, and that this is not a sales pitch. I'm inclined to disagree, but hey, flattery has worked in the past and will work again. I'd only take lessons in the summer, of course; school work is too hectic right now, but my mum misses the sound of my harp and I kind of do too. Whether this is because of the recent flattery or my obsession with all things Irish and green, we'll find out this summer.   So that's all for now, folks (I've used folks twice in this blog - RE is already influencing me - expect some hippieness, guys), so see ya'll tomorrow.
