I will surely miss the  silly videos Chris makes of his wife.  I have been talking to people close to Gretchen and Chris.  Heres an excerpt of what one of them is saying: "I'm not sure where the word is getting around about Chris and Gretchen, but it really is their personal life, and I hope people are respecting that. For the record, I have known about it for many months, only because Gretchen is a good friend of mine and she chose to talk to me about it. I hope the rumors aren't spreading too far... it concerns me."  And as for me, I am deeply saddened that there is one less geek with out  a model for a companion.  Sigh.  Okay now on with the holiday cheer.  Happy Hannukah!  From now  until Wednesday there will be Eight Days of the Festival of Lights!  Cheers!
