I made myself throw up yesterday just to get the room to stop spinning. Mornings have always been the hardest for me. I haven't slept a peaceful night in a really long time. I'm talking at least a year. Mornings are the saddest, I wake up and realize my life is still as fucked up as it was when I went to sleep the night before. I think me and my lovely boy are through. I told him yesterday while I was buzzing that whateva girl he's talking to is gonna fuck him over. He stayed real quiet, cause I'm usually the one the encourages him not the one that tears him down, then he said thanks and said he'll talk to me later. Which of course, my drunkass could not accept. So I called back but no answer. So then I called his mom, and she repeatdly reminded me that no boy is worth this much pain. How come even thought I know that, it still hurts like hell and I can't make it stop. I think the mental ward is gonna come looking for me too, I remember vaguely telling her that I just wanted to die. I'm sure that didn't sound too healthy.    What the Fuck am I doing?!?!
