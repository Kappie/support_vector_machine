Really, I get so serious about something and then if provoked, I drop it like a hot potatoe... or how I drop a china plate when I find creepy crawlers on it -- got yelled at by my grandmother for dropping China awhile back due to ants.  It's pathetic how I want my braces off. Kind of like: "I don't care about appearances; I want to feel my teeth!" Anyhow, my orthodontist appointment is tomorrow, and I am at the point in which I could get my braces off. HOwever, my bite is still screwy and the rubberbands are useless. Grrr... half of me want it all over and the perfectionist half demand perfection.  Having a sloven and a perfectionist living in the same brain is pure torture.
