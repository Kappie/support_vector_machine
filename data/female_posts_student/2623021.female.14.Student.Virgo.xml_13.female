There's nothing I need to turn around, I'm a  little  confused lately, but there is  absolutely nothing  I regret! I live life to the fullest, and you're right I don't care what you have to say. And when I said Gossiping, Backstabing, and Shit talking, wasn't about my friends that I have now, it's about my old friends. Which includes you. I wouldn't traid the friends I have now for anything... or anyone.
