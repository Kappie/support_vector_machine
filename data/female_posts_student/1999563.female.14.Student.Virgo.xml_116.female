I got to go in every shop I wanted!!! :D  After much deliberation I purchased a skirt and a sweater for sadie hawkins.  They are soooooo coool! The skirt is like pin-striped. :D Yay!    Then my dad came and picked my sister and I up and we headed to the soccer game. We rode the monerail. (Sp?)  It took like a half an hour to get the PGE Park, where the game was being held. The train was sooooooooooo squished! I ould barely breathe!! When we finnally arived at PGE there was a HUGE line to get in! To we stood in line with all the crazy soccer fanatics....I took a picture.
