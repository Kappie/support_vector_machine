My new rant concerns users. People who you try to be nice to, for whatever reason, and they take the concern and care you show them and use that as a means to get into your life and then act all pissy when you ask them to give you a break from them. Take my friend Jessie. Very sweet girl, but OH MY GODDESS. She is one of those people that acts all sweet and nice to you, but as soon as you are nice back, she turns into Demon Jessie. I have done some wonderful things for her, bent over backwards to make sure that she is taken care of, is not wanting for anything, etc(not to toot my own horn, but ask anyone i am friends with-I will do anything for someone I consider a friend, even going so far as to open my home up on a few occasions for people who not only took advantage of that, but then stabbed me in the back afterwards), and you would think that she would have the decency to treat me and my family with respect, right? WRONG! She just keeps taking full advantage of us, and when I have tried to talk to her about her lack of respect, holy hades breaks loose. She acts like I accused her of murder. I am getting really close to beating the crap out of her one of these days, I swear...
