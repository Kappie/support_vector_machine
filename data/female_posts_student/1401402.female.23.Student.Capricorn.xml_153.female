Tired to even think. Instructor has been so hard on me. I have class from tues-sat. Damnit, one more day to go CRAP. I want to go out and party damnit.   I heard that club IBIZA has a grand opening this Sat. Which is so cool, its the home boyz b-day, their renting a room and we'll have our own DJ. Good luck to anyone who will try to look for me that night. If you dont have connections you'll never find me. It's my time to have fun. I'm so gonna party until I drop. Shake what your mama gave you hehhehehhehe....
