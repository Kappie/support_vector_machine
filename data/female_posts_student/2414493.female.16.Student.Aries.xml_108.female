Didn't realize how awesome it was to sit next to Doupe again until today. He never pays attention (often, he asks Mrs. Freeman a question right after she lectures on it) and he starts talking to me, too, so I end up not paying attention either. He gawks at my grades.  "Lydia!" he exclaims when I get that B. 72/85. The class average was a 77. We laugh together at my spotty knowledge on sentence structure terms.  Life is very much bearable today. Andrew and Nige are taking pictures of random people and won't tell me what it's about. A photo album, they tell me. Nigel snickers. Andrew, you're going to have to tell me or that's another 20 bucks :)  I'm cheating myself in physio. It's so easy to just memorize everything and not retain anything long-term, but I am busy and I haven't the time to sit down and absorb.   Jess brought up that Barbara was planning to run for NHS president. I tell Tiff. "Ew," she says, declaring that she's going to run too just to stop her. I almost wish I didn't tell her, but that's awfully selfish of me. I want to run too. Tiff is formidable competition. Maybe it really doesn't matter. I just don't want Barbara to win. Barbara-->barbarian-->bearded one. Does she not realize how people hate her? If I like her for anything, it's that she can still let herself live when everybody makes faces at the mention of her name, even when it's people I don't know. Induction tonight. I almost wish I could go to the rest of orchestra so I could see Sylvia and Andrew (falling asleep on cello). Maybe I will. But I have studying to do.   I snapped again. At Grandma this time. I really don't want to go to her birthday party. I'll settle for leftovers, really. It's just not worth it! I will eat, sure, but I don't exactly see the necessity of traveling all the way to San Gabriel. And I know she's turning 80 and that's awfully special, but I have things to do too. It's weird. I'm looking forward, almost, to Sunday and the car wash (just not five hours of it) but I know I'll have to endure the stress of SATIIs and Bach first. I almost thought I didn't have to take the US history SATII today. Wow.  Ok, I'm off. I need some hot sauce on my lunch.
