I loved  Angels in America  when I read it, as a work of literature and of art, and I think the HBO movie adaptation was wonderful.  And I'm sure, if I'd been old enough to have seen the original stage version of the play, that I would have loved it as well.  He has a way with words and images that is rare to find in a playwright.  The thing with him is that it is hard to put politics aside because he blindly refuses to.  And in doing so, he very often  urlLink goes to far .    But even this could be forgiven if he produced works that were not only brilliant in their own time, but were somehow transcendent, the way really great art is and should be.  But his works are so tied up in current political and social events that I fear his works will be largely forgotten by the time the next generation comes around.  Despite the warm reception that the T.V. version of  Angels in America  received at the Golden Globes - winning everything it was up for - even that play, a little more than a decade after it was written and first produced, seems largely out of place, largely dated in today's world.  It's hard to make historical judgments about works that are still largely unhistorical in the same way that it's hard to make a judgment about how important any particular event will be historically speaking when that event is not far enough removed from the present to accurately evaluate it's significance.  But Kusher's works are so specifically grounded in the current time in which they are written that it is hard to think that they will continue to be significant when circumstances have changed.  So perhaps it is easy to put up with him and his polemical silliness now because time, in the end, will render him completely insignificant, and his brand of discourse, while attractive to some, is never long-lasting.  In the end, it turns people off and runs them off with its unreasonableness.
