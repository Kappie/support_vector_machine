And theres lots of things in there that someone [ who will remain anonymous] wrote, or got from somewhere and she talks  about these 'ideas'.. haha on the first page it says .." I write like a poet when I'm high" So thats what I'm gonna call it.. here are a few things that made me laugh/think....    Gilligans Island:  "The Gilligans Island script is written by genious kids in Russia. A porn w/ the sex parts cut out."  "I was smoking and Boy Meets World was on and in a black woman tone I was all " Oh I thought I was watching Friends" Get it, cause Boy Meets World was on..."   Ricky Lake:  "Ricky Lake makes a show, they use prisoners and change the outfits and Ricky is a fat insecure fat girl..."  "You've got two different people in life. You've got the young, funny ones who are being told by the older hard working ones that life doesn't come easy and you've got to work hard for what you want. Then you've got it vise-versa ( or twisted) and the older funnies who are telling the young hard workers to have fun in life cause it aint all about work work work , you gotta have some fun in life and they are all like " Which road are you gonna take? What kind of person are you?" And I'm just like who gives a fuck, i'm not just gonna listen to that, i'm gonna do whatever is now, fuck tomorrow, it can wait. I'll make my desicions for tomorrow, tomorrow, cause today I might die. Fuck the plans. I'm doing whats here and whats now. You can say whatever you want but whos gonna care in 1 week and will that save your life?"   The Devil:  " Hell wants to show you when you should do bad things b/c he is trying to recuit  people that are going to hell. And then there is angels sent from heaven and when good things happen that makes another person motivated to do more good stuff and that's how the good in the world turns . Because it's a fight for good (heaven) and evil (hell) and for a long time good has won and it reigns over the earth cause they go to different planets and control aliens on it ( we are the aliens) It's like a sims game."   Sac Town:  "See now i'm Ol' Sac-Town and here we breakin 'em down. Sometimes we smile, somtimes we frown, you know how it be and some say we get around but most of all you know we been gettin down come n see its the place to be. Can we get it? But all i can say is i'm wit it and how that i'm here we can get it. We role up a blunt, STL will hit it once Its all in a day but tomorrow we'll forget it. We didnt get it today, thats all that we'll do in 1 day but we'll never get it so get over yesterday... " (  We role up a blunt, STL will hit it once...   She was talking about me... I used to be STL.."  one hit n quit bitch "... haha good times. )  I blacked out for 3 minutes and had a flash back to lunch serving duty and dreamed about chicken nuggets.   The day at the park:  " My head was spinning , all throught the contovercy of a whisical kiss. I heard dozens of voices telling me how wrong and how the world is plauged w/ these occasions coming up time and time again, ruining lives. Then an alarm goes off. Too late to turn back, to sad, too bad, its too late. Then the realization of evil sets in and upon my head. Thats another point for the devil. "  Haha to me that is hella funny, just because I know why she was thinking it all and i understand it.. Well in the past 4 days, I have only gotten about 6 hours of sleep. I will feel hella tired, and will lay down , and won't be able to go to sleep. I think im gonna go have me some Enchilada Soup.. I made it, and its hella good...    urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla
