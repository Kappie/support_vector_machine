You get your schedule... and it's going to be dictating my life for a good part (if not all) of my life until the blissful last day of school waaaay far off in May 2005.  I don't want to get my schedule (for obvious reasons), but then a part of me can't wait to get back to the grind of things and Jasper and competition and all that homework. I'm sure that once school starts, I'll remember every single reason I hated it so much last year, but I'm still looking forward to the beginning of this school year. I know roughly where I stand in the strange heirachy of school (or the Asian part, at least), and I'm comfortable with it.   However , I don't want to see everyone's reaction to my short hair. Or shorter, anyway. My mom still thinks it's too long.  It's totally unfair that it's harder for an Asian to get into a good college than it is for anyone else. But I won't expound on the subject; I'll just refer any interested parties to Yini's blog.    But onto happier things. Somewhat happier, anyway.  I went to Lisa's house with Jack yesterday after not being able to decide on which movie to watch. So instead, we all gathered and watched One Hour Photo and ordered pizza from Pizza Hut and played more ping-pong. Jack is very good at ping-pong. He can slam like no other. I never get the slams. There is now an orange dent in Lisa's wall. It's kind of funny.  Lisa gave me handsoap from Bath and Body Works. (Pearberry scent for anyone who wants to know; I highly recommend it.) It was for my birthday, but she kept forgetting about it. It can be for my 1/3 birthday.  One Hour Photo is disturbing. In this one scene, Sy is makes two people have sex while he's holding a knife and a camera. It's... interesting. If anyone wants to know what happens, leave a comment.    I drove on the highway today. It was... boring. This one time, I think I was signaling left but I actually turned right... hahahaha. Anyway.     I'm writing a Lily James fic with Kailing right now. It's very cute. I have actually started on it! I like it. C= It is going to become legendary. Because it was made by two resident members of the three-member Legendary Co. But then schoolwork will kick in and it'll be stopped right when it's getting to the good part. AKA when Lily and James are just about to make up (and out). Legendary Co. is also a very evil company. Just watch. In twenty years (or less), it will be taking Wall Street by storm. So you'd better invest in it asap.  My brother's watching Shrek 2 right now. Illegal, of course.  EVERYONE TO READ THE BOURNE SERIES. I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT ENOUGH. OOOOH MY GOD I LOOOOOVE JAMES BOURNE.
