I hung around with Michelle and Jessica and Brett most of the time, and finally got to meet Mr. Pai.  I didn't realize that so many different projects were funded by the foundation, and I also didn't know that most of the money comes from the Pai family themselves.  It's something to think about everytime Junior Journalists feels too difficult to handle.  I guess I'm serving on the Board next year, and I'm glad.  Janice Pai... I didn't even know her, but that girl and her family are pretty amazing people.
