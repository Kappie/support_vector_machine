I'm trying to fix my sleep schedule to something fairly normal. I've been staying up until around two in the morning recently, and sleeping until at least noon, and it's been bothering me. So I tried to go to bed around midnight last night, but I wasn't yet tired at all, so I slept horribly. I did manage to get up at eight today, though, so I'm awake, if not very well rested. Hence the sleepy Unkymood.      Oh, I do love my Unkymoods.       So I decided to go over to the playground at the elementary school which is adjacent to my house and run for about thirty minutes. Well, mostly I walked. I'm really terribly out of shape. The track at the school is a little over a quarter of a mile, and I can just barely run around once before I'm completely exhausted. And to think that I could fairly easily run two and a half miles when I was in fifth grade... So I'm trying to work out a little now. I always feel really weak and wimpy, and I'm tired of that.      So, I got six hours of sleep (at most), and then I wore myself out by running (a quarter mile). I'm now both sleepy and just plain worn out. What a great feeling.       About an hour ago, Andy's friend Will called to ask him if he wanted to go to his house and "mess around with" a bee hive in Will's back yard. Andy accepted the invitation. Wow. My brother and his friends are real geniuses, aren't they? I can't  wait  'til he gets home, though. I need a laugh.      I changed the style of my Chatterbox. Those of you who saw how it was before, tell me which one you like better. I think I might be leaning toward the new one, since it has a scroll bar so you can see old messages. The other one just deletes them. Plus the font's smaller on this one, and I like that.       Well, I think I'm going to go read for awhile or something. Tootles.
