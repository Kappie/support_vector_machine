Poor Justin slammed his head into the steel staircase and thought Anna had thrown a chair at him. It was great. I'm laughing just typing it out.  After that I had my French exam. I think I passed it. It wasn't as hard as I thought it was going to be and I did great on the speaking part. So then I came home lol. We're moving into the house next door towards the end of July. Funny isn't it? lol. But it's bigger and I'll be getting the basement.  Work was....not cool. Not cool at all. I don't like birthday kisses when it's from someone I don't like. Eh. It doesn't matter.  Erfy's poetry blows me away. It seriously does. I'm hooked on it. I've printed out all the ones she's posted. I like to reread them. That's for you Erfy and don't you dare argue!  Ok so now I'm 17. Well..not officially. I will be officially 17 at 11:56am. That's when I was born. Anyways..have a look at what I wrote after my exam. I had some time left.  The Truth Within A Sentence  I can get over you. Get over you; Can I?  I am fine without you. Am I fine without you?  I didn't care for you anyways. Anyways, didn't I care for you?  You're not hurting me, you're only hurting yourself. You're hurting only me, you're not hurting yourself.  Forget you! I don't miss you. And you don't forget, I miss you.  Lmfao It's so....ehhy. But yea lol. Short little thing from me.  Much love  THERE ERFY! I UPDATED!
