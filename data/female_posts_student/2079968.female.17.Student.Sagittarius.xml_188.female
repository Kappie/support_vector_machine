So I've been wondering whether I should cut my hair again or let it grow...I don't have any really good pics of me up here, so nobody can really determine that for me...  I feel like making something...presents for people...mmhmm. I really don't know.  Relationships...courting or dating...whichever, no matter for this discussion. Someone once said to me "God gave you seven years to be a teenager".  So yeah...seven years, seven years to develop ourselves into men and women of God. Why are teenagers focused on such frivolous things as boyfriends and girlfriends? Right now, I'm gonna leave it at that :-) I'm still very much in thought...
