(nabasa ko na rin to sa princess diaries.. wen mia wished for a bf and realized dat she cant love him bak.. she said be careful wat u wish for, it myt come true.. nakarelate ako jan)  *Being in love is a patchwork of many indescribable moments..  *THE RIGHT THING AT THE WRONG TIME.. IS THE WRONG THING! (i totally believe this.. at sobrang nakarelate ako.. kung pano? ask nyo c krishna..)  *YOU DON'T NEED TO SHOP FOR WHAT YOU CANT AFFORD! (i explained this to krishna.. nakarelate sya.. haha!! alam ko kung bkt..)  un lng muna.. hehe..
