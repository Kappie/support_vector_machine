My mother was screaming my name right into my ear. My doctor, two nurses, and Nicole stood around me. They called 911 and I was rushed to the hospital, where they made me take a couple of tests before discharging me. All I can say is that it was very interesting. It hurt a lot though. The right side of my face got hit as well as my chin. Neither of them werebruised though. Which is a very good thing indeed.The back of my neck is hurting really badly right nowhowever...I've got a massive head ache too.   The doctor at the hospital said that I could have fainted from either dehydration, not eating breakfast, or stress. Though my sister and my mom might say that it was because Ididn'teat breakfast this morning, I think otherwise. I haven't ate breakfast in probably about three years. I believe that it was stress. The visit to the doctor's was very overwhelming for me. I really didn't like it all. Everything was just very depressing. All of the things going on my life were in my mind too. Dr. Patel was lecturing me about my diet. I remember feeling angry, upset, and frustrated. I didn't need to be lectured about something as trivial as my health. There were other, more important things going on in my life. I didn't care about discussing my eating habits...   Before I fainted, I had my height and weight checked out. I'm 5 foot 5 and 1/4 inches tall and I weigh about 121.5 pounds. This totally depresses me. And I thought that I had been losing weight.  *sighs*  I guess I was wrong... Oh, well...   I'm out.
