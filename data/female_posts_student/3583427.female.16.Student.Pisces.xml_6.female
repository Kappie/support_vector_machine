Parents are assholes (pardon my language), and sometimes it feels as if no one really cares. I don't really understand why things work out the way they do...But, meh. Blah. I really miss him...My boyfriend. I love him so much, but my parents seem to think that "Young love" is a sack of Crap...That's what I think of what they think. Frikkin' 2 months without seeing him, talking to him...It's so hard. I've never been put up to a challenge so difficult. I mean, this isn't just all about me. It's about him, too. I really wonder what he's thinking...And how he feels...I'm just worried. I really hope things work out. Blah.  Anyways...About me...My name is Aman, I'm 16, Go to Frank Hurt Secondary, and I am in the 10th grade. Time is passing by so fast right now. Just for the school part of it, anyway. Yeah...2 weeks, and school is over...Well, a week and a half, I'd say. Meh, meh, and meh.  Well, that's it for my rant. Thanks again, Mica, for telling me to try this out...Maybe it'll help with the time consumption. =).
