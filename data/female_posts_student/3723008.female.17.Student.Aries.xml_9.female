Aleyya's birthday is on Thursday... so most likely will be going up to Joe's Pizza with her and Jaye-Anne and ... Nadia... on Thursday.. tomorrow we'd be in Chaguanas.. me, Foor n Nandi... n Rene .. haha.. well he said he was coming so I aint sure.. I'm still sick shitless.. Went this morning with mom to buy some ribbon for some pyjama thing... and I ended up making her buy this gorgeous piece of cloth... I ain't really a cloth-buying-giving-people-to-sew-clothes person... but .. wow.. its black and silky and wow... I just couldn't leave it in the store... so now I have a piece of cloth.. I need to find a good seamstress who would make a nice dress for me ehehehe.. ok this is boring me .. bye
