F*%ing "neither" and "either!!!!" why the H#LL can't they just say "j CANNOT be next to k and h???" i can't believe i didn't have time to check my work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am the most careless person in the WHOLE WORLD!!!!! MY LIFE DEPENDS ON DOUBLE-CHECKING MY WORK!!!!!!!!!  okay. get a grip lady. GET A F*@#ING GRIP!!!!  this is pathetic. i only know three cuss words total to express my angst.  oh yeah, i also ran into a buncha ppl i met in my first year at ucla. either i'm REALLY bad at keeping in touch, or these ppl just weren't my type. i dunno, probably a combination of both. but gosh, i wasted freshman year eating a lotta meals with a lotta ppl that i never talk to anymore. i guess it's part of the college experience. hm. come to think of it, all the ppl i lost touch with were church ppl. but i also have to admit that i really am terrible at keeping in touch. and in contrast to freshman year, i have zero incentive to meet or talk to anybody. might be the stress, but my estrogen level is definitely at an all time low.  anyhoo, i felt very competitive today, regardless of who i saw. i do not like the fact that so many ppl were taking the test. even at such a tiny test center as mine, there were probably 200+ test takers. i could not believe my eyes.   for some reason, tv, IM, and shopping do not hold the same appeal as when they were on the hands-off list....
