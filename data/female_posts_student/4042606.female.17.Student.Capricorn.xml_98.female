Jackie hasthem (everyone already knows that). I wear baggy clothing so that I don't draw attention to myself, unlike my sister whom barely wears anything. Now I usually will always wear cargo pants and a hoodie. When I am with close friends I'll just wear the t-shirt under my hoodie. So they know my "endowments". If I ever hear Mute say my breasts look a lot like my sisters again, I will kill him. Plain and Simple, they are no where near as big as Jackie's so shut up.
