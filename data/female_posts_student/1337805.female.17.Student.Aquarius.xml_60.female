Went to Durrance lake at like, 10 last night. It was an adventure. I can honestly say I have never been swimming at night, and never been skinny dipping either. Muchos fun was had, and I enjoyed it. Talking to the guy I like last night too, and he was wasted off his ass. I never realized how annoying it is talking to someone who is drunk, when you are not drunk. Not fun. And he gets to go away for a week. But hey! It gives me a chance to live my life the way I wanna, and go crazy, and I'm not going to pine for him. I'm going to break my crazy clingy ways. See what happens with this guy, and if it works out (With me, I dont think so.) then wow! I know what's wrong. Amazing.  Relationships never really work out for more than a month for me. It's crazy. I've gone out with practically half of Victoria, at least more than most people my age. It's kinda scary, when you think about it. And none of them has lasted longer than 3 months. I'd really like it if one of these times I could have a relationship that lasted, that meant something to me, that I truelly loved, and not the fake feelings of longing I've had before.  I don't actaully think I've been in love before. I think its just the feeling of longing that has taken over my mind and heart, and tricking me into believing its real. Or maybe I have been. Maybe that pain I had last summer was love. Cause man oh man, i don't ever wanna feel like that again.  I really really hope that this one turns out. Cause man, life would be so awesome.  Power to you Jess for speaking your mind out. Hope it went well tonite. Email me and give me full details giiirl!:) And Sanford, go look at the pics I found for you. You'll enjoy them...  Have fun at Seabeck Tom! Even though I highly doubt you read this, there's a chance you might. Have fun, don't get too wild, and say hi to anyone who knows me (like they will). Get some hints on handling the ladies too, if master PLaYa Kelty is gonna be there...:P Gotta love that Kelty. Oh man.   Loves you all later.
