As time passed, he cast off his diabolical countenance for a new face...the face of pure reason. Transparent and insidious, but soulless all the same"  "Doubt is your last shred of control. It is doubt that brings souls to you. Our need to know that life has a meaning. Man's insecurity and nedd for an enlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan. But the chusch is not the only enlightened soul on the planet! We all seek God in different ways. What are you afraid of? That God will show himself somewhere other than inside these walls? That people will find him in their own lives and leave your antiquated rituals behind? Religions evolve! The mind finds answers, the heart grapples with new truths.(...) God is not some omnipotent authority looking down from above, threatening to throw us into a pit of fire if we disobey. God is the energy that flows through the synapses of our nervous system and the chambers of our hearts!"  "ANGELS  DEMONS" Dan Brown
