I won't bore you with the stats, but this is freakin' huge. And it will suffice to make me happy for at least a week. Also, training camp begins next Friday, which means the pre-season kickoff game between the 'Boys and the (hiss) Houston Texans is a mere three weeks from tomorrow. Life is good.  As a very significant PS, big thanks to the guys at  urlLink Scrutiny Hooligans  for the link--if you aren't already checking their site daily, you should be. Be sure and watch  urlLink this clip , which they postedearlier today. I think evenyou radical conservatives (you know who you are) will enjoy it. This also might inspire me to write more intelligent posts about current events, as opposed to stories about kegs. We'll see...
