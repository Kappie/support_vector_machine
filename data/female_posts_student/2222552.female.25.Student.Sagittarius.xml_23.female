I think today I had a nervous break down and I called a friend crying and just spilling out all the things that have been bothering me for the past year... Been so stressed I developed an anxiety disorder with occasional panic attacks. ok on with the story after about 2 maybe 3 hours on the phone crying and venting my friend offered to come over and babysit so I could get out and just feel free for a little while. So I called up a girl from work and went out for a bit...I was feeling so much better until I got home and she showed me something she did... I am not too impressed and in fact what she did could cause more problems and more stress, I understand she was only sticking up for me from some people who treat me like shit but now I guarantee it will get about 100x worse
