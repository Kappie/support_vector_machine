I didn't have a problem with this, I have thirteen brothers and sister, handling two sounded like a cinch. I was all ready, i brought over a couple movies (Pirates of the Carribean and Bruce Almighty) and I was planning on a nice day, maybe taking them to the park, or going to run a few errands. But OH NOOOOO! The girl, Olivia (Liv) was nice. She was very quiet and didn't get into trouble, but Stevie was horrible!! He ran around the house like a wild animal and actually started barking at some point. Then when I was getting Livi some cereal, he hid in the closet and I couldn't find him, then he jumped out with a sqirt gun and started getting me all wet! I thought I was going to kill him right there! But i managed to calm him down for a little time and he started watching Pirates of the carribean, then he got up in the middle of the movie, and started hitting his sister with a pillow, which of course made her cry.... seriously i didn't know such a child could exist! SOOOO.... I chased him with a pillow and pummeled him until he just lied on the ground.... i thought I had killed the little bastard, but he got up and bit my leg! What a cannibalistic little freak. After that he went and resumed wathing his DVD. I put Livi to bed and was cleaning up the kitchen when I heard the screen door slam. I glanced up and Stevie was gone... The DVD had ended and he decided to go outside at 10:00 at night! So I went out looking for him and I couldn't find him, then i heard the lock on the door latch shut.... So i was outside for a half an hour.... then he let me in and went to bed.... weird....  When their parents got home they asked me how they were. "Oh they were great." I said She smiled and said she knew they would be... i was like oooh!!! You better be paying me a lot for this little episode! But they usually do, he's a doctor and she's a dentist... They gave me 150 for that night, i usually get that per month! Looks like me getting a 67' mustabg isn't going to be sucha  farfetched Idea!  That's about it for my blog today. Tomorrow will be good. My ENTIRE greek famiyl is coming over. 42 cousins, 10 aunts and 12 uncles... then my 4 grandparents... AY!
