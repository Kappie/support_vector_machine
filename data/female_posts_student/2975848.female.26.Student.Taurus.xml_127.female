So cold blue I try to warm you My lips in yours, our last kiss But you’re not there with me You’re time has arrived and you left me behind Oh! Tell me why? I’m on my knees holding you in my arms In despair I try to reach you But you’re forever gone and there was no goodbye Hope to be with you really soon Hold you again, reaching the stars in the sky What a magical dream. What a tragic reality. Oh! My love… why?    ]-[ellMistress * Angel Who Can’t Fly
