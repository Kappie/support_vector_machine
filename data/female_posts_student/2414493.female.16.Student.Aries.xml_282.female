       
      Sad for some particular reason that I can't particularly pinpoint.   I've practiced some piano, at least. Oh, what else do I have to do? Get plates, forks and napkins. Ready the camera. Do Spanish homework. I hate Spanish, and I think Bruckner knows it too. She picks on me because I don't speak up much. I guess my participation in a class is dependent on how much I respect the teacher or the curriculum. I don't like this nuestra ciudad feel. I'd much rather read stories.  Maybe I'm sad because Austin's playing Dashboard Confessional in the background.  Or maybe it's because I keep on checking my email and there's nothing there. Well, what could I expect? I've been tempted all day to write again, but that's repeating ugly history and I'm not going to resign to those tactics. What did I ever want from this? I don't even know, but whenever I really talk about it I'm edgy and bitter. And now I'm forlorn. What the hell. The problem is that I never decided. I still haven't.  I'm angry that the yearbooks aren't out yet. They said last Friday, then today, and now Thursday. Word is that someone inserted porn and now they have to fix it somehow. I'm tempted to cuss those people out because the rest of the school ends up paying more than $50 a pop for those books riddled with bad grammar. No, I'm tempted to write an editorial. But it's simply annoying since tomorrow's the last day for the journalism seniors and unless I hunt them down, they won't be able to sign my yearbook. Tomorrow we're having our mock trial dinner, and unless I hunt down some of the people, I won't see them again for a long, long time.  I conducted the critique in journalism today. Scary thought. They don't respect me yet, but that's ok.  If I press   a few more times...
