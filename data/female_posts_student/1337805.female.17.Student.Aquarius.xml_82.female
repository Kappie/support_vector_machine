It tastes very weird, not sure about this. I watched the Steelers vs. the Cowboys today. Decided Cowboys are my fave team, is subject to change seeing as I've only watched that game, and the superbowl where the RAMS LOST! Mwahaha....Sorry Mike:)  Have started competition with Annetta: Who can have sex first? Must beat her, so! Anyone willing?  Good grief. Later, I'm going to regret being such a slut this summer.   BTW, I heart you Rob. I want your ass. Before it's too late and my conscieous returns.
