[the last time it happened, he came in looking crazed.. he said that he wished the kids would've gotten stuck trying to get in and he would've left them there to die, stuck in the vents in the ceiling of his shop.. (i guess that's how they got in) he said a few times that they're lucky that he didn't show up there when they were still here.. mumbling stuff about guns and the whatnot] when bad things happen to him, he appears very sad and troubled and worried and scary..  there was a time when he seemed so depressed that i thought he might actually kill himself.. seriously..  at the moment, he has a pseudo-girlfriend whom he likes to make sexual innuendos about...  joan .. he says things about how he didn't get much sleep the night before.. stuff like that.. but he scared her with a christmas present (a fancy ring) and they went through some rough times.. i guess she freaked out about it.. and actually got mad.. they play a lot of pool i guess.. billiards..
