"...The leaves are scattered on the ground I miss the seasons, and the comfort of your smile.   Sometimes this all feels like a dream I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up, from this life...."   ...As I sit here all alone I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on When your gone...  I'll never be the same without you I love you more than you will ever know..."  ..Do you ever feel like crying? Do you ever feel like giving up? I raise my hands up towards the sky I say this prayer for you tonight Because nothing is impossible."  *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*  Well, I went to the races today.  It sucked.  Blah.  Make beautiful mistakes, crazies.
