We had a chance to take the train into the city this morning and we toured around.  Part of the touring was doing the world's larges escalator.  What we didn't know when we set out for it, was that it only escalated one way, and when we went that way was down.  So we had to climb all of the stairs beside the world's largest escalator.  We were drenched in sweat but achieved some sense of satisfaction from doing it.  And now I can say that I have been all the way down the world's largest escalator.  I think it is safe to say that we are getting a little tired of airplanes.  We didn't get off the plane we started on until 19.5 hours after we got on it.  Leg cramp, leg cramp!  The food has been good and the movies alright.  Though there are only so many times one can watch the Emperor's New Groove.  Our next flight leaves in about 3 hours and then another 6 after that we'll finally be in India.
