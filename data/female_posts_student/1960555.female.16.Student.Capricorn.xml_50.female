They wish me a Happy Birthday and I wish them the same,  trying desperately not to be rude.  A confused look crosses their faces but instead of commenting on the obscurity of my request they opt for pinching my cheeks and telling me how I truly am my father’s daughter.  Aren’t I my mother’s daughter too?  I begin to wonder.  “Amanda,” my mother informs me, “you say ‘Thank You’.”   Oh, alright.  “Thank You, Happy Birthday.”
