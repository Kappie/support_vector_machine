I hope no one has to do that. Although its really very easy. I only have to work until about 12:00 pm so it isn't bad at all.  Wow, okay last time I updated was a while ago! I need to get back on top of this!! Anyways.. About 10 minutes ago, I got home from Violet in Plano. This was the second time we went and it was great once again. Gavin, Leah, Courtney  her mom and dad, Alex, Jennifer(his date), and us were there. They all thought it was great! Anyone that hasn't seen it yet should go see it next weekend. You guys would love it!   Last night I went to go see Stepford Wives with Sarah and her mom. It's always a LITTLE tense when your girlfriend's mother is around, also because she's been a bitch to Sarah lately, but she's usually pretty friendly. She makes me a little nervous but I get over it. Well the movie was really great. We of course liked it because it had a lot of feminist qualities and depictions of strong women! That's always good!! I'm so glad I got to see that. The only other movie out right now that I want to see is Saved! I've heard that it's really really good. Maybe next week sometime. I first have to finish a book. Oh well. I'll do it.  Well approximately 35 minutes ago, our 6-month anniversary started! Hooray! I really think that it is an amazing thing. More importantly though, I think Sarah is an amazing person. On the same level of importance as that, I think  WE  are an amazing entity. I love her so much, and my passion for her is still burning strong even after 6 months. I'm amazed. Completely.  And to top off a great evening, I read our comments on Sarah's post before this one. Someone named Sabrina commented and said some incredible things! I can't believe we actually touched someone that we don't even know. When I told Sarah, she was ECSTATIC! Well anyway, that wraps it up for tonight, bye everyone! *kisses* to Sarah! Happy Anniverary Sweetie
