The mall sucked away over an hour and we spent 45 minutes going to walmart to get stuff for Kay's valentines day dinnner.  Now its 8:20 and I haven't done anything except spend oodles of money and agree to cook an elaborate (...well maybe not elaborate, just labor intensive) dinner for Kayla and her best friend to pass off as their own for their boyfriends on the table I decorated.  Hmm...maybe I need to channel this creative energy I pretend to have toward other things like english essays.
