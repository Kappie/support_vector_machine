There is a blind man who is eating Burger King, which against my will, I had to eat for breakfast as well, only because of lack of choices. I'm in Seattle I have another two hours until my next flight. Last flight I slept the whole way, I only wanted two things, not to sit by little kids or someone fat... I ended up sitting next to this guy who was rather large... took up all of his space and most of mine, but he was a sweetheart.   On the way into the airport in Eugene I went through security and it kept beeping, so the first time I took off a huge metal braclet, the second time I took out my cell phone, and then they pulled me over to the side and I had to take off my belt, and it turned out it was beeping because I had condoms in my pocket, they made me take them out of my pocket (I totally forgot that they were in there) and my father was standing behind me. I was soo embarrassed, he didn't see them though. HOT ROD, and TROJAN haha. It's all Felicia's fault. I swear! Ashlyn and I bought them as a joke, and I decided that I shouldn't leave them in my room for my dad to find them, so I was going to give them to Felicia because she's never had one before, let alone, touched one, and I thought it was funny so I was going to give it to her :P She decided that her parents would most likely find it and she would get in trouble though.   We stayed up all night last night, and Felicia and Suzy brought me to the airport to see me off. It was a lot of fun. I've had so much on my mind lately, well mainly about one person. I don't know what I can do about it. Nothing I suppose, he doesn't want to talk to me in person, because he is seeing someone else, and he "doesn't want to risk it" and they are "trying to see if they are meant to be." Which personally, I think that's bullshit, why the hell would you be together only to find out if it's meant to be. "She's a complex girl" he tells me, I suppose I can't complain because at least he's talking to me about her, well at least he's talking to me at all. Although I think HE should be thankful that I'm willing to talk to him, after everything that has happened. But if he thinks that they are meant to be, then he shouldn't be tempted to cheat on her, expessally with a past fling, who happens to be 14, and that only lasted a month, give or take. I think that if he is tempted to cheat then obviously he's not that serious about her.   Why can't I get him out of me head?!?! He's done nothing but hurt me. I think that I need to meet a hot guy, and forget about Florence guys. They are stupid, not all of them, just a good majority of them.   Oh and Anthony, I'm sorry about my last blog entry, you just had me pissed off... When I get back it will be september... that means school starts soon. I don't want to go back! Actually, I'm pretty excited to go back, I'll have my permit, and then after that I get my license, then I am free, and I can do whatever I want to do.   I have a goal! My goal for the rest of the summer is to forget about certain people. They aren't worth it. I want to have as much fun as I can in Maine, that's my purpose in life right now. To be a kid for as long as I can, have as much fun as I can and being able to NOT GIVE A SHIT about ANYTHING.   This quote, was someone's msn name, I don't remember who, but the quote really stuck with me. "Live life the way you want to be remembered." :) It's just really sat with me well... My grandmother had heart surgery this morning, she's in Bangor, that's where I will be flying into. I really hope she's doing alright. It was an 80% chance that everything is going to go fine, and that she will be fine. She's been through so much this last year or two. I truely hope everything turns out alright.   Did I meantion that I'm going to be an Aunt?!?! I am so excited!! Possibly to twins! It's so happy! I love it so much. I love babies... when I can leave them at night. My sister is going to spoil that baby rotten, she spoils her sisters alot. I am so excited for her.   I talked to Felicia today, that was fun I woke her up, but she got a kick out of me having to be searched because I had condoms in my pocket *blushes* Not like I was planning on using them or anything, it's just that... what was I supposed to do? Leave them at home for my dad to find? I don't think so! That would be worse, well at least I'm protected ;) And that I haven't used them. Virginity wut? haha   This post will be long, if I decided to publish it... it might be kind of annoying, but what do I care, I won't be able to post very often, every once in a while, I'll get online. This is friggen long... yeah anyways... take care and don't worry about the small stuff...
