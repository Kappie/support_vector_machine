We have School on tuesday *sigh*..but at least we get monday off cuz of memorial day I cant wait till school gets out because IM going to mass all summer to stay with my grandparents like I do every year... Only bad thing is they don't have a computer down there so I wont be able to update this...O-well I think I'll Live... Today's going pretty good I've Laughed a lot which is weird for me because usually IM not happy..Well now to get off the subject IM sorta glad that IM single cuz if you look all the people who have boy friends most of them aren't happy and there being controlled... O-well that special some one is out there some were and truth fully I really dont want a relationship.. I have had to many heart achs and I dont wanna do it again..
