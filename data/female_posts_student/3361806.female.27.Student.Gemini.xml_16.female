I got a similar feeling when I went to the  RuanThai .  RuanThai sits down a cobbled lane in Cockburn Street and on entering the establishment, you are immediately transported somewhere far away, like Shangri-La.   This is simply one of the most imaginative and beautiful interiors you'll see in the Capital; a spacious restaurant in an alley split into three intimate rooms bedecked in traditional Thai carving and panelling,with blossoms hanging in lattices from the roof. The enhanted atmosphere is perfected by the scent of flowers and traditional Thai background music.   RuanThai literally means 'Thai house', and owner has literally built one with his family. His skills in design are matched by his skills as a restaurateur, which has led to RuanThai becoming a popular destination over the past two years for the young, fashionable set who lounge around Cockburn Street and its environs. The decor may be traditional Thai, however the menu is contemporary, with one clever twist being the Pad Thai Loog Thoong, which translates as 'the cowboy noodle', and is a clever twist on the classic Pad Thai noodle.   There is a sister restaurant,  the Ruanmai , located in Rose Street, which is like one small, intimate room of the RuanThai, and caters more for business clientele. RuanThai really is something special, perfect for taking someone special to.
