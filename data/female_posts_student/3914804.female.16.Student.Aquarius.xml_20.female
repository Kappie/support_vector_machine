Just thought I'd comment on how *amazing* Billy Joel's songs are, I love them, I really do, and had forgotten how much until I discovered the cd just now.       Talking to an old friend - one of my oldest - online, constantly perplexed as to whether or not we get on. ??? Odd situation.      In other news, I *really* need to go on a diet, but I just can't be bothered!! No willpower...       Ah well...      Listening to "modern woman" by Bill Joel now.      Don't really know why I'm babbling on 2 be completely honest, better bugger off and catch the train...      later!
