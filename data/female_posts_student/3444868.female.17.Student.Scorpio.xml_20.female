Today has just been an awful day.  I didn't feel good this morning but I made myself go to the movie anyway.  Then I remembered I have the SAT tomorrow which I'm dreading.  Last but not least, Maury is going up north for a week which means I have nothing to do pretty much.  I saw his play last night and it was...uh...well it wasn't the best I've seen.  The camp is going ok.  It's really early in the morning.
