Here's the lyrics in case some of you hav forgotten it completely...(slightly diff from the previous one)    Home    Artist: Lin Jun Jie    (singing slowly)  This is home truly, where I know I must be  Where my dreams wait for me, where that river always flows This is home surely, as my senses tell me  This is where I won't be alone,  (start to rock)   for this is where, for this is where (I know I'm home...)  Whenever I am feeling low I look around me and I know There's a place that will stay within me Wherever I may choose to go I will always recall the city Know every street and shore Sail down the river which brings us life Winding through my Singapore    Chorus:  This is home truly, where I know I must be  Where my dreams wait for me, where that river always flows, This is home surely, as my senses tell me  This is where I won't be alone, for this is where I know it's home   C'mon... yeah C'mon singing yeah... C'mon, C'mon Singapore Yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yeah  When there are troubles to go through We'll find a way to start anew There is comfort in the knowledge That home's about its people too  So we'll build our dreams together Just like we've done before  Just like the river which brings us life There'll always be Singapore   (Chorus)   Yeah This is where I know This is where I know(This is where I know, this is where I know) Oh yea, this is where, this is where I know Yeah, This is where I know, I Home!
