I have a little homework, but oh well. Right now I am not doing it (it, being my homework) and I am watching the olympics. I am really excited for my Sweet 16 tomorrow! Although I will not be getting my lisence (or a puppy from the looks of it :*( I am going to be fine, I know. This week has been hectic with school and all and I haven't gotten much off time, but I'm scraping by. I finally found a group of people to sit with at lunch (exciting!) and they are all really nice (nicer than the people I went out with the first day, at least...). I am getting to know the people a little more in all my classes, especially Physics. I was cracking up today so hard I was crying, which is really cool because it's fun to share moments like that, even if it is over something as dumb as a chain of paperclips tied to a chair or used as jump-rope earrings :) My mom suggested I invite some people to go to a movie or something that day, but it's too late, cause I don't know anyone's numbers, and I don't think I know them that well to invite them out w/ me. We'll see. I still don't know many people in my chorus class, but I'm still enjoying that class very much and it's one of my favorites. So mainly I'm just excited about tomorrow. We'll probably be going out to Olive Garden or someplace like that and going shopping, or to a movie. Thankfully, nothing else much (good or bad) has been happening, but I am still missin yall and can't wait to come home. (I was especially devistated to realize I couldn't have my favorite Whitey's shake on my b-day!) Hugs and kisses to everyone...*
