I've found that recently, well in the past year i get angry and i'm really angry, not like a little bubbling of anger, like a rage of anger, and i can't hit anyone or lash out at anything as there is no one there, its probably a good thing i'm single as i might lash out at someone... Maybe its just hormones or frustration or something, i don't know, but i get angry and i'll just do it and then i've a mark, and another scar, and it can be over stupid silly things. I mean, yes a couple have been over Jason, i mean i was constantly scratching at my wrist just after we split up, i was continually irritated and i did it without even knowing. Compared to about 99% my life is perfect, so i have no real reason to do that, although i've been very good, hardly anyone knows, and i doubt the people who do believe me, but hey, i know i'm not as bad as i was, and its not for attention, to me its like a reminder now, not to go back there, and feel that shitty. I don't seem to have much planned for the weeks except work mainly, but i guess i get lots of money out of it at the end of August, just after results, i really wish that i had them now, i need to know, i can see me getting so agitated about them. I wish i was going on holiday too, be great, even just down to the coast in a caravan, wish me and some mates could go away, or one mate. Would have been something i wanted to do with Jason this year, just go away for a week in a caravan, by the sea, eat cheap etc, he could have driven and just stay on site all the time so not to spend too much money, that to me is a perfect image, obviously he doesn't want it so that is a bit screwy but hey. I'm a bit tired and have a full day of work tomorrow being as everyone else is on holiday. Jason is going away for his 18th to Camber with people, and Laura... Hmm, i dislike her, but i need to talk to the enemy to find out how the target is doing so to speak...  ~Lisa~
