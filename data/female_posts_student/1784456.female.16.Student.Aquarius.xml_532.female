She can't, so she's making it look like we've done something to give her a reason for doing something and getting attention! (phew!) Doing anything back to her is not a good idea (but a repeat of the baked-beans-over-the-head-inceddent would be funny!) because it will show her that we care which we DON'T! And it will give her the attention that she wants, and will only encourage her to do it more. If she thinks it's really cool and that she looks really smart then hell, let her! She'll grow up sooner or later and realise how stupid she's being! Ok, that's the end of my Kilroy impression, sorry about that! Anywayyyyyyy... eeek got a load of savage monsters i mean, uh... you guys coming round tomorrow...it's gonna be hectic cause my Grandma will have just arrived and it'll be like "Uh... Hi, er -talk later...*smuggles Lynne out the way before she says something stupid*"
