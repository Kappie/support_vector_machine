I hope she didnt find mine... that would be traumatic. I dont even know what to say around people anyway, and if she found my blog and was freaked out shed like.. tell my mom i was a bad person or somehting and freak out and... and.. aiee! and then i could never talk to her again. Because it would be crazy.  I have finals tomorrow. Lucky jessie got out of school TODAY! and she gets to graduate. but noooooo, i have to go take stupid tests for hours and hours. But luckily i dont have a la final and my art final consists of how well i clean the art room. but my science final is going to eat my brain, i swear. And that is tomorrow. Oh funfun joy. I might as well go die now.  AHH!   i have to study. and quit freaking out.  ~abby
