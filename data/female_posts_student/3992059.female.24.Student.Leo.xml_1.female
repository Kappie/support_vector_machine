They sent out 'packets' a month ago with all the damn nursing math stuff, abbreviations, and some prefix/suffix things we have to have memorized for a test on the first day of school.  And we have to pass it.  On top of that, at our orientation last week they basically told us to go buy our books and have the fors 50 pages of our workbook done by the time we get to class.  oh joy.  this sucks.  Too much work...too little time.   On the other hand I enjoy it.  I can't wait to get into the clinical setting.  I know it's going to be nothing compared to taking care of Jasmine.  She's fed through a feeding tube during the night to make up for the calories she doesn't get during the day.  (she just started eating about 4 months ago and she's doing quite well I might add!)  And her mother is another frustrating thing.  She's such a bitch.  I don't know anyone who doesn't want their daughter to be healthy.  She wants her to be on a feeding tube the rest of her life.  She wants her daughter to be dependent on her.  WTF???  The hardest thing about being a parent is letting go and making your child as indepedent as you possibly can.   oh well....I'll ramble about that bitch later.  I really need to go to bed.    ugh  sometimes I just wish I could fast forward my life 2 years.....
