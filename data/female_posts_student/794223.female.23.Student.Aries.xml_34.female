I walked a mile with sorrow; And ne'er a word said she; But, oh, the things I learned from her When sorrow walked with me" ~Anon.  Tomorrow is Brandi's surgery, and we're going to Houston to be with her. I'm not sure when we'll be back--probably Tuesday or Wednesday. Tues. is also Brandi's birthday, and my grandparents' 48th anniversary. What a shame to have to spend your birthday in the hospital. (or Christmas too, for that matter) At least she has so many people there right now to make this situation more tolerable.
