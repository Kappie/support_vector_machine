I last seen him was Friday at about 4.00pm like that when we just came back from sentosa... Saturday,which was yesterday, he could not come out as his mother was not at home and he needs to look after his siblings.. And today I could not go out as it's Sunday which is suppose to be my family day and we will be leaving to our grandma hose later around 2.30pm.. haiz... Missing him like hell man.. What is he doing now..?? Sleeping?? Playing games?? He would only be doing these 2 things as he is lazy to do others.. haha.. This is his habit man... Just can't imagine if really we 2 are going to last till I go overseas to Australia to study.. What is life going to be man.. I'm not going to live like that.. How can I keep in contact with him.. How am I going to see him.. haiz.. That really makes me sad.. haiz.. But Just not to think about it man right??.. haha...
