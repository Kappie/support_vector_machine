The one who got slapped                               was hurt, but without                                 saying anything,                                wrote in the sand:                                TODAY MY BEST FRIEND                              SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE.                                They kept on walking                            until they found an oasis,                                where they decided                                  to take a bath.                               The one who had been                             slapped got stuck in the                            mire and started drowning,                             but the friend saved him.                               After he recovered from                                the near drowning,                               he wrote on a stone:                                TODAY MY BEST FRIEND                                  SAVED MY LIFE.                             The friend who had slapped                             and saved his best friend                           asked him, "After I hurt you,                          you wrote in the sand and now,                            you write on a stone, why?"                             The other friend replied                              "When someone hurts us                              we should write it down                              in sand where winds of                          forgiveness can erase it away.                              But, when someone does                              something good for us,                            we must engrave it in stone                                   where no wind                                can ever erase it."                                   LEARN TO WRITE                                   YOUR HURTS IN                                  THE SAND AND TO                                    CARVE YOUR                                BENEFITS IN STONE.                                 They say it takes a                             minute to find a special                                person, an hour to                              appreciate them, a day                              to love them, but then                                  an entire life                                  to forget them.
