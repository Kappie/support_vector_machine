Listening carefully to the voice I hear, I entrusted my body to the movements of the waves. Gentle times pass by slowly, without anything such as loneliness or emptiness. I feel the sky, coming closer and closer...I can't tell if it's real, or an illusion. The me you left behind lives on. I'm just beginning to realize I can't stay here. The voice that calls me out of your sea spreads out with a dizzy feeling, becoming light.  Embracing the shards of my heart, broken by sorrow, with both hands, I was afraid of tomorrow. If everything can come true with prayer, take me back to before I'm born. For how long will I go on, breaking someone's heart and despising my degenerating self? The pain called "loneliness" makes my chest tighten Tears overflow... I want to open the box of memory right now and erase the painful past For eternity.  Since the moment I became aware of this power moving in me, I wander around, searching for the emotions I lost. Give me the strength to pierce through this era in which people hurt each other. In the sky I'm looking up at, the unfurling blue is waiting for me... Guiding me... Someday these hands surely will turn into wings, taking me to the sky of hope.  Don't fake the smile you gave to others. Sincerely letting your tears flow is also courage.  Those sad days will soon turn into fossils, and your pain will be secretly led to the forest of sleep. Good night, all of you overly enthusiastic stray children, until the day your impatience evolves into a dream. Life is waiting for the dazzling morning.  Even if final confession isn't granted Someday the darkness of this era will break into dawn. Life is awakening, weaving time itself. As if to return to your proof and so, the light tells your heart. You stand for a long time on the shore of tears. As if to gently conceal your feelings, the secret medicine Transports them to the open sea of memories. Let your fingers and ears, dirtied by morality, sleep within my arms.  Please come back to me, following memories, to the source of gentleness and dreams, In order to be born, and shine to the stars Once again... I'm getting used to the loneliness, ever since I was born. In order to forget, I always had one encounter after another...They did me a favor by making me aware of such pain...Those warm tears... Another conclusion. Another beginning. Is the death of the people nothing more than the birth of new life? Will the wishes of the people decay in heartbroken prostration?Will the hopes of the people lead to a desolate future? Will the dreams of the people lead to a past repeating itself? My dissolving heart destroys me.
