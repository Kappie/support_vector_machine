In all of that blabber have I once said something profound or useful to anyone out there but my self?  I can't believe I have written that much.  The number is staggering.  30,000...Wow.  Anyway the blog got a face lift.  My life is jealous.  It seems as if everything in the world moves on except me.  I'm stuck in the same place, like a little child, waiting for someone to take my hand and help me cross the street safely.  I don't like changing.  I like changes to occur, and need one to occur soon, but I don't like making them happen.  I am not a catalyst, at least not in my own life. I can demand things of the people around me, I can motivate them to change, yet here I am stuck in a rut and not confident enough to leave it.  Why is it that we (I'm assuming I'm not truly all alone here) lack the ability to change our own world, yet expect others to change theirs?  Why is it that when someone takes a drastic step we are shocked?  Having a good group of people is like having a crutch.  You become content and lazy and timid.  Slowly but surely you work yourself into a rut.  But now a new season is coming upon the world.  With this season I want to embrace new people, new routines, and a new me.  Then maybe I will be ready to embrace a new you.
