Immediately, I had come to terms with a "falling out" (that was really much more like an explosion really) that happened between my best friend and I almost two years ago.  Explaining it in detail would be a really pussy thing to do... come on, I'm not that bad. (I am soooo gonna complain on my blog about this! OMG!!!!11111nociurjhei) But basically, we were inseparable for four years, and then one night she stayed at my then-boyfriend's house (yeah, don't even ask about that.) and went into great detail about all the things she hates about me. This came as a great shock, and I stopped calling her. It just hurt too much. I figured I was somehow making her happy by leaving her life entirely. I know, that wasn't like me, but I didn't know what else to do... it was like the entire foundation of my personality or identity or whatever was ripped out from under me. So I retreated into myself and concentrated on things that have no room to reflect on anything. Now, it did have a few advantages; I'm sure that I'm a much stronger person for surviving it... and I'm now (laughably) a member of National Honor Society, Spanish National Honor Society... shit, what else... Anyway, I didn't have to worry too much last year when I didn't do a fucking thing in school.  And more importantly, this whole "fiasco" allowed me to become good friends with Diller, and I don't know what I would've done if he hadn't let me unburden all my troubles on him.  Aww, teary now.  But to the point: as the air chilled and my attitude lifted, I began to look on things in a different light. Maybe my then-boyfriend was trying to take advantage of me, maybe there was some misunderstanding, maybe I simply didn't care anymore, and maybe I subconsciously missed all the fun times with her.  To make matters even more pressing, she's graduating this semester, which doesn't leave much time for me to sit and debate.  Hold on.  Jesus.  I'm too pissed off for this right now.  I'll explain later.  Jesus.
