I think Chris and I decided we cannot stand not knowing what sex the baby is so we will probably find out sometime after my next appointment--Aug. 16th. My doc should make me an appt. then as long as everything was okay with the AFP blood test I just took today. I have already started looking at announcements that I like and making my hospital bag checklist. It's getting exciting already!   We took Caden to get his 6 month pictures on Sunday. That was fun! He is too cute. We'll get those back Aug. 10th so everyone can enjoy them. They are really adorable. He's been pretty funny lately. He runs all around in his walker and bangs himdelf into everything! He likes to pull the kitchen towel down from the fridge or cabinet and soothe his poor gums by sticking it in his mouth. Well, what doesn't go in his mouth?!?! Everywhere we go people are enamored with him but no one as much as Mommy and Daddy!
