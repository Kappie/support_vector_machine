Will you consider that as "wear and tear"?  Or just a case of no-durability, or rather, a defective good?  I considered it as defective good, and since I was not too free to make the trip down to the store, I waited till one week.  The clause of the shop being, any good that was defective should be changed within 7 days.  Good, one week, 7 days.  When I got there, I was told a different story - 1 week later is considered the 8th day.  HELLO!  And plus they are unwilling to make an exchange - RULES CANNOT BE BROKEN DUH?  Well I pity the sales assistant, its not her fault.  And under the wallet's brand warranty, I should be able to get it repaired for free by the manufacturer.  But I don't want to wait!  Simply because I still think I bought a defective good!  However I notice that I cannot bargain for a better deal, and she had already consulted her manager to brush me off with servicing the wallet and I can collect it after X days.  (X is unknown of course, she said that depended on the manufacturing company itself.  CRAP!)  I told her I would like to speak to her manager - if she can't decide, I want to speak to the one that can.  She was hesistant, but I refused to leave.    Sales Assistant: My manager says no. Me: *smiles* I would like to speak to your manager. :) Sales Assistant: My manager has already instructed me that we cannot exchange for you. Me: *raised brow* I would like to speak to your manager.  Sales Assistant: *irritated* I already called her just now and she said no! Me: *more assertive tone now* I would like to speak to your manager.  Sales Assistant: *face darkened, and dials the number, hands over phone to me grudgingly.*  Although its not her fault I am most annoyed that she was only too happy to get rid of me with the "NOPE IM SORRY" excuse.  She was not at all emphathetic, like trying to imply I spoil the damn thing and I'm trying to cheat their company by refunding or something.  She took the stern approach and I dislike it.  She's in the service industry.  Heck she doesn't know much manners does she?    Manager: yeah? Me: I think your gal has already told you about the wallet incident? Manager: Nevermind I think its better for you to tell me what happened. Me: *Repeat my story.* Manager: I am sure my girl can tell the difference between wear and tear, or manufacturing defect. Me: Miss....its the zip that fell off....do you seriously think I have some cow-strength or something to pull it off like that?!!   Manager: .......... Me: It's only a week, even if you insist thats 8 days your shop did not specifically said so.  The instruction was ambiguous.   Manager: er..I will speak to my girl.  *hands phone to shop assistant.*  Sales Assistant: *exchanges the wallet with a bored look.*  Me: Thank you. *smiles*  Left the shop.
