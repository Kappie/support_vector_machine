He makes me ridiculously happy. Which, inturn, makes me ridiculously sad when he leaves. I can't wait till after exams when I go camping with him...he is so god damn sexxy. James is THE SEX! hehe...he promised me nakedness when I come and visit...which is awesome!!  I don't love Dave anymore...maybe its cause he has been away so long (suspended for streaking) but I am losing interest in him...I heart James so much!  Rugby is awesome...although today I over-exurted myself and was sick :( I slept through math class...my teacher gave me permission "If you are sleeping you won't be talking" So I am going to sleep in math class for the rest of the year :)  At lunch I was sleeping on a picnic table at the Fry Hut and Eric slapped my ass really hard and it hurt.   Okay...I think I am done...for now...  Chera
