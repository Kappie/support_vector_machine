For an instant the movie seemed as if it would be a regular "whodunit" but took an unexpected twist. It'll have you talking about it for hours. The acting was good, and the scares were even better. I strongly recommend seeing this movie, but not alone."  my thoughts exactly. memento was another movie i had to google. but yeah, if you haven't seen either, go.
