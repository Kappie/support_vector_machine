Every since the pic below, there's always been one of us missing... i missed my sister's wedding, but the boys were there... i went with the boys to miami, but kimmie wasn't with us... it's so annoying...  we were all supposed to get together this weekend for sky's birthday party... but je took LAST weekend off because he had the dates confused, and he won't be able to come up for 3 weeks!  Kimmie can't come up in 3 weeks cuz she took THIS weekend off, and, after that, Teddie is starting a new position as an EMT and he can't pic and choose his days off... so whaaaaa...  at least kimmie, teddie, robbie, and sheena will be up this weekend... robbie's best friend, bryan, (NOT my husband, lol) is coming, too.  i've cancelled sky's birthday party. we are still going to chuck e cheese, but it is going to be a surprise shower for kimmie instead. she THINKS it's a birthday party for sky, haha...   urlLink    this is a pic of the last time all four of us (my bros and sis kimmie, who is taking the pic) were together... this pic was taken in feb 2001 when i was a newlywed and newly preg with baby anthony... the bald guy with the belly is my (ex) husband...also known on this page as... veggie, ant, anthony, bryan and jackass lol  urlLink
