(a desire which sends chills up my spine. one horrific haircut was when all of my hair was the same exact length if i tilted my head a certain way. another was when someone decided i'd look good with bangs...) yet what she did is simple and safe.  and now i'm free from haircuts for another year!   -- the whole ordeal reminded me that i love the hair washing bit.  is it possible for strangers with scissors to only wash my hair?  perhaps this would require my adoption of an old-lady-do', for a weekly wash'n style without the taint of scissors....
