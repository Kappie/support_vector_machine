and so..i walked back..and so such a long queue at the side of the wall,i was wondering why they need to queue up..i felt scared and so shy, didn't know what to do really actually..so stupidly i looked..just followed behind the queue lol..haha..infront of me stand this girl, wearin black long sleeve shirt and jeANs..then i remembered our OGL huixiang whom i talked to on phone before i went to the first day orientation, said we cannot wear white shirts..luckily i remembered yah..the girl infront of me, looked so fierce and a bit proud..i wanted to talk to her, but she did not seem to want to talk to me haha=.=..any way i was sleepy too so i hecked care =.=..and then we stand and stand for quite some time..then came two person, one guy one gal..they are so noisy..the only two noisy people in the queue standing behind me..felt like punching them..okie haha anyways..then later on we kind of registered and went into the theatre of arts and sit down in groups after we all have received our nametacks to stick on our shirt..i was  SOoo  surpriseD when i recognised my workplace friend, his name is zeke, at the doorway..oh yeah cool, he's one of the ogls haha..i kept looking at him, i think he noticed me also lolx i don't remember..then i sat down in this queue..then to my surprise(again), the fierce girl standing infront of me just now in the queue is sitting in front of me now..awww..okie thats coincident..then i sit and waited..more people came in..some looked hot, pretty, cute..wonder why some people still wear skirts or high heel shoes when they are told not to wear them??!?! okie..then i was really sleepy..the fierce girl talked to the girl sitting in front of her..behind me is another guy(which i forgot is who)..then i was left alone.. when we were prepared to stand up and leave for the roof top to play ice-breaker games..i walked alone at first.. and the fierce girl suddenly turned back(scared me) and talked to me..heh heh i was so happy lolx..we exchanged introductions and now i know the fierce girl's name is called nancy and the girl whom she talked to first is called dorothy but she prefferred being called haruko..mm..well, nancy ain't a fierce girl after all lolx..she's nice and friendly actually haha..to fast to give conclusions..okie..then we played the games..all of us introduced ourselves..and there are these two guys, weeleong and ridz..they were the damn noisy one..and irritating one lolx(i've told ridz before)..i wanted to punch them !!!
