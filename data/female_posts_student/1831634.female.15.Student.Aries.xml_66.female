I like my gap dress.  skew.  so now I am in various states of undress.  whoo.  we went to the DMA for the field trip!  I got to skip the greater half of orchestra.  go me!  then yesterday I got to leave rehearsals early, so I only really played for 5 minutes.  go me!  wheee.   at the dma, I took the contemporary tour!  I saw jackson pollocks.  =)  his painting all look suspiciously similar... haha.  I learned lots of interesting things about jackson pollock.  and then I saw some mondrians!  which is always cool.  then some picassos and the candy exhibit!  awesome, man.  louisa and I stole so much candy...  hehe.  louisa is so cool.  and on the bus rides, we fantasized about banquet dresses.  we were being so girly.  it was fun.  then we got back to jasper and we were so tired.  we did nothing!  then we went to the counselor together.  some really wacked up things, man.  then eighth period, during which I was completely dead.  but that's okay.  nothing ever happens in french, anyways.  then I went to bio tutorials with jack and grace and she went to take the hum test.  then we waited for her dad to come pick us up and irene and aarthi talked about ranks and I learned some very common very wrong perceptions.  it was very interesting, all in all.  then yesterday I was very messed up.  but it was all good.  I ran into bio to look at the slides, then there was an ESOL class in there, and it was interesting.  then I went to algebra where I got my report card.  blaergh.  but I can't really bring myself to care about it all that much.  then today on the walk to sonic, chuan was telling me about a talk ning had with him in humanities.  guess what it was about?  yar.  so anyway, he was like, "she said that kailing and I should conviently get lost so jack and sunny can spend some time together."  and I was like awwww, maaaaaaaaaaan.  and I told him some stuff, too.  =)  hehe.  it was very funny.  egads.  anyway, he blabbed. so yeah.  I can't wait until may 8!  it will be oodles of fun.  and then I got home and read a RK fic.  and now I'm like, hmm.  I think I'm in denial about my feelings.  and I know I'm in denial.  but as long as I am in denial, I don't feel it.  like, I can raelly stop myself from feeling things.  it is strange.  but once I take away teh denial, I know I'll feel it.  so my denial is just up.... and up... and up.  until I know the feeling is gone.  then I can be out of denial.  =)  so I'm pretty sure I HAVE liked ppl before, but I've never liked them.  if that makes sense.  but of course, I'm not sure sure because of that denial.  haha.  it's like I'm living in one big dream.  the most esoteric book I've read is the history of mankind.  published in 1921, the first newbery award book ever.
