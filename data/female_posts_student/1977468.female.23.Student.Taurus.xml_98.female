I'd come in and be like "You wouldn't  believe  what happened at the office today..." and the fish would just be open and receptive to anything I'd have to say. And it would depend on me, and yet through my shortcomings be content. I would read it books on fish hygeine, and frolic with it.  Because my fish is the best there is, it would deserve the name of a god. Rathyngardandamandadon! Brilliant. Thats pronounced Rath-yn-gar-dan-da-dam-an-dan-da-don. I'd tell people he was the incarnate of the Gaelic god of War and Awesome. I would construct for him a throne of stone from which he would reign the far reaches of his 1 gallon tank. Perhaps if he gained favor with me, I would buy for him some fish concubines. Neons perhaps. Hot little harlots if I ever met a harlot fish.  I love fish. If people were more like fish we wouldn't have war and drugs and pornography. I mean I've never seen  a fish work a camera before! The world would be so ideal... so serene! We'd bump into each other mindlessly, our fragile existences merely accenting the ebbs and tides of the astral plane. And when feeding time comes, look out folks! thats when things get crazy! it's like an awesome game where if you lose, you starve.   And when a fellow fish gets sick, well, bonus meal. Everyone's happy! I mean, its not like we knew him. He was the new guy. You either handle the shock of rehabitation or you don't, its the unwritten law of the tank. Maybe we should write it down anyhow, just for the legality aspect of it. Someone is bound to get upset. Probably a dumbass guppy.
