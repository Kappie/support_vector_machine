Unfortunately for me, I only got to ride for 30 minutes because I started getting a headache... but the 30 minutes I was riding were absolutely awesome!!!  We all wanna go do it again... and actually Ricky and I were looking at used waverunners for sale on Ebay.  Hehehe  They're expensive... but we were thinking if we split the cost of one that'd be awesome!  Dude... Mike is a crazy guy behind the steering handles of the wave runner!  It was fun, though.  Our waverunner (the 3 seater) tipped over 2 times... that guy told us the 3 seater wouldn't tip over... he SO lied to us!  Twas interesting getting back onto the waverunner, though... my first attempt took me awhile... I did better with my second time getting back on, I think.  At least it was more entertaining for Mike and Ricky to see.  hehe  ; )  Everyone who was there knows what I'm talking about.  Poor Mikey got a big knot on his head from the back end of the waverunner hitting him in the head when he had fallen off....  Oy!  As for me, I got misc. bruises on my legs and a couple scrapes... but nothing that wouldn't provide an awesome story and memory.  The whole time we were riding Ricky kept yelling, "There's a boat!  Somebody help them... PLEASE!!!"  It was hilarious!  Anyhow, tomorrow is my first day of classes... and I'm not looking forward to it at all... but at least I can rest assured that work will probably go more smoothly.  :-)  I'm growing to love the kids already... they're just so fun!!!  So, I go to class from 8-noon... and then I work from 2:15-6:15pm... I can't wait to tell Greg about my Canyon Lake weekend... he'll think it's funny... especially if I show him my 'battle wounds.'  Anyhow, that's all for now... anyone who wasn't with us this weekend missed out big time, man!!!  Maybe next time, eh...?
