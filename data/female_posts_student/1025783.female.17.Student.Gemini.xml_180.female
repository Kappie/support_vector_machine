Dress up in cheesy eighties clothes and sing along to Blink's "First Date" 2.) Put doll clothes on your dog (specially good if you have a four pound poodle) 3.) Put random pieces of clothing in the refrigerator and see how many people comment 4.) Play Monopoly with you parents and on your first turn run away and see what they do. 5.) FLush the toilet 23 times in a row...it gets really hypnotic 6.) Put on headphones and walk around the house pretending to listen to music. When your parents comment on the fact you have no cd player with you, look at them alarmed and go, "but where's the music coming from then?!" 7.) Sing along to Carol Burnett's "Little GIrls" and beat your barbies while doing it (for more realistic results, throw back a coupla bottles of Vodka before) 8.) See how many articles of clothing you can put on at one time. 9.)Sit outside on your driveway and wave at passing by cars...see how many people you can get to wave back. 10.) Ask your parents what this "sex" is that you've been hearing about at school...act dead serious, and really confused. 11.) Speak in old English, and when someone says something, exclaim loudly, "OFF WITH HIS HEAD!" and chase the person till they threaten to call the cops...then you run away. 12.) See how many different pop-up ads you can get in one minute on different websites, hold contests with your friends. 13.) Make pointless lists like I am right now 14.) Watch Disney Movies, and find all the similarites in them...there's a ton trust me. 15.) Play video games until you get a blister...it takes a long time 16.) Fill up socks with marbles and see how far you can hurl them. 17.) Hide behind a shrub or on a balcony and throw pebbles at passer-byers. If they look over, smile and say, "Merry CHristmas you bastards!" and then hide. 18.) FInd the top ten funniest/randomist words in the dictionary ex:lignite 19.) Make a top ten list of the poppiest pop songs. ex: Dream, he loves not; No Secrets, Kidz in AMerica 20.) Watch ALL of the Bond movies, and start quoting them on a regular basis.
