I wanna be my own boss and reap the profits (or loss...) that I rightfully deserve!        I've been thinking of putting up a business connected to my core competency...which is  fashion . I'm lucky my roomies and I share the same passion. We all would like to be partners someday and create a  fashion empire .I can imaginewalking down the runway with my three other friendsin our uber  fashionable clothes! Well, were starting small with pajamas. This is actually Tin-tin's(my roomie)baby since she's been doing it for awhile. She had one made for me for my last birthday. We hope to conquer the jammy world!        I almost backed out going through with this but thanks to our entrepreneurship mentor really pushed me to pursue this. This is my first step to being an entrepreneur and a fashion mogul!
