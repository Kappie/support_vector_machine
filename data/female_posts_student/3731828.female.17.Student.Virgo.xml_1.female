I drank a bit too much and got bitten by lots of mosquitos. I also fell down some stairs and now I've got two huge bruises in my leg. good thing I was drunk so i didn't feel anything. :p But overall I had a very fun juhannus. :) I just don't feel like drinking again for a while...  I can't wait to see the photos that I took. I remember taking only 7 photos, but when I checked my camera this morning I noticed that I (or some of my friends) have taken 24 pictures... Hopefully there aren't any bad surprises among the pics.
