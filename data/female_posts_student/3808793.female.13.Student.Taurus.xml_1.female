It's called Inofittive because it sounded like a cool name at 4:00 AM.  Got it?  Riiiiiiight.  Inofittive is called Inofittive because, and now, listen carefully- Inofittive is called Inofittive because that's what you get when you combine the opposite of 'out of it' with 'innovative'. Not that this blog is either of those. Now that you're here, try to enjoy it. Read a post or two, or three. Write a comment, send me hate mail...you get the idea. Mainly speaking, try to stay alive.  --  Righto. If you recognized that paragraph, you are a cool guy and have officially played HalfQuake Amen. If you didn't recognize that paragraph, you need to go play HQA right now. Then, and only then, you shall become a cool guy. Or girl. Or transvestite. Whatever.  What REALLY is Inofittive? Someone was like "hey, you're a decent writer. you should start a blog." and I was like "hell no." and they were like "i'll kill you in your sleep if you don't." and I was like "well, ok."   As for the actual content, it's basically whatever I want to put here. Reviews, stories, etc. "REVIEWS, you say?! What makes you a critic?!" you say. Nothing. I ate, drank, played, saw, met someone, listened to something and decided to write a review of it.   Don't like it? Don't read it. No, seriously. Go away. You smell.  Also, please note I probably won't review anything I either didn't really like or really hate. If you want me to review something, comment about it. Maybe I will.  Now then, sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. Except you're going to have to click the links yourself, I'm not doing that for you. Gross.
