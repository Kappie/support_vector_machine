Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army Tiger Army  Enough of that.  I love their new CD. I think it's been long enough so I can say I really really enjoy it. It's so much more mellow and at first I thought I wouldn't like it but I was proved wrong. Horray. Fred Hell can't play though, that's sad. I was so worried they wouldn't be able to do Warped but they are. Horray again.  I'm just nervous about Warped Tour. I really don't... like  any of the bands playing. Just Tiger Army. Bad Religion's pretty good, as is Anti-Flag. Maybe Flogging Molly will be cool. That's about all that comes to mind. We're All Broken isn't showing up on the Warped Tour website so are they going to be there or not?  I don't really want to admit to going to Warped Tour. (Sorry.) But I'm not missing one of my favorite bands coming to Virginia. Nobody ever comes to Virginia.  I'm worried though because I imagine Warped Tour will just be a bunch of teenager girls panicing when they see their favorite pop punk band. You know those type of people? And they always crowd up, trying to get to the front so it gets all crazy and stupid.  Stupid teenage girls.  Too bad I am a teenage girl.  I'm just saying most of the people there will be like that. I THINK. I don't know. I've never been.  Shelby will want to see a lot of the bands I don't really like, I know. Story of the Year, Yellowcard and all that jazz. I won't bail out on her or anything though, I probably wouldn't be able to find her if I left. Oh yeah, I just remember nofx should be good.  Anyway. What was I saying? Shelby likes bands I don't like. Yeah. Well whatever.   I'm so bored. So bored bored bored bored bored bored bored. I was so bored I typed that more than needed. I need somewhere to go.   Oh yeah I hear Catwoman is bad. Hahahaha. I so knew it. I love being right. From the first time I saw the preview I knew it'd be lousy. The average critic vote on Yahoo is D+. Oh man. Hahaha. That's so sad.     Music: He Who Laughs Last... - AFI
