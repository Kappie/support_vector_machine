Five for Fighting Radiohead Aha No Use for a Name Cranberries, The Eagles, The Strokes, The Coldplay Apex Theory, The   2) Have you ever had a song written about you? A famous one involving my name... and then an attempt to a song by a little-known individual *shakes head in retrospect*  3) What song makes you cry? Quite a few, but possibly "The Cadillac of the Skies" or "Your Congratulations" by Alanis Morissette  4) What song makes you happy? I know this is really backwards, but "Your Horoscope for Today" by Weird Al and "Life's Gonna Suck" by Denis Leary are in the list. Then, can't beat Bobby McFerrin's "Don't Worry, Be Happy". Then there's also "African Herbman" and "Buffalo Soldier" of Marley's, and can't forget "No Woman, No Cry" and "One Love". Then, there's "U R" by Alanis Morrisette... and "Steven's Last Night in Town" by Ben Folds Five, and last but not least, "Witch Doctor" by the Cartoons (what?! I like that song!!)  5) What do you like to listen to before bed? Depends on my mood, but often Radiohead's  Pablo Honey  or anything Badly Drawn Boy.  6)Name a song by Coal Chamber: "Empty Jar", though I don't remember what it sounds like. I never was really into that kind of stuff at all, but Renee used to be...   7) Who was/were your idol/s when you were younger? 12 years ago: Christian, a dude we knew who played the piano  enchantingly  10 years ago: Blur! Now: Blur, still! I know, odd. Uhh, well, I actually listen to a wide range of stuff, but I still love Blur, although I will have to include that Coldplay is an unbelievably talented group in general. For individuals, I'd have to say that the pianist of Ben Folds Five was unbelievable, the drummer of 311 kicks total butt, Graham Coxon remains one of the best guitarists in my book (Hendrix taken for granted, but I guess you know that), Joshua Bell- no words there, 311's bass, again, is awesome, and well, what can I say? I love Damon's voice...   8) First album you ever bought?  Hmmm... with  my  money out of my own pocket? I think it was Radiohead's  OK Computer , actually.    Okay, I've been digressing from my homework for entirely too long, although I still haven't a possible clue over how to write up that infernally stupid lab.
