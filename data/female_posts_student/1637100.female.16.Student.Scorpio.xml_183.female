The only thing you like to get out of romances are the passionate kisses and make-out sessions. Well, at least the perverted wretches like you.  Not that I don't like you, that is. No offense meant! You are seductive, attractive, and playful.    urlLink What Kind of Romantic Are You? (for girls)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     You are the Piano. You sophisticated devil, you. You are a proud bird, a classy chick, a debonare... well, you ge the idea. Most of the people you socialize with are just mere aquantances, you have very few true friends. The ones you do have are close, though, and they know that underneath your hard, glossy exterior, you are just a delicate instrument.    urlLink Which Musical Instrument Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Ah, you have a very...unique interest in guys. Often going for the bad-guy in movies, who are good-guys in life. Aw, what a sweetheart you must be. You have the perfect boyfriend(or maybe you HAD him) and would do anything for him. You believe in the saying: love is a many splendid thing! Love is like oxygen! Love lifts us up where we belong! Keep up that attitude, girl, and cherish every moment of love. Because you never know what could happen, and with a guy like you've got, you should never take chances. Live life and have fun! Your world doesn't revolve around him, but you're still crazy in love. Just keep that balance and whatever you do DON'T lose your friendship w/that guy. He's a sweetie and a lifesaver. One of the precious few perfect guys.    urlLink What guy are you totally in love with?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     interesting.. i like the seductive lover one.. ;) =P
