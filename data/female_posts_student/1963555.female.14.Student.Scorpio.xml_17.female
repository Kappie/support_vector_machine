So live it up, we arn't gonna have another one for 7 years!! so what's up? That's cool. I think the only thing bad today would be..... Walk to World Civ. I was talking to Dacia and she was getting pissed at this chick that was walking really slow. And we were gonna be late but I was like who cares beacuse that class sucks. She gets alll oh no were late and freaking out so I simply said calm down it's just World Civ. It's not that big of a deal. I wasn't giving her a bitchy attitude or anything and she's like "Why do you have to be such a BITCH!!" I was like whoe! I wasn't trying to be mean.But we had a good laugh about it on the phone later. We kept immitating and screaming Bitch into the phone laughing. It's all good! lol yeah......
