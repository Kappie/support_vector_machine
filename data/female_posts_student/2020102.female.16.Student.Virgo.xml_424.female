I never changed it, not even to my ownblog (I have my own account - Windows XP - so I could do that), but I haven't, because I've grown rather attatched to good ol' Netscape.com. I love looking at all the pointless headlines and reading aboutall theretarded things they consider "Need to Know."For example, Jessica Simpson has started a fashion craze in Argentina!And - get ready for this - drinking pool water is  bad for you! I've always thought that Netscape.com was a little ridiculous, especially when they put headlines about the war on terror in the same list as the"Monkey now walking on 2 legs" headline.   But no more! No, today, I am changed, for when I read the headline going with  urlLink this  story, I discovered the true meaning of "Need to Know."
