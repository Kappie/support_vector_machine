So today i took a shower, got ready, did all that junk and went over to amez then me and her and michael went to DF so they could find out what their new parking pass was. I think i have amez' memorized. it's 372 which is pretty good apparently so she's happy. Then we all went to Wendy's for lunch b/c we are poor. When i say poor i mean like we had 3 dollars poor. So we went to wendy's cuz the dollar value menu rocks right allie? Then we just drove around like past the dam and all then he dropped me and amez off so she could get ready. I did her make up and omg, i've never done anyone's makeup before and i did a terrific job, so if i need money or something, i might sell mary kay or work for clinique or something.   Then I came home and mis parentes y yo went to drop my lil bro off at ACX and then we got lizards thicket. On the way back from ACX, my mom decides to start in on me about how i'm fat and i need to join a gym. Well lets see, i'm 5'4" and i weigh 120 pounds. Last time i checked that was normal, and oh yeh, no one thinks i'm fat cept her. oh did i mention my mom's like practically anorexic? yeh she's 43 and she weighs a whopping 94 lbs. very nice. Anyway i yelled at her so it's okay now i guess. Ooohhhh guess what? I think my family is going on a cruise during spring break this year and my daddy said amez might be able to come. Me gusta b/c we will have soo much fun. Well that's about it. i gotta go see if Jared dropped off my pics. This could be scary, walking outside to my mailbox at 10:30. Well I gots to go cuz i'm off to Mr.Bill's tomorrow to help watch his kids. By the way, his house is off the chain! It's humungous! K that's all. Buenos noches!  liz
