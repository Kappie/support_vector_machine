Day 1 of eating regularly, though I don't think it was particularly successful by the time I finished with dinner. Ate in the hospital cafeteria: no rice, but pork, fries and what didn't look like old peach pie. Also had an ice cream. So there, I've ruined it. I'm somewhat lighter, though not considerably. I wonder how long it's going to last, but really, I'm not that hungry right now so I shan't care.  I pulled out all the post-its in my Harper's today and I found an Emerson quote: "Ne te quoesiveris extra." Yay. I just need to be strong and get through everything that bothers me.   I'm going to go look for a poem, so I'm going to quit posting--not like I've written anything great today anyways.
