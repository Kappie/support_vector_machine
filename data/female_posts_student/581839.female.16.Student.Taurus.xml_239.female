GREEEATTT... i don't think i'll ever write those stories i said i would write about earlier. soo, you'll just have to spend your whole life wondering what on earth i was talking about, and if it was serious, and if it would have changed your life.  i'm starting to freak out cause i can't find my CD case, and i didn't take it out of the car. either meaning it's been stolen, or it's been stolen. either way, it's bad. jordan may have taken it, but she says she didn't. so WHERE did it go? i'll have NO CD's for europe, how terrible. that's what i LIVE off of. greeattt... better go eat pastrami, clean my room, dream, write, pack, read, and search for my CD case. which i want back.
