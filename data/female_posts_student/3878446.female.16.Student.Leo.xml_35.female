See, two of my friends are going out. Which is awkward, you'd understand why if you knew these two. And no one else in our little group of friends understands why they are going out, because they don't have a boyfriend/girlfriend realationship, all they do is kiss and hold hands and make out. I dunno, it's just weird, and everyone is just waiting for them to break it off, which will only make things worse for the rest of us because then two of our friends won't want to hang out with the other as much if at all. I don't know how to explain it all but it's just weird, and I'm sick of it. ANYWAYS, the point of my story, We went to Enchanted Village ( Water Park an hour from Seattle) and I got sick of watching my friends make out so I laid down, put a towel over my face, and then fell asleep, in the sun, therefore getting burned. I was so red, it was sick, now it's just my shoulders that are red, but they still hurt...a lot. So there is yet another story from my camp experience. More updates later...
