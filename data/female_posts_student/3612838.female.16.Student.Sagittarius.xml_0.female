I was so much astounded to think I enjoyed a lot better compared to my past summer vacays.  I really never thought this kind of lunatic escapade could be a more enjoyable one. I just think I'm not anymore into the usual stuff of indulging in some adrenaline-rushing kind. Well, who would agree with me???? But the fact that I enjoyed being just simply laid-back and lazy is something really indulging..  Oh, I'm getting nearer zany but all I know at this point is that, I wanna go back to the province and have fun with my cousins!
