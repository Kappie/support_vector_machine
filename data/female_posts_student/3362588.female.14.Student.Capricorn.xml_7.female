We went on this bird watching thing today at Round Valley lake.  It was pretty fun.  We all got a pair of binoculars and a nird (whoops, that's supposed to bird.  ha) feeding chart.  I zoomed in on people faces, it was fun.   Oh, and I didn't have to do algebra today either!  muahahahahaha.  Clarisa renamed her blue jay, it's new name is Pukey 'cause it pukes.  It doesn't swallow all it's food, it just keeps it in his beak and then when your not looking splatters it all over you.  It's really sicko.   I looked up Jack's Musings on google to see if my blog would come up, but no...  It came up with some friar's blog.  A friar with a blog?  How weird.   haha, there's this article that tells what to do if your mom discovers your blog.  It says that instead of saying you got drunk last night, say you got marshmallowed and your mom will never notice.  yeah right.   So what am I doing right now?  I'm touching up a photo of me to put on my blog.  Let's see...  We'll give me perfect eyebrows....  A flawless complexion.... Should I be wearing makeup or not????  Hmmmm.....Not.  That flawless skin is coming round really nicely.  Bless you Photoshop.   Well, must run. Signing out - Jack the Great  P.S.  don't tell anyone the picture is touched up a bit.  hehe.  You can show it to all your good looking single male friends.  okay okay, i'm just joking, relax.  I mean, why would someone who looks like me need that kind of advirtisment?   Fine then, break my bubble.  I'm leaving..........  merrrrmaid.....  muahaha
