That reminds me!  My life is now complete!  I now know someone (more or less) named Von.  There was a mild case of mistaken identity but I HAVE PREVAILED and know EVERYTHING (nothing) about him!  MUWAHAHAHA!!!!  *cough* Yeah. Anyways. Neil Young.  Who is neil young?  I know he's famous, and I'm fairly certain it's for being musically gifted, but....  *shrugs*  Eh.  Not everyone can be so completely sophisticated in their musical tastes. JUST KIDDING.  I'm really not that much of a jerk, most of the time.  I think I have to be going, I'll probably post again during Health.  BYE!
