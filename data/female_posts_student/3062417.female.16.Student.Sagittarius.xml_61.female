And then I went to Kayla's and this is were the fun/bad part comes in. I met Raik. Who was Carol's date. And he was absolutely gorgeous. Well we took pictures at Kayla's house.   Then we went to the Grand March. I just watched it. And then we went to get into our  SUV LIMO  and who did I see? Gavin and Gregg. I almost started crying I freaked out so bad. Well, after I got over that, is where the real fun began.   We got to the prom and just hung out at our table talking. And then we ate. After that we did some awesome dancing and it was so much fun! And I got to hang out with all my awesome friends! And I got to make a new friend. Raik is an awesome person and I'm so happy that he went to prom with Carol. Well I danced with Alex Sike twice. It was really weird. I don't even know the kid.   Well, after the awesome prom, we got back into the limo and drove around for a while. Then we went to Denny's and I had and oreo sundae.   Then we rode around some more and went back to Mike Noeth's house. I finally changed out of my dress and into my bathing suit. I went in the 5 person hot tub with 12 other people. I guess you could say it was a bit crowded. We were all just hanging out when something I realized something really bad/good. Raik had been hitting on me all night. So there I am, sitting in the hot tub, with Raik's arm around me and Carol swimming in the pool not knowing what to do or say and feeling completely uncomfortable. And I can't say that I hated the fact that he was hitting on me but I did hate the fact that he was Carol's date and I couldn't flirt back with him. So I talked to Carol about him flirting with me and how I had no intentions of flirting back and she didn't seem to believe me. At all.   So we got out of the hot tub and I changed into regular clothes and went down into Mike's basement and played some pool. Where Raik continued to flirt with me even when Carol was right in front of me. And I could tell that Carol was getting more and more mad at  me  every second. Not mad at Raik for hitting on me. Mad at me for Raik hitting on me. Things like that are out of my control. I couldn't help it.   So I avoided Raik for the rest of the night until Carol was out of the room and then I talked to him. I told him how Carol is really mad at me because she thinks that I had been flirting with Raik all night and how he should stop flirting with me for the rest of the night and he said, "I know that Carol expected something more out of this but I just like her as a friend, but you..." and then he stopped talking and just looked at me and I could tell what he was trying to say. He didn't even have to say it, I knew.   So then at around 6 AM Carol's mom picked us up from Mike's and she brought us home. What an akward ride home that was. So I go to get out of the car and what do I say to Raik? "It was nice meeting you Raik." How geeky that was. What I really wanted to do was give him a giant hug and get his screen name so I could still talk to him and be friends with him but I couldn't. That would have hurt Carol way to much and Carol is my best friend. I can't do anything to hurt her. I really hope that Carol doesn't hate me. It's really not my fault and I feel so so bad about it.   So I finally got to sleep at around 7 AM and I got up at 2 so that makes 6 hours of sleep and being awake for 25 hours straight.  So other than that whole big thing, prom was the best night of my life. I had fun with all my friends and it was wicked awesome!  Right now I'm talking to Heidi, Josh, and Molly and being bored and wondering how bad school is going to be tomorrow.  Does anyone know what I should do about Carol probally hating me now? Does anyone think that I did something wrong? What should I say to Carol? Should I still talk to Raik? Someone please please help me!
