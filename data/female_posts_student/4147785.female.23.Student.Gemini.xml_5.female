As of a year ago, I moved to Alpine,TX and am currently attending Sul Ross State University and am enrolled in the Veterinary Technician Program. Last year I was Vice President of the Sul Ross Veterinary  Technician Association which involved setting up fundraisers for 'continuing education' trips to the Southwest Veterinary Symposium. Not only did our fundraisers benefit the students, but the community as well by doing weekend 'bath  dips' for dogs  cats to help keep them bug free! We were extremly successful and hopefully will be again this next year. Along with going to school full time I am also working a couple of different jobs as a bartender and waitress. This allows me to meet newcomers in Alpine and to get to know the ol' timers as well. Friends have been hard to come by (for me) in the past, but here...in this remote town....there's always someone willing to help. In the past year I have lived in three different places, and just last week moved into my fourth home. My roomate/co-worker, Robbi, has become a really close friend of mine and I don't know what I'd do without her. Molly also lives with us...she's become our security system/alarm. For those of ya'll who haven't met Molly, she's a 13mth old Great Pyrenees mix weighing in at about 85lbs. She's a little underweight and allergic to everything under the sun, so we've put her on a weight gaining diet which, hopefully, will work. She's also NOT the brightest crayon in the box and has some NOT so intellgent moments, which Robbi and I have dubbed "Molly Moments". Her slow thinking is a result of one of her owner's 'blonde moments'...of which we will not discuss.
