I feel so cool!  The rockin' part is: her vagina was nice to me, w00t w00t!  In odd news (and yes, I stole this from  urlLink The Unlucky Guy ) the following seaches have brought people to my blog:  "don diva" "peel offs vertical happy birthday" "dapper don" "don and the diva" "dynamite diva" "partly cloudy patriot track listing" "quotes by guster  dispatch" "scottish flag tattoos" (I don't have one, but I need one final tatoo and that sounds f-ing badass!) "cute lil quotes" (spelled lil, like I usually spell it) "burton air snowboard"  I wonder what else will bring people here.  Gary seems to get some crazy, nutty dirty searches to his blog, I'm waiting for those to come here so I can laugh.   Again, I said it yesterday, but in case you didn't hear me the first time:   go listen to Pat McGuire ...go, NOW!  Well not right now, 'cause I'm still writing, but after you're done reading this.    Tonight is Andrew's birthday party at the house.  It shoudl be a good time.  We're all gonna get crazy snotted (that seems to be the theme for this week) hopefully I will not end up booting this time like I did last weekend.  His birthday present  still  hasn't arrived which is really annoying, but he'll have to deal, 'cause its so awesome and he'll love it and its funny 'cause he still has absolutely NO clue what it is.    I have really not been even remotely entertaining in weeks.  I suck.  Sorry, childrens.  For those of you from  urlLink  a strange place  you might remember my "Into the Diva's Toybox" thread.  A new one of those is in the works and will be hopefully as entertaining as it was last time.  And we're planning a safari into the filthy, smelly bedroom of an almost twenty-something boy (namely my stoney cheeba-monkey brother).  If you guys have anything you'd like investigated that a) wont put me in too much eminent danger, b) doesn't involve feces or c) wouldn't be too expensive to experiment let me know and I'll start a weekly post with the findings of my investigations.  (Think Geraldo exposes only twice as seedy and trashy).    I'm out, catch you all on the flipside!
