It really pisses me off, damit! I look really close minded, when I actually have like 10 other bands that I like, and are different types of music. HUZZUH! My day will probably be incredibly boring again, because everyone is gone including TV Hannah, my parents, and James, my older brother. They are all at a garage sale, selling shit. I am listening to the old Madonna right now, the song is Material Girl. I have to go and waste my pathetic life.  -Sierra
