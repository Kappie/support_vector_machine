All of it. no really. Me sitting in my room thinking that all is well, is crap. Thinking that i'm a pretty good friend, thats bigger crap. If i were a good friend, i would have friends... For people who might be reading this... which there is like no one reading this i'm sure. Yal' are good people. REally. Good people. But i'm not a friend. I dont call. I dont hang out. I dont do anything. Yet i wonder why i sit around thinking i want to go out. And i can't think of anyone to go with. Is this me feeling sorry for myself? Yep...Probley. Its a waste of time. Trying to make it in this world. maybe i'm just upset cause i can't make it. I mean i can't make it now. I can't keep a relationship going? Why do i even try?
