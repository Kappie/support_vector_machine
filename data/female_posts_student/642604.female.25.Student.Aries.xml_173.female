This is a site I have to come to use as a PC user (itunes for PC users will be released later this year but until then this is the best alternative) to download cheap and legal music.  You can download by song or download by album.  I have recently purchased three albums at $9.99 each instead of paying the $12.99 to $18.99 they would've cost me in the store.  Songs I believe are anywhere between $0.79 to $1.79.  I personally love this site, although I enjoy itunes much more and will probably switch to them when the PC version comes out.  Just go to the website and read the step by step processes.  You can download the music, open up a program such as Windows Media Player and burn your cd right from there.  It's cost effective and more importantly it's legal!  The RIAA will not be coming after you for using this one.  And in my opinion the best part is you can download and have it right away without having to even get in your car.  Couldn't hurt to check out and unless you are addicted to the space consuming jewel cases with the liner notes it is a nice alternative.
