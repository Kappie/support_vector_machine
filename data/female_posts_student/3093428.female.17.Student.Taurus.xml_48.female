Well, today is, for me, the 12th annual Whiteside Spring Fair (only because I've been to it every year since kindergarten), so this is the 12th time I've been. I brought my brother considering he goes there, and it was great. My grade seven teacher says to me (in french, of course): "Oh Samantha, nice hair colour! It seems to change every time I see you." Pfft...figures...I come back to Whiteside all the time, and I dye my hair at least once a month or so. I expect I'll be seeing bald patches soon.  So other than that, I've had an overall great week. Lots of acting--our one acts were Wednesday and there's another showing tomorrow night...McRoberts...7 pm...entrance by donation...be there or be circular. CIRCULAR, MAN!  Anyway, Matt is cool. And in the words of the famous Martha Stewart: Rock the Casbah. Wait, that wasn't Martha Stewart, was it? Heh. Good old Martha Stewart...
