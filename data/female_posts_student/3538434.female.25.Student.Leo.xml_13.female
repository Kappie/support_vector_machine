Personally, I like to keep my body busy with loads of activities (walk, blade, cycle, run, swim, softball, yoga, etc..) Keeps it and my brain happy. i thought it would be cool to talk about how we all compose with the daily realitiy of physical activity, what makes us feel good and why.   Since we`re talking about that and since I LOVE gelato, what do you say we all get some ice cream, have a chat while we`re there and then decide if we want to just go for a walk after that or if it`s crappy, we`ll relocate to an indoor location, maybe the Manx or the Pump.  So we`ll meet up at PURE GELATO on Elgin Street. I`ll have my cell if need be: 371-6352 @ 7:30 for ice cream, and probably move out of there by about 8:15 @ the latest.  See you then! Don`t wear lipschtick, we're licking some ice cream.....   Anne-Sophie.
