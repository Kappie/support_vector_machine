So I'm there chilling (because the rest of the household is in Freetown and the asylum seeking aunt is out on the town) and I notice a shadow scurry across the kitchen counter (a window separates the kitchen and sitting room) I think nothing of it as I used to live there, so I tell myself it must be me because I'm the only living organism in the house.  Oh how wrong was I.  An hour later a FUCKING MOUSE appears from underneath the dinning table and looks at me and mumbles something in Creole...it wasn't in English because the mouse must have come from Freetown with asylum-seeking-Aunty-Joyce a.k.a. Mantan (long story for those few beings who haven't watched Bamboozled)  because I have never seen a mouse in a London home.  Basically what happened was, I saw the mouse in the living room at 02:10:20 secs and at about 02:10:22 secs I was upstairs on the top bunk of my cousins bunk bed trying to recover from the shock of it all...I still canâ€™t believe it GGGRRRROOOOSSSSSSSSS! Reliving that night has made me too distraught to continue this blog...I have to end it right now so I can find a corner of the room where I can rock myself to sleep :0)   According to my friend Yusuf there are more rats/mice than people in London!!!
