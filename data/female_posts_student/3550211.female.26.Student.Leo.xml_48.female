This film does an excellent job of exposing the failed leadership of Bush Jr. and it's a great opportunity for you to take a friend or family member to an event that may open their eyes or change their opinion regarding our embarrassing President.   Or could it possibly be as horrific and completely full of shit, like  urlLink Hitch  says it is?   [It's]a film that bases itself on a big lie and a big misrepresentation [that] can only sustain itself by a dizzying succession of smaller falsehoods, beefed up by wilder and (if possible) yet more-contradictory claims.   My guess is that it will land somewhere in the middle.  If anyone has seen it, I would love to hear what you have to say.
