Ate bbq-ed marshmellows [yum] and sotong and chicken...blah blah blah. But that's not the point. Point is, YF is finally gonna start in August! The fellowship was a meaningful one cos we all were like so guilty not doing anything about ourselves and church and all...so i guess this is a good start. Talked about tracting, evangelism, topics to study, outing once a month...haha...really looking forward but dun wanna organize it. Capital l-a-z-y.  But it was like double tragedy that day cos little Victoria nearly drowned in the swimming pool that day...Auntie Tina sms-ed Sarah and we were like "OH MY ..." Damn scary xia. She was at the bottom of the pool when they found her. Thank God she survived. Then mum's dad got mild stroke, so no one send me home that night so they asked Josh to be my escort. I was like damn happy. Hehe...alone with him in the taxi is the perfect time to...haha...let my feelings show? no lah...i didn't...but we talked a whole lot in the taxi...about amos and how that day is approaching where i might just have to give it to him...sigh...imagine the pain...  :: trust in God with all your heart and lead not to your understanding ::  Sadly, he never mentioned what i wanted to hear...sigh. But anyway, it was a nice moment alone without phoebe and my bro. :) Then yesterday we ate dinner together with the rest of them...until i got diahorrea today *dao mei*  Die larh...tmr my violin exam liao, so fast...the thought of it is scary man. BUt i damn lazy so dun wanna practise but still have to...Sigh...nvm
