I had this dream last night and I woke up absolutely ecstatic  and then reality slapped me in the face and I was really really mad but once I got to thinking about it, I was even more mad...not because reality slapped me in the face but because I shouldn't have been ecstatic about the dream. I was supposed to be over it. Spring break was supposed to help me get over it and I thought it had. I really did but...no. I'm definitely not if I was that excited and then that bummed about it. My wise words of the day....BOYS SUCK.   Anyway, I'm  off to run errands and such and I still have to finish up my homework for tonight AND I have to work from 6-11...I think...
