You kinow our love was meant to be The kind of love that lasts forever And I want you here with me From tonight until the end of time  You should know Everywhere I go You're always on my mind, in my heart, in my soul  Baby You're the meaning in my life You're the inspiration You bring feeling to my life You're the inspiration  I wanna have you near me I wanna have you hear me say it No one needs you more than I need you  And I know Yes I know that it's plain to see We're so in love when we're together  Now I know That I need you here with me From tonight until the end of time  You should know Everywhere I go You're always on my mind In my heart In my soul  You're the meaning in my life You're the inspiration you bring feeling to my life You're the inspiration  I wanna have you near me I wanna have you hear me say it No one needs you more than I need you........   I feel so helplessly alone right now. I feel like I can't trust certain people anymore and it bites.   I know this is a little late but don't read this if you don't want to hear me complain.   I think I'd rather complain in here and not to my friends. At least I wont feel stupid for writing in here tomorrow. I feel stupid sometimes after talking with friends. Like...I said the wrong thing or I shouldn't have told them that...
