They also tend to stumble about in a feverish haze and could very well trip in your hallway and die. Imagine the hassle you'll have to go through trying to climb over their greenish, purple bodies every time you need to use the toilet. Sometimes a girl just wants to go poop without having to worry about decomposing corpses in her hallway. Will it ever end?!  Yesterday, my sick roommate was feeling a bit thirsty. "Snuffy (My real name, the name that was given to me by Jesus, our Lard, up in the Glorious Cloud Castle in the sky!)," she asked politely from her comfortable spot on the couch, "Would you mind getting me a glass of orange juice?"  "OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE," I replied, "DO I LOOK LIKE YOUR SLAVE, YOU CONDESCENDING WENCH?!" It seemed like a reasonable reply at the time. After all, I was busily involved in trying to figure out the intricate mechanics of a ballpoint pen by clicking it in alternating tempos. After trying to stab the pen viciously in my eye, she stomped off into the kitchen to get herself the glass of juice while mumbling incoherently.  I was feeling a bit sorry, so I tried to lighten the mood by making fun of pictures of her as a fat teenager and drawing little moustaches on them. She didn't appreciate my sense of humour and went into her room to sulk and curse my name. She can be such a baby sometimes.
