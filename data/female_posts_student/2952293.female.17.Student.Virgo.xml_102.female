All I remember is that the Incubus concert was on Saturday. They probably are the best performers I've seen. They put on a real show, and it's sad that I only say that because they actually played longer than an hour! GO THEM! Brandon Boyd took off his shirt. Every boy that plays guitar must do it without his shirt on! There was this horrible man shouting out rude things. He was so ugly and evil, he should just go to Iraq. He had the haircut. All I do is babysit. And every time I babysit, it is always bad and weird, why is that? Yesterday I babysat, well first I went to let out the pets I'm watching at like 8 AM, then babysat from 8:30-12. Then I went back to let the pets out and stayed with them. Then I babysat from 2:30-9:30. Then I went back and let the pets out again. But let's just talk about that second babysitting gig. It was for Sophia, but her mom's friend was in town with her two kids. Anyways, they have no sidewalk at the moment, so I had to cross the flower bed. I see one of the new kids, but I went inside. They tell me that the one inside is named Emma. I was about to ask about the one outside, "What is his name?" But they told me the other one's name is Sarah. Okay- first problem, I thought that kid was a boy. When they were eating dinner: Sarah: "Do you think I'm a boy or a girl?" Me  nervously : "A girl." Emma: "Well, people at school thinks she's a boy!" Sarah: "Emma, everybody here knows I'm a girl, but it's complicated..." COmplicated.. I do NOT have the emotional capacity to help you figure out your gender issues kid. Seriously, don't mess with me. Then we walked to Dairy Queen, yeah the one at Indianola and Arcadia, the one where if you walk two feet you are in the road. I thought I was going to have a heart attack with these three kids running around. This really dirty man riding a bike kept laughing at how I was freaking out and muttering under my breath. Actually, he was kind of hot, in that dirty, you ride-around-town-all-day-long-where-are-you-really-going kind of way. Sophia's cone was dripping EVERYWHERE, and I had to hold it, of course. I kept wrapping napkins around it, but they were all dirty. I was like, "God damn this turnicate!" I thought it was funny. YOu had to be there. Anyways, Sarah got like five different ice creams cause she didn't like anything- fucker. She asked me about the sports I play, when I promptly told her that I'm more of an "activist than an athlete" but I told her I used to play field hockey, which she scowled at. She went on about cricket (or something), and lacrosse, and rugby- WHO THE HELL PLAYS RUGBY IN THE U.S., LET ALONE AN 8-YEAR-OLD GIRL?! When we were watching TV, and by "we" I mean "them" because I am Anti-Hillary Duff, so I DO NOT watch her show. Sarah seemed to like her. I said that she was rumored to be dating a 25-year-old and she was like, "NO, YOU'RE WRONG!" Okay, sorry to burst someone's bubble. Actually, you know, that kid seemed to be going through a lot, and that's rough at 8 years old, poor thing. Nobody went to bed, I told Sarah and Emma to NOT go into Sophia's room, but they did. I hate them, go back to Connecticut, the land of evil. BYE. BUT THEN: dog sitting, that can't be bad, can it? YES IT CAN!I get there and notice that the basement lights are on. I let the dog out then go inside to feed them. I grab her bowl, but it's full of dog food. It was empty when I was there in the afternoon. I look over and the front door is open. I hear this man talking. I'm thinking, okay maybe it's Jenny's boyfriend. So I called out but nobody answered. It seemed like it was coming from a bedroom, but everything was so dark, I was too scared to turn on a light and find a man, possibly dead, lying there. So, I freaked out and left. Why can't anything be normal for me?  FUnny story: We've been taking stuff to this resale store. I was carrying this heavy lamp and here's how it goes down: Lady 1: "You may want to take that to the furniture store. It'll sell faster there." Lady 2: "Oh no, it's so cluttered, nobody would ever see it!" Lady 1: "Well Sarah said that it was really nice." Lady 2: "Are you sure?" My mom: "So should we take it there? Or do you think we should try and sell it here." Lady 1: "I don't know." ME: "Well, can you make up your mind, cause this thing is HEAVY!" AHH I'M SUCH A BITCH!  I feel like going on a walk. I think I'll walk up to the Library with a canvas bag to fill with books. Can I be any more pathetic?
