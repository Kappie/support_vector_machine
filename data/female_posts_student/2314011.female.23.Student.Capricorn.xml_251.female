I walked home from work through the park and spotted her ambling down the sidewalk to my apartment. With a goofy wave and a shake of our heads (followed by the public fondling) we began our latest weekend of life-altering adventure and bonding.        We laid on the couch (and on each other) for the obligatory hour of catch-up conversation that marks the beginning of our reunions. I recounted my week of being the cool role model for 6-year-olds everywhere, she talked of the previous night's drive with an old pal, still waiting on a copy of my London mix that I forgot to send 7 months ago. (oops)        We filled the whole hour before she asked, "So do you want to eat now, or should we wait for Lorraine?"        My gasp nearly propelled me across the room. "Nooooo, Are you joking! SHUT UP! She is NOT COMING! Are you serious? Don't you fuck with me like that! Don't you even!"        By her devilish grin I knew it was true. "She's on the road right now."        "Shut.the.fuck.up."        But how could this be? Lorraine at my house? In my town? Black Queen? The grand Clam Dragon herself? The secret benefactor I worship and adore on a level separate from all others? The three of us together at last, after an aching year of separation and longing? Earlier in the week i had made a joke of saying "So you gonna get Lorraine to come up, too?" We laughed about the possibility, sure. But always in that because-it'll-never-happen-in-a-million-years kind of way. The dream was too perfect and painfully impossible to entertain.        After 20 minutes of shock and bewilderment, I realized this changed everything. The three of us haven't been together since last July, and that was an event big enough to kill a team of horses. This was not simply another rockin' trip with Andrea, (which is rare and momentous enough) this was HUGE! The Queen touched down around 10 last night, and we haven't stopped rubbing each other since. Before bed I whined to Andrea, "I'm afraid to go to sleep because i just know she'll be gone when I wake up, and then I'll die! I'll just DIE!" I have to keep poking her to make sure she's really there. She brought her fishing poles, and we're off to find a package of Italian Sausage. The rest is up to the Fates. How does one compress a year's worth of "Quality Time" into 2 magical days? I don't know, but somehow, I know we'll find a way (tear).       She came to grieve the end of a relationship. A relationship that may find itself again, but for now has ended in its current form. I must admit, a part of me was worried about seeing her again. It's been a year. A year since our rationalized 'reconnection' and I wondered if we could be in the same room without feeling the familiar tension. But there was none. We got on like we always had, without discomfort, uneasinessor too many sparks.      The fates handed us a brilliant Saturday indeed. Made our way to the site of the October 2000 photoshoot: the bank of a hot river on an even hotter day. But we found just enough shade to keep us busy for a couple of hours. Lorraine and the Boy worked on their sketchpads while I dabbled a bit in mid-afternoon pages before lugging out Book 4, which never received much attention. Ended up chatting while they drew and even made a mad dash for a stray Coke can as it attempted to flee the sunk sack full of beverages. The yoga certainly is paying off, as my ass (who was saved from an embarrassing dunk in said river on said mad dash on account of my stunning agility due to said yoga) can attest. Before long, though, Lorraine's air conditioned hotel room beckoned and we soon found ourselves there, cleaning and priming ourselves for a night on the town with dinner at a favorite Italian eatery and Spider Man 2 (which earned a solid B+ from Lorraine.)         Sunday : Learning to fly    Lazy wanderingsaround downtown Bozeman after a spot-on wonderful breakfast at the CatEye Cafe.Wemarveled at the waitress'tight jeansand tank-top dress code and drooled over the hot cowgirl outside our window. Lorraine and Levifound some keepsakes at a favorite bookstore and we soon found ourselves in Cooper Park(named inhonor of Lewis and Clark)with our respective reads.After a round of horoscopes, yogaandthe kick-off the the Third Task, the rain convinced usto move the party inside.We relocated to the Boy's apartment, opened thewindows, turned on the fans and enjoyed thewet fresh air and each other's company.We gaveand got foot massages, lounged and laughed, smiled and shook heads. Lorraine and I retired to the spare bedroom for a bit, leaving Levi to his latest creation. My guilty grin a while later confirmed what he already knew,and I assured him (and myself) that I knew what I was doing and why. No attempts at recreating what we once had. No fantasies ofriding off into the sunsettogether. No rationalizing, no excuses.    Before I knew what happened, I found myself in the middle of a perfect moment. Laying on The Boy's couch, legs sprawled across Lorraine's lap, gripping Book 4 tight, gasping at every other paragraph, listening to one of the new mixes, watching Levi paint out of the corner of my eye, smelling rain on the grass outside, everything was in its right place.    Had take a breath at one point and write a bit about it all:     Sitting between the two best people I've known, reading a great book, sipping great wine, reveling in afterglow (sans guilt or conflict), with the smell of rain on the air. Couldn't really stop to breathe, let alone write about it. Just felt wrong to stop  being . And at last, a respite. But just for a minute because I want to get back to it. He's painting, she's reading and I've never felt like the planets have aligned to converge such a perfect, needed, surprising gift in such a way. It may be the hormones and it may be the wine. But it could be just what everything kept telling me would happen. Just sit back and let little, seemingly insignificant things happen because that's where the most momentous things will emerge. And I find myself drowning in it all. In a cool, safe, fated kind of way.     We finished out the night with pizza, more great conversation and a titch more reading before bed.         Monday : This is gonna hurt like hell    The Boy arose at 6 on account of his having to be at work by 8. Lorraine and I bid him a fond farewell and crawled back to bed for a bit before making our own departures. The phone rang around 830, making me jump, literally. I made Lorraine answer. It was the Boy and I was relieved. Then I saw her face change and I shivered.    "Here, I'll let you talk to Andrea," she said as she put her hand on my shoulder and handed me the receiver.    "What's up?"    "I just got a call. My dad's been killed in a farming accident. I'm heading over there..."    Everything stopped. The air in my lungs and stomach evaporated. I couldn't speak. He kept talking, but I couldn't respond. All I knew was this sudden pain in my chest that hurt more than anything I've ever known. Finally, I knocked myself into reality.    "We're coming over."    And we stayed until noon.    Eventually, he went to be with his stepmother and Lorraine and I headed south, although the only place I really wanted to be was at his side.    We drove down 'together', she following me through the forest to West Yellowstone and beyond. We said our goodbyes at a rest stop between Idaho Falls and Blackfoot. She was opening a water bottle as I pulled away.    As I neared the Pocatello exit, a song from the mix from last night came on that was too appropriate to be coincidental. I turned it up and sang along, hoping he might hear.    "Light up, light up. As if you have a choice. Even if you cannot hear my voice, I will be right beside you dear."    I looked to my left and saw Lorraine in the passing lane, waving the sign for "I love you."        It's almost midnight and I don't want to get into this big bed by myself. The parents are leaving for Oregon tomorrow. I'm going to Driggs Wednesday to be with him before the funeral Thursday.    Yesterday has never felt so far away.
