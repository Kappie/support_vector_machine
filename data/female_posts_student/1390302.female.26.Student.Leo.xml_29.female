There is always some madness in love, but there is also always some reason in madness.”  ~ Friedrich Nietzsche    Have you ever looked back at your life and scoffed at your past, and your ability to get through the then “overwhelming odds” which now look like a speed bump rather than a racetrack. I remember the things I have gone through and done in my past, and its almost like I am looking back on my life then with a vision of now, and what I see is someone entirely different.  There were the times when I thought that I just couldn’t go on, or I just couldn’t get past… whatever it was at the time.  What a load of crap, complete and utter crap!    An example would be my divorce from my first husband –wow, that makes me look bad, so just for clarification sake I have only been divorced ONCE and that was more than enough for me!  When I tried to leave my first husband, he wouldn’t let me go.  He did everything he could to hold on and all I wanted was to be free.  The jerk acted as if the idea of getting a divorce came out of the blue and hit him like a ton of bricks, and the fact is that it didn’t.  So why is it that people only hear what they want to hear?    That is a problem in my life even now.  My Husband Matt and I get along great!  We seldom fight or argue, and when we do its mostly just senseless bickering and nothing serious to worry about.  Then there are those times when I just want to kill him, and I am sure he feels the same.  Take for example the “fight” we had on Monday night.  I made comment about going out and getting something to eat on the way back from feeding my in-law’s cat.  He said okay, but misunderstood me to mean I wanted take-out.  I didn’t say that, but that is what he got from it.  I suppose he was feeling game deprived so after a long day of school he wanted me to GM (Game Master) for him.  All I wanted was to eat in a restaurant.  We got into a huge fight over the Lord knows what now and we didn’t talk to each other for like 20 minutes, yep the unbearable “I’m not about to be the first one to speak” silent treatment came next.    Now the background of that fight is this.  The city we live in just banned smoking in restaurants.  He feels that this is an infringement of his rights and that its unethical and immoral to tell him that he can’t do something that is perfectly legal in a public place. So he is taking his stand and not eating in ANY restaurants that DO NOT allow smoking, which is all of them now.  I feel like his stand is not only punishing “society” but is also punishing me, who doesn’t smoke and would like to have dinner in a restaurant once in a while.  I suppose I can understand his “Stand” but I still think its crazy!    You know, I was thinking that maybe I should take a “stand” of my own.  He won’t eat in restaurants and he can not cook.  Maybe I should stop cooking for him, or buying groceries, because he smokes in the house and I feel that it’s immoral and unethical for him to kill me with his second hand smoke.  After all why should I have to die for his habit?  Now I realize that two wrongs don’t make a right and that would never work. He would just start getting take-out for himself and none for me, my plan would backfire and I would go hungry!  I also realize that taking a stand like that against your own husband is relationship suicide, but I have considered a strike on more than one occasion.    So there you have it, the troubles of the world, or my world at least all bottled up into one scenario about eating at restaurants.  It’s a bit pathetic I know, but hey that’s life!  ~Kristyn
