And yesterday...well... it didn't help. God, I just need someone to talk to. I need a hug. I need a big hug, and a shoulder to cry on. I so incredibly hate my life. I wish I could just disappear. I would go to the park and sit for a while, but the mosquitos are getting bad. Yeah, it's summer alright. God I need a hug. I need everything to be ok again. "Jump in the river, what do I see? Black eyed angels swimming with me..."  Stab stab stab
