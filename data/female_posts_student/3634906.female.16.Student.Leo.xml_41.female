YUMMY!! and then we picked up mike and went to chris's where they were watching the butterfly effect, i didnt want to watch it so i was the big bitch who left and made everyone hate us!!! YAY my dream has come true!!! no then somehow we ended up back at chris's just to leave again because james didnt want to stay so we came to my house and sat around until i got tired and kicked them out... so the night wasnt a complete let down but i was pretty lazy... today is going to be interesting... my brother just left for the warped tour!! i wish i were going because i really want to meet yellowcard, well actually i really want to meet the violinist, but still so i begged my brother to get their autograph and he was like... blah blah blah, i guess i will get you something but i cant promise that exact thing... but still hes going to get me something because he loves me!!! and then my dad is basically dedicating the whatever the hell i want to do... pat a. is going to call me around 2 and we are supposed to play video games, im not sure it will happen but we'll see, and then later tonight amanda is coming over to watch nip tuck with me... and max might come after hes done working we'll see if that actually happens... i dont know but these past days have been so amazingly boring that i just want to shoot myself in the foot... nothing to do... no one to talk to... sitting alone trying to find something convenient to do well i avoid everyone and everything that will make me feel bad about myself... im sick of people in general... i have been around too many too much lately, and half of them are asses so why do i even associate with them??? they just bring down my mood and make me become bitchy (i.e. last night) i cant be myself and have fun with people that i dont feel comfortable around or who are complete assholes to me... well i feel like all i do is complain, i feel really bad, but i hate having to deal with people who i dont even care for... and i hate it when the ones i do blow me off every night and now arent even talking to me... what did i do? could someone please explain this to me? well i must go... need to shower... i stink -gabby
