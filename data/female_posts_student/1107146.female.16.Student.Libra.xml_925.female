But noooooo, I have to be home schooled for a few weeks, then come back for only like, two periods at a time (I'll try to make it 5th as often as possible) AAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I'm going to scream if I don't get out of this house soon.  Even the visit to the doctor today was a treat, and I'm not fond of doctors.  GET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I hate being sick, and I found out today that it's going to be, not days, but WEEKS until I get out of here.  SAVE ME!!!!  People, get your butts over here and visit me!!!!!!  I'm not contagious!!!  I'm seriously begging you to GET ME OUT OF THIS TORTURE CHAMBER!!!!!!!!!  Wow, I feel better now.  I'll try not to do that again for a while.  I'm starting to count down the days until I'm back at school.  It's not looking good for now.  Instead of getting better, I'm getting worse.  This sucks MAJOR BUTT!!!!  Also, I could end up in the freaking HOSPITAL!!!  How much would that suck?  Oh, and Z, exactly, WHY was your dad put in the hospital?  It wasn't just the rash, was it, cuz I've got it now.  Luckily, I don't have much of a fever.  Only like the equivalent to about 100 degrees or so (for those of you who don't know, my body temp is like, 4 or 5 degrees below the normal temp.  Don't quite know why, though)  So, people, help put me out of my misery.  I don't know how, just HELP!!!!!!!  I HATE THIS WITH A PASSION!!!!!!  I'll talk to yall tomorrow.  I'm hitting the sack.
