It makes as much sense to blame all American Catholics for Oklahoma City, since McVeigh was Catholic.  Blaming hundreds of millions of Moslems for the twisted actions of a small group is unfair.  And stupid.  I'm pleased to see our leaders (with whom I rarely agree) reiterating this - we don't have a gripe with Arabs.  We don't have a gripe with Moslems.  We have a gripe with terrorists.
