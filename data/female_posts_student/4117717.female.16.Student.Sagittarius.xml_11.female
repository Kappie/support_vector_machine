And I havent had nice dreams in a freakishly long time so....sigghh...it was good. It was pretty confusing. It kept going back and forth between different places, but some moments......good moments. Hah, yup. No kissing, making out, or having sex...I dont have THOSE kind of dreams, this was just a....awseome dream. Which I still don't really feel like explaining......but Jessica/Katie I'll tell you about it later if you would like to hear about my fantabulous dream. Since you know...you two are the only ones who read this. SIGHHh....aw man, twas a good dream. I wish it would come true....well....some parts. The parts that made sense. So you know, I was all happy prappy waking up and pretty bouncy like "yay! even if it that never happens in real life, it totally felt real and I am quite content right now."...Yeah ok so contentness goes to bitterness cause I go on the computer and I read other random people's blogs...andddd........GAR. It makes the dream even farther away from reality. Which sucks. I think I'm just going to block all blogs except for Jessica's. ...Cause Jessica's is awseome. And I am going to go back to sleep now, cause the bounciness has worn off into tiredness.....
