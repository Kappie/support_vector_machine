I love getting comments, it just makes me happy. :) The only bad thing, I can't even read my comments through my actual blog page, I try to and it messes up. The only comments I can actually read are from Cassie's blog. It's quite strange. So I guess I will just reply to my comments in here instead..I didn't get to see the play at AU this weekend because I was so busy with family and friends and stuff for my birthday, but I'm hoping I can go sometime next weekend since I don't have to work on Saturday. So maybe I'll try to go Friday or Saturday. And thanks for the address again, Matt. I have your guys' blogs in my favorites so I can read them whenever I get on!  Well the ACT went fairly well I thought. I got to the school about 2 minutes until 8:00 so I was fairly worried. I was walking quickly down the hall wondering what room I was in. Thankfully, Mr. Shambre was standing at the end of the hall talking to Mrs. Edwards and he like yells, "Jacqui! You're with me...room 105." So I'm like "Ok...umm..which room is that?" lol So I got in there right on time. PHEW! So we're getting started and filling out the info about yourself at the beginning. Well the night before I had my mom buy me some mechanical pencils while she was out because we don't really have anything good anymore, I was running low at the end of the year. So I have these new mechanical pencils...and I cannot figure out how the heck they work!! The top doesn't click in, there's no push thing on the side, you don't squeeze it, the tip turns, but it doesn't bring out any more lead. So I'm like panicking. I mean what if my lead broke, how would I get more?! So thankfully I borrowed one from someone. I got all 4 tests done this time, which makes me feel so much better. I think I did best in math because there was only one I didn't know the answer to for sure. I hate the reading and science sections. The selections in the reading just don't interest me, so I really have to focus on it so I don't forget what I'm reading. I barely got done with it though. When I started the science, I was starting to read the first passage and I seriously just wanted to give up because it was so ridiculous. I just wanted to walk out of the school and go celebrate my birthday, but obviously I didn't.  So afterwards I went home and just did not a whole lot. Sat outside at the garage sale for a while, practiced some marching band music with my brother and dad (that was interesting!! lol We tried to play the Star Spangled Banner in a round....not pretty). Then later I left to meet some of my friends at Pizza Hut. It was Carinna, Wanda, Holly, and I that ate there. Of course they had to get some of the staff to sing happy birthday to me, which was a tad embarassing, but since they didn't do anything too big (like put a hat on me, or clap hands, or sings some big song) it wasn't too bad. Rachel came right at the end when we were getting ready to leave. We stopped at Hallmark to say hi to LeeAnne (and so Rach could get me a quick birthday card, lol), then we came back to my house. It seems like my friends and I always end up making prank calls while we're here. So we ended up in my room talking for a while and wanting to call people just to be stupid. So we did...It was quite funny. We called Sheldon and left a funny message on his answering machine and we were gonna call Ken and pretend to be from some modeling universtity who's taking an interest in him. And I was gonna call Jon and talk with a Japanese accent/voice and tell him I was from the University of Tokoyo and that we were interested in him because of his high GPA in Chemistry and Spanish (he did nothing in Chemistry and he hates Spanish), but we couldn't find his phone number. And we called Andy and said something dumb to him, but he knew it was a prank call. But it was still fun because we were laughing....a lot.  Then Abbi and LeeAnne got there so we had some ice cream cake that my mom made. And then we played this game I got called "Scene It?" which was really fun. After that, Abbi had to leave because it was getting late and the rest of us played Dream Phone because we like to play old games like that once in a while. lol We're such nerds, but it was so fun and funny. Eventually everyone left. It was a lot of fun though.  Today we went to this girl from my mom and I's work named Brittany, her graduation party. So we were there and our bosses were there and they had gotten me something for my birthday!! It was so sweet of them! I got a purse with the letter J on it, a pair of cute flip-flops (because they heard I am the flip-flop queen...I think I have a pair for everyday of the week now), and a necklace. After that, we came back home for my family birthday party. I was so happy this year because I actually had ONE big family party. Usually I have to have 2 or 3 small ones because everyone is busy all the time. So it was nice to have one for the first time in several years. I got a lot of nice stuff and it was just nice to see everyone. They left around 8:00-ish.  Then tonight I was sitting in the house and it was steadily getting cloudier. My mom and brothers were sitting on the back patio and my brother, Drew, was looking at a cloud over our neighbor's house, Kory. And he says. jokingly, "That looks like a funnel cloud!" and my mom says, "Yeah right." And then the tornado siren went off. So we were going in and out of the basement a lot tonight. My dad kept going on the front porch, he wanted to see a tornado because he's never seen one before. My little brother, Brooke, was freaking out about everything. He said he wanted to sleep in the basement tonight and everything...but I think he's okay too.  Well that is all for now...oh yeah. My grandpa told me this really scary thing that happened to him about a week ago in this bed and breakfast place he stayed at. I will tell you about it later. The place was haunted......I leave you with that. =)
