Stood around and played football with Jeena and Nana and everyone else, exchanged some gossip and then Nick showed up and Karissa and Nana left. And we slowly dispersed after that... Nick and I went off to his place to chill and keep dry. We chilled for a bit, then I called Laura to see what time she wanted to leave for the movie, and was informed that she had poorly planned her time, and needed to study instead. Hope she had a good nap....So I was pretty bummed and upset..cause I wanted to spend time with my best friend, and talk to her about pressing matters...But Nicky took pity on my tears and took me instead. He really is the sweetest, bestest guy ever. the movie was decent, I'm glad I saw it..they did a good job taking junk out of the book and representing it. But I noticed these as well..  -Firstly, I didn't think it was that sexual...but maybe that's just because I'm just so into sex myself. -Secondly, good relace on Dumbledore...he just looks thinner, and that's it..but what's with tying the beard? And Nevelle grew up so muuuch :P They all did.. -Thirdly, WOW, set sucks. They could not have changed it more. The Forbidden Forest was like a shot from Bambi, suddenly Hogwarts is by a river, two COMPLETELY different ones, too, and Hagrid's shack is now on a hill? When did Hogwarts get on a hill? -Forthly, what's with the kids no longer having to wear their full uniform he whole day, and into Hogsmeade? Did I miss something there?  Movie was still amazing though. And standing in the rain waiting to be picked up was fun too. :) Can't wait till some of those movies we saw in the ads come out...Princess Diarys 2 (damn you Kim), Cinderella Story (damnit Kim :P), Polar Express (which actaully looks really really good, it was one of my fave christmas books growing up...one of the traditions..) Yeah.  I've got so much homework to do now tho it's hardly funny. I have to write 6 poems, for a total of 8 (I'm going to use ones I've already written me thinks tho) and do a thing on "Solutions for Acid Rain" for Katie like NOW so she can put it on our poster...Graa...So that means I'm out, for now. Until next time..  Hey, anyone noticed that my blog is working again? The profile picture thingy is at the top where it's supposed to be..Hurray! :)
