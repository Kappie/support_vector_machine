Right after that I began doing homework. I have a history test tommorow, a french ditto due tommorow, english make-up to do and I have to fix my child development conclusion because it's not long enough. Thats a lot. Also I worked on the midterm review sheet madame brodie (for french) made us do... we each have 2 different from everyone else's. I got one of them done.. so that I dont have to do all this homework while my grandparents are here...  they're coming tommorow night. I really cant wait until school ends because I hate the chaos of the work and the drama that people have to bring into it. Its like a crappy job, but you dont get payed. Anyway, I've kind of stopped using livejournal.. only because I guess I like this one better. Yes.. that one has moods and a better selection of backrounds but I still like this better. It's more "mature" I guess you could say. Anyway, got to get going. I'm going to TRY to excercise tonight because my hip is feeling a lot better.. but now my wrist hurts from typing so much.. lol. ttyl.
