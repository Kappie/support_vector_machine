You try to move your fingers about the keys to spurn out your feelings but sometimes it feels like there's a gate or a barrier blocking them.  So one of my best friends is currently telling me via MSN how she's planning to kill herself. Granted, she's an attention seeker, and too happy and undepressed to do so. She's just having a bad night. It's only over a boy and they'll get back together soon anyway. They always do. So why do I feel so disturbed and upset? Why is her discussing overdosing on her parent's perscribed painkillers mixed with alcohol making me feel sick to the soul? And now I want her to stop talking to me because I don't want to have to feel like this. I don't want to have to know what she's thinking, why she's thinking it. Because I'm being selfish and don't want to be laboured with other people's problems.   I'm the worst friend in the world. Why won't I speak to her? Why  can't  I speak to her?   I just want to curl away from problems forever. I can't face them or confront them. I keep running away, and as I do so I just encounter ones that get worse and worse, and because I ran away from them before I don't know how to deal with them, and so I just end up telling them to go to bed and giving advice that's not any good and generally is just shit.   Today was a good day. This has just gone and ruined it all. I need to take my own advice and switch this computer off, leave MSN, empty my mind and sleep.    Sleep, perchance to dream
