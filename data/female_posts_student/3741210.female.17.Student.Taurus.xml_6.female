There was a lot of wooded areas and those were downhill, but of course the sunny patches seemed to be all uphill.  Our friend Tom came in his corvette and we kind of collapsed into that and rested.  I think I might go see that movie tonight. I called my friend Emily who has seen it, and she said that it wasn't very good, and for a PG-13 movie, it was pretty racy.  Ofcourse we both get pretty embarrassed by steamy scenes, probably much more than normal people.  My mom got me Pride and Prejudice from the library.  That's the next book in our book club.  Our first meeting was at my house and we read Divine Secrets of the Ya ya Sisterhood.  It was so much fun, I love being with my friends!!  When we're together, well, crazy things happen.  Ofcourse with Pride and Prejudice we might have a "proper" meeting, but I doubt it.
