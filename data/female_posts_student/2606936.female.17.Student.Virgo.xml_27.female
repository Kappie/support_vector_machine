Yesterday, a friend and I spent an hour at CVS buying all kinds of cool stuff (mousse, cheap red V-Day Mardi Gras style beads, brown hair shampoo, water flavored with SPLENDA, etc).  I think reading bottles of conditioner while treating your hair actually has a psychosomatic effect on its beauty. Which is why I am quite familiar with the Pantene Pro-V Treatise on Conditioner. It includes the  Six Signs of Healthy Hair:  1) silkiness 2) shine 3) less frizz 4) softness 5) strength 6) body  So, yeah. I mean, hey, they're the ones who devote their careers to making hair shiny, so why not listen?  However, I was just now reading a bottle of my brother's shampoo, which is VO5 Balsam  Protein, and it promises to restore the  Five Attributes of Healthy Hair:  1) Manageability 2) Shine 3) Softness 4) Bounce and Body 5) Strength  Compare and contrast, my friends. Compare and contrast.   I must now return that stuff to my brother's bathroom. But I think this shows that not all hair companies are the same. I mean, one seeks "silkiness" and "less frizz" while another wants "manageability" and "bounce." Totally different.  What the hell is balsam?
