And if someone else was saying this to me, i would tell them... "well change..." Now see with me, i can. I'm sure i can. but do i really want to? I mean is it going to make me happy? I'm sure it would make others happyier. And for the things i am thinking about right now, i'm sure it would really make others happier. But would i be happy? Now that is a hard question to answer. I am Joyful. I am full of joy, dont get me wrong. But...I dont know. I'm trunning out like my parents. But i think thats cause i spend so much time with them (My Dad) And i dont want to be like them, (My Mom) I would give anything not to be like my mom... So she is awesomely caring person. But just some of the stuff mannnnnnnn. I dont know.
