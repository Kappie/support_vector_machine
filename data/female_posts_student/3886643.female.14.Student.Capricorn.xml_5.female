(woo hoo)...then after that me n taylor went down to the dairy center.  I had an ice tea and a corn dog.  Well I got my corn dog, pulled all the stuff around the outside off (as usual) and took a bit out of my dog part.  Well i bit into it and it tasted funny.  So i took another bite...And it was FREEZING COLD....YuCk.  So i told the lady and she said, "O our microwave must be messed up, let me go get another one."  So she went to cook another one and i ate my corn part.  So i got another one.  Well i took  my corn part off, then i took a bite of my hot dog.  the first bite wasn't too bad...but just to be sure i pulled that lil' sucky apart right in the middle.  Sure enough it was FROZEN...Still (yuck!)...So i ate the corn part again.  Then Tree n Tori came in.  Then i went w/ them.  The lady brought an extra order of Fries.  Well Tori told the lady, "mamn, we didn't order these"  So the lady said, oh well, eat up!....So my whole lunch was FREE....I love the Dairy Center (but not their corndogs).   After that i came home and sat here all alone all day with my dog, Bax.  In the whole time i was here i started thinking....and i decided it sux when ur single, and ur not @ the beach....Cameron (from the real world) said it all..." I Need A BOY! I Need Some LuViN!" haha...Well I watched Walker Texas Ranger for 2 hours (gotta luv it).. Then came n got on the computer...i have been so gosh dern bored!...Gah I Gotta Talk To Somebody Bad, i wish he'd hurry up n get home...*Im Out*
