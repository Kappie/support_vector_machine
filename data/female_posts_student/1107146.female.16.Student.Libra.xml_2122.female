And for my dad's friend in General Services, he died of pneumonia after a huge and essentially lifelong immuno-deficiency battle the other day. Again, a *sigh* should here be input...please keep the families in your prayers.  On a lighter note: Kitties! Butterflies! Puffy white clouds! Waltzes in the springtime! Warm summer nights! Snuggling up with a huge glass of hot chocolate and a blanket and watching Lifetime! Woodstock (old, peaceful hippy Woodstock)! Hugs and kisses! Blah blah blah.
