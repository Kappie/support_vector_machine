But....like   always  , the dinner got cancelled - dont make me say why.  Then i started to feel giddy and had a bad stomachache, so i couldnt meet my 2 other friends for pool. So sorry, didnt want it to be that way too. And i stayed at home the  whoooooollllleeeee  day.  So what was suppose to be a fun day, turned out horrible. period.
