The path that leads up to the open door Is worn and grayed by many a toiling feet Of us who listen to the Bible lore And once again the old time hymns repeat.  And every Sabbath morning we are still Returning to the altar waiting there. A hush,  a prayer, a pause, And the voices fill the master's house With a triumphant air.  The old church leans awry and looks quite odd, But it is beautiful to us and God.  --Stephen Paulus
