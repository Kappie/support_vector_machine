Max and Brooke will renew their rivalry (lol considering max has won 5 WSS crowns, and Brooke has 4, brooke wants to go back to a tie!) Max won last season everyone interested in sprintcars check out these two websites  urlLink www.worldseriessprintcars.com  and  urlLink www.australianspeedway.com  australianspeedway is a speedway forum if u dont get it send a private message to sprintcarzrock (thats me) :)  oh well, time to sign off i might go work on linesys sprintcar  - i crew for a local driver so im always working on his car..
