"my soul has just been crushed-- my life is over!"  i'm not melodramatic in the least! lol.  we're a good combo-- balanced... a blogger team if you will.    [But back to the actual purpose of this post... i want to ask him out... is that crazy?  i was always under the impression that if a guy likes you, he'll ask you out, but what if he doesn't realize that i like him?  what if he's just as dumb as Shane was? (no offence there... but really, it was like 5 months!) are all guys slow?  no, no, the really funny part is that the one guy who likes me is the one guy that i could never go out with!  (it's not haha funny so much as it is ironically funny)  and it's not that i could never go out with him because he's somesort of nasty freak, but it's just that he's such a good friend of mine, it would be severly uncomfortable for me.  and the worst part is that he's all about flattery and trying to help me hook up with this guy!  life has become chaos-- and if life is chaos and love is chaos, is life love or better yet, is love life?  oh, i am Zen!  anyhoo, i'm off to watch Shrek, woot.
