So my brand new DVD player is acting funny.  I'm not freaking out, although I have considered dropping it out the window to see if that improves its attitude any.  Think I have the problem figured out, though.  It makes a weird noise sometimes while playing certain songs.  It's this sound that precipitated the stopping of playing and grinding sound of its predecessor.  It only happens on songs copied from MP3 files.  The other copied songs play just dandy.  Think I can handle that.  It plays movies beautifully, so at least there's that.  Had an okay day.  Wish I could either get to the point where I feel comfortable with my preparation-study process for finals or just get the damn things over with, because I'm finding myself stuck somewhere in between.  Feeling better tonight after getting back into the school routine and talking to the boy.  Went to the opening reception of an intriguing art exhibit for World AIDS Day.  Chatted with the interim director of the Women's Center.  No sparks to speak of, but a few nice chuckles.  Was nice to get my mind off the biggest thoughts of the day, for a bit at least.     Think I might actually get around to sinking my teeth into the new book: Cold Mountain.  I know, I'm a few years late, but I'd like to get through it before the movie's released.  Actually bought it in Seattle last December; it's only fitting I get around to reading it this year.  It was my first purchase in the store I affectionately call The Pussy Book Store; it's just off Broadway, the heart of Seattle's big gay district.  The first time I walked through its door, in the summer of 2001, I was immediately struck by the pet-store smell.  The wandering felines and hidden-in-the-sea-of-similar-flyers advertisement for cat-sitting eventually alerted me to the used bookstore's alternate identity.  And a trip to the Emerald City's never been complete without a visit since.
