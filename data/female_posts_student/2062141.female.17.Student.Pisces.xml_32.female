This pet ate nothing and didn't bark or chew the furniture. Pet Rocks were sold with a funny manual that included tips on how to handle an excited rock and how to teach it tricks. By 1976, Gary Dahl was a millionaire and Pet Rocks were the nation's favorite pet.   http://www.crazyfads.com  HAHAHAHA.... yeah check out this site it has all these weird fads from all the decades. SOOO lame!!! You know what we should have a party where we make pet rocks. It'd be awesome.
