His mission is to send out the message that "just because you're 80, that doesn't mean you can't do fun stuff or interesting things."  Fun stuff or interesting things.  I wonder how many 80 year olds are interested in parachuting?  I mean... I am, but I'm 26.    Anyway.  It's 11:30, and I have to be back here at 5:30, so I'm going to go find out if I can go home yet.  I tried (and missed) my first lumbar puncture today!
