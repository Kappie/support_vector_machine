Changing some things around the old sitearooney, you can now email Don or myself via linkage on the left, you can still check out our other great bloggy friedns with new linkage under the tagboard on the right.  Pictures or some graphical element will come soon, but for now, this is all ya gets, motherbitches.  Anyhow, not much exciting going on in the world of Divadom...I'm down 4lbs since Monday.  Me and some of the people in my office got together to do the whole "weight watchers points" thing.  Its workign.  Woo wooo wooo!  I'm acutally gonna skip  urlLink Happy Hour  tonight, 'cause I'm sick of drinking and feeling shitty on week nights, and I am going to  urlLink the casino  with my grandparents on Monday, so I gotta save me some ducats.  Also: the people at Lake Mohican are bitches, but cokeheads cook a mean steak.  If you dont get it dont worry, you're not supposed to.  Fuck off,  urlLink smokey the bear   take  urlLink your bitch, McGruff,  with you!
