However I am surrounded by Jesters who play, And fakely laugh every single day. People who go out into space, Just for a chance to spite me. I don't want to be, Stuck in a miserable world like this. Help me break free.  All 'poems' on this are done by me - stilldreaming *pen name* kes *fake real name!* YEAY!
