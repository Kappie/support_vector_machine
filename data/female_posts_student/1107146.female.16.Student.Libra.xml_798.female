At Breakthru and Lake Junaluska and stuff they do it and I'm sitting there shouting to the top of my lungs "NOOOOOOOOOO!!!"  Especially when it's a Beatles song... that REALLY makes me mad.  Why mess with the masters, you know?  Thanks, Josh.  Rather hard to believe he remembered, but there you have it.  He might just have a limbic system in there somewhere and we never knew it.  Ah, well, not like he acted on his knowledge, but close enough I guess.  I'm proud of you Josh.  Three days without Abby (without one of you being out of town) is hard.  And I'm proud of you for humbling yourself and writing the letter.  I'm sure you're doing the right thing.  Ok, enough mushy stuff, I know you hate, so I'll see you later.
