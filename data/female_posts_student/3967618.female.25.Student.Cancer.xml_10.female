Of course, the real message for me is that the majority of the iceberg is below the water, meaning that much of your own personality is unconscious motives and issues. My own astrologically sign, Cancer, has much to do with this metaphor, in that a Cancer is strongly attuned to her emotional ups and downs, many of which she is not fully cognizant of. What bothers me about this model is that knowing myself seems so far out of my grasp, and even when I begin to touch on my character, it seems that this model has a way of disregarding my findings. As I do begin to realize my strengths and weaknesses, I laugh because a part of me willfully decides to deny these realizations. Why? I believe that a part of me has a (albeit false) vision for who I am, and anything that contradicts that is rejected. It makes one wonder how deeply one has been fooling oneself...OK, I'm starting to sound like Sybil, the multiple personality victim, but I really do think that this is fairly common. We aspire to certain ideals, visions of who we would like to be, and these visions are not always positive or feasible in relation to who we really are. That makes little sense, I guess.  I keep thinking of my Dad--one time he told me that when he finally accepted his strengths and weaknesses, he was much more on target with what he wanted to get done.  Yes it's intuitive, but hard to make happen!
