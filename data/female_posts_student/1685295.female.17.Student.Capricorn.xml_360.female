At first he was shooting at me, and then I said, "Oh no!" and he modified it to, "No!  I'm shooting  oatmeal  at you!"  What a healthy way to die?  ^_^  Then he asked me what my name was, didn't wait for me to answer before pointing and saying, "You're name is Apple-juice!"  To give him credit, he was *drinking* apple-juice at the time.  It made me think of the movie star person who named her kid Apple, except that Jandro's two so he has an excuse.  Other than that, nothing interesting.  Prom's this weekend!  We get our invitations this week, and I'm crazy excited. ^_^  Getting our nails done, skipping school Friday, getting dressed up and all fancy.  Yay!  Much less excited about the softball playoffs - everyone should come and watch me do something remarkably stupid in centerfield, because I always do.  Or watch me sleep in centerfield . . . I do that, too.  See you guys later -Apple-juice ^_~
