In chorus we did absolutely nothing, I don't even see the point of going to that class anymore. The rest of the day was just boring. Yeah, so I'm going over to Paul's on Saturday, yay! I'm excited. Grr, I got a C- on my final essay for english, just because I puncuated all my dialogue wrong. I guess its ok though, because shes letting me correct it in class tomorrow. Nice.
