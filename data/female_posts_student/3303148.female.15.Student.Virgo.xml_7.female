I have been trying to make my comcast personal webpage for awhile now, and have gotten no where with what I want.   See, I uploaded the song that I want to post on the webpage (so that I can use it for the background music on my blog), but for some goddamn reason I can't post it on my webpage. I am getting REALLY mad.  In their stupid little wizard thing, it has no options for using your uploaded files. And I can't find out what the name of the fucking source directory is to use either. So I don't know how to reach my uploaded files. I did the live chat assistance thing, and the guys told me nothing.   GAH! I am so frustrated. I have been working on this for about 2 hours now, without any results. It's really bugging the fuck out of me. I hate it I hate it I hate it. I am seriously so MAD.
