Now that we know there was no connection between Hussein and bin Laden in regards to the 9/11 attacks, I am concerned with our reasons behind going over there.  I think I would have much preferred that we had simply gone after bin Laden and al Queda.  On the other hand, the improvements that have been made in Iraq since the war began cannot be ignored.    Some have used gruesome photos of Americans being decapitated in order to convince us that this war is necessary.  Well, I see it differently.  Such activity gives me more reason to believe that we should not be in this war.  Can it even be called a war when our enemy is too pitiful and too much of a coward to actually fight a fair battle?  Kidnapping an American soldier and threatening to behead him is not courageous and it is not by any means indicative of warfare.  It's exactly what it is:  kidnapping.    If our enemy won't come out and fight, it's not a war.  Period.  This will continue happening to our servicemen if the U.S. military is not soon brought out of the middle east.  Being a military brat I generally have the tendency to argue that when a man or woman joins the armed forces, they understand that they are signing their life away, figuratively and literally.    But let's face it, this isn't what they signed up for.  This isn't real battle.  These terrorists, cowards, have no honor and have no sense of what it means to be real men and fight for what they believe fair and square.  They will continue their disgusting acts because they are heartless and simply don't care.  At the same time, I can't say that we should bring our boys back.  They must finish what these foolish terrorists have started, and I trust they will.
