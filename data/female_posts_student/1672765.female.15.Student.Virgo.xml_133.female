I notice the fewer and fewer days of school we have the less and less homework I do and less and less energy I put into school work (causing my grades to decrease too unfortunetly...).  Is this an example of direct variation, inverse variation, or joint variation? Too bad I have no idea. Too bad my Algebra II SOL is in 7 days.  I'll probably cram the day before, read over all my notes. At least I have notes, I'm about the only person in the class that takes notes...and still I'm struggling. It's not fair. (I noticed that sounds immature, and I was going to say "ha." afterwards but it sounded dumb.) I've never had this much trouble in a class before. I mean World History was hard...but just because of the tests...I understood the stuff..nothing in Algebra clicks for me... I miss geometry. I liked geometry. Someone give me two points to find the distance between or a proof or  something .    Music: Conversations with Dr. Suessicide - I Hate Myself
