He was an Australian Shepherd and was happiest when herding his loved ones and only when everyone was in a room together would he drop to the floor with a sigh and relax.    My fondest personal memory is of autumn 2000, driving around an old Benz of my father's with Justice riding shotgun and me wearing a vintage black coat with a wooly off-white cowl of a collar that matched. We had some sweet times together that fall, walking the Cascadilla Creek gorge to and from work in Anabel Taylor Hall when they were still allowing dogs in the buildings at Cornell.  He mostly flopped at my feet while I worked at the computer, now and then deciding it was snacktime and wondering down the hall to the Catholics for a handout.  I loved Justice for intervening in family arguments.  And for how much he loved the woods, and the smells outdoors.  And for taking care of my friend Rachel when she was getting better from being sick, keeping watch over her.    I am so grateful he was here with me recently, and that I got to romp with him in Cass Park and watch his silky, soft ears lift inquisitively when the frogs in Rachel and Paul's pond were croaking.    And that he died, peacefully, with my mother.  And that I even heard his gentle woof on the phone this morning.  Once, when my Mom was walking in the woods with him and my niece Delu,  she called out, "Justice, Come Here Boy!" Delu said, "Ama! He's not a boy!" So my Mom asked her, "Well, then what is he?" Delu thought about it and said "He's a Justy!"  Justice walked that trail, formerly the B railroad, many, many times with various members of my family, though with mostly my Mom and my little brother John.  He never really did walk on a leash all that obediently or well, but he was a gorgeous and ecstatic dog off-lead, running in the woods.
