So i havent been online much or posting much. or emailing much. but now my daddy killed the evil virus so we're good. Let see...this has been a pretty good week. I got my license...summer school started and photo is fun. My teacher is cool. And im making some new friends. yay! i took most of my pictures for my fragmentation project today, i have about 4 subject left to come up with tomorrow...unless i want to shoot 2 rolls...but we'll see how it goes. another good thing about photo: hardly any homework! im loving it. cause i acutually get to do stuff after school. unlike with world history. but that was  completely  different. especially with the Emilyness of it all.       so what other fun stuff did i do this week? i went to liz/sam/cathy/whoever's party on tuesday after i got my license and then cait and emily and i went to the mall for a little (very little) bit and hung out and i found out where bookids is. and i got a yummy cookie. wednesday i didnt do much, i drove to school for the first time alone. after school i slept and eventually ran to dominicks to get a new camera battery and pick up some cool mini/emergency stuff for the car. and visited heather on the way home. :-D. thursday i got lost coming home from einstein but its okay cause now i know how to get to city park! and i got jamba juice. and i went to jimmy johns (surprisingly tasty) and then to see starsky and hutch after school with cait and kara and rita. i picked up kara at her dads, drove to buffalo grove theaters, and dropped kara off at her moms. i didnt know how to get to any of those places. but i lived. and kara didnt laugh at me  too  much. friday i got caribou on the way to school cause my mommy got me a caribou card with like 30 bucks on it. wooo. then i came home and called emily to find out what we were doing and then i slept and then i called her again to figure out which ice cream place we were going to and eventually we ended up at taste freeze (or however they spell it) and we had milkshakes and talked and then tried to go to the library but it was closed cause it was past hours and it was the day of mourning for reagan. so then we went to the park illegally cause i didnt have an h-pass or something so im not allowed in the park cause i dont live in lake zurich or something  and  it was past dusk. but no cops came and arrested us so we played on the swings and talked about narnia and some other things... and then we went to dominicks and walked around for an hour trying to decide what to buy and emily showed me that there are gummy bear vitamins that apparently taste really good. eventually we bought real gummy bears and a cookie on a stick for prostate cancer. and payed for it entirely in change. cause the tastefreeze man told us to. sort of. and then emilys car temporarily broke and we had to go sit suspiciously by the bank for mr. pasch to come save us (and i got extra time to talk to emily and eat gummy bears. score.) and then the car was magically fine but emily drove me home in her dads car anyway because we were all still suspicious. and this was just after she told me her dad never lets her drive his car. the irony. so im probably the only person emilys ever going to drive in her dads car. cool, huh? and then i went home and i never called my mommy to tell her that emilys car broke cause i thought she would worry unncessarily. and i still havent told her. i dont think she needs to know. right? i dont want her to be uneasy next time emily drives me.  and...what else? i shot some pictures today for my fragmentation but i already said that. and now i have to go drive see SAVED! with martha and kara and bobby. and kara called to get me to leave. so i shall. ill let you know how that goes.
