There are many famous and non-famous men who I think are just delicious looking. LOL! Now for the list...  Famous: (not in any order) Brad Pitt Hugh Jackman Matt Damon Edward Burns (actor from Saving Private Ryan) Eminem Aaron Stanford (Pyro from X-Men 2) Brian Littrell (from the Backstreet Boys) (yes, I know, I need a life) Ashley Parker Angel (from O-Town) (omg, I embarrass myself!) Ricky Ullman Ryan Merriman Adam Lamberg Um...I think that might be it. If I forgot any, I'll just update the list.  Non-famous: Well, for the non-famous, I feel uncomfortable putting their names incase they happen to stumble along this list, so, like I always say, if you know me well enough, you should know who they are...BTW, only one of them is in our grade...sorry guys!  Okay, I'm sure you're reading this and thinking, "What is up with her taste in guys?" Well, I have a pretty distinct taste. I usually go for the "good-looking" type. You know, blonde/brown/black hair, blue/green/brown eyes, strong jawline, bright beautiful smile, and they have to have good hair! I usually go for any type of hair, as long as its a normal color, and it has to have a nice cut. It can be straight or curly, but it cannot be shaggy or ugly! Lol. Um, this kind of sounds like one of those online dating personals where it sounds like I'm looking for someone. Well, I'm not. At least not now, because I'm not allowed until I'm 16. Doesn't that suck?! My mom doesn't want me becoming a teenage slut/whore/ho/skank...whatever you want to call it. (lol, Joy) Um...my back is hurting and I'm gonna try and find something to do, so until the next post, all! Love and Madness! Please comment!!! ^_^ Much love!
