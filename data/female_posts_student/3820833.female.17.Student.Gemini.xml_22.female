However, I ended up gossiping with my friends. I was so happy since the anger I kept it inside my heart for so long could be poured out eventually. I was really unhappy with one of my classmate. I really couldn’t stand her attitude. My blood was boiling when I talked about her just now. Anyway, I’m ok now.  My friends praised me. They said that another friend’s autograph book was so nicely decorated by me. Hehe… I do impressed with my own work too. Please let me praised myself a bit. I really spent some time on it. =)
