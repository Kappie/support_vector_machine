I like drinking beer with my friends and love music, escpecially rock, hard rock, metal, punk, hard core etc. I've got a dog. Her name's Vega :) I live in Bytom, on Silesia. I must say it's rather ugly town, but people in here are wonderful! :) On Monday we went to the Zoo in Chorzow. Evil_girl, Jo, Kora and me. Observing animals is great especially if it is smart monkey reaching out it's hands to us for biscuits or 2-month old lemurs playing on their little isle. They were really great! They jumped in so funny way :) We also loved a donkey. It was alone in the end of the zoo with no grass on it's farm so we decided to pick some grass for it. Some became a lot :P I think it had hay in building on it's farm, but hay is not as tasty as grass :) Great were also "timons" - if you've watched "the lion king" you should remember Timon, little Simba's friend. I wrote "timons" because I don't know how "surykatka" is in English :P We also spent some time trying to lure a little black cat from the bushes, but he didn't want to come out of there. After visit to the zoo, we went on cable railway named "Elka". It's "the only lowland cable railway in Central Europe" :>
