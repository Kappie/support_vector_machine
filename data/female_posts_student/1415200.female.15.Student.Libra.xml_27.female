Today, however, in spite of the tension that's in the air, your words seem to have no effect. Good! Let other people take care of themselves for a change."  Words need no guidence. Actions do. So misconcepted. People never get what im trying to get across. They take it out of context and blow it out of proportion. I can't make a friendly gesture, with out someone taking it wrong.  Where's Brendan Leonard? ---> This was my favorite show over the summer, and it's gone! I havent seen it in months. Maybe someone thefted ABCfamily of the tapes. I think I need to place a call to the russian mafia.  Wow. It's 11:57, as I type. That means only 2 days until I can open up my x-mas presents. (Note: At the household, we open gifts on x-mas eve. Just for the simple fact were too lazy to wake up early on x-mas day, and I dont feel like waiting that long.)  No one showed up today. I tried calling but his line was busy. I think he doesnt want anything to do with me anymore. It's awefully funny (sarcasim) how they ditched us Friday, and how we havent gone anyplace just the normal 3 of us in a few weeks. I have a feeling something's up. Not like I could approch him about it though. Oh yeah I could see it now. Me: How come we never do anything anymore? Him: What do you mean? Me: Well we used to go places, walk alot and talk on the phone. We dont do any of that anymore. Him: Meh, dunno. Why do you care so much? Me: Because I still like you alot. Even though you used me, and ect..yeah. Him: WAAAH!?!? ---That would go over oh-so-smoothly. I need to move on to somebody else. Somebody better, who shows more respect, and who dosent want me to be something im not. But I have no clue who that is. Oh, well I guess Im not the like-able type because no one likes me like that. I made cookies today. Peanut Butter ones. The 'rents liked them. But I got sick both times after eating them. I think im allergic to Peanut Butter. That would suck. Oh, deary me. It's 12:08. and I gots some stuff to get yet. If I can I will write later. If not then I will tomarrow sometime. *Someone Save me.*
