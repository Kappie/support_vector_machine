The move took longer than we thought it would, and I am still trying to find a place for everything in the house. The apartment we were living in down in Waco was something like 550 square feet. We fit everything in there somehow. Now we have 960 square feet and though we not as cramped, we are barely fitting! Everything is getting put away, slowly, and we’re getting situated.   The day we moved, Friday July 9th, Matt, Chummer, and Galileo came up here to the house early, while I waited for the mover to pack everything up and get on the road. When Chris, Jennipher, and I finally arrived at the house there was no power. We had enough problems without that too! Matt informed me there was power, he just managed to blow a fuse on the air conditioner and that’s why we were lacking the essential cool air that would make a July afternoon in Central Texas bearable. We waited for the air conditioning tech for almost an hour when he arrived and fixed the problem, which happened to be a positive hooked to a positive and a negative hooked to a negative. While we waited, I began looking for Chummer and Galileo. Jennipher finally found them in the bathtub in the front bathroom. The bathroom happened to be sweltering, when I asked Matt why they were cooking alive in the bathroom he said that’s where he’d taken them when they arrived and they had stayed there. I took them out of the bathroom and Jennipher and I put Chummer in the freezer –with the door open- because it was the only cool place in the whole house. Chummer wouldn’t drink the water and was acting very strangely, cat deliria I suppose. He began panting like a dog, so the freezer was the best possible choice, considering that it had been cooling overnight before the electricity went out.   When the air conditioning guy finally fixed the problem and charged us a service call, we had air conditioning, but where were the movers? I had noticed immediately upon our arrival that they hadn’t yet arrived, which was strange since they left almost an hour before Jennipher, Chris, and I. In the midst of the air conditioning catastrophe I had almost forgotten that they had not arrived yet, but when the air conditioner was restored to working condition I began to worry about where the mover was again. Finally they arrived while the a/c guy was finishing up.   The movers were another situation entirely. The driver Herb was a total weirdo! As I said, Matt left my girlfriend Jennipher and I to deal with the movers and I'm not sure I am ever going to forgive him. Herb kept telling us to smile, be happy, it was weird. I just wanted to get moved. Its not that I was trying to be rude, but we paid him for a service and talking was not it. He moved our things, but he just kept on talking to us while he was doing it. I felt like telling him, “less talk, more moving.” They left an hour ahead of Chris, Jennipher, and I, arrived an hour after us, and Herb went back to talking rather than moving. Chris actually helped unload the truck so they would leave. Jennipher and I were completely creped out by this guy. The word predator came to mind, not just mine but also Jennipher’s.   When the mover left, it was just Matt, Chris, Jennipher, and I, with a lot of boxes. There were so man boxes we could barely move around them. I think there was a total of 60 boxes total, plus a few crates, and all of our furniture. We went out to dinner, leaving the boxes for another time. Dinner was okay; we ate at a Mexican restaurant in Hico. I would normally recommend this place highly, but the food just seemed to be tasteless this particular night. Oh well, so much for having a good meal and to top it off the margaritas were very strong, too strong!   Chris and Jennipher left around 10:30 pm and I went to bed. The next morning I was up unpacking bright and early. I finally got nearly everything unpacked by the following Monday. A box lingered here and there –still lingers here and there- but for the most part we got everything done! Alleluia! I think I already mentioned that we went to Waco again last Friday, July 16th. We finished packing everything up and between our little Sunfire and Jennipher’s Rodeo we managed to get everything here…almost. Chris and Jennipher still have a few things sitting around their apartment that belong to us for the next time we go to Waco, but other than that we are done, finished, fini, finito!   I am still trying to find a place for the never-ending clutter, wish me luck, but for the most part everything is done. Matt’s dad is coming up on Thursday to see up, yippee. All things considered this has been the best move Matt and I have ever had. That’s saying a LOT for us. We tend to have terrible moves, possibly the worst ever. Still, with the movers moving all of our furniture and the majority of our boxes of stuff, we still had a lot to do. The apartment was not left as clean as I would have like it to be but hey, that’s life right?   I have to say that without Jennipher and Chris, this move would have been far more of a nightmare! Thanks guys, from the bottom of my heart!   ~Kristyn
