I waited up until 11:30 last night to see if he would be online, just to tell him I love him and to say hi, but he never came on. They are always changing his schedule around so he really can’t give me a definite work schedule. I never know when his days off are until after they happen. I just have to keep telling myself that all of this is petty, he is safe and that’s all I should be concerned about.   I guess partly I am bothered by the fact that he isn’t home when bad things happen to me. I have to say I contribute my being sick forever to the fact that my immune system is probably low because of me being sad or upset about him being gone. I know it sounds funny but emotional stress can affect your health.  Other than that I am doing ok. I am still suffering from the allergy monster (please note he has graduated from bug to monster over the course of one day) and I find that it takes great skill to consume a meal when you cant breath through your nose.   If I keep blowing my nose the way I have, Jesse should have no problem finding me, all he would have to do is look for the red glow that has developed from the constant blowing.  And on top of all that, my cat bit my finger this morning and broke skin (Don’t ask- if you really want to know just email me it’s wussamattayu@yahoo.com, please put cat bite in the subject line) so now I am typing with a handicap.  I guess if Jesse happens to read this just know that I haven’t broken anything yet, and I do still have all ten fingers and nine… oops ten toes.  :-)  Its so nice to have a sense of humor about these types of things.
