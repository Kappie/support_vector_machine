I still have to pack, and I have to take my grandma shopping at some point today, plus fill the car w/ gas again so my dad doesn't get mad.  I was supposed to wash it, but who gives a fuck... it'll just get dirty again anyway.  In all honesty I'm too damn lazy to do much of anything... I want to call about my senior pics too, but I don't feel like it right now...  This sucks.  I hate being lazy.
