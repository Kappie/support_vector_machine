I think tomorrow I'll finally get my tickets for Montenegro worked out, which then gives a baseline for dates for the Spain trip, at least for the date on which whoever I'm traveling with will have to compromise and make sure we are in a city with an airport so that I can get to London.   Ah shoot.  Stuff to do.
