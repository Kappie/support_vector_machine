Chocolate here and chocolate there but tomorrow I am going to eat really healthy and try keep it up for the entire week.  Also there is so really good news.  We went to the Saturn dealership today just to look around at some cars in the lot and next time my dad comes in we are going back to the dealership and I am pretty sure he is trading in our van and getting the L300 series for him and my Mom and buying me a used.  We saw a REALLY really nice 2001 LS-200 today which was like so nice and my dad checked up on it and said he really liked it and stuff.  NO ONE BETTER BUY THAT CAR OR ELSE.  It's my car...!!!  It is just like the car I drove for drivers ed (Is that like totally freaky or what?!?) and well it's the same color too.  It's like a really nice light blue color.  I love it!  Hardly anyone has cars like that and the interior is great.  And since I drove a car like it for Drivers Ed, I know where most of the things are in the car.  I want it so bad but my dad doesn't come in for another two weeks.  He is heading back to Vacouver tonight and it's his b-day tomorrow.  My mom also said that if he buys me a car then she is going to buy me a cell phone.  I was in a state of shock when she told me this.  I mean I have asked and asked and asked to the point on no return and now she is practically offering me one.  I guess she is right that I do need one.  She needs to be able to contact me at times and in case I need to call CAA/AMA then I am going to need it.  Like "YES!" if I get a a car then it is guaranteed that I will get a cell and she is paying the bill though I can't rack up charges but that is not something I would do on purpose anyways.  I still have to come up with a play for how to pay for gas but I do have money saved in the bank for a while that should last me a while.  My dad asked "If I buy you a car and everything, Melissa payed for gas, so I would expect you to pay for gas too, so would you buy your own gas."  And of course knowing how badly I want a car I said "yes" because I have a lot of money now but depending on how much I use the car, gas could become quite expensive.  I don't have a job for incoming money either.  I know long ago I used to work at Perkins but I couldn't keep up with the demands of school and work.  So now when I apply for jobs I put I am only available from Friday to Sunday.  No one ever calls me back when I apply places that I actually do want to work.  There is nothing wrong with my resume.  Employers just think that your only life should be work.  No offence though I am not one to go pick and choose.  I just need a BALANCE of school and work, though to employers the word 'balance' is almost unheard of.  All they seem to want these days is someone who is available 24/7.  They don't care how much experience you have, how qualified you are, or nice you are.  Plain and simple, they are going to hire the people that have a wider range of availability than those that don't.  And well if actually wanting some time to focus on school and continue to do well is interfering with getting hired or a job then whatever.  It's just sad that people put more emphasize on stuff like that, than actually caring about the things that really matter.  So to sum things up:  My dad bought me a laptop, I might get a car (though eventually forsure get one), and then a cell phone.  Hmmm I begged for all these things before and the answer was always no, no, no.  Slowing it changed to maybe, maybe, maybe.  Not it's a probably, probably, probably.  I have stopped bagging, stopped asking.  I am slowly but surely getting what I want.  I suddenly feel very lucky.  And I am very lucky.
