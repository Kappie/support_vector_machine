(Horse Anigrami)   Kayburen Dracon: Daughter to Count Dracula (the vampire), she is the one that is caught in the middle of the war with no clear way out. Upon discovering her family line, the kinghts of the holy order removed her from their service and now the once unmatched monster hunter roomes the streets as a freelancer.Her ego does not allow her to  find her father as she had already killed so many of his servants, but as the war progresses it is starting to become very clear that the only way for her to survive is to go to him for help.

Count Vladislaus Dragulia: Father to Kayburen and lord of vampires and werewolves, he had known all along that Kayburen was his child but did not have the will to tell her the truth when he saw the hatred in her eyes when he killed her friend Jet. So he played the dangerous game of cat and mouse, pretending to try and kill Kay while in fact trying to keep watch over her. With Lord Voldemort's constant challenges to his throne, he has to juggle two enemies at once, the knights of the holy order and the Death Eaters, while all the while hoping that his daughter will one day discover the truth of her family.
