Isn't it beautiful?  Two of us walking hand in hand.  I want to go to  your town, your home, your arms.   I dream of lying  against your chest.  My body in your clasp,  disappearring into the evening.   Words stopped by the wind  are a gentle illsion.  A cloud-torned tommorrow is  a far-away voice.   My heart has been in  a moon-blocked flowing mirror.  Stars that swayed and flowed  can't hide my tears.   Isn't it beautiful?  Two of us walking hand in hand.  I want to go to  your town, your home, your arms.   I dream of  your face  that softly melts  in the morning.
