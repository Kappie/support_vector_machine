That fits, I just wish it didnt. I dont think i should have to be the one who fixes things with Andrew. If he's gonna be like this, not caing, he doesn't deserve me. And he definittly doesnt deserve me giving up everything just to fix things with him.      I never know what i want anymore though. One day it's everything perfect with Andrew, then it's drama, then it's Kyle, and then backto Andrew.      Kyle- what another subject! Everywhere I go something reminds me of him, whether it's his basketball number or a song he mentioned once. But he's so wrong for me, right? He practically hates me now, and you know who's fault that is... MINE! I'm the stupid one that listened to my "friends" that say " Oh he's a player" or "He's never serious, maybe he's gay" It's the stupid comments like that. I'm sick of it. I've seen the other side of him, though. He can be sweet, romantic, sexy, considerate, caring, protective, fun, funny, my list goes on and on. I really like him, and we used to be like best friends. We loved each other, as friends, maybe more. But that's all done now. I'm running my own life from now on.      Andrew's out of town. I miss him, but since he's not calling me, i'm not calling him. I'm sick of doing that act. If he wants to be with me, he's gonna have to make an effort. But i'm going out of town soon, so we'll see if he calls my cell... I don't know.         Leave me comments please.
