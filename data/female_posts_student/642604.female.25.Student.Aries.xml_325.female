Also, took a final tonight and pretty sure didn't ace that one so guess who is livid and pissed off... THAT WOULD BE ME!  This is going to fuck up my 4.0!  Damn it.  Anyway, the reason that I actually signed on to write something down is because I saw a bumper sticker while I was waiting for the bus earlier and I wanted to post it here.    HATRED is not in my family values!  Take that Mr. Bush!
