So, about this vacation  Not my dream vaca, visiting family and all. But it'll still be fun because of the  Octoberfest . I've been waiting for it since last year. TighTnesS.. I can't wait any longer- and it's 3 days away! Meh... I guess not all is lost. All is not lost because I have moo-moo. No, I'm not weird. Moo-moo is my serta counting sheep and your jealous cause you don't have one (a serta counting sheep that is..) :-P.  Right, as you can prolly tell I'm just a little sleep deprived. Im gonna go now.
