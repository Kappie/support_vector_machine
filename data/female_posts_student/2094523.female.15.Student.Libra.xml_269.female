They are so reasonable and they are pretty damn smarter than all the peopel that actually stay in school. Hell Id drop out if i wasnt so much of a coward. I mean u learn so much more when ur outta school when u actually live life.. the way everyone was put here to do. If u cant take it drop it leave it do whatever pleases your pathetic heart so it can finally satisfy you. Everyone is caged in misery because we are so lost. We do what everyone else wants us to but when will we finally take the time to do what the hell we please. think bout it. We're just wasting our lives away coz we're all idiotic creatures. Lifes too short to be angry, lifes too short to fake it, lifes too short to hold grudges, lifes too short to bitch @, lifes just life and no matter what we do we will never complete it happy. Fuck it down the draion. I hate so many people I really do.. no one every undertsands anyone and everyone wants too much outta everyong when they have nothin left to give anyways. When a person does something that doesn't satsify u its pretty selfish to just fuckin leave them and ignore the number of times they were there for u, the number of times they wiped away your tears, the number of times they decdicated themselves all for you, and the countless number of times they were actually a friend to you. WHat more can i say? People are so selfish. Its all about themselves isnt it because no matter hyow much u say u care for someone.. u dont. U fuckin dont because all the only thign u ever give a damn about is yourself. Why dont peopel just die by them,selves. die happy by themselves so they can stop hurting the ones around them and only hurt themselves in a painless way. Death.
