I am so extremely excited because Travis is going to go and buy my concert tickets in few days. YAY! I hope my mom lets me go, its actually in a week. I dont really know a lot of songs by the Lost Prophets but I'm sure it will be a good concert. I hope it is. I also feel really bad because I cant pay for my own ticket and Travis doesnt even really want to go. Oh well. He offered and its my birthday present from him and Nicole.    Oh, I was looking yesterday and I am really excited because I have coupons for six flags to get a friend in for 1/2 off anytime from August 9th - 29th. So I can go up to 4 different times with 4 different coupons. Its really nice having a pass and all.    Well I think I have to break down and fill out my applications tomorrow. Its finally time to suck it up and do it. I need to get money, I'm sick of pissing people off and making them pay for me. Everyone tells me I'm lazy and pathetic so I guess I'm just sick of it. I need to give in to the pressure and do it. Along with taking driver's ed because I'm sick of depending on others to tote me around. It's bullshit and no one likes to do it so I might as well just give in to that while I'm at it and get my frickin' license and tote my little self around. I dont know I think I just need to be responsible for myself for once instead of having other people have to worry about me or having me not being able to do something because I cant afford it or I cant get there. I always feel so bad so I'm done being a mooch... Well actually I'm not until I get a job and I wont stop mooching rides for a long time because I can't take a class anytime soon. Still at least I am putting forth effort to do it. AnywaysI must be going, my brother wants to computer for awhile.   -gabby
