So you know my blood was boiling, right?  His friend at the corner saw me coming, though... mmhmm... I had the obligatory "OH NO YOU DI'ENT MOTHAFUCKA" look on my face when I said, "UM, EXCUSE ME?!?!  BUT DO YOU MIND NOT MAKING YOURSELF AT HOME ON MY CAR?!?!?!"    Motherfucking fuckers!!  I mean, HOW DARE HE!?!  I swear I almost took  urlLink The Club  and beat him over the head with it.  I think he could tell I was about to hurt him cause he backed away slowly and apologized.  His friend was like, "Oh, SHIT, yo!  Oh shit!"  Dumbasses.  Also, on a lighter note...  "Summertiiiiiiiime and the livin' is eeeeaaassssyyyyyy..."   If Fantasia doesn't win it will be a travesty.  I tried calling a billion times but all the lines were busy.  Hmmph.
