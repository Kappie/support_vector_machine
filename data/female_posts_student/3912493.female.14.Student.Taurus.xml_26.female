What are they going to do, take over the world by sweeping it squeaky clean? -Atomsmasher   Y'know, I thought the band camp wasn't going to be for a while...but then Sally tells me that it's this Monday at 8 AM... Oh, the horror! I hope I don't forget. It feels like I'm going to school because I have to wake up at 7 AM and get there at 8 AM. Those other 10th and 11th graders are gonna feel so superior to us and try to tell us what to do...probably. But, if they try to embarrase me or make me look more stupid than I already am, then they'll meet the real dany, and the real dany can get pretty mean. So, if they mess with me, I'll mess with them. Crap, how much I hate band. Someone wake me up from this nightmare.  But anyways, Regi-chan told me something that I couldn't believe. It's quite shocking, and it just makes you see what kind of creeps the band directors are. I changed the spelling and grammar a lot. =P   Ok, see...when my brother quit band, he didnÂ´t want to get out of the car to get his stuff, and so instead my mom got down. She was asking for the mouthpiece, but didn't know what the name was. So she asked Mr. King, "Do you know where the thing where you blow through is??" and he replied "Are you stupid?" and some other stuff. I think he was treating her like she was mental or something. Then she came running to the car crying, and couldn't tell my brother the story because she was crying so much. Ha-ha, my aunt said that whenever she comes to Dallas, my brother is going to show him that man so she can cuss him out in Spanish XD! See how mean he was to my mom?!   All I can say is...wow. I never thought any band director could be so mean and disrespectful, especially to a parent. I mean, what the fug? It's not Mrs. Urrutia's fault that she didn't know what the name of it .was. How did he expect her to know what the heck a mouthpiece was if she's not in band? Of course, band directors expect a lot from people, but they're just so fugged up! It didn't even happen to me, and yet I'm so fuggin' upset on what Mr. King did to Mrs. Urrutia. What an idiot. And I thought he was nice... pfft, moron.  Like Regi-chan said, all band directors are mean, and I just noticed that's true. Maybe their band directors from their childhood traumatized them so much, so now they're taking it out on us...or the parents. =s  So... yeah. Band camp's tomorrow and I'm so nervous. 'Tis gonna be be at the Panther Stadium, near the DHS. I'm so nervous...even though I now know what's going on. Hehe, Regi-chan and Kathryn-chan wanna come to the band practices, but Regi-chan can't come until the last rehearsal. It's fine with me, though, 'cause that'd be so embarrasing! I didn't tell either Regi-chan or Kathryn-chan where the band camp was gonna be, but that's alright, too. XD Kathryn said that she was gonna be yelling my name all the time, which would be funny and embarrasing, too. Crap, if I see those two some day at some practice, I'll be so happy! XD  Nothing much to say. I have to go to sleep early (10 PM) for one week and two days. Blaaah, how much I'm gonna miss summer! ;_;
