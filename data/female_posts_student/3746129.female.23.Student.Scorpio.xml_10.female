The following little blurb was the opening paragraph to an article I wrote on the topic of vegetarianism and the like.  It hits the issue in a fun manner and helps to grab the readers attention.  The poem that follows is one on the topic of acceptance and how I think that one person can make a difference.       'Welcome to the real world, where the arches are golden, take out is finger licking’ fried, and the cows are all mad.  In many ways there’s never been a better time to be a vegetarian.  It is definitely the wave of the future, but unfortunately, the present hasn’t quite caught up.'   Acceptance:   Why can’t people just accept That I’m different, Instead of trying to tell me Reasons why, Their way is the better way, And what I believe is wrong? No one understands the pain I feel in my heart When I see a piece of red meat frying in a pan; And why I get tears in my eyes  When I see fish packaged in can. Animals are living just like you and me. Since I don’t feast on my brother And he doesn’t feat on me; What makes it right to kill For the sake of consumption? When the earth provides a feast  That is fulfilling and tasty That doesn’t involve  The slaughtering of those  Who have no choice. They can’t speak up  For the purpose of saviour But can cry out in pain When the hunters shot the hunted And made his claim to fame. Everything that breaths has the right to live So why then do people take this sacred right away? Vegetables give protein just like the flesh of cows; And soy beans provide the same calcium  That also comes from a cow. Mother Nature provides us with ways  To feast off her, So why then do we kill the living Walking God’s green earth? You can push and shove your beliefs in my face But that won’t change the choice I made in my heart. Animals deserve the right to live And that right I plan to give.
