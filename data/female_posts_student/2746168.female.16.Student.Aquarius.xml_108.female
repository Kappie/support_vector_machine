Well, I'm on vacation - you know, that thing where you relax and don't do stuff like this? - but I guess I'll post anyway to keep you happy.   Lesse...We've gone on several excursions the past few days, though "we" is usually two adults and three kids. Dad, Bruce, Ben, Taylor, and I sought out some Mayan (Aztec? Inca?) ruins, but never found them, instead taking a four-hour detour through the middle of nowhere and seeing some interesting things. A dam in a canyon, a hole-in-the-wall village with chickens running through the yards, and a beautiful church in a town of a hundred people were a few of the things we stumbled across. Yesterday, the Arendales (sans Katy; she left for a few days) and I went to a market on the other side of town, just to check out what it was like, but it was mostly produce and clothes. And several days ago, we all went to this gorgeous ranch where some millionaire's going to build a golf course. Personally, I liked it the way it was. Actually, we were supposed to go to a glass factory, but we got there like half an hour late and missed our tour. So we went to the ranch instead.   Now what? Um...Taylor left yesterday. Katy's coming back...er, soon. Tomorrow, or something. Lizzie's been at camp for a week, or a bit more.   As far as what everybody's up to...well, I can't tell you for sure. Alafair and Bruce are taking a sculpting class; both are making fish of some sort. Avery rides horses every morning. Dad does whatever Dad does. Laura and Lida go shopping. Ben hangs out with a bunch of girls he's found. And I...Well, if we're not doing something interesting, I'm in my room, writing HTML code or some such nonsense. I brought my computer up onto the roof one day to work, but the glare was such that I could hardly see the screen. Don't get me wrong; I love being in Mexico, but web design is just so much  fun!  Seriously! Who would've thought it, eh?  At any rate, I can't believe our time here is halfway spent. That's insane. I feel like I live here.  Okay, I  do , but not literally. However, if home is where your heart is, then I do indeed live here year-round. It's just so...so....Not  perfect  (no place is), but so  close  to perfect. You know? No big-city pollution or shopping malls or glitz or glamor or stress anything like that. Just...life, diluted to its purest form. Again, it's not perfect (for one thing, the Internet connection is really spazzy) but hey, it's close enough for me.   Okay, that's enough. I'm off to gather manipulable graphics to mess with in PaintShop Pro 8. See ya.
