My friend and I were swimming in her pool and I was telling her my plans for this weekend, and how I might go see Farenhiet 911. Then her brother piped in. This is kind of how the conversation went.   (Friend's bro)"Yeah, you'd like that. You're the political type."  (Me)"What's THAT mean?"  "You're the Political Type. I dunno how to explain it"  "How would you know?" (I've never had a single real conversation with this guy besides where things are in his house)  "You just are."   Now, I definetly wouldn't consider myself the political type. I mean i have a slight interest in what's going on in the world, just so i'm not completely oblivious to the things around me, but not hardcore "fight for your rights" kinda person. I can't even say more than "yes sir" and "Okay" to a police officer. None of you really know me, but if anyone reading this is super good at analysis, do you think i am?   -Ali
