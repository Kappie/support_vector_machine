I am so ready for school to be out. Three days, and I haven't even submitted my applications. What am I thinking? I've got to get on the ball, or I'm pretty much guaranteed a job at home with my sister, and I'm just not up to that.  All I really need is to do a little shopping, that always makes life better.
