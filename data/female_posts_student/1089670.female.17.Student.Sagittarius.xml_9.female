The simple message was - "When ur hope is gone - u'r gone 2.." I dunno why he said dis stuff to me.. maybe juz to share or maybe the comment of my nick.. Indeed dat time maybe my msn nick showed dat my hope to wait 4 him nearly gone.. I dunno whether I should remain to wait patiently or not.. I dunno.. I want the answer noww !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really can't wait any longer.. >_>_  + vc +
