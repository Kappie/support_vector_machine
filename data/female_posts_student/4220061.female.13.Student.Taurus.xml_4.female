My mom says (from watching practice) that i'm one of the best people out there... so I am hopeful. Nobody will mess with me if I'm on jv badminton according to Katie.  What else?  Me and Katie did this skit for  Exodus  today... it wasn't as funny as intended, but we still got our point through with some laughs. I think I'm going to do fine (academically and socially) in Pre-IB. I'm already making some friendly acquaintances with cool people, and I already have some pretty good friends. Life is good in highschool- much better than middle school. Some people really hated me there... A LOT.  I also like to be around smart people, because they aren't so stupid. There are these totally stupid girls that sit behind me in first period that don't know what 'outgoing' means. Damnit, they had better drop out.  Way more hot kids than I thought there would be for loser classes too... but there are also some weird-looking kids. I swear to Gosh that this kid named Michael C. has a glass eye... or a lazy eye... same thing   urlLink http://diaries.suchisthis.com/candicetortoise  -go there to experience Candice's badass essence (I had to switch my blog accounts because my daddy found it and that was pretty terrible)  Alright... that's enough for now!  Party on!  -Candice
