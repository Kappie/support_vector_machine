Blogger staff had the following to say about it:  We've just released a new-fangled version of Blogger that'll let you fancify your posts using a feature-rich text editor. Go forth and align, colorify and embolden your words.  But remember, with great power comes great stylistic responsibility.    Notice the part I made bold. :P   Oh, also google bought the picasa company! yay! [The people that make hello]  Anyway, you can now  urlLink get a free copy of picasa .  I haven't tried it... But i'll likely do that later tonight.
