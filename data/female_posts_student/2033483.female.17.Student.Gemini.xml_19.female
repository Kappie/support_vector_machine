But, I think the kid that sits next to me must have skipped his shower again this morning b/c he didn't smell too good.  Physics-I walked in to find half the class b4 me still taking their quiz I forgot about.(oops!)  In AP Lit and Comp, I sat down to only get asked by Brett Peterson "If our vocab test was gonna have all 60 words on it?"  My answer was, "What vocab test?"  Yes, I didn't know about the Unit vocab test, again(oops!) But, I think I did okay. Thank you, Brett!  Mrs. Benz read some essays aloud that we should models ours after and personally I think they were both boring as hell!  But on the second one, the kid said Voltaire and it reminded me of the "Princess Diaries"  When Lilly goes, "Voltaire, Voltaire, personally I'd like to learn about Voltaire!" And then Mia mouthed "Thank you"  I love that movie!  Why can't I be a princess and have a rock star boyfriend that just so happens to be the lead singer for Rooney?  My favorite part is at the end when they kiss and Mia's foot pops and all the lights go on in the garden. Awww...classic!     Anyways, Lunch was great like always!  I mean why wouldn't it be?  I get to "site see" And I must say this, Drew (Sean told me his name so it's right) can eat ALOT!  When Renae and I were standing in line he was walking back to his table with a tray of food and then when we were standing in line to pay for ours he was buying another meal.  So he got two b4 we got our one.  And I don't know where that kid puts it either!  Chemistry was uber easy!  AP History was uber boing...again.  And Newspaper was educational as always.  I learned how to fax today.  When I came back I helped Stephanie Tschetter edit Ben's commentary.  He typed French fires instead of french fries...hahaha that sill cracks me up!  It was hilarious.     Now, I am at home putting off writing my Literary Movement paper.  I've finished all of my other homework and should work on that paper.  But...eh...  ~tata
