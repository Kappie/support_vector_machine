Sometimes I go by THE Reverend Jojo Jenkins (long story). AND yes, I am Sylvie's sister.  In a nutshell, this is what has been going on in my life lately: ~Boyfriend drama. I fucking blew it. I always mess stuff up. I love him. :'''( ~Went to Tsedey's friend's memorial service. I've never seen a dead person before. ~Shanelle was (or still is?) feeling suicidal in 3rd period yesterday. I told her how much I love her and that I wasn't gonna let her do that. She says she's okay now. :-S  http://toureille.deviantart.com/ That's where my journal, art and photos are.  I'm not in a very good mood, so that's all for tonight. Nice meeting you all and have a goodnight.  :]
