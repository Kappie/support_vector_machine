If I'm caught, I'll be deadmeat."  I looked at my watch. It was only 9.45 pm, barely an hour from when we had gotten seats and started talking. Gadafi too looked at his watched.  "Aww, come on Myra. It's not even 10 yet. Just chill babe. Where you staying?"  I looked at Gadafi. Was he trying to make his move? Myra wasn't his type though. She was chubby, at the very least. And about 3 years too young. Then again, with Gadafi, you can never tell. I turned to Myra, who started whispering to a girl seated next to her. Rose-or-something.  "Not far. About 10 minutes from here. Taman Bunga Raya. But my parents are at my dad's office dinner and I don't know what time they'll be back. And I have to get back before they do."  Gadafi groaned. For the full effect, I groaned too.  "Aw man, that's like so close. We can drop you off later.  Kan , Far? Saves you a taxi and you'll get to hang out with us for a while still."  I could tell that Myra was wavering. She leaned over to her friend and whispered some more. Shaking her head, she got up.  "Sorry guys. Rita and I really need to go. I can't afford to stay any longer."  Gadafi's cigarette was poised above the ashtray.  "You want us to send you home?"  Myra shook her head.  "Sokay. We'll find our way home. It was nice to finally meet you G-man. Err, Gadafi. You're exactly like what I thought you would be."  And then she turned to me.  "And it was nice meeting you too, Fariz. Maybe one day we'll bump into each other online."  I nodded. Who knew?
