Yes two totally different words, but it's fun.  Now we're watching Spongebob and tryign to get her to fall asleep, maybe it would help if we actually watched something she liked....*cough erin cough* change the channel.  Okay i put her video in her T.V. and it's playing like "naptime music" and what not.  So maybe she'll fall asleep.  We've already been out in her backyard for like an hour or so. And she's rubbing her eyes.  So yeah. anyway i'm done describinb what Ali looks like when she's sleepy.   So besides that WEDNESDAY IS MY BIRTHDAY! And i'm going to waterworld with bab and then Beaujos later that night with Teej, so i think it'll b fun! I can't wait, cuz a week after my b day i'm taking drivers ed and since i'll already b 15 i can get my lisence the first day! :-D Yay!  Toodles 4 now! -Kel
