We learned about facial recognition software, image recognition software, different types of printers and scanners, 3-d imaging, and OLED screens. I thought the idea of machines being able to recognize whats in photos so they could sort them for the customer and adapt their processes, was really cool. I think it is amazing that people know how to use math and computer programming to make a machine almost intelligent. I wish i could have seen some of the math behind it and the actual programming. The OLED screens were also neat. I can't believe how thin they are and how sharp the image looks.
