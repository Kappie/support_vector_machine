That episode literally fucked me up.  My heart dropped because it was so unbelievable.  I dreamt about it all night long.  And I never even liked the character, so maybe I felt a little guilty?  Ok, a little background for those who dont know, and a spoiler for those who watch the show, but didnt see it last night...  1. Jack Bauer (Keifer) is an agent of CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit) located in Los Angeles.  Jack is a very troubled man.  His old partner went double agent a few years back and killed Jack's wife.  He's got serious issues and is even a recovering heroin addict (he did it to infiltrate a drug ring and got hooked.)  2. There is a European terrorist with a biological weapon that is a contageous virus.  He is using it against the President and the President has CTU working overtime to get this guy.    3. President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) also has a history with Jack (Jack saved his life) and he tends to ask too much of Jack.  But whatever, he's the President.  4. Jack has a boss.  Ryan Chappelle (Paul Schultze) is a micromanaging asshole from Division Headquarters.  He disapproves of Jack and his 'rogue' ways.  That said, he helps out when he believes that what everyone is doing is right.  So basically the terrorist guy finds out that Chappelle is tracking a money trail that leads back to him and demands the President to have him killed within the hour.  What does he do?  Well he cant do much, this terrorist has 11 vials of this virus that he will let loose if Palmer doesnt listen.  So the President calls on Jack, the only man he knows who could do such a thing.  (i.e. someone who's fucked up enough to kill their boss because the President told him to.)  And what does Jack do?  Well, after a futile attempt by CTU to catch this guy before the hour is up, Jack is forced to kill Chappelle.  A bullet to the back of the head with him saying, "I'm sorry we failed you Ryan, God forgive me."  BANG!  My heart just dropped.  It was so sad.  Steve and I were speechless.  I'm tellin' ya, this bothered me so much that I had to go to bed!  Sigh.  Rest in Peace, Ryan.
