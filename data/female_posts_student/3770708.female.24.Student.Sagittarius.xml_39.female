This has been a source of great anticipation and endless frightening school dreams - the kind where you suddenly realize you forgot a class for the last semester and failed. Often taking place at Ringling, curse them.  Gavin, at 5:30pm, crashed in bed and is on his way to sleeping until dawn, having failed completely to take a nap today. I'm at a loss for entertainment, as the tv has lost it's appeal and I'm all storied-out with books and conversation. Even art seems tedious tonight. I'm having great fun, however, playing with my new diet toys, and I'm pleased to say that after only four days, I've lost two pounds. Amazing. I imagine myself as a slender librarian with a tight bun and a short skirt, with clever little glasses perched on my nose. I really must find some non-presciption glasses to make me look more learned. Preferably horn-rimmed, with little rhinestones in the corners. Oh yes.
