Yesterday was hell.  Dad took Cody to the airport and I went with, just to get out of the house.  While we were there Dad and I started talking about our trip to Kansas.  He said I was going to be driving some of the way and as a joke I said, "yeah watch us get lost."  He said no because I'd have the directions.  He then went on to say that we weren't leaving until 6 that morning after he said the day before 4am.  I corrected him and he said, "No 6 cuz then we'd get there at about 2, or if I don't get my check 9 then we'd get there at 5."  I got mad saying the later we got out there the later we were staying and he said no.  So I told him he could go back alone and I'd just stay out there, he could mail my stuff home.  He then leaned over to whisper something in Cody ear and he started laughing and said, "Yeah especially when she does this," and he ran his hands through his hair.  Dad then had the never to turn to me and say, "Guess what I said??"  He looked like he was all proud of himself.  I glared at him and told him it was probably something about Mom and he said he never talks about her (my ass, he's always making fun of her).  I said, "well there's only two people you bitch and moan about, Mom and Rudy." (Rudy is my gay uncle who I hate to no end)  As soon as I said Rudy, Dad and Cody busted up laughing and slapped hands.  I had enough, told them to stuff themselves and walked off.  I planned on just walking to the car and waiting.  After I got half way to the escalators Cody went walking past me, so I knew Dad had to be behind me.  I heard him ask why I was mad, and whip around looked him square in the eye and said, "Fuck off asshole."  He just looked at me so I continued walking.  I heard him say, "If you keep walking we're not going to Kansas."  But at that point it didn't matter because either way I was going, not like I don't have a mom or anything.  Cody and him walked back to his gate and I was still walking.  Once I got to the escalators I stopped and called Rachel because I was on the verge of tears and I just needed to talk to somebody.  I was going to tell Dad on the way home everything that was on my mind.  I was going to tell him that he was the reason I was going home early.  That I was sick of his teasing, that the teasing I've been getting all my life was what drove me to almost committing suicide.  I was also going to tell him why I hated Rudy because I knew he was going to ask.  I couldn't believe he'd even dare compare me with  that .  It's not that he's gay, I couldn't care less about that.  But Rudy is the only that messed with me the most.  In his mind, I'm supposed to respect him more than anyone and for the life of me I can't figure out why he would think that.  And then when I brought Rachel to my dad's house for my 15th... everytime I've seen Rudy after that he's always called me his "little lesbian", and then asks me, "how's your lesbian friend."  He hasn't asked me yet this summer, but if he dares I'm going to tell him I don't have one.  I've seen him twice and have been giving him the cold shoulder kind of.  I give him very, very short answers.  But after all this, we're still going to Kansas because instead of driving home from the airport he went to Target and asked me what pop I wanted to bring on the trip.  I've talked to him some today.  I plan on milking him for all he's worth on this trip after what he did.  I also plan on giving Cody a piece of my mind.  I'm sick of the taunting, teasing, be-littling, whatever you want to call it and I'm not taking it anymore.  If telling my parents to "fuck off" is the only way to get them to stop, well then, looks like I'm going to be saying fuck a lot more. later dayz
