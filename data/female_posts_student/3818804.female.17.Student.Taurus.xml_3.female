I get darker and darker everyday and I try not to, I meanI wear so much sunblock and I try to stay out of the sun as much as I can because I don't want to be too black for my senior pictures....But it's to freakin'' late bitches!!! Darn it...   I worked this morning for a while and then got pissed and stopped. I cleaned up and headed to TARGET....Target is my home boy. I love it there, but yep I got some essentials because my dad is too lazy to go do the shopping like he's supposed to. I got this lotion from Suave its like Vanilla and Roasted marshmallows...yum. Smells edible ;)   After Target I went to my uncle's house for a bit whereI got hit in the face... or rather bitch slapped by my two year old cousin...lolz and then my other cousin got mad at me and dug his nails in me and BROKE SKIN!!! You little shit head.   I then came home and worked somemore and sweated somemore...and can't forget! Got bossed around somemore and took it like a woman if I may add...   It's so hot!!! I want to go to Raging Waters, Six Flags, and the beach so if you want to take me, call me up bitches...lolz :D j/k I love you...but I really do want to go!   P.S. I hate being so indecisive....I wish I was older......   _l..l Rock on you little hotties ~
