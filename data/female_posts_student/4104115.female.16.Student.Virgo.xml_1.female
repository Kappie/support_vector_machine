Well today, ahem... I got up at around about 10:45ish, I ambled down stairs expecting that biatch of a mother to screw at me for being online late last night but she was cool and nice to me. She made me beans on toast for breakfast.   My cousin Roy came around, I do love him. He's a cool person and I like his new girlfriend Karen. She's tattooed and always has her hair up in this cool mess in which she sticks her sun glasses in. It's cool. What happened with Roy though was really weird. He went away for years and didn't contact us and when he finaly did he was married and had four step children and was living miles away in Buckinghamshire. Then he started having an affair with Karen, whom he was working for at the time. And his wife, Ann, was having an affair with Karen's husband. Now Roy and Ann are having a divorce and Karen and Roy are going to live near us and they've brought a pub and plan to buy another. They said I have a job with them. YAY! Woo frickerty hoo.  I miss Sig already, yesterday Jay went on holiday to Wales (wakeboarding and skiing for him) and we spent all day together in bed just hugging and 'playing chess' as Crystar (   urlLink  http://crystar.deviantart.com/    ) would say. I do love him, I want him with me now. I just don't know why I love him. It's so weird.  Meh, have to go get dinner started.  Bye.
