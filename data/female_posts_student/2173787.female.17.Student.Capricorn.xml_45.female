My grandparents (the ones from NY) arrived yesterday and i saw them for the first time in 2 years, which is pretty cool, but i digress.  Tonight we invited my other set of grandparents to come to dinner so there we are, one set on one side of the table and the other across the way.   Seems perfectly normal in a family sort of way.  And it is until i begin to what my grandfathers are casually chatting about...Germane.  This too could pass as normal if you didn't know my family.  But here comes the weird part, 2 men, one conversation, totally different experiences.  My mom's dad is a catholic raised in Germany before and during WWII.  My dad's dad is a polish Jew who spent his late teens early twenties in a concentration camp in Germany.  Somehow it never occurred to me that it should be surprising that they can have a nice chat about the geography of Germany.  I look at the two of them hunched over their cups of coffee and it amazes me.  My Zayde (dad's dad) is this tiny, old, nearly deaf man huddled in his chair.  My Opa (mom's dad) is this huge booming robust guy.  It just seems so weird, and even odder that I never noticed it before.  For some reason I am incredibly protective of my Zayde, he's had such a life I guess I try to shield him, and yet he continually surprises me.  He very rarely talks about the war, which took all of his family, his childhood and most of his hearing.  When I was little he told me he doesn't speak German because its painful, yet in order to have something to talk about with my Opa he speaks of the little bits of the country he saw, and will read the German papers my Opa always brings so as not to offend him.  What was also weird is the difference between their lives now.  My mom's parents tour the world, Austria last year the Caribbean next or something like that, while the big outing for my dad's parents is going out to the grocery store not in their neighborhood.  My Bubbe and Zayde moved this week into a retirement community because they are getting to the point that they can no longer take care of themselves, yet my Opa and Grandma do meals on wheels to help the "old".  There is only a 3 year difference in age.  Yet they can come together and talk and talk for 3 hours straight.  Life is one of those oddities that seems incredibly hopeful, as seen by two people with so many reasons to be at odds having a nice little chat, and so unfair, as one having a happy active life and the other aging and living with immense guilt for having the opportunity to age.  Sometimes i wish it was more fair, but everything would be so different, I guess somwhere there is a master plan, but....
