I have just spent the past 5 hours cleaning and looking and now you can see my floor as well as the card.  And the best advice in the world is officially "I will leave you with parting words of wisdom (and you must know they come from the wisest source there is--the other two voices in my head) look on your dresser and in a three foot radius around said dresser."  I also discovered that I have way too many clothes, even after I bagged up 2 complete trash bags of stuff for goodwill.  Its rather depressing when I think of all that I have.  My life is entirely consumerist. Losing my credit card is the scariest thing I've had to deal with in a long long time.  My drawers and closet are still bursting, after bagging up 4 dresses, 6 pairs of pants, 12 pairs of shorts, and countless tops.  I have 6 pairs of shoes to get rid of as well.  When did this happen?  I didn't used to be so clothes obsessive, did I?   Apparently i have an addiction...
