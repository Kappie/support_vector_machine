The exact color of the human eye is determined by the amount of a single pigment called melanin that is present in the iris of the eye. Melanin is a dark brown pigment that is deposited on the front surface of the iris. If a lot of melanin is present, the eye will appear brown or even black. If very little melanin is present the iris appears blue. Intermediate amounts of melanin produces gray, green, hazel or varying shades of brown.  Albinos have no pigment in their irises so the blood vessels in the back of the eye reflect light making the eyes look pink.  Another interesting point, all newborn babies have blue eyes because they haven't produced enough melanin to color them yet.  Cool, eh?  2.   Why don't we have hair on the bottoms of our feet or the palms of our hands?   This is my hypothesis.  Hair aids in sensing objects on one's skin.  The parts of the body that have hair need it either for protection or just as increased sensitivity.  Your hands have enough nerves to sense what they touch, so they don't need hair on them.  Besides, using common sense, hair would get in the way if it were on your hands or soles.  God was just being practical.    3.   What will you name your children?   I have actually thought about this quite a bit.  For the girls:  Emily Rose, Isabella Rose.  For the boys (I've only thought of one for sure):  Scott.
