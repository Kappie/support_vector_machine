I figured that most other knitters seem to have them these days, and I might as well jump on the bandwagon... also, my "normal" (i.e. non-knitting) friends were getting a bit annoyed by my constant knitting talk in my regular Blog. Now I can talk about knitting to my heart's content, and NO ONE CAN STOP ME!! Mwahahahah!    I will be trying to figure out how to change things... I know next to nothing about HTML. I don't even know how to insert a picture into a post. I hope to have that figured out soon...    Oh, well, done with this entry. I will try to have more intresting things to talk about next time.
