As I sat listening I just kept thinking "wow I should call Alek because he would really like to see the guitar player." Or I would think, "Alek would be really great in this band, I wonder if they need a bass player?" It was so strange for me because at times I would not even think of his name I would just say "my boyfriend blah blah blah." Then I would say to myself "not my boyfriend... my EX-boyfriend" I just hate that so very much. I never wanted this to happen and I swear that this was the farthest thing from my mind when I wrote the first E-mail to him. I just needed time to fix my life and now I don't know if I have made it worse. I wish I knew what to do, I wish I could talk to him, and I wish this never happened. Well you know what the say about wishing. Wish in one hand and shit in the other.... blah blah blah (you know the rest) Oh well I did this so I guess I just need to live with it. Talk to you later.
