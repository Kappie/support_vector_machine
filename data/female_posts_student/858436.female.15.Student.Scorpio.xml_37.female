So I am getting a tutor on Monday. John Kiblinger. Don't know who he is. I would have been totally fine with this if she would have told me beforehand instead of acting like I'm in the damn 3rd grade. I DON'T like people checking up on me behind my back. I am a very independent person and I don't want to treated like I'm freaking 5 years old. This really pisses me off.   Alright enough of that. I STILL have ea bunch of civics that I haven't done and left it at school. I just keep forgetting! I don't know what my problem is. So tomorrow I'm going to have to rush through it before school since I have the class 2nd hour. I am SUPPOSED to be in 3rd hour but nooo my art class just had to get screwed up and then screw up everything else. Geeze.   ENOUGH OF THAT! Haha everything today is in caps. Today was that all school mass. It was really short. But it was nice.. Mhm. I think I'm gonna go finish making everyone's Christmas presents.. yeah a month late but WHATEVER!
