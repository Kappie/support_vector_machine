       
      I'm dragging today.  I just can't seem to get motivated, and I still have two more finals to study and prepare for.  I keep telling myself the worst is over, but I'm not sure that is the case since I have to learn an entire class in three days.  But it will all be over soon, and then I will be going home for Christmas.   So as long as I keep the end in sight, I should be fine.
