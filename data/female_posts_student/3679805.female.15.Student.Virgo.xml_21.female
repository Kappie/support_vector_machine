STOP RYTHMING AND I MEAN IT! anybody want a peanut?"   ..yah i love the Princess Bride!! ;-)    As Another day passes by, I think of how much I like you more and more...  My friends see how likin you effects me but  they still seem to tell me "dont worry  everything will work out"..and i pray that they are right. And once in awhile ill get... "aww you 2 would be so cute together" and i just simply say "yah i do like him"   One Question "Why?" Why am i still chasing after someone that I  probably wont ever get... why am i fallin for you?  I'm sorry...
