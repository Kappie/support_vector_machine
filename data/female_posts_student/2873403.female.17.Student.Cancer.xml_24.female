I'd sort of like to blame Rob for this, but I can't because it was my fault and I did some stupid stuff. It was something like this: I did something bad-ish and stupid that I guess I shouldn't have done... Then when Rob told Nick about it he got all mad that I did it in the first place, but mostly mad because I lied. So he was pissed off all day and ignoring me and I didn't really understand what was going on, and then Rob sort of filled me in but I was still pretty confused about it, so the day continued with me being sad and unable to concentrate on the stupid HSPA test bullshit, and with Nick all ignoring me and wanting me to die and such. All because of one stupid little thing I did. So later, I got on the bus to go home (for the last time till June), and normally I sit with Nick, but he was being all Danielle-hating, so I sat down in the seat behind him and talked to my awesome tiny twin/ B.U.S. buddy, Erica. Then Amy got on and we discussed how much we hate certain conniving (yeah, I just learned how to spell that word properly all thanks to the spell checker thing that they have on here.)athletic equipment stealing bitches. Then something strange happened. James sat down next to Rob. Now, the whole James sitting down next to Rob thing wasn't really strange. What was strange was just the fact that he was there, since he doesn't actually go to school very often. Anyway, I decided to just be an asshole the whole time, because somehow, when I'm pissed off, being an asshole just makes it amusing. So we were all sitting there looking at this little book thing that James had and there was all this stuff about sex and drugs and such, then Rob turns to the page entitled "Mental Health," which had all.....  Holy ADD subject change interruption thing, Batman!: I love how my grandma just called and told me I'm boring.  Anywho, as I was saying:                                                                                                                    ...stuff about depression and self mutilation and suicide and he hands it to me. Then I looked at it, didn't read a word of it other than those subtitles and threw it at him, and it was kind of funny because both Rob and James looked like they were going to dive out of the way.. but really it was just kind of like James leaned one way and Rob went the other way...Yeah nevermind... But it was fun (or something). Then I sat there being all sad and every once in a while threw in some asshole comment just to be... well... an asshole. Not that it mattered anyway because Nick probably couldn't hear me since he was sitting there listening to music and hating me. Although the asshole comments weren't even specifically directed towards him. They were really just general asshole-isms. Yeah, I'm stupid, I know. So then when I got home, I actually did something somewhat smart. For once I tried to fix what I fucked up. So I called Nick. He was still pissed for a while, but something, I'm not sure what, but something made him change his mind. So everything is ok now.... I hope....   Other than that, today was quite uneventful, unless I was just completely oblivious to anything that might have happened. Lacrosse starts tomorrow. Ugh... That kind of sucks. Oh well. My family members are assholes. Goodbye.
