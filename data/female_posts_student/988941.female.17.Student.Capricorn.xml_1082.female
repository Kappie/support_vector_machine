But now we have these super fast PC's *ahem* that play games and scan in our math h/w and it'll do it all for us and spellcheck it.  Phones are lazy as well, whatever happened to the phonebox?  This is the way I see it: It is making society lazier. But I like it somewhat, as long as it isn't expensive for its purpose. For example, a smartphone (costing £500) is enough for me to build a nippy mid-class PC, which I think has more use than the smartphone, plus its cheaper to run. On the other hand, a phone costing £100 range is fair enough.
