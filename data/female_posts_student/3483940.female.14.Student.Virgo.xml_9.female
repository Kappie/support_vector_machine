It's really cold in my house, and my fingers are about to fall off. Im not in a really good/happy mood this morning. Im not sure why. Im getting the point were i am just fusturated with people. All people, and all the annoying little habits, and annoying little things that say or do. I need to relax. But its like i'm always sitting on the edge, ready to fall Or that the bottle is ready to burst. Oh man its really cold in my house. But that is ok. I will probably write more later. I have relised that no one leaves comments, maybe because im some annoying complainer. Meh oh well.  Hannah
