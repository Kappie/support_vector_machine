I've been wearing one of my ex-boyfriends braclet for quite a while now...i'm not too sure why i am though....i'm trying to think if its telling me something or what...but i haven't taken it off at all for almost 2 months now...like i don't even take it off in the shower...i'm not too sure why that is...i think the only time i took it off was when  i went to Brendan's prom and the only reason i took it off cause it didn't really go with my dress...hmm...makes me think....bah...i still need to talk about the talk i had with Bren last night...  not sure if i should've given him a second chance....does he deserve it? most people....*sabz* is telling me no....she's telling me that he deserves it...but i shouldn't of given it to him...but i'm pretty much giving him till the end of this week to show improvement....and then i'm giving him another week to change my mind...i'm not sure how its going to go...and at the moment it still isn't going too well...but i guess we'll have to wait and see won't we?
