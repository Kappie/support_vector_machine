First off, I'd like to say, that reading the wide variety of responses out there to the film, that my own thoughts on it are something akin to those of  urlLink Roger Ebert , from both a filmic and emotive standpoint.  His is actually one of the most thoughtful and reasoned approaches to the film that I have thus far encountered.  It is difficult for me to be reasonable in my approach to this, because it is an emotional and spiritual question that goes to the very core of my faith and identity, so sometimes I wonder when I read some of the vicious attacks of the film and of Gibson personally that are floating out there, some of which are from circles that I normally admire and agree with, I have to wonder if my emotions are getting the better of my judgment.  Then, I read such thoughtful and reasonable opposition on Gail's blog,  urlLink Crossing the Rubicon , and I see that this cannot possibly be the case.  As a case in point, I feel that  urlLink Andrew Sullivan  - who I normally appreciate above all else (I've given money to support his blog, and I read it daily, and always leave wanting more) - has been incredibly unreasonable on this issue.  Today, on his blog for instance, he has two entries that I find devoid of all meaning and relevance to the issues at hand.  The first can be  urlLink found here  (scroll down to the heading "Gibson on Non-Catholics"), where he notes that Gibson thinks that all non-Catholics (and presumably all those Catholics who don't share his particular view of pre-Vatican II Catholicism, though this is a guess on my part) are going to Hell.  First of all, I fail to see the relevance of this statement to anything.  So the guy has a particularly wacky, exclusive view of Christianity.  He is certainly not the only one.  It is in the nature of most religious belief to be exclusive in one way or another.  What matters is how those people treat others, regardless of whether they believe that person to be destined for Hell or Heaven.  Christianity teaches that God loves everyone ("God so loved  the world  that he gave his only begotten Son") regardless of whether they love His back or even believe in His existence.  Perhaps Mel Gibson doesn't believe this either, and this would be a valid line of attack against him.  But what Sullivan poses has no relevance whatsoever other than a silly attempt to make him look like a bad guy.  And for all I know he is.  But let's at least try to prove that with things that matter.  Second of all, this is old news, as I remember reading these quotes months ago in an interview Mel Gibson gave with the  New Yorker .  And I seem to recall vaguely from the Diane Sawyer interview that he made a statement that contradicted this (I do not remember the exact content, but I do remember thinking it was odd because I remembered the earlier statement from the interview - perhaps I will look into it if I have the energy after this post and update accordingly), so perhaps this is something that he really doesn't believe, or perhaps it is something that he has reconsidered, or perhaps he just thinks that saying it publicly makes him look bad.  The main point is Gibson has said a lot of crazy things and done a lot of crazy things over the course of making this movie, and singling this out for special comment seems slightly ridiculous to me.  The second entry from his blog can be  urlLink found here  (scroll down to "Noticing Evil"), where he links to  urlLink this piece by David Frum  and  urlLink another by William Safire .  Both of these pieces are interesting, and well worth reading, even if I disagree with their ultimate conclusions.  It is Sullivan's final statement that I take exception to: "Gradually, conservatives are cottoning on to the  real agenda  behind 'The Passion of the Christ.'"  Since both pieces are about the possible anti-Semitic implications of the film, and possible anti-Semitic leanings of Mel Gibson, I feel that this statement is unfounded.  Even if the charge can be leveled that the film is anti-Semitic on some level - a charge which, as I've said before, I do not subscribe to - this does not necessarily mean that this is the "agenda" of the film.  And I do not think it is.  Even Abraham Foxman has stated, most forcefully in the same Diane Sawyer program, that his major concern was not that the film itself was anti-Semitic - a charge that to my knowledge he has not directly leveled - but that it could be seen as anti-Semitic by some and fuel anti-Semitic feelings.  Perhaps this is just a facile distinction.  Except I don't think it is.  The difference between making a blatantly anti-Semitic film and making a film true to what one believes, but that also happens to fuel anti-Semitism, is huge, in my opinion.  And I do not feel that Mel Gibson set out deliberately to make an anti-Semitic film.  Perhaps I am wrong.  It could certainly be said that he has not done enough to allay fears that his film could provoke such a reaction.  But I also feel that with all the controversy for months and months, almost a year or longer it seems, surrounding this film before anyone even saw it means that no one can come into it with an unbiased eye.  And I think that all this controversy has done nothing to help the development of anti-Semitic feelings that have or will happen, and in fact has probably even hurt it in the long run.  It would never have occurred to me before all this mess began to come out of the movie blaming the Jews for anything, much less for the death of Christ.  I was not taught this either by my parents or by my religion - and my religious upbringing was as conservative and evangelical as you are likely to find - and to do so would not only seem strange to me as a person, but in complete opposition to my faith.  Am I unique in this?  Perhaps I am.  I do not profess to know what the average Christian is raised to think or believe.  But I do not think that I am all that unique.  I know that religion is a touchy subject, as is racial bigotry, and emotions tend to get in the way.  But I think if everyone would try to approach this with something less than hysteria and something more like caution, that differences could be worked out.  Or perhaps I am just too optimistic?  Or perhaps unreasonable?  I don't honestly know anymore.  I wish that I could just live with my personal experience of the film, without having to delve into all of these difficult questions that are way beyond my grasp and reach.  But when I read these attacks, I keep thinking that there must be something wrong with me for not seeing anything wrong with the film and indeed for seeing many things right with it.  For me it was a profoundly moving experience for which I am truly grateful.  But I begin to wonder if maybe I should have been sickened or offended by it.  But ultimately, I can only go with what I thought and felt.  And I cannot be swayed away from it by the fact that some crazies have taken things too far (as if they needed an excuse like this) or that even Mel Gibson himself is at fault or culpable in some way for not helping to stem the tide of the controversy.  But I do feel, from seeing the film, that his faith is indeed genuine, and perhaps his reaction is chalked up to defensiveness.  I do not feel that he could have made this film otherwise.  And while the other stuff matters, I'm not sure there's anything Mel Gibson could have done short of altering his vision or not making the film at all.  I leave it to you to decide for yourself whether he chose the right course of action, for I have nothing more to say on the matter, other than to say, while I might not have done it the same way as him, it was not my choice to make.
