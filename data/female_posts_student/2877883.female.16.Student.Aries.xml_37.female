So, yesterday I got the John Mayer Any Given Thursday DVD.  I know you're all so jealous. I like it.    I burned my mom the Guster CD because she is obsessed with them and has been begging me for weeks.  I really want the Guster CD from before "Keep It Together"  I think it's called "Lost and Gone Forever" or something like that.    So, Maine was lovely.  Relaxing after we made the condo really look like our own.  We have to paint the two bathrooms.  We are going for a medium blue downstairs and I'm really really pushing for a light green, I hope I'll get my way.   I finished "Raisin in the Sun" for English.  I'm not sure it had a point.  I got this weird sort of little rash on one side of my nose, which is really bothering me, since I have no idea what it's from.    i read a surgery about plastic surgery.  It was disgusting.   Now, unpacking. I also really want the O.A.R. CD.  Lovely.
