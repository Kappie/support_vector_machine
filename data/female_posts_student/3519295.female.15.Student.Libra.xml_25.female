(hey, i can give friggin mixed signals, too.)i left a message on his cell on mon. that said i was home, but that was all. he hasn't responded yet. all i said was "hey, it's me. i'm back. you're gay for not picking up your phone and if you're screening this call i'll kick ur ass."  i got back from morgan's on monday, where i had so much fun! (sorry...footloose is on in the background so this won't be my best work yet. hehe) i got to meet her boyfriend, michael, whose DADDY is the preacher-man, and who is also (cracking up) HOMESCHOOLED! them goshdarned homeschool kids are the funniest people in the whole world. OVERPROTECTIVE MOMS, JUST SEND YOUR KIDS TO PUBLIC SCHOOL. IT'S BETTER FOR THEM, ENDANGERED SPECIES, AND THE OZONE LAYER. AND THEY'LL HATE YOU WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO INTERACT W/ THE OPPOSITE SEX UNTIL THEY'RE 26. i'll fill you in about  every last detail about the trip  later.  oh, i have an announcement to make!!! I HAVE A READER WHO IS NOT MEGAN!!! her name is caroline (hi, caroline!) and i guess that she got my blog name b/c when i went and checked out her profile, it said swim team and i think that she and i are the only bloggers that are on the swim team (or who are proud enough to claim that we are indeed, swimmers, to the internet world.)  she thinks i'm EXCITING! [i know, megan, i can't figure it out, either...little does she know!!! HAHAHAHA!]  and, answering ur question, (sie hast eine frage, meike! ha!) my life is sometimes rated Y, most of the time just PG or PG-13(language), and the notes I wrote to nate in german are...NC-17(themes may be inappropriate for viewers under the age of 17. alchohol content, severe sexual content, violence, and occasional drug references. gaw, i love that kid.). she leaves me comments, and sorry, kiddo, but i didn't read any of them til about 6 1/2 minutes ago.   oh, caroline, drew is this kid whose relationship w/ me was hot, hot, hot after we went on a trip to frontier city (an amusement park that's only interesting if boy-yoys come) and almost made out on one of the rides in the dark. after that, he and i constantly flirted/ignored eachother and have all year since. never anywhere in between, always at totally different ends of the spectrem. odd, eh? needless to say, i am still madly in love with him.    liebe, katja von detton
