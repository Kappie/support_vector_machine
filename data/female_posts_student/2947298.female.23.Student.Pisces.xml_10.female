And no matter how hard I try I can't get it back, that order, that feeling that I belong in this skin. I woke up from some odd dream and that Outside song by Staind was in my head. I just can't shake that feeling...  Well last night was our sat night of  debauchery ! (ive been itching to use that word since I saw it on spongebob): Taco Bell (two #8s and a nacho supreme), movie (catch me if you can), popcorn(extra butter) and candy(mike ikes, snow caps, sour straws, whoppers) with my  baby (Rossnami) - who could ask for more!!! The movie I was avoiding because of all the hype wasn't half bad, I really loved the opening credits and shrudder to think how much time they put into those.  I think this was the start of "oh my god im gonna be doing this the rest of my life" question. Gave up architecture, law and museum curation for this! But it was a good movie, laughable even at the saddest moments.  Watching that movie was followed by watching two other HORRIBLE tv movies.  You know the kind you laugh at becasue its SO BAD rather than actually watching it. Man, this feeling is gonna haunt me until I have proper distractions.Very weird, eww, there was a spa bath in my dream and now one on the tv! But mine was spegetti! Something about piranahs and saving atlanta... very very odd! Sometimes I miss that feeling of sponteneity, of fleeting love and being so engulfed with it its close to encompassing all the feelings you had. Whatever...!!!
