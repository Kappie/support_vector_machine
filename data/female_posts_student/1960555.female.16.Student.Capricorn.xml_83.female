I've been doing lots of thinking lately, and I hate the answers that I've come up with.   If I were to go out with him, it would evidentally ruin my friendship with Amy.  (Remember that this is all hypathetical and stuff cause he has a girlfriend and he's not interested in me.)  It would be fine for me, and fine for him, but Amy would be uncomfortable with it and she'd want to leave the room and not be around us... me.  I would be the unintentional, teenage equivalent of a home wrecker.  I don't know if it would be resentment that she felt, but it would be something that would probably kill whatever she has with him, and definatly kill our friendship.  Now I honestly thought that it would work, and that not to much would change, but she thinks that everything would be different and uncomfortable.  I would never intentionally let that happen, but supposidly it would.  Why can't things work out how I want.  Just for once, I would have what I want, and everyone else would be happy.  Sadly, instead, everyone else is happy, and I'm just along for the ride.  I guess theres no use complaining about it.  No use worrying about something that will never happen.  I just wish that he wern't going out with her.  It would be like there was a shred of hope, even though there is none.  Why do I bother?  Nothing can happen.  Everything would seem better, but in reality, everything would be tearing at the seams.
