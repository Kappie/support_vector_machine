And everyone in the group started laughing, and looked ova at Luke and I, and I was laughing and looking at Luke and he just slid down in his seat and went bright red. It was a quite hilarious. And the fact that the movie said it was also funny. And also...Westie got lost at lunch. And we neva found him. U'd think it'd be easy seeing as he is so tall, but nup, we lost him and neva found him! Poor Westie.   I wonder where Westie is now.....
