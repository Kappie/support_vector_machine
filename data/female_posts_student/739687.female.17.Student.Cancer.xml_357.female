I can't live like that.  I can't live knowing that it's killing everyone else. I just don't feel anything. Except failure. I give up.  I can't describe what it's like to feel so empty. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to keep hurting people. I'm ruining my family. I'm tearing everyone apart and I just don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to have to wake up tomorrow morning. It would hurt too much.  It would hurt everyone else.  Nothing good can come out of my life if I can't cause anything good in anyone else's.  I bring out something awful in people and it needs to go away. I need to go away.  Please don't tell my secrets...even if I'm not around to stop you. Please don't cause people the pain of truthfulness. Sometimes not knowing the truth is the only thing that keeps a person alive. Don't forget the person I want to be. I don't mean to be the person I am. I don't want to be the person I am. I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.  And if I do wake up tomorrow, please don't dwell on my darker moments. Please don't dwell on my pitfalls. Please don't remind me of the things I try to forget.  Please help me. I can't....i just cant...please dont argue, dont yell...please...
