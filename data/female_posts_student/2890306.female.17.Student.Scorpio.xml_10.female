Today was a gorgeous one, and taking full of advantage of it, I drove home from school with the sunroof open.  As a lighthearted song played, those lyrics from the song above drifted through the comforting breeze, and as they grazed my ear I smiled.  Perhaps you did too.  After I arrived at my humble abode, I received a call from Kacie.  She wanted to go shopping, and since my brain is eternally programmed to think that shopping is a great idea, I consented.  We searched for a Spinsters dress for her, and I believe we found the perfect one.  It is very bold colored and spunky, just like its wearer.  Afterwards, we bo-dee-oh-doed on over to Applebee's for a tasty dinner.  It was just what I needed:  a good conversation and a filling meal.  Who wouldn't be happy after that?  Then, I came home to a warm house.  If comfort has a smell, my house is it.  When you walk in, it's clean and fresh, the air tingling with a hint of the food prepared for dinner.  Next year at college, I don't know how I'll handle not coming home to that each night.  I suppose I will have to create my own home, my own comfort.  I wonder how my house will smell when I have settled down, with a husband and a couple kids.  I wonder if they will walk in to our future house and be comforted by the same things I am today.    Only time will tell... *smile*
