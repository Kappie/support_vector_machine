So hes a year and half or so younger then me, he acts likes he my age, the BOSS, like he can control everything. "Oh Hannah can do this, so why cant i" then goes on and on."Hannah were like the same age i can do anything you can do, dont tell me what to do, i tell you what to do". He has no respect what so ever for nothing and no one. He acts like he can doing anything, push me out of the way. Be the spotlight. I have to stop thinking. Or im going to end up going crazy.
