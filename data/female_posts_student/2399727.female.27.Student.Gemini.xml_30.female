I visited him this morning and was shocked by how much he had deteriorated.  The nurses are making sure he is comfortable but it has to be frustrating for someone who was so active into his old age to find communication so difficult and to be 100% dependent on others.  For a person with a blog, I'm really not feeling like talking about it right now.    More to come...
