He made it this way so as to point out all of the president’s lies (liar, liar pants on fire). “In a polite society, you don’t go up to a person and look at them in the face and say, ‘You’re a liar.’” Cohen was quoted in a phone interview in Spokane, Washington, which is his next stop on his Pants on Fire Tour. The PantsOnFire-Mobile is a trailer that is pulled behind Cohen’s car. The electronic ticker on the front of the effigy displays some of what Cohen calls, “Bush’s lies.” The head rotates and has pictures of various George Bush facial expressions. He plans to take it across the country as a way of advertising against Bush for the upcoming election. This is the most interesting presidential advertisement I have heard of so far. It’s a joke to make people aware of the negatives of George W. Bush. What would you think if you saw this being pulled behind a car on the highway?
