We still made it there for the group we really wanted to see.   Sherri: Hey look, big hallow elementry school. Amy: *looks at the decrepit building and laughs a little, laughter stops when she reads name of school 'Big Hallow Elementry School'* Sherri: *almost dies laughing at look on Amy's face*  Krissy: Whoa wait... say that again. Amy: Itsays take US-12 to Counrty Road U, then left on Highway B. Andy: What's upwith the fuckin' letters?! Sherri: Wisconsin is messed up. Amy: Hey!They ran out of numbers ok?!?! *uproar of laughter*  I only saw two groups preform, but hey. The tickets were free, I'll take what I can get. I saw Trace Adkins and Lonestar. Ok, so I only saw parts of Trace because I was getting food and watching Andy jump on a trampoline. And we didn't see the end of Lonestar because we wanted to be the rush back to the cars. Which I found all by myself thank you very much. Yes I was the one who found the car, so, go me! Took us an hour and 15 minutes just to get out of the parking lot though because there was so many people there. I have never seen so many drunk 20 something year olds in my life. Holy shit. Man cute guys without shirts though, damn! I heard later on the radio there was 60,000+ people there. I don't think I'd do it again. They were all assholes there. I almost decked this one lady behind us in line for the port-o-john because some drunk bitch just cut everyone, so the lady behind us started bitching saying stuff like, "Well if you're just gonna let people cut maybe I'll do the same!" I just looked at her like she was disgusting. We didn't hear from her again. It seems Grandma really is moving out. She's been cleaning out her room. Dad crapped his pants today too. He's sick, but he's still going to work. Bought himself some depends... *stops typing to laugh her ass off* Ok I'm good. I haven't heard back from Mom yet on whether or not I'm going to Texas or coming home early. She said she'd call me on Saturday though. Apparently Rachel is having second thoughts to. Which kinda scares me because she always talks about home much she loves her home... I can only hope right now that she's doing ok because she's not home for me to call her. But I'm done rambling for now, I have bigger and better things to do... like play PS2... yeah.... later dayz
