And yeh, he sayd he'd come and wake me up at 5:30... so, I fell asleep, and he never woke up either =P  So, that was it for our "6 a.m. run" this morning.  When I woke up, it was about 7:45ish, and I had to go and wake myself up.  I looked like CRAP!  Then, Gerardo shows up at my house 15ish minutes later, and he whips out a camera and he's like "PISHURR!? =)" And I'm like OMG NO! but yeh, he didn't take any pictures, so that's good.  UHMM, I spent lunch with him tho, so yeh, that was fun.  We came back here so that I could turn off the alarm, cuz he wanted to come back here for last blk, cuz he hadn't done his h/w and didn't feel like going.  So, yeh, he came back here and he fell asleep in my bed... so cute =P  But yeh, my door was unlocked =| So, I was scared for him and my house, hahaha. But yehh... I feel bad about skipping and everything, because yeh, I don't want to go to any of my classes, but I've missed so much... MAN, I'm stupid. I'm not skipping another class... except, on friday, I'm going for the first couple blks, because I have a math test, and I think we're writing our essays for our final in english, too... so I'll just go home at lunch or something.  But yeh, anyways... uhmm... so I came home, and yeh, I was here with my boy for a bit... and that idiot ( I love you =P ) gave me this huge hickey on my neck.  I was like WTH!  That was the fastest I've ever seen anyone give one... he was like, on my neck for 3 seconds, and that was it. =| FREAK! MAN... ugh... and yeh, my grandma's gonna be here soon, and yeh, I don't exactly want HER to see it. =(... oh well. And yeh, my EFBF went to choose her courses today, so that's good... I'm sooo happy that she's gonna be there with me next year.  It's gonna be lots of fun... hehe =)  I hope that we get SOME classes together! We better!! ...  But LOOK! It's RAINING!! =)  I've missed the rain soooooo much!! I love it!! Isn't it awesome?!  I think so.. hehe...  ANYWAYS, I've got to go get ready for JS, and finish up my h/w and stuff...  GO OUT  ENJOY THE RAIN-SHINE! =)
