WE made bets on how late the boys would be. I WON! The Indian boy came in with a green polo, collar up, and a green trucker hat on. It said, "Pimp daddy". Yes, it was fantastic. Hank, the white boy, came in in his shin guards and slippers. Nobody knows why. I started talking about how St. Charles calls CSG the dog pound, but nobody understood. And I was rambling about how, "The brain is the sexiest part of the body. We are all beautiful AND intelligent at CSG" Yeah, that's me just telling myself that. Well I must go be productive again, and by that, I mean read blogs. BYE
