Her church was having a gathering Sunday morning and a singing so she thought I would enjoy that.  Drew and Cat had both said the previous week that they would come and watch the dogs Saturday night.  Drew called Friday to say he had lost his drivers liscense and was going to check the 4 places it could be and was not sure when he would make it down.  To me this sounded like he was still coming. So I figured things were ok.  I left Saturday about 1:30 headed to mom's.  We had a great time.  Sitting on the dock and watching the water skiiers.  Grandmom fried fresh fish for all and we had a good dinner.   Mom had even gotten me a birthday cake for Sunday and one of my sisters had her family were coming too.  About 7pm I called home to check on things.  (note... only reason I worry about my dogs is my closest neighbor hates dogs and shot one recently)  There was no answer.  I called cat to make sure she was still planning on heading to my house and got no answer.  I was not really concerned yet.  At 9 pm I tried again.  Still noone at my house.  I called Cat again.  She informed me that she had been drinking and had forgotten she was supposed to be there.  So I start trying to track down Drew and find out if he was on the way or what.  These poor puppies had not been able to go outside for 12 hours at this time.  After trying to reach someone for 3 hours I gave up and started home.  *sigh* so 3 hours sleep friday night... 240 miles and 6 hours of driving.  My back hated me so when I finally got home Sunday morning at 3am I let the girls out, cleaned up their messes, notified everyone I had made it back safely and began my pain management techniques to help my back.      I was more than mad... My mom and I do not have the greatest relationship anymore and the fact the visit was going so well was wonderful for me... then to have to cut it short because my friends could not keep their word... I was pissed.    Finally managed to crash around 5... and I get a call at 8 am.   A sub I have been watching out for had another crisis.  He is trying to live on his own in a new town and feeling very vulnerable and alone.  So he calls and talks and talks and talks.  He is trying to deal with the fact there is less of a availability of dommes where he is and so he has been trying vanilla relationships and they have been driving him up the wall.  *sigh* so I am confidant, dating counselor, lol damn and support group for him at this time.  I have never met a person who had almost no condience in themself at all... not in any of their abilities or anything.  He is totally self defeating and will not even try to see the abilities he has.    So after talking to him for a while Sunday morning I was wired and bored =p.  So I start surfing and went shopping some to umm raise my spirits =p.  Finally broke down and bought the cupping set I have been looking at, a new paddle, and a few other neat nifties.    Matt called and we got to talk for quite a while.  He is definately ready to get a break from the sand and heat of Kuwait.  We talked over some of the plans we have for his leave when he returns.  And the possible CA christmas trip.  I am trying to work out a surprise for him to go to a Jethro Tull concert in November.  The logistics are fun.  But he loves tull so it would be cool.   ok this is longer and more rambling than I had intended... so enough for now
