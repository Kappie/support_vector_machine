It's really odd because I've gotten to where I don't care really but then there are things that bring this on...   Sid was on webcam a second ago... He  did that once for me and I dunno why that was just fun and whenever I watch anyone's I think about that.  He  is such a wonderful person but just has so many problems and that just hurt to watch. I've heard a term used for a disaster that goes "It's like watching a train wreck." That pretty much sums up watching someone you care about, and would die for if ever in such a situation, continue to screw up their life ... almost purposely and not even give a shit.   I have to wonder what would have happened if  he  hadn't. Where would I be? Would I be here? Of course not. I'm too incredibly stupid to have not killed myself. Well, having faith in God I'd like to believe I would be alive...I just don't know. There are things that happened because of  him  being a part of my life. And certainly things that didn't. I need to stop contemplating would-have-beens. It gives me a head ache.    And that  person  I mentioned in my last blog. He's good right now. I hope. because what I did yesterday may have me banned from everything for a while if my sister mouths.   I just redid my HumanForSale...I've gone up! To $1,887,246.00! Somehow!   Bye folks.
