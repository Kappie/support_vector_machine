I was alone, free at last. my parents where at home, watching the football in the warm house and my sister was there to.   As I laid in the soaking wet, lush green grass. The rain cascading from the skies onto my freezing body I felt safe and free. It was just me and the world, alone.  The only sounds that could be heard was my harsh breathing as I caught a worse cold and the thundering of the rain. But, I didn't want to leave, because in that space, that time, for once, all my troubles and pressures just melting away, like I was a free spirit, not a single care in the world.  I know it was probably a stupid thing to do, but it needed to be done, it's like it washed away all my sin and heartbreak. Maybe it was what I needed to get free.   There is a bad side to this experience though, as it reminded me of my Grandma, her smile, her hugs and her warming laughter. It seemed that even though I was in the cold rain, I was somewhat warm, It felt like I was in one of my Gran's most famous hugs that I would recieve on cold winter days or when I was upset. I miss those hugs. I miss her.  When I was in the park, my hair, clothes and body drenched to the bone, I seemed that the trees knew my secrets, they swayed to the rhythm of my heart. It's like I was in my own world, the population was me, and me alone. No one these there to bother me, It was a place I could cry alone, without being judged.  That's what I did, I cried, and cried. Until there was nothing more left inside to cry about. Sometimes it's best to cry, To let out your feelings when no one is around to see you. There where no other kids to laugh at me, or parents to look at me like I'm some kind of weirdo. It was me, myself and I. Free...  I know you people probably think im weird, for crying. But, it hurt to loose two of the people I love, A week after each other. My world just seemed to stop, pause in time, freeze like ice. It was like a dark cloud of nothingness covered all happiness. A cold wind rushed through my life. A tornado ripped all things in my world away, leaving nothing but devistation in it's path. I felt alone, and frustrated. But I also felt angry, why did this happen to me? Was god trying to punish me? Did I do something terribly wrong to someone? I felt like it was my fault they died, maybe if I had told them how much I loved them, or showed it more then they wouldn't have let go. They would still be around and I wouldn't be feeling the way I am.  It feels like I have lost everything, I never got to say goodbye, not before they died, not after they died. I haven't seen them, or spoken to them at all. Maybe if I went to there funerals I would be able to get over some of this. Maybe seing them that last time in my life would have given me some kind of hope?  Ever since the dreaded phonecalls. Where I recieved the news that broke my heart, my world hasn't been the same. It's like everyone hates me, like I have no friends....It feels like the whole damn world is out to get me and I know I won't make it through the day. But, I do make it through everyday. And what makes it worse is knowing I have to wake up again and feel the heartbreak...and pain...all over again.   Well, I must go. I have some things to write down and some people to call. I hope that your life isn't as crap as mine.  Heartbroken, Bridget.
