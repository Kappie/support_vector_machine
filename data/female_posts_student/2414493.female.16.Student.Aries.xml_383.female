She went crazy in Bath and Body Works :) and bought lotion, while I simply marveled at the color spectrum. Maybe I just never developed an attraction to antibacterial anything.  We got back just when the cafeteria was about to close...luckily, we hurried in and got our waffles and food. It was just so weird just sitting there and not talking because we were so busy eating. Remember last night? I thought it'd be ok, since I woke up this morning more comfortable in bed than I'd ever been, and by 2pm I was hungry all over again. I'm still tired from walking around. I think I'll have to go to Widener to get something for the research paper before it closes at 5, lovely.  I need to finish writing for anthro today. Hm.
