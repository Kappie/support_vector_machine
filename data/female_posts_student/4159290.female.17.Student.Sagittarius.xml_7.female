I went out with Cindy and her parents and ate lunch.  I got a strawberry slushee.  I forgot how good those things are!  I'm gonna have to eat/drink those more often.  Then we went to Wal-mart and I got the cutest reversible bucket hats for $1.00 each!!  I was so excited about that.. (lol, my life sure is thrilling..)  Then we went to this little Maine book  and gift store.  Then we stopped at this scenic place and I took some dam pictures (as in pictures of a dam...  haha.. ha..)  They were actually really pretty tho.  Then I came home and talked to David for a couple hours (I am fully digging his unlimited cell phone minutes), ate supper, got on the computer, and here I am.  I'm kinda annoyed at Tom right now.  We had an argument.. thing last night about David.  ugh.. the drama.  It's so weird, he breaks up with me, I'm heart broken and try to convince him that he doesn't really wanna break up with me, it doesn't work..  I get over it, *then* he says he made a mistake and wants us to get back together.  And of course, by this point, we've been broken up for two months, so I'm over it, and I'm  moving on, and he has a cow.  *sigh....*  Hilary Duff's "So Yesterday" sums up my feelings right now.  Not in like a mean, haha, I'm over you, go to hell kinda way or anything...  but like in a ok, you're being really weird about this, but I'm not gonna let it get to me kinda way.   You can change your life (if you wanna) You can change your clothes (if you wanna) If you change your mind Well that's the way it goes  But I'm gonna keep your jeans **or pajama pants** And your old black hat (cuz I wanna) They look good on me You're never gonna get them back  At least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok  You can say you're bored (if you wanna) You could act real tough (if you wanna) You could say you're torn But I've heard enough  Thank you You've made my mind up for me When you started to ignore me You won't see a single tear It isn't gonna happen here  At least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok  If you're over me I'm already over you If it's all been done What is left to do How can you hang up If the line is dead If you wanna walk out I'm a step ahead If you're moving on I'm already gone If the light is off Then it isn't on  At least not today, not today, not today, cuz...  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that you're (so yesterday)  If it's over let it go and Come tomorrow it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday I'm just a bird  Thats already flown away Laugh it off Let it go and When you wake up it will seem So yesterday, so yesterday Haven't you heard that I'm gonna be ok
