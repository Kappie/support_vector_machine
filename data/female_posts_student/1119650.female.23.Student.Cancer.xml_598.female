Today is a Wednesday and I'm going out and getting snotted tonight and I'll be hung over at work tomorrow as well, but you know what?!? I dont care!  I only have computer training for work tomorrow for a computer program that I don't even have access to and yet my job is paying $250 for me to sit there for half a day and listen to some guy talk.  (Glad to see your tax dollars hard at work, eh?)  I need a nap and I need  urlLink UConn  to come out with the summer schedule so I can start figuring out a) how the HELL I'm gonna pay for this and b) what the heck classes I'm going to be taking this summer.  I should probably get my lazy ass over there to speak to an acutal person instead of trying to figure it all out myself and be misinformed, but since when have I done anything the intelligent way?
