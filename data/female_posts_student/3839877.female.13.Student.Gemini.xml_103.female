But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."   Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon.  As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.
