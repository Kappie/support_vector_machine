A usual conversation between me and my 'friend' Wendy normally starts like this. (Wendy is SmeagleLuvsU by the way) Although we fell out recently, we now seem to be talking online. She hasn't apologised to me for being a total bitch though! I'm always the one to say sorry first to friends, so this time I've decided not to.  I'm currently listening to a Casaloco song I've been after for a long time. Full blast. Hopefully next door won't complain, as they usually do - and then they have the cheek to let their 'little' brat of a kid scream and cry, the spoilt cow. I can't stand her. 10am in the morning when I'm trying to lie in, she starts screaming and doesn't stop until she gets her own way.  I usually get my own way, but I can tell you I don't scream until I do...  How clean is your arse? says: boo dint u get ma txt? Arise, Fair Sun, And Kill The Envious Moon says: yeah I fell asleep tho  Another friend of mine.  That's a lie. I couldn't be arsed texting him back. He was being dirty and I'd get told off if I replied. Why is it that I always get stuck with the horny males? The only person I'm willing to help is Jamie, or rather that's what I've got to abide by.    urlLink http://www.dorrk.com/contenti/story_fat.jpg     And who's this? Why, it's only Charlene, a.k.a 'Baby Whale.' The most despised girl in the whole of my school. Well, she doesn't actually look like that... But I can see the resemblance.  I could go on and on about how much she annoys me. For one, she copys my ideas in my English lessons! She's also a user and a backstabber. The latest gossip circulating around my school is that she accused her step dad of raping her - urg, yeah right. As if he'd even want to shag a 4'10"  tub of lard .  Anyway.  "Amy, come and open the door for me!"  My sister forgot her door keys - again. Then she made me feed the cat. She bought me a cornish pasty while she was out. I don't usually eat them because they're ikky, but I was hungry so I started to bite into it, and...  "Eeerr it's got big onions in it!"  Soon put me off.  Also got a phone call from a friend at school. "Hiiiiii, bet you're surprised I'm ringing you!" Very. We had a chat about... Not much. School and exam results and AS Level courses. She's only going to be in one of my lessons.  So in September I'm gonna be in Year 12 - Yippee? No, I'm scared I won't be able to cope. I've chosen Art Graphics, ICT, English Literature and RE. I've got a feeling that English is gonna be really hard - that's if I'm allowed to do it. I need a C in GCSE English Lit, but hopefully if I get something lower they'll still let me do it as normally I do quite well in English.  I think thats about it now.  Still waiting for Jamie to stop wanking or stop whatever he is doing and talk to me. That's one of the things I get moody over - not having him lavish his undivided attention upon me!!
