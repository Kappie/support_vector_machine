The weighted essay paper was due and I was flipping out about that and then we had that thing 7th and 8th hour yesterday to play for this guy who helped capture Saddam. That's pretty cool I guess but it just added to the stress. THEN, last night we had our concert, which was like...three hours long. We didn't play very well either. My brother came and I was so super surprised. I wish he would have come to a concert with songs I like though. Oh well. Such is life. Then, today, I slept in and my mom let me go in after first hour since first hour is just band and we weren't doing anything anyway. It was nice. However, I had a bunch of tests today and I have my psych final on Tuesday. Eek. I have to get an A on it to get an A in the class. I'm stressed. Hah. Oh well. Summer is almost here. YaY!  So, tonight. Well, actually...I'll start with this afternoon. This afternoon SUCKED. Marching rehearsal was so bad. I don't even know what I'm going to do next year. Today's marching rehearsal made me want to quit ten times more than I already wanted to quit. Ugh. Oh well. I'll end up doing it and I know I will. So, that sucked. It was possibly the most frustrating time I've ever had with people.   Then, I came home and called Kelly and, I thought I was going to meet up with her, Kathryn, and MC at Seven Bridges to go see Shrek 2, but when I got there, it ended up being them plus Emily, Kirby, Rick, Tom, Steve, and Roger. It was crazy. We had like...a whole row. Haha. Shrek 2 was really funny too. I didn't think it was a kids movie at all though. It didn't seem like little kids would enjoy it. I guess they'd enjoy it for the animation and whatnot, but I can't see little kids understanding half the jokes in that movie. Then, we all went to Tom's house. Holy cow, his house is HUGE. There's a ton of land too and he has this ginormous barn. Oh man. Coolest place ever. We played ghost in the graveyard! I haven't played that in FOREVER! Then we made some prank calls, haha, not really pranks since they knew who we were but it was still funny nonetheless. Then we played like...6th grade Truth or Dare. It was hilarious. Then Rick drove me home. And...yeah, here I am...writing in my bloggy blog and in a very good mood after a very long week. :) I like being happy and not stressed out.
