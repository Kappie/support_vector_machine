Okay, so this is why I decided to start packing literally right after I finished my rotation and why I decided to go to LA next week--I know that if I have too much time on my hands, I become a TV junkie. Now that I am fully moved back to Sac (more or less), my brain has turned to mush the past two days. I feel more and more miserable every day. I guess there are lots of things I could potentially be doing such as:    Contacting Dr. Fox at MIT  Baking  Reading/Bible study  Hanging out with friends like Ruth, Karyn    Today I went over to Pinecrest and filled out the rental application. I don't really know why, but I'm still don't feel thrilled to be living there. Don't get me wrong--it's a perfectly decent place and it's very affordable, relatively speaking. It has everything that I need for basic living and it's in a very quiet, attractive complex. I guess I had my heart set on living at Cambridge House. I don't regret choosing Pinecrest because I still think it's the most practical decision. As I blogged earlier, I don't really need to live in such luxury, especially since I will only be in Davis for 2 more years. What happened to me? I used to be very comfortable with living simply and now I have a hard time turning down an apartment that's nearly $1,000/month.   Along the same lines, I also noticed that I'm becoming more materialistic. Every time I go to the mall, my eyes get really big and I see a lot of things I want. I'm still conscious of the price and I don't buy anything that's not on sale (with a few exceptions), but I still have that desire to acquire more.I really need to be more content with what I have. Whatbothers me is that I  used  to be content with living simply back in my Berkland days, but I've changed slowly over time. This has nothing to do with vet school or being with B, and more to do with being disconnected from God.   B is going to Tigard tonight. It'll be nice to be on the same time zone again. Funny how basic things like time zones can mean so much to B and myself. I can't believe we're going to see eachother in about 6 days. When I think back to how things were over Memorial Day, our relationship has definatelychanged. We've been through some hard times together: both of us went through a couple tough finals weeks, I started and finished my rotation (which was quite possibly the hardest thing I've ever done in my life), not to mention setting a record for time spent apart. We've definately been more impatient with eachother lately. It doesn't make me regret being with him, but it does make me concerned about our extended time together in Boston. Things will either be a lot easier, or a lot harder when we see eachother. From how things usually are when we get together, I predict the latter. I bet we will probably argue less overall, but when we do argue, I think it will be more intense than arguing over the phone. It's funny, b/c I say "argue", but we have never actually yelled at eachother. It's more like feelings get hurt and we get annoyed with eachother.   The closer it gets to seeing him, the stronger my feelings seem to get. I'm either really annoyed or really affectionate. Why do I have to be so moody?!? I feel really bad that I've been so unstable lately because it's hard on B. In that sense, I remind myself of Mom, which scares me. Her coldness and moodiness sometimes is what makes her difficult to get along with sometimes and I don't want B to have to put up with that.   I'm really hot. This computer is burning me up. I'm gonna go fill up the sink with cold water and dunk my head in it. Or maybe I'll just eat ice cream.
