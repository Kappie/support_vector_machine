       
      As this is my first blog, I will start it off by writing a little bit about me. I am a student currentlycompleting my degree in Computer Science at The University of Nottingham, Malaysia campus. I am also a software developer focusing on web and mobile applications/solutions.    I spend most of my free timetinkering with my iPAQ Pocket PC and Microsoft Smartphone, playing my acousticguitar or trying out a recipe which I have found on the Internet. I am also a devoted vegetarian and I love to browse the Internet looking for useful information on ways to improve my familiy's and my own dietbased on vegetarianism.    I will be be posting up blogs related to my academic life, my work as a software developer as well as things which are related to my interests such as music, dogs, cooking, reading and vegetarianism. I hope whoever that reads my blog will find something useful, informative and educational.
