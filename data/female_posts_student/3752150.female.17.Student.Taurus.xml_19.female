Here are the rides I went on in the order I went on them:    Raptor  Magnum  Thunder Canyon (or whatever it's called)  Snake River Falls  Millenium Force  Mantis  Power Tower  Top Thrill Dragster  Raptor   Sadly the Wicked Twister wasn't working. I would've liked to have gone on it. Over all Cedar point was fun despite my nasty cold. We didn't get home until 4:30 AM and I slept in until about 2:30 PM. I wish I lived closer to cedar point.  Yesterday Sarah and I went to tawas. We rented 6 movies for 5 days and it only cost $2. We're not sure when we're going to watch all of them but probably this weekend when we're supposed to be having the church campout in Sarah's woods.   Today has been a very intense day so far. I took a shower, went to the post office, bought some kitty litter at carters, and gave my cat a bath. I figured after all that I deserve to relax for the rest of the day....
