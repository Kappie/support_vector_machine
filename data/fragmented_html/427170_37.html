ABORATORY ANIMALS: Chronic Exposure or Carcinogenicity:</strong> Typical lesions of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were induced experimentally in the ventral prostate of adolescent (6 week old) male rats by citral, a nonsteroidal compound.

A longer period of treatment (1 month) significantly enhanced epithelial hyperplasia, whereas the stromal elements were less reactive. Characteristic BPH lesions invo
