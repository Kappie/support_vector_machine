ory's superior spatial and
spectral resolution, for example, are probing the structure and
evolution of supernova remnant ejecta, diffusive shock acceleration
processes, and interactions between supernova remnants and pulsar wind
nebulae down to the sub-arcsecond level. This conference highlights
both observational and theoretical studies of SNR, emphasizing recent
X-ray observations of Galactic SNR. All aspects of SNR research will
be explored including shock acceleration, electron/ion temperature
