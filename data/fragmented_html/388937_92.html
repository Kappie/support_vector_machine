39&#x000b0;C in the 1:2 mol/mol C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC mixture. Similarly, in the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DMPC system the heat consumption decreased going from 10&#x000b0;C to 30&#x000b0;C, although less abruptly than in the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC system. Unfortunately, reliable measurements were not feasible below 10&#x000b0;C due to instrumental limitations. Therefore, a sudden drop of the heat consumption at lower temperatures could not be established here.</p><p>The notion that m
