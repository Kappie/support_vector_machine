changes, we can apply the simplifying 
  equations (2) and (3) for Coulomb failure, where the coefficient of friction 
  is <IMG SRC="/research/deformation/modeling/papers/baystress/Image18.gif" WIDTH=69 HEIGHT=15>. 
  Thus if pore fluids are distributed in fault-parallel cracks, coseismic pressure 
  changes effectively cancel the imposed normal stress changes acting on the fault 
  plane, and the fault responds only to the imposed shear stresses. This behavior 
  is consistent with our observations of sei
