?</B> Under what conditions does new particle formation occur in the atmosphere?  Is new particle formation a process that occurs only in the clean atmosphere, i.e., remote locations and/or the free troposphere, or are there conditions in the polluted atmosphere that are amenable to new particle formation?  <B>What are the rates of these processes?</B>  What is the dependence of these rates on concentrations of gaseous precursors, photochemical activity, solar radiation, existing aerosol loading, and other
