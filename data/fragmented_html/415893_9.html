tivity survey of parts of the Farallon Islands Radioactive 
        Waste Dump Site (fig. 1). This was done using the proven BGS towed seabed 
        spectrometer (EEL) system (e.g., Jones, 1994; Miller et al., 1977), modified 
        to operate in deeper water (Deep Tow EEL). The main aim was to obtain 
        regional-scale information on sea floor radioactivity levels for parts 
        of the site, particularly with reference to USGS mapping of barrel locations 
        using sidescan sonar dat
