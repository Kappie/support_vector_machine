   <a href="../spicelib/npelpt.html">NPELPT</a> is used as a utility routine by the SPICELIB routine <a href="../spicelib/npedln.html">NPEDLN</a>. It
   is also useful for testing ellipses for equality: given a parametric
   representation of one ellipse, a number of points on that ellipse can be
   generated, and the distance of each from a second ellipse can be found.
