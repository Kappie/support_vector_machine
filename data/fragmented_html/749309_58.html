After the discovery of supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) with the Einstein 
Observatory, the detection of about a dozen luminous SSS in the Magellanic 
Clouds in the ROSAT all-sky survey data established luminous SSS as a class 
of objects. Later, ROSAT pointed observations revealed SSS also in the Milky 
Way and other nearby galaxies.<p>
