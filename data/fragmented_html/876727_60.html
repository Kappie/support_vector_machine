ear stress change to a greater extent than with normal stress change 
  (Figure 7), an indication of lower friction. The ratio of the normal stress 
  change to the right-lateral shear stress change ranges from ~1:1 where both 
  normal stress and shear stress changes encourage seismicity to ~10:1 where shear 
  stress changes appear to have discouraged seismicity. Thus, if a frictional 
  failure criterion were applied, then the best fit to the seismicity rate change 
  appears to be with smaller values of
