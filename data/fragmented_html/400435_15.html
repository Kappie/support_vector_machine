ies of zinc-finger proteins  involved in DNA transcription, all very rapidly evolving,&quot; says Dernburg.  &quot;Gene duplication is common throughout the genome in all species, but  unless a duplicated gene quickly acquires a new function, it is not likely to  be conserved. The group of related zinc-finger protein genes in <em>C. elegans</em> offers an opportunity to  address the question of how and why new zinc-finger proteins acquire new  functions.&quot; </p>
