that this is also very close to total measured CE expenditure. For several distinct categories and for total
consumption, we show that cross-sectional life cycle estimates of household expenditure activity are very similar across the two surveys. Finally, we illustrate the unique research value of the PSID for studying consumption by exploiting the survey's longitudinal design and genealogical structure
to estimate the intergenerational elasticity of consumption expenditure, which is found to be in the ra
