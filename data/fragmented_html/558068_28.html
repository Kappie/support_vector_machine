mat) is designed with a built-in sensor that terminates the pressure applied to the paddle once the system&rsquo;s software algorithm determines that additional force will not achieve further thickness reduction. This design is intended to maximize patient comfort while achieving optimum compression. When such a device is pressed against a hard surface (such as a bathroom scale), the sensor, recognizing that very little or no compression has been achieved by the applied force up to that point, terminates th
