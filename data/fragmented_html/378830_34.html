aithful in every detail. To make a weather map generated by computer we need to solve six partial differential equations that describe the fluid motions in the atmosphere. It sounds in principle like there's no problem: we know that those equations work in the laboratory, we know that they describe fluid motions and energy and mass relationships. So why then aren't the models perfect simulations of the atmospheric behavior?<P>

One answer is that the evolution of weather from some starting weather map (kn
