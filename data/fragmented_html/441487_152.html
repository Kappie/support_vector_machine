unk, on occasion,
eliminated as much as 35% of the entire root system.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Pavement which covers rather large portions of a
tree's entire root system produces growth increases exceeding those
mentioned earlier in compacted soils. Not only does impervious pavement
eliminate plant competition, but surface evaporative losses are also
reduced to a minimum leaving the "relict" sequoia a greater supply of
soil moisture that enables growth to continue beyond the normal growing
season.
