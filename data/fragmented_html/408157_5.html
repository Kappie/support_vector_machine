oked was to explain the Verwey transition (a metal-insulator 
transition to a charge ordered ground state), first observed in magnetite.  
A new class of Verwey compounds RBaM<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (R = rare-earth, M = transition 
metal) are based on the perovskite structure with a doubled unit cell 
and a layer of oxygen vacancies.  The structure consists of pyramids 
of five-coordinated M-sites, and more importantly the M-site is mixed 
valent in the stoichiometric formula unit (with an average valence
