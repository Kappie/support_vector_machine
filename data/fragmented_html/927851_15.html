 and Technology to demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of heat release rate-based test methods and hazard analysis techniques when applied to passenger train fire safety.  The results of Phase II of the program which focused on the application of hazard analysis techniques using heat release rate data and computer modeling to evaluate passenger rail car fire performance is presented.  In addition to materials, the impact of car geometry, detection and suppression systems, and egress time on the s
