for the pure phospholipids (8.7 kcal/mol and 6.2 kcal/mol). After correcting for the mixing enthalpy the heat consumption measured by ITC will be still somewhat larger than the literature data. Hence, the concentration of disordered phospholipids solubilized in the semitoroidal detergent volume <em>V</em><sub>S</sub> (which amounts to decreasing &#x00394;<em>H</em><sub>0</sub>) may be negligible when the titrations are performed &#x02265;10&#x000b0;C below <em>t</em><sub>m</sub>. The magnitude of the transi
