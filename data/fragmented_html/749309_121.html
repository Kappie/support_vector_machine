umber of known exoplanets. While the 
detection of exoplanets is challenging conventional views of planet 
formation, it has also created opportunities for new observational 
methods to detect and characterize habitability and bio-signatures. 
And the study of life on Earth has revealed surprising constraints 
on the limits of life with the discovery of extremophiles capable 
of surviving in near-freezing, near-boiling, non-aqueous, or high 
radiation environments.<p>
