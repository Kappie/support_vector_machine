n developmental toxicity, pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to citral by inhalation for 6 hr/day on gestation days 6-15 at mean concentrations of 0, l0 or 34 ppm as vapor, or 68 ppm as an aerosol/vapor mixture. On gestation day 20, the fetuses were evaluated for gross, visceral and skeletal malformation. Exposure to 68 ppm was maternally toxic, with reduced body-weight gains, ocular opacity, breathing difficulty, nasal discharge and salivation noted in the dams. No maternal toxicity was seen at the
