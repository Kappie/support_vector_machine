geometry of Fig.&nbsp;1, the recombination typically occurs in a quantum well
in the semiconductor. The quantum well confinement lifts the light and heavy
hole degeneracy at the top of the valence band as shown in the lower part of
Fig.&nbsp;2. Here a -1/2 to -3/2 transition is indicated by the heavy line
resulting in  &Delta;<i>m<sub>j</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1. To conserve angular momentum,
the photon generated must have angular momentum +1 and hence is &sigma;<sup>+</sup> light when p
