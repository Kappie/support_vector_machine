ifficulty with coupled models is known as "flux adjustment"-- a technique for accounting for local oceanic heat transport processes that are not well simulated in some models. Adding this element of empirical-statistical "tuning" to models that strive to be based as much as possible on first principles has been controversial. However, not all models use flux adjustments, yet nearly all models, with or with out this technique, produce climate sensitivities within or near to the standard IPCC range of 1.5 to
