a (Karl et al., 1994). Previous radioactivity 
        measurements had been restricted to the analyses of samples of water, 
        sediments and biota (Dyer, 1976; Noshkin et al., 1978; PneumoDynamics 
        Corporation, 1961; Schell and Sugai, 1980; Suchanek et al., 1996). In 
        the case of the sediments, only a relatively small number of sites had 
        been sampled, although some samples were collected from areas adjacent 
        to barrels using submersibles (Dyer, 1976; Schell and
