<p>The intergenerational elasticity in <span class="MATH"><img width="49" height="28" align="middle" border="0" src="img10.gif" alt="C_{PSID} " /></span> for a single year ranges from 0.25 to 0.27, which is similar to the single-year elasticity in earnings (Solon, 1992). Averaging over multiple
years increases the correlation to 0.32 to 0.34, or as much as nine percentage points, which is similar in magnitude to the increase in intergenerational correlation in ea
