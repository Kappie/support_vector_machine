nine
		months a year, teachers hold the future of America in their hands. </P>
	 <P> This week, my husband carried on the tradition of recognizing great
		teachers when he honored Andy Baumgartner of Augusta, Ga., as the new Teacher
		of the Year. </P>
	 <P> A former Marine, Andy is a bundle of energy. Whether he's using popcorn
		to teach counting or leading a solemn funeral for a departed pet tarantula,
		Andy's ability to rivet the attention of his kindergarten students is the envy
		of his colleagues. <
