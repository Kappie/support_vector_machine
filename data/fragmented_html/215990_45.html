Material eluting in the position expected for cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan was pooled, concentrated, and subsequently desalted using a Sephadex G-15 column (1 by 49 cm). The Sephadex G-15 column was eluted at room temperature with 7&#x00025; propanol (vol/vol) at a rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed for carbohydrate content
