 Markey offered an amendment, both during the Resources Committee consideration of the bill and on the House floor, that would have struck from the bill all of the language opening our coastlines to drilling and left in place only the provisions that you mention in your letter, addressing the problem of these leases. You voted against the Markey Amendment in Committee and on the House floor. 

<P>We would think that if you were truly serious about fixing this problem, you would not have twice voted agains
