This is not a speculative theory, but a well understood and validated phenomenon of nature. The most important greenhouse gas is water vapor, since it absorbs terrestrial radiation over most of the infrared spectrum. Even though humans are not altering the average amount of water vapor in the atmosphere very much by direct injections of this gas, increases in other greenhouse gases which warm the surface cause an increase in evaporation which increases atmospheric water vapor concentrations,
