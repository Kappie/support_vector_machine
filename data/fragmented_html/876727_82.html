ery few earthquakes observed in this zone 
  (zero in most places) before 1989, we calculated the correlation between rank 
  of stress change and the rank number of earthquakes per dislocation element 
  following the Loma Prieta shock, instead of seismicity rate change (Figure 12). 
  We found that the testable faults in the Santa Clara Valley thrust belt showed 
  an opposite correlation trend as the major strike-slip faults (Figure 9), with 
  a stronger association between normal stress change and numb
