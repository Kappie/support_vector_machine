						<p>Facilities with CHP systems recover waste heat from generators, turbines, or engines and use it for heating and cooling to maximize overall facility efficiency. TAT HVAC components can use these large quantities of low-  to high-temperature heat to provide dry, cool, comfortable fresh air to building occupants.</p>
						<p>Development and deployment of efficient and cost-effective TAT/CHP systems for buildings constitute important elements of the strategic plan for maximizing national energy
