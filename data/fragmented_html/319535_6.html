-identical hormones should be ashamed of themselves for being so insecure as to think their profit margins will suffer if women are offered a more natural product.  I am absolutely against any attempt by Wyeth or any other company seeking to eliminate bio-idential hormones from the free market.  Such attemtps will only drive the consumer to the borders to acquire the products they want. This should be a consumer choice, not a corporate choice.</font><br>
