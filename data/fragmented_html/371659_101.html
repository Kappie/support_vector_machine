   C     Now that the observer's position and the star's direction
   C     vector are in Jupiter equator and prime meridian coordinates,
   C     we can apply <a href="../spicelib/surfpt.html">SURFPT</a> to find out whether the line segment
   C     from the observer to the star intersects Jupiter.  The point
   C     of working in this coordinate system is that our Jupiter
   C     axes are lined up with the coordinate axes of this system.
