s. There are reports of certain rodents, for example,
chipmunks, using the dust accumulated in these bark cavities for dust
baths. Some believe that the pulverized bark, rich in tannin, repels
such common ectoparasites as lice and fleas. Other birds, such as
flycatchers, will utilize these holes and limbs as nesting
sites. The giant sequoia, however, is never exclusively sought out for
food or nesting. The vertebrate that comes closest to reliance upon the
giant sequoia is still the chickaree.</P>
