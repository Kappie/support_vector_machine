 fault patch is locked (<I>V</I>=0) the state variable increases as time,

<P>Coulomb failure and rate and state friction have been shown 
  to apply in repeated laboratory studies on confined rock samples [e.g., <I>Jaeger 
  and Cook</I>, 1979; <I>Dieterich</I>, 1978, 1979]. Inherent in applying these 
  ideas is the assumption that brittle failure occurs on a preexisting surface, 
  and that increased normal stress ("clamping") acts to inhibit failure (l
