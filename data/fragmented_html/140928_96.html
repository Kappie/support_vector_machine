otactile inputs may engage descending pain-modulating pathways resulting in inhibition of nociceptive transmission at the spinal level.</p><p>Failure of suckling-sucrose to completely inhibit Fos induction is of interest, because the behavioral treatments completely blocked the hyperalgesia induced by the inflammation. Thus, spinal mechanisms may not solely account for the behavioral effects. The role of supraspinal sites is supported by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of &#x003b2;-casomorphin a
