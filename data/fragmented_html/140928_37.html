n and hyperalgesia in 10-day-old rats that can be attenuated by endogenous pain-modulating systems activated by taste and nonnutritive suckling; (<em>ii</em>) the mediation of the sucrose-suckling analgesia and antihyperalgesia at the spinal level; and (<em>iii</em>) a differential rostrocaudal maturation of descending pain-modulating systems to the spinal cord of 10-day-old rats. These findings may provide new clinical approaches for engaging endogenous analgesic mechanisms in infants following tissue inju
