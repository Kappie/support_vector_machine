ity of states at the
Fermi level which can differ from  <i>P<sub>m</sub></i> in sign and magnitude.
A third, the polarization of the conductivity, describes the transport in bulk
ferromagnets, and a fourth, the polarization of the interface conductance,
describes the transport through the interface. The polarization
<i>P<sub>m</sub></i> of the bulk density is positive by definition, but the
other polarizations need not be. For example, the polarization of the Fermi
level density of states for Fe is p
