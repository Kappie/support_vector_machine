 1987], 
  can be described by applying a failure criterion with approximately hydrostatic 
  pore pressure and the higher coefficients of friction more consistent with laboratory 
  measurements (0.5-0.8). This difference in behavior from the faults with large 
  cumulative slip may result from a lack of a gouge seal that allows coseismic 
  pressurized fluids to escape the fault zones. Additionally, it is possible that 
  the more limited activity on these faults before the Loma Prieta earthquake
