imited 
  to the unstable sliding regime (where <I>A-B</I>&lt;0 in equation 4) for time 
  and velocity dependent friction). However, examination of the stresses imposed 
  on the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault zone by the 1982-1985 New 
  Idria, Coalinga, and Kettleman Hills earthquakes indicates that those earthquakes 
  acted to reduce the fault-normal stress component on the San Andreas. Applying 
  the above-discussed approaches to frictional failure predicts an increased seismicity
