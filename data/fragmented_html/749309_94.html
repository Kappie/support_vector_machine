 A IAU JD provides an ideal setting for such a meeting and 
will allow discussions focused to these topics. Although the emphasis is on 
time variability, all aspects will be addressed, from radio observations to 
high-resolution spectra and high-energy emission.<p>

The principal topics to be discussed:<p>
<pre>
    * quasi-periodic oscillations from mHz to kHz
    * X-ray bursts and superbursts
    * millisecond X-ray pulsars
    * AXP/SGR and magnetars
    * isolated neutron stars
    * very-high energy
