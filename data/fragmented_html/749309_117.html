The Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) is sponsoring 
a workshop to engage the UV/optical/Near-IR (UVOIR) astronomy community to 
discuss its long-term goals for space-based astronomy and astrophysics. The 
meeting will provide the community with an opportunity to look forward on a

very large space telescopes and to outline a path forward that will form the 
basis for a community-led repo
