EPS was eluted from the TLC plate with water and then desalted on a Sephadex G-15 column. Compositional analysis was performed using gas chromatography linked to electron impact mass spectrometry after hydrolysis, <em>N</em>-acetylation, and derivatization with trimethylsilyl (TMS). The composition is the same as that previously reported for the high-molecular-weight EPS of <em>B. japonicum</em> strains (<a href="#B18" class="cite-reflink bibr">18</a>, <a href="#B24" class="cite-reflink bibr">24</a>, <a hre
