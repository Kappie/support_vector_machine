<strong>Scenario 2.</strong> If your <u>kVp meter</u> is not manufacturer-certified for W/Ag and W/Rh beams and you are using a <u>mammography-calibrated ion chamber</u>, you will need to include a correction factor in your kVp measurements. This correction factor may be obtained from the kVp meter manufacturer or by working with the mammography unit&rsquo;s service engineer (by comparing the engineer&rsquo;s manufacturer-approved measurements during machine installation with your noninvasive meter results)
