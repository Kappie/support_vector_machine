      <p>The question remains whether new binding sites or new forms  of zinc-finger protein lead rapid evolution in the worms. And there are other  questions: in <em>C. elegans</em>, and also <em>C. remanei</em>, there are only four kinds of  ZIM proteins that serve to initiate the pairing of six different chromosomes  (in <em>C.&nbsp;briggsae</em>, only five  proteins for si
