0b0;C below <em>t</em><sub>m</sub> have not been fully characterized so far. Various techniques were combined here to explore the properties of these unusual micellar aggregates. X-ray scattering using synchrotron radiation as well as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed the presence of ordered phospholipid acyl chains in the mixed micellar dispersions below <em>t</em><sub>m</sub>. A model will be presented that accounts for the wide-angle x-ray reflect
