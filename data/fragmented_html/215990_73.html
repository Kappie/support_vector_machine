olecular-weight polysaccharides when compared to the wild-type USDA 110 strain. Therefore, it is possible that the low level of radiolabeled glucose incorporated into the cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan pool of M1E7 during the radiolabel screening procedure was a result of increased extracellular polysaccharide production by this mutant.</p><p>Further analysis of mutant M1E7 revealed another curious result. Specifically, the Tn<em>5</em> insertion was found to lie within the <em>clpA</em> gene (th
