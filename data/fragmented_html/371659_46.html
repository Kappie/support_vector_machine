   The routine <a href="../spicelib/npedln.html">NPEDLN</a> finds the nearest point on a triaxial ellipsoid to a
   specified line. Let A, B, C be the lengths of the semi-axes of the
   ellipsoid, and let the line be specified by a point and a direction
   vector represented by the variables POINT and DIR respectively. <a href="../spicelib/npedln.html">NPEDLN</a>
   returns the nearest point on the ellipsoid to the line and the distance
   between that point and the line. The variables NRPT
