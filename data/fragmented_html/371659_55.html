 output argument NXPTS equal to the number of intersection
   points of the ELLIPS and PLANE. The possible values of NXPTS are -1, 0,
   1, and 2. The value -1 is returned when the input ellipse lies in the
   input plane; the number of intersection points is infinite in that case.
   When NXPTS is equal to 1, both XPT1 and XPT2 are set to the value of the
   single point of intersection. When NXPTS is equal to 2, XPT1 and XPT2
   are the points of intersection.
