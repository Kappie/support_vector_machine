es of constant average size. Accordingly, no indication was found in the <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra for a subpopulation of fluid lipids that increases as a function of increasing molar ratio <em>R</em>. The model also neglects the heat of remixing upon dilution of the micelles into the detergent solution. An endothermic enthalpy of approximately 1.2 kcal/mol has previously been observed (<a href="#B18" class="cite-reflink bibr">18</a>) upon dilution of small amounts (0.028 &#x003bc;mol) of POPC vesicles int
