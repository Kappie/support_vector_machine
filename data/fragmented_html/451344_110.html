-loop sequence, which makes this differentiation particularly relevant. Mitochondrial variability in Turkish sheep was very high. The three lineages B, A and C were found in all the breeds analysed, with different types predominating in each population. It is to be noted that the new lineage C reached a high frequency in Akkaraman and Karayaka breeds, while another interesting fact is the high variability found in cluster C. Interestingly, within cluster C, two very strongly supported and quite differentiat
