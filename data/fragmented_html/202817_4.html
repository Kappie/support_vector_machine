phenomenon will require a thorough knowledge of the transmissivity of light throughout the microscope as a function of polarization, as unpolarized light entering the illumination train may become polarized before exiting the objective. &nbsp;Linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to these lines and trenches is investigated as a possible enhancer of overlay offset measurement repeatability. &nbsp;In our particular case, nominally unpolarized light performed proved most repeatable.</TD>
