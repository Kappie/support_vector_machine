Indices of sequence variation and haplotype structure were calculated using the <span class="small-caps">DnaSP</span> 4.00 program (<a href="#bib24" class="cite-reflink bibr">Rozas <em>et al</em>. 2003</a>). A pairwise distance matrix between mtDNA haplotypes was independently calculated for D-loop and <em>Cyt b</em>, using the nucleotide <em>p</em>-distance (<
