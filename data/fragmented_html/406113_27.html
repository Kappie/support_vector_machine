mportance. Previously, alterations in CFI and AI levels were detected in <strong>chronic</strong> inflammatory disease states, but no data on their activity or role during acute inflammatory reactions have been demonstrated. Here we demonstrate the elevation of serum CFI activity during <strong>acute</strong> inflammatory reactions in rabbits. Specifically, inflammatory reactions were induced in rabbits by intraperitoneal injections of 0.1% oyster glycogen. Rabbit serum CFI levels rose rapidly over the firs
