st talented and influential painters? There's a good book - J.M.W.Turner: Romantic Painter of the Industrial Revolution -- which covers the period in the mid 19th century when he was fascinated by steam, power and the way it was transforming perception. Another, if you like that sort of thing, is "Pandaemonium: Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers", which is a collection of reports and thoughts from the time.
