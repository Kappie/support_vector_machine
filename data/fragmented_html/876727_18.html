  Bear earthquakes. We calculate changes in the fault-parallel and fault-normal 
  components of stress on our model after a large earthquake, and compare seismicity 
  rates before and after the event. Spatial correlations between the changes in 
  fault-normal stress component and seismicity rates are evident. From these correlations 
  we generalize the responses of faults to applied stress changes. </P>
