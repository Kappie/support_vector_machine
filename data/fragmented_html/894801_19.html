 with parameters fixed by the FH
 model with Monte Carlo calculations of the lattice model of polymer blends
 should provide some insight into the mean-field approximation in the case
 of properties not tractable using analytic mean-field theory.  For example,
 we can compare LB calculations of the interfacial tension
 to Monte Carlo calculations
 for polymer blends that avoid the mean-field approximation.
