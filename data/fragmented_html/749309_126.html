experiments and theoretical calculations, are collectively 
known as laboratory astrophysics.  This Meeting-in-a-Meeting will consist of 
six sessions that will discuss the nature and evolution of molecules, dust 
and ices from stellar and planetary formation regions to circumstellar, 
planetary nebulae and diffuse ISM environments to comets and planets.  
The sessions map the sub areas of laboratory astrophysics in the IR, FIR 
and Submm domains and cover the study of molecules, dust and ices.  Each
