                This bird, which breeds along the Massachusetts coast, has a black 
                cap and bright red-orange bill with a dark tip. It has a light 
                gray mantle across its back and wings. These 13-16&quot; birds 
                winter in Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and other more southern 
                locations. </font></p>
