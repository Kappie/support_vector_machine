increasing the understanding of radar characteristics associated with violent
tornadic storms and to determine the similarities and differences of the
characteristics across separate geographic regions of the United States.&nbsp;
For this study, 38 United States violent tornadic storms were analyzed
from 1993 to 2001 using the NSSL algorithms.&nbsp; Storm types and environment
characteristics were identified.&nbsp; In addition, radar signatures were
recorded along with cell and meso parameters.&nbs
