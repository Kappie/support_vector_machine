perties of the hot interstellar matter in elliptical galaxies 
are directly related with the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies 
via star formation episodes, environmental effects such as stripping, infall, 
and mergers, and growth of super-massiveblack holes. While the recent 
successful Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray space missions have provided 
a large amount of high quality observational data on the hot ISM in 
elliptical galaxies, a number of important issues are still poorly understood,
