time efficient, nonlinguistic measure of spectral peak resolution has been developed by Henry and Turner (<a href="#CR13" class="cite-reflink bibr">2003</a>, <a href="#CR14" class="cite-reflink bibr">2005</a>). The spectral shape of the ripple sounds had a full-wave rectified sinusoidal shape. They evaluated the ability of subjects to discriminate a reversal in the phase of the rippled shape (Supin et al. <a href="#CR26" class="cite-reflink bibr">1994</a>). They found that CI users could discriminate 0.13&#
