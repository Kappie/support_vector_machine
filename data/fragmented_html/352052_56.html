 protein translocated into the periplasmic space of <em>E. coli</em>. In order to further investigate the subcellular localization of the recombinant CYP, bacteria induced to express the protein were subfractionated into periplasmic, cytoplasmic, and membrane fractions. That effective subcellular fractionation had occurred was indicated by &#x0003e;90&#x00025; enrichment of the marker enzyme activities associated with the isolated subcellular fraction, i.e., alkaline phosphatase (periplasm), malate dehydrog
