 the risk of bacterial gill diseases and catastrophic loss of fish,
even if it does not have an immediate impact on production. The water quality
parameters of primary concern are dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite, carbon
dioxide, and gas supersaturation from either oxygen or nitrogen. Dissolved
oxygen should not be less than 5 ppm, preferable near saturation, but oxygen
supersaturation should be avoided. Recent observations suggest that walleye fry
are especially sensitive to supersaturation.</p>
