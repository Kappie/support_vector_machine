lected for further study because radiolabeling studies suggested that it was impaired for cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan biosynthesis. Curiously, analyses of nonradiolabeled, large-scale cultures of M1E7 revealed that the levels of cell-associated cyclic &#x003b2;-1, 6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans are similar to the levels found in wild-type USDA 110 cultures (data not shown). However, these analyses have also revealed that mutant M1E7 produces approximately twofold higher levels of extracellular, low-m
