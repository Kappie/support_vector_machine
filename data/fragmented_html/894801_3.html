ritical point.)
Such inconsistencies can also be 
expected for certain
 dynamic properties near the critical point. For example, the shear 
viscosity of a near critical Ising-type
 fluid mixture diverges near the critical point while no divergence occurs
 in a model mean-field mixture [<A

due to compositional flucuations have an even larger effect on the collective diffusion 
coefficient [<A
