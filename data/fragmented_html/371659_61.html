   CALL <a href="../spicelib/saelgv.html">SAELGV</a> ( V1, V2, SMAJOR, SMINOR )
</PRE>
   returns SMAJOR as a semi-major axis of the ellipse and SMINOR as a
   semi-minor axis. SMAJOR and SMINOR are orthogonal; SMAJOR is a point on
   the ellipse of largest norm, and SMINOR is a point of smallest norm. The
   semi-axis vectors are not unique: the inverse of any semi-axis vector is
   also a semi-axis vector.
