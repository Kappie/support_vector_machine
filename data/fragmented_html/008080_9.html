n, we find that genetic crossovers are better predicted by the computed recombination profile of the cognate population. The observed differences among populations and between historic hotspots of recombination and present-day crossovers indicate that profiles of recombination are changing rapidly over time. We believe that this degree of a polymorphism of recombination hotspots most likely reflects DNA sequence changes in distant elements or epigenetic factors. </div></th>
