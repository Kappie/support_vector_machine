<p>In figure 8 below, the RFD graph is overlaid onto the meso gate to gate
shear graph.&nbsp; Notice that during the 30 minute cycling period from
53 minutes to 23 minutes prior to the violent tornado, there is a similarity
between RFD and meso gate to gate shear.&nbsp; This similarity is also
true for RFD and meso max rotational velocity.&nbsp; Notice during the
rapid building period, the meso gate to gate shear does not react to the
strong surge
