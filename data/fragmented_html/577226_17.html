 at different altitudes - air traffic control has rules for spacing flights in different directions - so that
the north-south flight path contained more moisture or was at a lower 
temperature than the east-west flight-path.  The amount of moisture in the 
atmosphere can change considerably in a short vertical distance.  It depends
strongly on the origin of the particular air mass.  There are also variations in
the efficiency of aircraft engines, which can affect whether or not a particular plane will leave
