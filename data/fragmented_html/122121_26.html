                Unlike the Wilson's, this bird is not a long-distance migrator 
                but stays in the northern hemisphere. However, its appearance 
                is very similar to the Wilson's except that it has a forked tail. 
                It is a bit more brown, has a duller rump patch, and has longer, 
                more angled wings. The 8&quot; bird does not follow ships. </font></p>
