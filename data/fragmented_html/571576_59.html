poral resolution is required in models to represent aerosol loadings and properties on a regional scale in order to provide realistic estimations of effects of emission controls?</B>  The question of resolution is central to the accuracy of models and to the evaluation of model accuracy in comparison with measurements.  Models need to be able to capture the spatial and temporal scales exhibiting the greatest power.  Possible approaches to this question may involve dynamic gridding or nested grids.  <B><I>Mo
