) along the central y-axis of each block.  
A five second count time was used at each location to improve the 
signal to noise ratio.  Assuming a Poisson process, the relative 
standard uncertainty in the sum of the counts obtained for channels 
50 to 150 should be on the order of 300 counts or 0.4 % (for a sum of 
70,000 counts, a typical value for the cement paste specimens). </p>

provided in Fig. <A HREF="node2.html#pspectra">2</A>.
