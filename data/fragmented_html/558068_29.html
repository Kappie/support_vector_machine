e pressure before the maximum force can be achieved. When performing the compression test with such a device, the tester (i.e., radiologic technologist or medical physicist) may have to press the foot pedal more than once to accurately measure the maximum force. Failure to do so may lead the tester to report an artificially low maximum compression force, leading to an inappropriate failure of the initial power drive compression device quality control test. </p>
