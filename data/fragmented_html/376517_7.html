<span class="newhome1">Rationale:</span> RNA levels for over 63,000 probe sets were measured in a microarray experiment utilizing Affymetrix Human Genome U95Av2 A-E arrays. Many of these probe sets can be linked to known genes (based on clustering information from UniGene) - follow the links to UniGene and GeneCards, where information on possible function can be found. Other probe sets represent as yet unnamed genes - follow the Unigene link for more information. All gen
