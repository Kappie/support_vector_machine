<p>The poly (A)+ RNA was decapped with tabacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) and ligated with DNA-RNA linker including EcoRI site by treatment of T4 RNA ligase. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from oligo dT-selected mRNA by priming with dT-tailed vector. The dT-tailed vector was adjusted to have about 60nt. The cDNA vector was circularized with E. coli DNA ligase after digestion of EcoRI which
