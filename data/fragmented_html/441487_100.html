reen plants' success or failure in this competition
depends also upon the availability of such essentials as solar energy,
soil moisture, and nutrients. Competition within the plant world is
strongly, but not exclusively, governed by the sunlight available at the
photosynthetic or leaf surfaces. This is partly a function of stature,
with the taller plants succeeding, and partly one of chlorophyll density
within the leaves, as some shorter plants can compete successfully in
reduced light. In both, the
