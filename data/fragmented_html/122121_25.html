                This long-distance migrator (breeds in Antarctic and ranges to 
                temperate and subarctic areas of northern hemisphere) is a small 
                (7&quot;), sooty-brown bird, with paler wings and a conspicuous 
                white patch on its rump. Its tail is even at the end (no fork). 
                May be seen following ships. </font></p>
