ple, we present a small program that solves a realistic
   science analysis geometry problem: finding the sub-observer point on an
   extended body at a specified time. We will assume that we have an SPK
   file available that contains ephemeris data for observer and target body
   at the time of interest.
<P>
 
   If you are not familar with SPICE kernel files, consult the <a href="../req/spk.html">SPK.REQ</a>,
