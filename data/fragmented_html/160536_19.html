nctive pattern.  Rates of displacement were slow after a dome-building
episode but increased nearly exponentially as the onset of the next dome-growth
event neared (Chadwick and others, 1983).  This pattern and various other
details of the entire deformation process of the crater floor were nicely traced
with the simple rebar-and-tape method and formed the basis for a series of
predictions of dome growth in 1981-1982 (Swanson and others, 1983).  Moreover,
the simple measurements with a steel tape prov
