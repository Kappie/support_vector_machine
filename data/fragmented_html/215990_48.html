B. japonicum</em> mutant M1E7 were examined by TLC, a major spot, migrating with a substantially higher <em>R<sub>f</sub></em> value than the cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans, was detected (data not shown). Indeed, this material was a major contaminant within cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan preparations and represented approximately 75&#x00025; (glucose equivalent) of the total carbohydrate present within the low-molecular-weight fraction isolated from culture supernatants of mutant M1E7
