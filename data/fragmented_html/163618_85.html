 the building was nearly derelict by the 1980s. Much of 
the original architectural detail was destroyed or removed in decades of

acquired the building in 1988 and restoration was begun. The subsequent 
restoration was so faithful to original drawings and historical photos that the 
courthouse received the 1994 Modernization Award from <I>Buildings Magazine
