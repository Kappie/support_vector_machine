om the 1st to 12th test runs. This effect was smaller, and in fact, not statistically significant for steady-state noise. Drennan et al. (<a href="#CR7" class="cite-reflink bibr">2007</a>) reported that normal-hearing listeners presented with vocoded speech using randomized temporal fine structure (a cochlear implant simulation with 100% randomization of fine structure) showed a similar greater learning effect with two-talker babble than with speech-shaped, steady-state noise, which is consistent with the p
