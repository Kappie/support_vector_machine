rapping power of the greenhouse effect existing at the magnitudes currently envisioned by most scientists -- i.e. a doubling of CO2 would raise surface temperatures by about 3 degrees C plus or minus 1.5 degrees C. This is known as the "climate sensitivity range." The magnitude of climate sensitivity that helps to explain the ice age coldness best is 2-3 degrees C. If the best estimate were ten degrees warming, which is twice the value at the high end of the climate sensitivity range thought by the mainstre
