This 3 day Meeting-in-a-Meeting will be devoted to the interplay between 
laboratory astrophysics and IR, FIR and Submm astronomy.  The sessions will 
discuss current and future missions and facilities that operate in this domain 
and their laboratory astrophysics needs.  Astronomy is an observational 
science detecting photons generated by atomic/molecular/chemical, and 
solid-state physics.  The astrophysically motivated studies, which consist 
of both laboratory
