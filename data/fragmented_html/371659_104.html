   C     The body-center--observer vector is OBSERV; RAYDIR is
   C     the boresight ray's direction vector in body-fixed
   C     coordinates.

   C     Find the limb of the ellipsoid as seen from the
   C     point OBSERV.  Here A, B, and C are the lengths of
   C     the semi-axes of the ellipsoid.
