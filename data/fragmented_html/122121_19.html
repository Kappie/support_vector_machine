                Tern</b><br>
                On occasion, one may see one of these flying over the Sanctuary. 
                This tern has a bright blood-red bill all the way to the tip. 
                It has white cheeks but grayer breast and wings than the Common 
                Tern; also the Arctic Tern has a shorter bill and legs (usually 
                seen in more northern waters). The 14-17&quot; bird winters in 
                the southern hemisphere. </fon
