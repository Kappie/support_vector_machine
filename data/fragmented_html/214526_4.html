leotide blast searches through megablast, blastall, and bl2seq
have until now allowed users to select arbitrary gap existence<A NAME="869"></A>
and gap extension<A NAME="870"></A> penalties for a blastn<A NAME="871"></A>
type search. This has been convenient for users but has led to the
unfortunate situation that searches with some parameter sets were
significantly overestimating the statistical significance of matches.
The parameters that might cause an issue here are -r, -q, -G, and
-E.
