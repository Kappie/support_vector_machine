nd the angle of the emitted light,

the quantization axis,  given by the magnetization direction, which is also the
surface normal here. For <i>bulk</i> GaAs the light and heavy holes are
degenerate at the valence band maximum, and a 100% polarized electron spin
density would recombine to give 50% circularly polarized light along the
surface normal (and 50% unpolarized light). For light emitted off-normal from
recombination of a conduction electron sp
