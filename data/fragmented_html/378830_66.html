nd on the rate at which CO2 concentrations increased. For slowly increasing CO2 buildup scenarios, the model predicted the standard model outcome: the temperature at the poles warmed more than the tropics. <P>

Any changes in equator-to-pole temperature difference help to create altered regional climates, since temperature differences over space influence large-scale atmospheric wind patterns. However, for very rapid increases in CO2 concentrations a reversal of the equator-to-pole difference occurred. If
