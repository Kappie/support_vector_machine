 team's greatest challenge is to balance the current level of production with requests from physicists for continual improvement, or studies, which could affect the accelerators' performance. "If we do studies for four hours, that's four hours the colliders may not be taking data," said Gattuso. "But if we can increase performance with those improvements, then that's worth it."  All three team members have experience working in operations at Fermilab, which helps them decide which maintenance needs are crit
