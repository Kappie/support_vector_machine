nce of this 
  difference is much stronger also with a ~0.001% probability of being the result 
  of random chance, whereas there is a ~10% chance that the difference is the 
  result of random chance for the San Andreas fault (Figure 8). We suggest that 
  the stronger correlation for low friction of the Hayward and San Gregorio faults 
  as compared with the San Andreas fault may result from the recent reactivation 
  of this segment of the southern San Andreas as a right-lateral strike-slip fault
