sional changes, there are recognized
concurrent changes in both quantity and quality of the soil substrate.
This is perhaps the more important in primary succession where sandy
soils present a low cation exchange or nutritive capacity typical of
soils low in the mineral clay fraction. Sierran granitoid soils, high in
sand content, thus improve with age as the organic content increases.
The humus performs a function similar to that of clay, enriching the
developing soil, a factor of considerable impor
