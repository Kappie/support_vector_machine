start exploring the TeV 
frontier searching for signals of Physics beyond the Standard Model. 
Meanwhile satellite experiments exploring high energy, Fermi GLAST and Pamela, 
and a number of ground based TeV telescopes have been in operation for some 
time. In addition, underground direct detection experiments contiunue to make 
considerable progress in exploring limits on dark matter. This Meeting will 
focus on the contributions of astrophysical observations, direct detection 
experiments, and TeV acceler
