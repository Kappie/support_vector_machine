the `center' of the ellipse, and we refer to V1 and V2 as
   `generating vectors'. Note that an ellipse centered at the origin is
   completely specified by its generating vectors. In the rest of this
   document, when we refer to the center or generating vectors for a
   particular ellipse, we mean vectors that play the role of CENTER or V1
   and V2 in defining that ellipse.

   This representation of ellipses has the particularly convenient property
   that it allows easy computation of the image of
