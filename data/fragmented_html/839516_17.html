Concrete pavements containing fly ash are very durable and cost effective. Between 1950 and 1970, concrete with fly ash contents as high as 50 percent was used in an estimated 100 major dam construction projects. In the construction of Hungry Horse Dam in 1953, for example, 120,000 metric tons of fly ash were used (<ABBR>fig.</ABBR> 5).
