high critical temperature of 68&deg;F. The critical temperature is that
below which the animal must expend energy beyond its basal rate to
maintain a constant body temperature (Irving et al. 1955). This helps
explain the correlation between temperatures and such evolutionary
features in these two squirrels as nestbuilding, the caching of food
underneath the insulating snow, daily foodgathering, etc., as well as
the cutting of cones in large numbers and then making many trips to the
ground to store th
