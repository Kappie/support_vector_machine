<I>Dieterich</I> [1992] and <I>Ruina</I> [1983] discuss the impact on the static 
friction coefficient with increasing state and show that for fault slip rates 
below a steady-state value, the fault strengthens through a frictional increase 
(Figure 16). <I>Dieterich and Kilgore</I> [1994] suggest that indentation creep 
processes can increase the contact area as a function of contact age. Laboratory
