 into space.  The small core of the star (typically a sphere of about 10 
km in radius) may remain behind as an ultradense "compact object", generally a 
neutron star, but sometimes, in extreme cases, a black hole.  In the case 
of the Crab Nebula, we can see both the nebula and the neutron star.  The

X-ray emission from the Crab Nebula allows us to probe the ejected outer 
material, along with the regions nearest the neutron star.  The ima
