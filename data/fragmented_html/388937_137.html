 of large liquid crystalline aggregates certainly represents a premise for the final, entropy-driven breakdown into smaller mixed micelles. The increasing water binding of the poly(ethyleneoxide) moiety of the detergent also promotes micelle formation with decreasing temperature. This has been rationalized in terms of a critical packing parameter (<a href="#B24" class="cite-reflink bibr">24</a>) defining the limiting conditions for the stability of an aggregated state, i.e., the average shape of the highly
