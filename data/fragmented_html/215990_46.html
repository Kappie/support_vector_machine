. Material eluting in the position expected for cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan was pooled and subsequently analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 plates (EM Industries, Gibbstown, N.J.) and a butanol-ethanol-water (5:5:4) solvent system. Samples were visualized on TLC plates by charring at 170&#x000b0;C for 20 min after spraying with 5&#x00025; sulfuric acid in methanol (vol/vol) (<a href="#B7" class="cite-reflink bibr">7</a>).</p></p><p><span class="head3
