 study, we characterized dairy manure organic P by enzymatic hydrolysis at pH 5.0. About 75% of total manure P in the fresh manure was characterized by this approach. Data obtained in this study indicate that mild enzymatic hydrolysis was useful for quantifying labile (or hydrolyzable) organic P forms in dairy manure. Quantifying labile P forms by this approach may advance our ability to manage manure P in an environmentally responsible manner.
