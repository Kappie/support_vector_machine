of capability to understand and represent these transport processes is central to the DOE/ESD Program on Vertical Transport and Mixing Processes,</B></I> which will be explicitly addressing questions such as the following: What formulation is most appropriate for the description of vertical diffusion in stable air?  How rapidly will an elevated layer of pollutants mix towards the ground in a stable pool trapped within a basin, and how can that mixing be modeled?  How do traveling weather systems scour stabl
