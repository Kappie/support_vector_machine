BASIS OF THE GRIEVANCE AND BEFORE HE WENT TO
 MR.  SANDS, HE HAD TALKED FIRST TO BILLY M. JONES, ANOTHER UNION
 STEWARD, WHO ADVISED COPYING THE 971 VERBATIM.  THEREFORE, THERE WAS NO
 NEED FOR HIM TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTS BEFORE SEEING THE 971.  I CANNOT
 CREDIT MR. DUKES' TESTIMONY FOR REASONS DISCUSSED INFRA.  I DO CREDIT
 MR.  SANDS' TESTIMONY BASED ON HIS TOTAL RECOLLECTION OF EVENTS AND HIS
 DEMEANOR WHILE TESTIFYING.  A "971" IS A SUPERVISOR'S PERSONAL RECORD OF
 AN EMPLOYEE.
