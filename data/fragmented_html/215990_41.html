strategy using C<sub>18</sub> silica gel resin was based on an earlier report by Rolin and coworkers (<a href="#B28" class="cite-reflink bibr">28</a>) that revealed that cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans could be bound to C<sub>18</sub> silica gel resin and selectively eluted using 30&#x00025; methanol. Of approximately 2,100 mutants screened, 1 mutant, referred to as mutant M1E7, was found to contain extremely low levels of radiolabel in the 30&#x00025; methanol eluent (i.e., 4&#x00025; of the lev
