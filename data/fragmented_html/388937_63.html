 to the bilayer surface perpendicular to the field direction. The macroscopic alignment is a result of the decreased elastic modulus of the aggregates, i.e., the torque arising from the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of the alkyl chains overcomes the bending rigidity of the bilayers (<a href="#B13" class="cite-reflink bibr">13</a>). As a result of micelle formation below 20&#x000b0;C the resolution of <sup>2</sup>H quadrupolar splittings is lost, the entire spectral intensity eventually merges into a s
