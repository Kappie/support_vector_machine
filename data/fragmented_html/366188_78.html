t ranged between 67.3% to 75.6%. Similar comparisons between the pronghorn virus sequence and representative viruses from the six recognized pestivirus genotypes yielded similarity values that ranged between 55.4% and 61.3%. These results suggest the virus isolated from pronghorn antelope represents a new pestivirus species and the first member of a new pestivirus genotype.  It also represents the only pestivirus genotype first isolated from New World wildlife.
