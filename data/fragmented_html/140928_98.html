esponse and Fos expression remained unchanged. The absence of sucrose-induced effects on hindpaws suggests a rostrocaudal developmental difference in anatomy and physiology of descending pathways.</p><p>Most of the descending pathways originating in the brain stem and traveling via the dorsolateral funiculus in the spinal cord are in place as early as neonatal day 6 and are comparable to the adult pattern (<a href="#B38" class="cite-reflink bibr">38</a>). Electrophysiology studies, however, reveal that acti
