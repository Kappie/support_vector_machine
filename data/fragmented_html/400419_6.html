olarization of the electron density at the
time of recombination. Recently there has been considerable interest in the
spin polarization of electrons which have been injected into GaAs from a
ferromagnet, for example through the Schottky barrier between a ferromagnet and
a GaAs-based quantum well light emitting diode, or by tunneling from a
ferromagnetic tip through the vacuum barrier in an STM experiment. Here we
discuss 1) potential sources of confusion in relating the sign of electron spin
