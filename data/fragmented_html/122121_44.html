                in the water, where they spend most of their lives, they are agile 
                swimmers and prodigious divers. Using their wings as flippers, 
                alcids swiftly pursue crustaceans and small fish, such as herring, 
                at great depths, often emerging with their bills filled with multiple 
                prey to bring back to their nests. One species, the Common Murre, 
                has been recorded diving to depths of 550 feet. </font></p>
