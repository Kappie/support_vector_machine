 The small peak at 
channel 200 is from an 
internal Cobalt source used for system calibration.  The denser w/c=0.3 cement 
paste is seen to absorb more of the X-rays as indicated by its lower count 
values at all channels up to 150.  Based on the pattern 
observed in Fig. <A HREF="node2.html#pspectra">2</A>, the sum of counts between channels 50 
and 150 was selected as the dependent variable to be analyzed as being 
representative of the density (and water content) of the cement paste.  
This value was no
