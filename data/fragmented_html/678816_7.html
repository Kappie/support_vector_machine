 the system with adaptive optics in June when         they will be able to see a real star.<br>        <br>        Adaptive optics refers to the ability to compensate or adapt to turbulence         in the Earth&#146;s atmosphere, removing the blurring of starlight. Adaptive         optics systems measure the distortions of the light from a star and then         remove the distortions by bouncing the light off a deformable mirror that         corrects the image several hundred times per second. <br>
