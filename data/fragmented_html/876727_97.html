ss-induced pore fluid pressure changes along fault zones. 
  For example, in Figure 13 three cases are shown for the Hayward fault. The first 
  case has a very simple criterion that failure occurs as a function of the shear 
  stress change only (m=0), which fits the observed seismicity rate decrease. 
  In the second case, a high coefficient of friction (m =0.8) is applied in the 
  Coulomb criterion that does not fit the seismicity. In the third case, the stress-induced 
  pore pressure change <IMG SRC="
