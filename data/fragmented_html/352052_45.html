t 1,500 &#x000d7; <em>g</em> for 10 min. Periplasmic fractions were prepared by osmotic shock. Cells were plasmolyzed by suspension in 20 ml of 20&#x00025; (wt/vol) sucrose&#x02013;0.3 M Tris-HCl (pH 8)&#x02013;1 mM EDTA (STE buffer) and incubation at 22&#x000b0;C for 10 min, harvested, and resuspended in residual STE buffer. Osmotic shock was performed by rapid immersion in 2 ml of ice-chilled 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the periplasmic fraction was recovered by centrifugat
