 few exceptions, such as uncontrolled fires, emissions of aerosols and aerosol precursors do not vary much from day to day, yet aerosol loadings vary substantially.  This variation is thus due primarily to variation in meteorological conditions governing transport, dispersion, and deposition.  These conditions must be accurately represented in models in order to evaluate model performance with observations and thereby ascertain the accuracy of model representation of pertinent processes.  <B><I>Development
