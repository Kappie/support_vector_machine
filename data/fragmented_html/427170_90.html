 or route of administration. At the lowest oral dose, 83% of the radiolabel was recovered within 72 hr (51% in urine, 12% in feces, 17% as expired 14CO2, <1% as expired [14C]citral, and 3% in total tissues). Production of 14CO2 essentially ceased 12 hr after treatment, and the amount of 14C found in any tissue was very small (<2%). This excretion profile did not change much with increasing oral dose, although ... oxidation to CO2 was somewhat greater at the lowest dose. [FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Fo
