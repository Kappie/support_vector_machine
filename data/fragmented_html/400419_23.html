he electron density
at the time of recombination in the semiconductor, and we have seen how with
care to avoid confusion the <i>sign</i> of the polarization in the
semiconductor can be related to the majority spin direction in the ferromagnet.
However, the <i>magnitude</i> of the measured electron polarization in the
semiconductor is not simply related to the magnitude of the polarization in the
ferromagnet. Transport across the barrier may be spin dependent and there is
spin-flip scattering in the s
