XMM-Newton and Chandra have been in orbit for about one decade. High-resolution
X-ray spectra of SSS are crucial for our understanding of the emission process 
in these systems. With their high-sensitivity instrumentation SSS can be 
investigated in more distant galaxies. XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys of M 31 
revealed that most SSS in M 31 are identified with optical novae with various 
durations of the SSS state lasting from months to more than 10 years. 
Monitoring observations with Swift allow us to i
