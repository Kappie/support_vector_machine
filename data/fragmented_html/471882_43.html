<td> "I reported a problem to dCache-admin 14:00 on 1/14/2009.  An LQCD user  reported an odd error when one of his 'dccp' commands failed.  I was able  to reproduce the problem at that time. It appeared that if the user tried  to use 'dccp' to copy a file that was not already in cache, he got the  following error:    > --(0)> dccp       >  /pnfs/theory/milc/l2064f21b679m020m050/gauge/Coulomb//l2064f21b679m020m050-  Coul_000342  > /tmp  > Command failed!  > Server error message for [1]: ""902
