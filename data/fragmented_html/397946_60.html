ins when the meso diameter rapidly shrinks.&nbsp; At this time, the
mesocyclone fills causing the meso rotational velocities to weaken.&nbsp;
As the meso shrinks, the hook or pendant strengthens.&nbsp; The hook or
pendant peaks when the meso is small and close to the precipitation shaft.&nbsp;
The cell top collapses a bit during this period.&nbsp; Three to five minutes
later, the meso diameter increases causing the hook to decrease or disappear.&nbsp;
The larger mesocyclone then pulls the RFD around.&
