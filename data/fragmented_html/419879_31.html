used to determine speech reception thresholds for words in two-talker babble and in speech-shaped, steady-state noise. Spectral-ripple thresholds (ripples/octave) were significantly correlated with speech reception thresholds (dB SNR) in noise for 29 cochlear implant users (<em>r</em><img src="corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" " />=<img src="corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" " />&#x02212;0.55, <em>p</em><img src="corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" " />=<img src="c
