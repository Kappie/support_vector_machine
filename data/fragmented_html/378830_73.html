of factors. Figure 1 shows the elicitation results for the important climate sensitivity factor. Note that 15 out of 16 scientists surveyed ( including several IPCC Working Group I Lead Authors -- I am scientist 9) assigned something like a 10% subjective likelihood of negligible (less than 1 C) climatic change from doubling of CO2. These scientists also typically assigned a 10% probability for extremely large climatic changes --greater than 5 C, roughly equivalent to the temperature difference experienced
