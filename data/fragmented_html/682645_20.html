e you are out in the middle of a field somewhere. 
        In front of you is a loudspeaker with your favorite music playing. As 
        you move away from the speaker the music will get quieter and quieter 
        until you can't hear it at all. In fact, you may notice that the loudness 
        of the music will decay rapidly as you first start to move away. However, 
        when you are further away, you will have to walk a much greater distance 
        to notice anymore change. Try it sometime. </sp
