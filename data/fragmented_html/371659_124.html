 on the projected
   C              limb to the projected vertex of the boresight
   C              ray.  The distance between the projected ellipse
   C              PJLIMB and the point PJPOS is the altitude of the
   C              boresight ray above the limb.  To find the point
   C              on the limb closest to the boresight, just find
   C              the inverse orthogonal projection of NEAR onto the
   C              limb plane.
