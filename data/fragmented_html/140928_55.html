de in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. The C7-8 or L4-5 spinal cord was removed, placed in the same fixative for 1&#x02013;3 hr at 4&#x000b0;C, and transferred to 30&#x00025; sucrose (wt/vol) in phosphate buffer for several days for cryoprotection. Thirty micron-thick sections were sliced on a cryostat at -20&#x000b0;C. Free-floating tissue sections were processed following the avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex protocol with a Vector ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Anti-Fos antibody was
