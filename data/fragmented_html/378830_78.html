and vertical patterns of climate change predicted to occur in coupled atmosphere-ocean models has been increasingly evident in observations over that past several decades. Clearly, more research is needed, but enough is already known to warrant assessments of the possible impacts of such projected climatic changes and the relative merits of alternative actions to both mitigate emissions and/or make adaptations less costly. That is the ongoing task of integrated assessment analysts, a task that will become i
