<P>Because faults in the Santa Clara Valley thrust belt were less 
  active prior to the Loma Prieta earthquake than was, for example, the southern 
  Hayward fault (Figure 15), a possibility exists that a component of time-dependent 
  friction might have allowed the less active faults to heal, and thus evolve 
  toward a greater static coefficient of friction as compared with fault patches 
  with more frequent instabilities or that creep (Figur
