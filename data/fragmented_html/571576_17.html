It also precludes evaluation of performance of global climate model simulations so that <B><I>it is impossible at present to answer the question of how much of the 0.6 degree temperature rise over the past century can be ascribed to anthropogenic activities and how much to natural variation</B></I>.  Much of this uncertainty arises from present limited ability to quantitatively describe the aerosol loading and microphysical prope
