<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">15.&#9;How can this understanding of aerosol processes be parameterized for inclusion in regional to continental to hemisphere scale air-quality models and in global scale climate models.</B>  Inclusion of aerosol processes "on-line" in climate models is increasingly recognized to be important to examination of feedbacks.  Likewise it may be necessary in air quality models to include feedbacks between aerosol and oxidant chemistry.  For these reasons, as well as for devel
