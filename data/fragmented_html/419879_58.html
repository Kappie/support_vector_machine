 filter (Byrne et al. <a href="#CR2" class="cite-reflink bibr">1994</a>). These stimuli differed from those used by Henry et al. (<a href="#CR14" class="cite-reflink bibr">2005</a>) (Turner, personal communication) in that our spectral shape was sinusoidal on a logarithmic amplitude axis (a dB scale), whereas the Henry et al. study had a sinusoidal shape on a linear amplitude axis. Logarithmic amplitude ripples were used in this study with the rationale that logarithmic amplitude is closer to the perceptual
