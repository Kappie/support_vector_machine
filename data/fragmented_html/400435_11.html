vision and  UC Berkeley's Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, working with graduate  student Carolyn Phillips, has identified a key family of genes and proteins  that help bring <em>C.&nbsp;elegans</em> chromosomes together during meiosis. This specialized cell division produces  gametes, or sex cells, each of which has only one copy of each chromosome  instead of the two copies most cells carry. </p>
      <p>During meiosis a cell replicates and then divides twice,  resulting in sperm or eggs with j
