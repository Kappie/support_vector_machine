d rats by an altered distribution of lipid and glycogen in the liver and peroxisome proliferation occurred in a manner of that associated with some hypolipidaemic compounds. Specific biochemical markers supported the morphological changes in the peroxisomes. Cyanide-insensitive palmitoyl CoA oxidation showed, at the maximum fourfold and threefold inductions in Wistar albino and Long Evans hooded rats, respectively. In addition, induction of cytochrome P450 levels was greater in the Long Evans than in the Wi
