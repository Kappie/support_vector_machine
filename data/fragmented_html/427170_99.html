responding acid presumably by aldehyde dehydrogenases. In the present study, hepatic mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats to assess in vitro metabolism of citral. Evidence of aldehyde dehydrogenases-mediated citral oxidation was not seen in either subcellular fraction. On the contrary, citral was found to be a potent inhibitor of acetaldehyde oxidation by the low-KM mitochondrial form of aldehyde dehydrogenases. Measurement of the in vitro acetaldehyde oxidation
