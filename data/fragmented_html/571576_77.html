ill develop modeling capabilities on relevant scales.  The modeling activities must be carried out in tight collaboration with the field program.  Modeling can be used to develop a program plan before the field campaign and afterwards it will be a major part of data analysis.  It is therefore imperative that the modeling activities focus on a regional and not global scale. A very important component of the model development must be characterization of the  meteorological variables that are responsible for a
