4, 800)">2</a>) show induction of CYP at the expected size of ~45,000 Da. A new protein at 45,406 Da was observed by electron spray analysis, indicating a processed product lacking a signal sequence. Additionally, the periplasmic fraction showed dramatic changes in the overall composition compared with control samples. Most significant is the intense cooverproduction of a 30-kDa protein whose identity was confirmed as &#x003b2;-lactamase through N-terminal protein sequence analysis of the protein band.    <
