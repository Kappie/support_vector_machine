l components of stress resolved on each receiver fault element. 
  To determine whether induced clamping or unclamping stresses promoted failure 
  on the receiver faults, we observed changes in seismicity rate on the receiver 
  fault. We thus plotted the receiver faults with the stress changes imposed by 
  the Loma Prieta or Landers earthquakes together with near-fault earthquake hypocenters 
  in three dimensions so that spatial correlations between stress changes and 
  seismicity could be seen (i.e.,
