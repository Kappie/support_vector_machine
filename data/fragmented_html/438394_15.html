pproximately 90% of the CO<span class="smaller">2</span> emitted
        to the atmosphere. It is now well established that there is a strong
        possibility that dissolved CO<span class="smaller">2</span> in the ocean surface will double
        over its pre-industrial value by the middle of this century, with accompanying
        surface ocean acidity (pH) and carbonate ion (CO32-) decreases that are
        greater than those experienced during the transition from ice ages to
        warm ages.
