gilli: Aspergillus auricomus, A. sclerotiorum and two isolates of A. alliaceus. Piperine and piperlongumine, natural alkaloids of Piper longum, significantly inhibited OTA production at 0.001% (w/v) for all aspergilli examined. Piperine and piperlongumine affected the polyketide synthesis step of OTA production and inhibited production of citrinin. Curcumin, a constituent of tumeric, completely inhibited mycelial growth of A. alliaceus isolate 791 at 0.1% (w/v) and decreased OTA production by approximately
