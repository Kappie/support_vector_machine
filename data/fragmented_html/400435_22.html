eins during meiosis and show that each protein binds specifically to the  chromosomes they help to pair. Further tracking showed that during meiosis  HIM-8 and the ZIM proteins on each chromosome latch onto the cell's nuclear  envelope. This activity is reminiscent of the way chromosomes attach to the  nuclear envelope during meiosis in other organisms. </p>
      <p>&quot;In most eukaryotic species &#151; plants, mammals, fungi,  and so on &#151; the telomeres on the ends of the chromosomes anchor to the
