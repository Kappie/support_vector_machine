             MR. VERSHBOW:  There's still no definitive numbers that we
can say as far as the overall size of the NATO implementation force or
the U.S. component of that.  The NATO planning is still underway in
Brussels and at SHAPE, and until we know the overall force requirements,
we won't be able to take our own decision.  But we will contribute a
substantial share of the force.

             Q  Can you say it's smaller than the figures that were used
some months ago of 50,000?
