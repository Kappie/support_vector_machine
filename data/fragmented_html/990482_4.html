                  IMAX              32767  I
The program determines linear stretch constants IMIN and IMAX such that:

 a) IMIN is the largest I which satisfies the equation
       A(-32768,I) &lt= PL * A(-32768,32767)

 b) IMAX is the smallest I which satisfies the equation
       A(I,32767) &lt= PH * A(-32768,32767)

where PL and PH may be specified by the LPER and HPER keywords.  The values
A(-32768,IMIN) and A(IMAX,32767) represent the shaded areas under the curve in 
the above graph.  Note that A(-3276
