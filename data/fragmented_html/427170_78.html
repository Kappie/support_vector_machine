	         <li> <strong>OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION:</strong> Citral induced histopathological changes in liver of rats and mice orally treated with citral only at extremely high doses. ...In /one/ rat study, specific biochemical marker supported the morphological changes in the peroxisomes and a peroxisome associated polypeptide of molecular weight 80,000 daltons (PPA-80) was induced. Therefore, peroxisome proliferation is involved in the action of citral on live
