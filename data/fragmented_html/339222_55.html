lyzable organic P and 12% non-hydrolyzable P. In the residual resuspension, the distribution of characterized P was 25%spontaneous labile P, 32% simple monoester P, 7% polynucleotide P, 9% phytate-like P, and 26% nonhydrolyzable P. Autoclaving released residual P in a level similar to that observed with spontaneous hydrolysis over 54 h. This suggests that autoclaving sped the release of spontaneously hydrolyzable organic P in animal manure and can be used as a simple and rapid way to identify the most labil
