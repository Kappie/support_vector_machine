tics on the Keck II telescope to greatly increase         the resolution of fine details of astronomical objects. <br>        <br>        Installed in 1999, the Keck adaptive optics system has enabled astronomers         to minimize the blurring effects of the Earth&#146;s atmosphere, producing         images with unprecedented detail and resolution. The adaptive optics system         uses light from a relatively bright star to measure the atmospheric distortions         and to correct for them, but
