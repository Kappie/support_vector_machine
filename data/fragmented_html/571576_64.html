/I> of the understanding of the processes that control aerosol loading and properties.  Accurate modeling of these aerosol properties under a wide variety of situations is necessary to give confidence in the physical understanding of the processes represented in the model and to the use of the model to answer questions.  Model evaluation should not be restricted solely to comparisons of aerosol loadings and properties but should also include evaluation of representation of concentrations of precursors and o
