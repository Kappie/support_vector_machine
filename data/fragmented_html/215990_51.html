ns containing 10 to 13 glucose residues. However, when the anionic, low-molecular-weight extracellular polysaccharide material obtained from mutant M1E7 was examined by negative-ion FABMS, the analysis revealed a very different spectrum, although the predominant molecular ion species had <em>m/z</em> values in the same range as the cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans (Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=92685&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F1" class="fig-table-link " onclick="startTarget(this, 'figu
