as tightened.</p>
<p>Very good flight.  Radome survived without problems.  183 GHz noise was not present for the first time in many flights, presumable due to tightening the loose SMA connector.</p>
<p>Flight included a rendezvous with a British research plane for about an hour (1450-1550). </p>
<p>At about 1736, Ch. 7 on the 55 GHz radiometer had saturated hot counts that persisted until nearly the end of the sortie.  Will fix before next flight by adding 1 dB of attenuation in that channel.</p>
