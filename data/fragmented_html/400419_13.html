 semiconductor. The second column
gives the moment of the same electrons in the ferromagnet and the final column
gives the helicity of the light. At the bottom, the third column is expanded to
give the angular momentum of states in the semiconductor at the conduction band
minimum and valence band maximum, and illustrates the relevant heavy hole
transitions.</p>

The circular polarization of the recombination radiation is related to
<i>P<sub>s</sub></i> through the matrix elements. In the light
