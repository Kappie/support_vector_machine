All bodies with temperature give off radiant energy. The earth gives off a total amount of radiant energy equivalent to that of a black body -- a fictional structure that represents an ideal radiator -- with a temperature of roughly -18 C (255 K). The mean global surface air temperature is about 14 C (287 K), some 32 C warmer than the earth's black body temperature. The difference is due to the well-established greenhouse effect.<P>
