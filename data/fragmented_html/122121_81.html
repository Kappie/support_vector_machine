The large and distinctive Great Black-backed Gull has a heavy 
                yellow bill with an orange spot on it and a black back and wings 
                that contrast sharply with its snow-white head and undersides. 
                Glaucous Gulls and Iceland Gulls often attend fishing boats during 
                the winter. They are gray above with white underparts, pink legs, 
                and yellow bills with orange spots like the Herring and Great 
                Black-backed gulls.
