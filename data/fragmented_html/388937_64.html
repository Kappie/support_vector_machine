ingle line, and the chemical shift of the <sup>31</sup>P-NMR signal moves toward 0 ppm. This transition is accompanied by a sudden decrease in light scattering and viscosity. The size of the aggregates above 30&#x000b0;C as determined by dynamic light scattering was &#x02265;200 nm whereas an average size of ~7 nm was found below 20&#x000b0;C. An analogous behavior was found for mixtures of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> and DPPC where the bilayer-micelle transition occurred around 38&#x000b0;C (<a href="#B7"
