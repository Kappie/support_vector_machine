meaning.  I introduce a formalization of the
representation within the framework of Head Driven Phrase Structure
Grammar (Pollard and Sag 1994), and rely on the model of discourse
coherence proposed by Lascarides and Asher (1992), Discourse in
Commonsense Entailment.  I furthermore discuss the implications of the
contextual dependency of semantic interpretation for lexicon design
and computational processing in Natural Language Understanding systems.
