heir projected intersections with major vertical strike-slip 
  faults such as the San Andreas. Where available, earthquake hypocenters were 
  projected in the vicinity of each fault to test that its dip was in accordance 
  with local earthquake activity. There is close agreement between the fault model 
  developed geologically, and an interpretation of nodal planes developed by <I>Zoback 
  et al.</I> [1998] from focal mechanisms. The final model is expressed as a series 
  of dislocation elements that
