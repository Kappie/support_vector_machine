ly diagnosed gastric  cancer cases with epidemiological and laboratory data from both high (e.g., Japan, South America) and low (e.g., U.S.)  incidence populations. In FY2008, gastric tissue for EBV testing would be  obtained from 4 or 5 completed studies that have extant questionnaire and  polymorphisms data on approximately 1500 cases. Data from this pilot would be  summarized and used to recruit additional completed cohort and case-control  studies to provide gastric tissue for EBV classification, as wel
