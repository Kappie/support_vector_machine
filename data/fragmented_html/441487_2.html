e assemblages are essentially in bands
or zones of varying width along the mountain slopes. Originally based
upon temperature zonation, this concept has limited usefulness. However,
the recognition of indicator organisms for each zone may serve the
fundamental concept that physical factors have selected various life
forms, and that these factors, mainly temperature and precipitation,
vary directly with altitude and, to a lesser extent, with aspect of the
slope. Very much similar to the Life Zone conc
