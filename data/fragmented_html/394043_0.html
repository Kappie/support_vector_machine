Nebula</A> is a large cloud of gas which was produced a stellar explosion 
that was seen in AD 1054. The nebula is 6000 light years from Earth, so the 
explosion observed in AD 1054 actually occurred 6000 years earlier.   Stars 
with masses of more than 10 times the sun's mass are thought to end their 
lives in great cataclysmic explosions called <I>supernovae</I>.  When a 
supernova occurs, most of the material which comprises the star gets thrown 
out
