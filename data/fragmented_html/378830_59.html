4.5 C. Flux adjustments do, however, have a large influence on regional climatic projections, even if they prove not to be a major impact on globally-averaged climate sensitivity. Improving coupled models is thus a high priority for climate researchers since it is precisely such regional projections that are so critical to the assessment of climatic impacts on environment and society (e.g., IPCC, 1996b; IPCC, 1997).<P>

Transient versus Equilibrium Simulations. One final issue needs to be addressed in the
