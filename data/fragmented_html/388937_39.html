The properties of mixed detergent/lipid micelles recently came into focus when detergent insoluble regions (so-called &#x0201c;rafts&#x0201d;) were discovered in cell membranes (<a href="#B5" class="cite-reflink bibr">5</a>). Improving the understanding of bilayer solubilization and mixed micelle formation is therefore
