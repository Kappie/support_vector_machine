egulations require that all air kerma measuring instruments be calibrated to a NIST-traceable standard, but don&rsquo;t specify the target-filter combination to be used. Currently, all air kerma measuring instruments are typically calibrated in the mammography kVp range using only one target-filter combination, such as Molybdenum/Molybdenum (Mo/Mo), even if the instrument is used with other combinations such as W/Ag or W/Rh. In addition, NIST currently does not provide calibration standards for W/Ag or W/Rh
