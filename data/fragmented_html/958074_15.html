century art.&nbsp; I have a liking for the impressionist school and my friend from Marshall, Dr. John Horack likes the pointellists so I thought this would be a good place to improve my art appreciation.&nbsp; The museum is housed in a converted 19th century train station and I must say that the building itself is as much a work of art as anything inside.&nbsp; I am fascinated by trains and railroads and looking at this wonderful structure was great.&nbsp;
