with gray walls compared with tanks with white, yellow
or green walls. A diffuse light source and a flat black or gray tank color is
helpful to reduce reflection of the light from the tank walls. Survival in my
laboratory was generally poor until turbid water was used. Artificial
turbidity was developed by addition of a small volume of a clay slurry. Some
hatcheries have naturally turbid water (15-25 NTS) from colloidal clay that is
not removed by rapid sand filtration.</p>
