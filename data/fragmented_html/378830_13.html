ds of laboratory experiments and direct measurements, millions of balloon observations and trillions of satellites data bits, that the basic structure of the energy flows in and out of the earth's atmosphere are relatively well understood. We know that water vapor, carbon dioxide, or methane trap enough energy on the earth to warm the surface up about 33 degrees C (60 degrees F) relative to that which would occur in their absence. <P>

This well known natural greenhouse effect is not under dispute, and ha
