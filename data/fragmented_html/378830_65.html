However, such a very complicated coupled system like an ESM is likely to have unanticipated results when forced to change very rapidly by external disturbances like CO2 and aerosols. Indeed, some of the transient models run out for hundreds of years exhibit dramatic change to the basic climate state (e.g., radical change in global ocean currents). Thompson and Schneider (1982) used very simplified transient models to investigate the question of whether the time evolving patterns of climate change might depe
