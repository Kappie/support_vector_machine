tension is usually sufficient to support small particles of feed as well as
bacteria and fungi. If the fry ingest surface film or partially decomposed feed
that is heavily contaminated with microbes, feed and microbes may be aspirated
into the gas bladder on the microfilm surrounding the air bubble. Although gas

epithelial lining of the gas bladder will lead to dysfunction of the gas gland,
