eneral geometry exemplified by the STM experiment in Fig.&nbsp;3,
additional factors must be considered in connecting the polarization of the detected
light to the electron spin density in the semiconductor: i) the angle of the light
emitted in the GaAs with respect to the quantization axis; and ii) the change in
circular polarization of the light passing through the interface.

<p>The ratio of the emitted light polarization to the electron spin density,
depends on the optical matrix elements a
