Numerous attempts to grow these viruses in cell culture or to develop animal models for the study of infection and disease have failed. The overall goals of this research program are to establish the role of these viruses as agents of human diarrheal disease and to develop experimental systems for study of the molecular basis for viral replication and pathogenicity. </p>
<p>Recent breakthroughs include the development of new diagnostic assays that use recombinant virus-like particles derived from expressio
