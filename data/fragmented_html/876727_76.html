f the major strike-slip faults [e.g., <I>Hill et al.</I>, 1990], 
  the correlation between clamping and low post-Loma Prieta earthquake rates at 
  shallow depth (Figures 9,10) might be fortuitous. However, in the few cases 
  where the Loma Prieta earthquake was calculated to have unclamped the shallower 
  parts of the faults, the resulting seismicity approaches the surface (i.e., 
  the Sargent fault, Figure 9). </P>
