ted over dry ice for 24 hr after a single po 500 mg/kg dose of (l4)C citral. Elimination in urine was rapid, with approximately 50% of the dose excreted within 24 hr. Citral was rapidly metabolized and excreted as metabolites, including several acids and a biliary glucuronide. Seven urinary metabolites were isolated and identified: 3-hydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenedioic acid; 3,8-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenolc acid; 3,9-dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-6-octenolc acid; E- and Z-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadienedioic acid;
