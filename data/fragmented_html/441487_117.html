 of seeds and that the conditions necessary for regeneration
were rather exacting. Wherever fires, intense or not, burn through
sequoia groves, they set back plant succession and to some degree help
regeneration of sequoias and other early-stage trees. The sequoia's
successful reproduction depends on distribution of undamaged seeds and
success in seedling development. Because its competitive strength is
roughly commensurate with that of the other early-stage trees, neither
the sequoia nor the others
