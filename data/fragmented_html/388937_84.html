pholipid concentration 2.5 mM) were injected at 30&#x000b0;C into the sample cell of the ITC instrument containing 1.41 ml of an aqueous 10 mM C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> solution, which corresponds to an 1,120-fold molar excess of the detergent for the first injection. Virtually the same integrated heat values (in terms of kcal/mol of phospholipid injected) were consumed in each titration step when 20 injections were performed, except for the first injection, which usually gave artifactual results (compare
