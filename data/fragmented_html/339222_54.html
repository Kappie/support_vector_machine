 forms in animal manure is a challenge due to their susceptibility to hydrolysis. In this study, we enzymatically characterized P forms in dairy feces under mild assay conditions. Fresh dairy feces collected from a representative dairy farm in New York was separated into soluble and residual components. The hydrolyzable organic P was then characterized by enzymatic hydrolysis to simple monoester P, polynucleotide P, phytate-like P, and nonhydrolyzable P. In the water extracts, 77% was inorganic P, 11% hydro
