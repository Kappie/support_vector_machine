 two-talker babble and steady-state noise had a duration of 2.0&nbsp;s. The 12-alternative forced-choice task used one-up, one-down adaptive tracking, converging on 50% correct. The level of the target speech was 65&nbsp;dBA. The noise level was varied with a step size of 2&nbsp;dB. Feedback was not provided. The threshold was estimated by averaging the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the final 10 of 14 reversals. As in experiment 1, 29 subjects completed six test runs. Sixteen of those subjects completed t
