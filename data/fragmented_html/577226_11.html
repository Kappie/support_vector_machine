 But the particle is MUCH smaller than the cloud/ice/snow particle.  When light passes through the crystal, it is reflected or bent (refracted) by the cloud or ice particle, which makes it appear white to an observer.  Therefore, what makes the contrail look white is the water (frozen into a crystal), rather than the exhaust particle.  Note that sometimes the optical effects through these crystals can also produce colors, much like rainbows in water drops.  You will only see these when the Sun-crystal-you g
