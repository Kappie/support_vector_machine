haracterized.  Antigenic analysis using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against bovine viral diarrhea genotype 1 (BVDV1) and bovine viral diarrhea genotype 2 (BVDV2) suggested this virus was antigenically related but distinct from both BVDV genotypes. Genomic characteristics, unique to pestiviruses, indicated that this virus belongs to the Pestivirus genus.  These characteristics included the organization of the 5' untranslated region (UTR), the presence and length of a viral N**pro coding regio
