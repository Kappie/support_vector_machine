   Is packed with meat and bread,<br>
              And they growler's rushed all day long--<br>
              Only poked beneath the bed<br>
              When we see the folks a-comin&rsquo;<br>
              To ask us what we need,<br>
              Then we whine and tell our story<br>
              Of 'Many mouths to feed&rsquo;;<br>
&ldquo;No<sub> </sub>work--all sick and freezin&rsquo;&quot; <br>
&ldquo;Landlord like to put us out.&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;I tell you it is pleasin&rsquo;;<br>
