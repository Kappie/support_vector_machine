Similar to the approach used by Fisher and Johnson (2006) and Skinner (1987) to impute consumption, we impute total PSID expenditure from a regression model estimated with CE data where
explanatory variables include expenditures in each category measured in the PSID. The R-squared from the imputation model was 0.88. The estimates from the model are reported in Table A3.</p>
<p>The profiles imply spending of roughly $30,000 per year in the late twenties, increasing to $42,000-45,000 in the mid-forties. Oth
