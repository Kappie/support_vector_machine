ry (FABMS). FABMS analysis revealed a mass spectrum distinctly different from that obtained for the cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1, 3-glucans. For example, it has previously been shown that a typical mass spectrum for purified cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan contains predominant molecular ion species (&#x0005b;M-H)<sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x0005d; at <em>m/z</em> values of 1,619, 1,781, 1,943, and 2,005 (<a href="#B23" class="cite-reflink bibr">23</a>), which correspond to unsubstituted cyclic gluca
