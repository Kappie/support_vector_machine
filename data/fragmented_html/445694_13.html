rmalized by dividing it by the ratio of the counts achieved 
in free air at each measuring time to the counts achieved in free air for the 
first measuring time (to account for inherent variability in the X-ray 
source).  In the graphs which follow, these normalized counts have been divided 
by one thousand producing values generally between 70 and 140.  In some 
cases, differential density (counts) profiles have been produced by 
subtracting the 3 h absorption values at each spatial location from 
all subs
