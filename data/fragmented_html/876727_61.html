 friction coefficients, similar to the results 
  for the southern Hayward and San Gregorio faults in the San Francisco Bay area.

<P><B>4.1.4. Test of association between stress and seismicity 
  changes.</b> This discussion has so far relied on visual spatial associations 
  between calculated stress changes and seismicity rate changes, which indicate 
  that seismicity rates on major right-lateral strike-slip faults are more sensitive 
  to changes in the shear stress component than in the normal st
