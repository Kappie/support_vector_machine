ategories of weapons, such as 100-millimeter
guns.  The U.N. I think will explain in greater detail what exactly is
the definition of the heavy weapons that need to be withdrawn.  I don't
have that at the tip of my tongue.  But the U.N. is defining the
conditions, not the Bosnian Serbs.  And we expect to see a full
withdrawal of the categories of weapons that the U.N. lays down.  We
also expect them to get all weapons that could threaten the safety of
planes coming into the airport out of range as well.
