Control titrations with 2.5 mM C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> in the syringe (without phospholipid) yielded a small exothermic heat of 0.08 kcal/mol, which was neglected in the data evaluation. The samples were degassed at 3 kPa under stirring before measurement.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell"
