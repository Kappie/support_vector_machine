-dipole transitions between them. The
measurements show that the frequency variation of the 3.1-MHz transition in Dy-163 and the 235-MHz transition in Dy-162 are essentially
consistent with zero and provide an upper limit on the magnitude of fractional variation of \alpha (without any assumptions on the constancy of
other fundamental constants) at the level of 5.6 10^{-15} per year (one sigma). This is short by a factor of ~3 from the presently best
laboratory limit obtained with optical-frequency combs but
