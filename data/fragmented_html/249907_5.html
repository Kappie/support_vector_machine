irement for new devices and devices that are significant modifications of
already marketed devices is set forth in section 510(k) of the Act. Devices determined by
FDA to be &quot;substantially equivalent&quot; are often referred to as &quot;510(k)
devices&quot;. If the new device is deemed not to be substantially equivalent to a
pre-amendments device, it must undergo clinical testing and premarket approval before it
can be marketed unless it is reclassified into a lower regulatory class. </p>
