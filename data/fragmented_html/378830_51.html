mpounds like chlorofluorocarbons are also greenhouse gases. The extent to which they are important to climate depends upon their atmospheric concentrations, the rates of change of those concentrations and their effects on depletion of stratospheric ozone --which in turn, can indirectly modify the radiative forcing of the lower atmosphere thus changing climate -- currently offsetting a considerable fraction of the otherwise expected greenhouse warming signal.<P>

The earth's temperature, then, is primarily
