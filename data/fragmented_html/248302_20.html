levels of factors that predict these changes) 
using two approaches: hypothesis-based analyses of specified clusters 
that are thought to be regulated by a putative common aging mechanism, 
and hypothesis-generating analyses to identify clusters that may 
suggest a possible common cause.  Comparisons of longitudinal data from 
diverse populations to distinguish aging changes that are shared among 
them from those specific to one or a few populations may help in 
distinguishing common fundamental agin
