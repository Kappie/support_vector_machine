ilitates the identification of the maximum intensity location of the beam slice.
<Li> Finally, the two black-and-white plots, show the number of reconstructed vertices per unit of lenght along
     the Z direction (beam direction is left to right). 
  <Ul>
   <Li> The top plot uses reconstructed vertices of <b>any</B> multiplicity, so two-track vertices (mostly due
        to e<sup>+</sup>e<sup>-</sup> pairs, which make almost parallel tracks in the microvertex) contribute 
        with badly determined Z p
