But we are at least at the point where the last remaining questions are well defined.  The most recent research results are beginning to firm up the notion that previous approaches to ozone reduction have been inadequate.  New approaches are being considered.  The DOE Atmospheric Chemistry Program (ACP) is one of the leading research programs in this field.  The field m
