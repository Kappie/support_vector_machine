= (0.2 nm)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> is observed in SAXS at all temperatures, which is compatible with scattering from micelles. In the WAXS regime, which is indicative of the ordering of the aliphatic chains of the lipids, a strong reflection is observed in both samples below the main transition temperature <em>t</em><sub>m</sub>. Above <em>t</em><sub>m</sub>, a broad reflection centered at smaller angles remains. The behavior of the WAXS reflection in both samples is typical for what is known from pure lipids
