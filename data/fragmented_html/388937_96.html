 the intramicellar chain ordering as a function of micelle composition, titrations were carried out for a broad range of detergent/phospholipid molar ratios. Samples were prepared so as to keep the total phospholipid concentration constant at 2.5 mM for all mixtures. Again, the titrations were performed at 30&#x000b0;C and 13&#x000b0;C for DPPC and DMPC, respectively. The results summarized in Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=55352&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F5" class="fig-table-link " onclick="star
