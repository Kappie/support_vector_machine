such deterministic predictability, as winter reliably follows summer and the cause and effect is known with certainty. <P>

Grids and Parameterization. The other answer to the imperfection of general circulation model simulations, even for long-term averages, is that nobody knows how to solve those six complex mathematical equations exactly. It's not like an algebraic equation where one can get the exact solution by a series of simple operations. There isn't any known mathematical technique to solve such
