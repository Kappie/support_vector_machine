 a topic of considerable interest.<p>Detergents from the poly(oxyethylene) series have found widespread application in membrane biochemistry, owing to their inoffensiveness toward membrane proteins (<a href="#B6" class="cite-reflink bibr">6</a>). Commonly used members of this class of nonionic amphiphiles are Triton X-100 (&#x0005b;<em>p</em>-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenyl&#x0005d;poly(oxyethylene)) and C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> (octaethyleneglycol-mono-<em>n</em>-dodecyl ether).
