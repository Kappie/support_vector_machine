tures of 24-to 72-hour-old KC were infected with HIV 1 (isolate LAV 1- Bru). RESULTS: In 3 different experiments syncytia detectable under optical microscopy appeared between 4 and 10 days. EM observations showed typical viral particles released either in vacuoles or outside the cell as well as characteristic budding figures. Except from the syncytia, no obvious cytopathic effect could be found. Furthermore, a reverse transcriptase activity increasing with the time of infection was demonstrated in the super
