	I want to thank all of you 37ers for a wonderful weekend.  You reflected God to me 
in so many ways.  As I told you Sunday, that 
weekend really changed my life.  I pray that as 
you continue to go forth the light of Christ will 
burn in your hearts.

	"Be on your guard, stand firm in the faith, be courageous, be strong.  Your every act 
should be done in love."  -1 Cor 16:13-14
