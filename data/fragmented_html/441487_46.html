<P ALIGN="justify">The chickaree, (Fig. 34) is far from an exclusive devotee of the
sequoia groves; it is in fact a resident of coniferous forests extending
from the southern Sierra and San Francisco regions northward through the
Cascades into Canada and Alaska. Its close cousin, the red squirrel,
ranges from eastern Washington southward and eastward across the United
States and Canada to the eastern seaboard.</P>
