 The clinicians `JBG, JLH' incorporated  ultrasensitive PCR assays into practice on 9/1/98. For patients  on HAART whose PCR remained &gt;400 copies, HAART was not intensified  even though HIV was detectable by more sensitive assays. Patients  who had PCR values &gt;400 with at least one 2nd generation assay  performed between 9/1/98 and 3/30/99 were studied. 95 patients  were divided into two cohorts. Cohort I `n = 54' was below detection  levels by both 1st and 2nd generation PCR. Cohort II `n = 41'  was
