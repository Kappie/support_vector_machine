hgrass are being monitored on several experiments at different 
							locations and on different sites. These experiments include different varieties 
							of switchgrass, different row spacings, and different harvest frequencies. 
							Specifically, soil cores are being taken every 2-3 years to a depth of bedrock, 
							or 3.3 m. Measurements include root mass at different depths, carbon 
							mineralization, microbial biomass carbon, carbon turnover, and organic carbon. </FONT>
