ory of the major vertical strike-slip 
  faults and the oblique faults in the southern Santa Clara Valley near the San 
  Andreas, Hayward, and Calaveras faults. To generate a three-dimensional fault 
  model, we applied an iterative process of projecting the simplest possible fault 
  planes that fit input geological data (Figure 2). Fault traces with known Quaternary 
  activity were digitized from geologic maps and dips constrained by structure-sections 
  or seismic velocity models when available [<I>Ay
