evaluation for their potentialto rupture or move by creep. In general, faults that moved during last ~10,000years are considered to have potential for rupture. Concealed faults canbe defined by geophysical studies. Cracks that formed during 1993 may havebeen caused by creep on several faults as a result of increased force onthose faults after the Landers earthquake in the southern Mojave Desert.Although the cracking is unlikely to disrupt most facilities, it could disruptsensitive communications line
