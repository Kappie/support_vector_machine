 to thrust directed slip. Aftershocks 
  with left-lateral and normal fault plane solutions did occur after the Loma 
  Prieta earthquake, but comprised only 14% of the total [e.g., <I>Zoback and 
  Beroza</I>, 1993]. </P>
<P>To illustrate the variations in calculated stress changes and 
  seismicity, we show in Figures 9 and 10 two examples of the most important faults 
  from the southern Santa Clara Valley thrust belt, the Sargent and Berrocal faults. 
  The faults are shown with the clamped parts shaded
