 populations where gastric cancer incidence is  low despite high <em>H. pylori </em>prevalence are characterized by  Th2-dominant immune responses. We are determining Th1/Th2 using novel IgG1/IgG2 <em>H. pylori</em>-specific subclass antibodies. This analysis will be  completed in FY2007. To further test the pro-inflammatory hypothesis, in  FY2007-2008 we plan to obtain residual serum samples for Th1/Th2 responses  (IgG1/IgG2 <em>H. pylori</em>-specific subclass antibodies) from subjects with  and without e
