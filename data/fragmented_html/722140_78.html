s case. Sarcomatous (or sarcomatoid) mesothelioma (15-20%) may in turn simulate sarcomas originating from connectival tissue (e.g., fibrosarcoma). The only pathognomonic phenotype is the mixed (or biphasic) mesothelioma (20-30%), where epithelioid and sarcomatoid tissues coexist. Histologic diagnosis of rare morphologic variants (e.g., small-cell, desmoplastic, or lymphohistiocytoid mesothelioma) may also be problematic (Attanoos and Gibbs 1997; Sugarbaker et al. 2002).
