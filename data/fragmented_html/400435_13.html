ernburg, Phillips, and their colleagues  identified the function of a <em>C.&nbsp;elegans</em> protein called HIM-8. This protein binds to and helps bring together copies of  the worm's sex chromosome (the X chromosome) to achieve stable pairing, called  synapsis. Now Dernburg and Phillips have found three new genes, which they have  named <em>zim-1</em>, <em>zim-2</em>, and <em>zim-3</em>, that  perform the same functions for the worm's five additional chromosomes. Their  results are published in the Decem
