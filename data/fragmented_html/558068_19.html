 target-filter combinations in the mammography kVp range. It is well known that the energy response is typically flat in the 20-40 kVp range for ionization chamber-based air kerma measuring instruments. For solid state air kerma measuring instruments, however, the energy response is not flat, and readings from such instruments require appropriate corrections. Means of correction may already be incorporated internally by the instrument or may be obtained from the instrument manufacturer. <strong>Consequently
