 large amount of scientific results are accumulating.
In the International Year of Astronomy 2009,
it is our hope to harvest them, and assemble them into novel
research paradigms that innovate our view of The Energetic Cosmos.<p>

These attempts will further strengthen the ASTRO-H (previously known
as NeXT) project, Suzaku's successor, which is making a steady
progress toward its launch around 2013. Our scope also includes
NuStar and Simbol-X, and further extends to the genuine one-world
X-ray mission, IXO.
