the fault zone, 
  preventing hydrofracing. <I>Lockner and Byerlee</I> [1995] and <I>Miller et

  within the fault zone; slip on the fault transfers the fluid into new cells.

<P>All the models discussed above incorporate the idea that impermeable 
  fault gouge traps fluids inside the fault. Observational and experimental data 
  indicate that as slip increases, faults develop a thick, impermeable gouge layer
