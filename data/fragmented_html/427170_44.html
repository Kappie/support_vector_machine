tion at the lowest doses and a reduction in body weight minus uterine weight at term at the highest doses indicated that citral was maternally toxic over the dose range tested.

Doses higher than 125 mg/kg reduced dose-dependently the ratio of pregnant per mated female. Signs of fetal growth retardation and a higher incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities were found
