<P><B>Abstract. </b>We present a new three-dimensional inventory of the southern 
  San Francisco Bay area faults and use it to calculate stress applied principally 
  by the 1989 M=7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake, and to compare fault seismicity rates 
  before and after 1989. The major high-angle right-lateral faults exhibit a different 
  response to the stress change than do minor oblique (right-lateral/thrust) faults.
