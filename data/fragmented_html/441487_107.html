l stage until at the climax
stage of succession it comes into dynamic balance with the final
breakdown of organic matter, and the soil depth becomes stabilized.
Because of topographical variation, both plant successional and soil
developmental sequences also vary greatly within short distances. This,
coupled with set-backs by fire and erosion, forms both a mosaic of soil
conditions and of plant community structure which thus gives the
impression of a variety of climax plant associations. These are th
