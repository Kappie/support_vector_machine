reviously explained by 
  <I>Simpson and Reasenberg</I> [1994]. We found that for normal-stress calculations, 
  the differences between the various Loma Prieta slip models were very small 
  (Figure 3). No difference between the source models is detectable at distances 
  greater than 50 km. All calculations assumed a Poisson's ratio of 0.25 and a 
  shear modulus of <IMG SRC="/research/deformation/modeling/papers/baystress/Image28.gif" WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=14> 
  bars for the elastic upper crust. </P>
