The Ice Age, which at its maximum some 20,000 years ago was about 5 degrees to 7 degrees C (around 100F) colder than our current global climate, disappeared in, what is to nature, a relatively rapid period of about five to ten thousand years. The average rate of temperature change from the Ice Age to the current 10,000 year period of re
