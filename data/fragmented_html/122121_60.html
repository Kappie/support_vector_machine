alcids must not only be impervious 
                to the cold, but they must have sharp eyes. Alcids are difficult 
                to spot as they bob among the waves, only to dive and stay under 
                water before the boat can approach close enough to get a decent 
                view. The fact that alcids spotted during the winter are often 
                immatures or in their winter plumage makes distinguishing the 
                species especially challenging. </font></p>
