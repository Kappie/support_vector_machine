 capacity and thus a larger seasonal cycle of surface temperature. How well do the climate models do in reproducing this change? The answer is "extraordinarily well." Although what the absolute temperatures models may simulate can be off by as much as five or six degrees in some regions of the world for some seasons, the models' capacity to reproduce the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of surface air temperatures, by and large, is quite good. (It is less good for other variables, however, particularly hydro
