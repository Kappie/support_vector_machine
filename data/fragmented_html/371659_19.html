r (possibly degenerate) ellipse.
<P>
 
   Since many geometric computations involving ellipses and ellipsoids may
   be greatly simplified by judicious application of linear transformations
   to ellipses, it is useful to have a representation for ellipses that
   allows ready computation of their images under such mappings.
