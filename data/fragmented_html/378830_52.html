 determined by the planetary radiation balance, through which the absorbed portion of the incoming solar radiation is nearly exactly balanced over a year's time by the outgoing terrestrial infrared radiation emitted by the climatic system to earth. As both of these quantities are determined by the properties of the atmosphere and the earth's surface, major climate theories that address changes in those properties have been constructed. Many of these remain plausible hypotheses of climatic change. Certainly
