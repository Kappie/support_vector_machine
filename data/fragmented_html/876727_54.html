explain some of the seismicity increase.

<P><B>4.1.3. The San Andreas fault in southern California. </b> 
  We examined the seismicity rate change on the San Andreas fault after the 23 
  April 1992 M=6.1 Joshua Tree, and the 28 June M=7.4 Landers and M=6.5 Big Bear 
  earthquakes in southern California. We applied the same procedures to calculate 
  stress changes and plot a statistical seismicity rate ratio calculation [<I>Matthe
