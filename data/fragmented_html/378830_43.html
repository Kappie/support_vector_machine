m up until the oceans boiled. We know the oceans are not boiling, and surface thermometers plus satellites have shown that the earth's temperature remains roughly constant from year to year (the interannual globally-averaged variability of about 0.2 C or the 0.5 C warming trend in the 20th century, notwithstanding). This near constancy requires that about as much radiant energy leaves the planet each year in some form as is coming in. In other words, a near-equilibrium or energy balance has been established
