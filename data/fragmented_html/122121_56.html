atest nightmare. An oil spill 
                in the wrong place could wipe out entire colonies, putting a severe 
                dent in the world population. For example, 90% of all Common Murres 
                nest in only three colonies in Canada. By increasing the number 
                of nesting colonies, conservationists hope to lessen the impact 
                of localized disasters such as oil spills. </font></p>
