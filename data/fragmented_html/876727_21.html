lique (right-lateral, 
reverse) slip that occurs near a bend in the San Andreas fault [e.g., <I>Aydin 
and Page</I>, 1984] (Figure 1). A similar group of oblique faults is clustered 
near the southern Hayward and Calaveras faults, east of the San Andreas fault. 
Cumulatively, these zones of crustal shear accommodate about 40-50 mm yr-1 of 
relative motion between the Pacific and North American plates [e.g., <I>De Mets 
et al.</I>, 1990; <I>Kelson et al.</I>, 1992].
