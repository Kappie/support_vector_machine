   CENTER    +    cos(theta) * V1    +    sin(theta) * V2,

   then the image of E under the transformation represented by M is

   M*CENTER    +    cos(theta) * M*V1    +    sin(theta) * M*V2.

   If we accept that the first set of points is an ellipse, then we can see
   that the image of an ellipse under a linear transformation is always
