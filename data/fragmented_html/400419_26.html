ositive, and the polarization of the
conductivity is negative. Just the opposite is true for Co and Ni where the
polarization of the Fermi level density of states is negative while the
polarization of the conductivity is positive. As can be seen, relating the spin
polarization measured in the semiconductor to spin-dependent materials
properties of the ferromagnet is by no means trivial and in general can only be
inferred via a model dependent calculation.
