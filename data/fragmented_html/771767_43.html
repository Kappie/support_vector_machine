formulated feed in the extensive-intensive culture procedure or stocked in cages
should be checked for gas bladder inflation. In my research on intensive culture
of walleye, gas bladder inflation is examined in fish samples from all culture
tanks at weekly intervals from 7 to 28 days. At least 30 days, and 1.1 in,
walleye are quite transparent and the gas bladder easy to observe. Fry are
observed in a petri dish on a dissecting microscope, using transmitted light
with 6-7 x magnification.</p>
