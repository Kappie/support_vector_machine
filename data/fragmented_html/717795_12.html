ve polymer layer on the substrate surface 
        of the via. A cleaner/conditioner step coats the glass and epoxy surfaces 
        in the through-holes with a water-soluble organic film. A permanganate 
        catalyst solution then deposits manganese dioxide (MnO2) on the organic 
        film (through oxidation). This only occurs on the film-coated glass and 
        epoxy surfaces. Polymerization takes place when a conductive polymer solution 
        containing the pyrrole monomer is applied t
