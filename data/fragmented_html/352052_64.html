05D1 is enzymatically active in vivo and in vitro </span> The catalytic activities of recombinant CYP105D1 were measured using a whole-cell biotransformation procedure and with isolated periplasmic fractions expressing CYP105D1. No activity was seen from <em>E. coli</em> TB1 harboring the empty plasmid pLiQ. The ability of the isolated periplasmic fraction to sustain the xenobiotic transformation in <em>E. coli</em> (Table <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=92847&amp;rendertype=table&amp;id=T1" class="fig-ta
