tems must be operated at low temperatures that reduce their efficiency and require reheating the saturated, cold air to achieve some degree of comfort. Both consequences are costly. Thermally driven air-conditioning systems, however, can supplement conventional air conditioners. By working together, they tackle the temperature and humidity loads separately and more efficiently. HVAC designers can then reduce compressor size and eliminate excess chiller capacity. Large-scale deployment of new power and HVAC
