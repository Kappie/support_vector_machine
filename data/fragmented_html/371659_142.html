istortion map ensures that the original
plane maps to a second plane (whose formula is easily calculated). The
ellipsoid maps to the unit sphere. The intersection of a plane and a unit
sphere is easily found. The inverse distortion map is then applied to the
circle of intersection (when the intersection is non-trivial), and the
ellipse of intersection of the original plane and ellipsoid results. This
procedure is used in the SPICELIB routine <a href="../spicelib/inedpl.html">INEDPL</a>.
