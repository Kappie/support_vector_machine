   There is one problem solving technique used in SPICELIB ellipse and
   ellipsoid routines that is so useful that it deserves special mention:
   using a `distortion map' to solve intersection problems.
<P>
 
   The distortion map (as it is referred to in SPICELIB routines) is simply
   a linear transformation that maps an ellipsoid to the unit sphere. The
   distortion ma
