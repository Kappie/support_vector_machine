es a grey level frequency table (histogram) of the input 
image.  The histogram has 65536 bins, hence spans the entire halfword
range from -32768 to +32767.

If <A HREF="fit_level2.html#exclude">EXCLUDE</A>=(N1,N2) is specified, the histogram is modified by setting:

	H(I) = 0 for N1 &lt= I <= N2

In addition, the histogram is modified by setting the low-saturation DN
to zero.  If the input image contains negative DN values, the low-saturation
DN is assumed to be -32768.  If not, then the low-saturation DN
