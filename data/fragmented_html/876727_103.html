 is developed parallel to slip 
  and pore fluids can thus be envisioned occupying long, crack-like spaces along 
  the fault plane. In this case the crack responds primarily to the stresses acting 
  normal to it [e.g., <I>Scholz</I>, 1990]. For fluid-filled cracks, Skempton&#146;s 
  coefficient (<IMG SRC="/research/deformation/modeling/papers/baystress/Image35.gif" WIDTH=9 HEIGHT=15>) 
  is approximately equal to 1 [<I>Scholz</I>, 1990] and because shear stresses 
  are not contributing to pore pressure
