rious climate forcing scenarios and/or various assumptions about the internal dynamics of both climate and impact models.<P>

Sensitivity studies are essential. It is unlikely that all important uncertainties in either climatic or impact models will be resolved to the satisfaction of the bulk of the scientific community in the near future. However, this does not imply that model results are uninformative. On the contrary, sensitivity analyses in which various policy-driven alternative radiative forcing as
