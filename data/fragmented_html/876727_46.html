  80-150 km [e.g., <I>Hall</I>, 1991]. Seismic surveys conducted offshore show 
  a steeply northeast dipping fault zone [e.g., <I>Mullins and Nagel</I>, 1982; 
  <I>Lewis</I>, 1990]. <I>Jachens and Griscom</I> [1998] used aeromagnetic data 
  to model the dip of the San Gregorio fault at 50û-60û northeast. <I>Anderson

  and found that a 70û northeast dipping San Gr
