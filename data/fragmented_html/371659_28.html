V</a> ( ELLIPS, CENTER, V1, V2 )
</PRE>
   On output, V1 will be a semi-major axis vector for the ellipse
   represented by ELLIPS, and V2 will be a semi-minor axis vector.
   Semi-axis vectors are never unique; if X is a semi-axis vector; then so
   is -X.
<P>
 
   V1 is a vector of maximum norm extending from the ellipse's center to
   the ellipse itself; V2 is an analogous vector of minimum norm. V1 and V2
   are orthogonal vectors.
