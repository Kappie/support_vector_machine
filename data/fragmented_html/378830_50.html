leading to an amplifying or "positive" feedback process known as the "water vapor-surface temperature-greenhouse feedback." The latter is believed responsible for the bulk of the climate sensitivity (IPCC, 1996a). Carbon dioxide is another major greenhouse gas. Although it absorbs and re-emits considerably less infrared radiation than water vapor, CO2 is of intense interest because its concentration is increasing due to human activities. Ozone, nitrogen oxides, some hydrocarbons, and even some artificial co
