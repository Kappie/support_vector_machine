P>Each block was labelled and weighed (to &#177; 0.01 g) before the 
cement paste was added.  The masses of the cement paste-filled blocks 
were determined initially and periodically throughout the exposure period.  
The blocks were located sequentially on a holder (an inverted Lego 
base element) placed at a fixed location within the X-ray chamber.  
After specific periods of exposure, the X-ray system was used to scan 
vertically (in 0.2 mm increments) a distance of either 8 mm (Legos) or 20 mm
