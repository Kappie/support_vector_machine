ated as a positive quantity. There is an apparent 
  correlation between the component of stress normal to the fault elements and 
  the most earthquakes. (b) The average number of earthquakes during the 7 years 
  after the Loma Prieta earthquake per fault element plotted against calculated 
  post Loma Prieta right-lateral shear stress changes. More events are observed 
  where increased right-lateral stresses were imposed than where left-lateral 
  stresses (negative stress change). (c) The average numbe
