penetration by roots, an effect that Meinecke believed very important.
However, field studies of sequoia growth patterns revealed no sequoias
tending toward death as a result, but rather
an increased average annual growth rate of almost all
sequoias growing in such soils. The soil profile of areas subject to
extensive foot traffic showed a soil moisture regime almost universally
more favorable than that in untrampled soils. Compaction
