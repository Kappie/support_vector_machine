ing produce analgesia to transient noxious stimuli in infant rats and humans. The present study evaluated the pain-modulating effects of sucrose and suckling in a rat model of persistent pain and hyperalgesia that mimics the response to tissue injury in humans. Fore- and hindpaw withdrawal latencies from a 30&#x000b0; or 48&#x000b0;C brass stylus were determined in 10-day-old rats following paw inflammation induced by complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant (CFA; 1:1 injected s.c. in a 0.01 ml volume).
