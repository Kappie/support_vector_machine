rock bursting while, at the same time, allowing increased mechanization of mining operations.^Instruments were specifically manufactured to monitor three geomechanical factors (backfill performance, ramp stability, and rock mass response) that directly affect the success of the stope design.^Despite considerable difficulties with instrument installation and survival in the harsh mine environment, especially within the stope fill, sufficient information was collected to suggest that the LFUL method was succe
