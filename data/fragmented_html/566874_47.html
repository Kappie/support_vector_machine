CPO was ordering the driver to stop when the accelerating Ford Excursion struck the CPO and a parked vehicle that the CPO was trapped against. The driver put the vehicle in reverse and then forward and accelerated in the direction of a second CPO. Both CPOs fired shots at the driver. The driver was struck at least once and crashed the vehicle into a neighboring residence. Customs officers gained control of the combative driver and seized the marijuana-laden vehicle. <p class="p"/><p class="p"/><p class="p"/
