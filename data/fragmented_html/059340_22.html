However, at this time there is an increase in the labelling of cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA, even though there is decreased labelling of total polyribosomal RNA. The decrease in labelling of nucleolar and total polyribosomal RNA owing to phenobarbital is a transient phenomenon. Under similar conditions, 3-methylcholanthrene has no effect on n
