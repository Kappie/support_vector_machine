><p>Analysis of the 663<img src="corehtml/pmc/pmcents/thinsp.gif" border="0" alt=" " />bp D-loop sequence and the complete <em>Cyt b</em> gene revealed 71 and 36 distinct haplotypes, respectively. Sixty-nine polymorphic sites were detected in the D-loop sequence, corresponding to one indel and 68 SNPs. Within the <em>Cyt b</em> gene 45 polymorphic sites were found, all SNPs.</p><p>NJ trees obtained independently from D-loop and <em>Cyt b</em> haplotypes (<a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=1559946&amp;rendert
