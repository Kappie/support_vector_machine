ry correction for your kVp reading (as described in Scenario 2 for kVp Measurements). Since such instrument&rsquo;s HVL and dose values will not be correct, in order to estimate the dose you will need to use the corrected kVp value with a nominal HVL value from the appropriate dose conversion table that is provided in the FFDM manufacturer&rsquo;s QC manual. You may then enter the estimated results in the MEE or medical physicist survey report. If the estimated dose is above 2.7 milligray (270 mrad), you ne
