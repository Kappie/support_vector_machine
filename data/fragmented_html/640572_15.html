<p>BRCA1 and BRCA2 belong to a class of genes called tumor suppressors.  Both genes encode proteins that help to repair damaged chromosomes.  With a mutation in the genes, the proteins cannot perform this job effectively and, therefore, genetic damage persists that may give way to uncontrolled cell growth, also known as cancer.  BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are also well known for their association with breast cancer.    </p>
