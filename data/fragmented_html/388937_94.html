o the detergent solution. It has been shown previously that this enthalpy is smaller than that of the chain-melting transition at least by an order of magnitude (<a href="#B18" class="cite-reflink bibr">18</a>). Titration of a C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/POPC mixture (1:2 mol/mol) at 30&#x000b0;C into a 10 mM solution of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> yielded a negligible enthalpy, indicating that the POPC dilution does not involve a chain-melting transition (Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=55352&amp;re
