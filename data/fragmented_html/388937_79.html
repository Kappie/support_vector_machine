integrating the entire DSC traces showed that the total enthalpy tended to zero with increasing molar ratio. Eventually, DSC signals were no longer detectable, which points at the formation of ordinary micelles with a disordered hydrocarbon core (<a href="#B15" class="cite-reflink bibr">15</a>) when the detergent/phospholipid molar ratio became &#x02265;4.  </p><div style="margin: 1em; margin-right: 2em;        border: 1px solid #999999;border-left: 1px solid #AAAAAA;border-bottom: 1px solid #AAAAAA;"><div
