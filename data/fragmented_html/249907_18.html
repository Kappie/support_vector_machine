ignificant risk (SR) to study subjects or others. If so, the
sponsor obtains an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from FDA. If the sponsor
believes the device does not impart significant risk, IRB approval of a study as an NSR

anticipated risk to human subjects did not justify the involvement of FDA. If the IRB
agrees that the study is NSR, no submission to or review by FDA is necessary before
starting studies
