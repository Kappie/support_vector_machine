 solely by &#x003b2;-1,2 glycosidic bonds, whereas in <em>Bradyrhizobium</em> species, these molecules are linked by both &#x003b2;-1,3 and &#x003b2;-1,6 glycosidic bonds. The cyclic &#x003b2;-glucans are localized within the periplasmic compartment of these bacteria, but they are also released into the medium. Indeed, we have previously shown that <em>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</em> cultures excrete relatively high levels of cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans into the culture medium, with levels appr
