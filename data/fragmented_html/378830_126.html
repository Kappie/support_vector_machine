f degrees is primarily because of natural experiments such as ice ages, volcanoes and seasonal cycles, as well as other technical questions dealing with theory and modeling (see IPCC 1996a for details). Nevertheless, a few have asserted, some with very high confidence, that global warming from CO2 doubling would only cause a few tenths of a degree C equilibrium temperature rise, and even have argued that certain processes that they can name, but cannot demonstrate to have global scale effects, would be resp
