   ocean bottom organisms. The calcification rate of nearly all calcium-secreting
        organisms investigated to date decreased in response to decreased carbonate
        ion concentration. This response holds across multiple taxonomic groups
        from single-celled organisms to reef-building corals. In general, when
        dissolved CO<span class="smaller">2</span> was increased to two times pre-industrial levels,
        a decrease in the calcification rate was observed, ranging from -5 to
