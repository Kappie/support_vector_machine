matrix corresponding to a given collection of aligned DNA sequences. This
matrix can then be used to calculate evolutionary distances between pairs
of sequences in the collection. Our algorithms are designed for fast execution
times, even on large data sets. In a test case on a primate pseudogene,
the matrix we arrived at resembles one obtained using maximum likelihood,
and the resulting distance measure is shown to have better linearity than
obtained in a less general model.</I></P>
