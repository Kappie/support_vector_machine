, San Gregorio and San Andreas faults 
  are consistent with other studies that concluded that the broader San Andreas 
  fault zone is weak [e.g., <I>Lachenbruch and Sass</I>; 1980; <I>Zoback</I>, 
  1991; <I>Reasenberg and Simpson</I>, 1992; <I>Miller</I>, 1996]. We find that 
  the application of a frictional failure criterion to these faults does not require 
  a compaction weakening model. Instead, the relative insensitivity of these faults 
  to changes in normal stress with respect to shear stress ch
