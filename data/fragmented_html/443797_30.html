s from the region that
the Serbs will be permitted to keep 82- and 100-millimeter mortars --
and I assume the reason for that is they're so small they couldn't be
detected anyway -- and antiaircraft guns.  Are those reports inaccurate?

             MR. VERSHBOW:  I'd rather not be the one to confirm or deny
because I'm not 100 percent sure what precisely the U.N. is listing as
the weapons the Serbs must get out.  I think they will be briefing in
the course of the day.
