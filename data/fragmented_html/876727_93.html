id pressure. In response to elastic stress changes, pore fluid pressure 
  changes can be transient if fluid diffusion is possible and are observed to 
  last about 6-12 months [<I>Muir-Wood and King</I>, 1993]. Only if fluids are 
  trapped in fault zones would the induced fluid pressure change would be static. 
  Because faults with large cumulative offset have better developed gouge zones 
  than more limited offset faults, lasting coseismic pore fluid changes are more 
  likely in the sealed faults. We
