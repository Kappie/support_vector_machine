       <br>        With Keck adaptive optics, for which LLNL scientists developed the fast         real-time control system, astronomers are obtaining infrared images with         four times better resolution than the Hubble Space Telescope, which orbits         high above the Earth&#146;s atmosphere. Many significant discoveries have         already been attributed to Keck adaptive optics, and the Keck virtual         guide star is expected to lead to many more.<br>        <br>        &#147;We have
