ouds. Instead, modelers try to get the average effect of processes that can't be resolved explicitly at smaller scales than the smallest resolved scale (the grid box) in the GCM. Developing, testing and validating many such parameterizations is the most important task of the modelers since these parameterizations determine critically important issues like "climate sensitivity." The climate sensitivity is the degree of response of the climate system to a unit change in some forcing factor: typically, in our
