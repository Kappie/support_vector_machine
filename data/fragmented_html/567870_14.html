ctures and modified closure assumptions for the calculation of the unsteady eddy-viscosity are suggested.  The results show a good agreement with physical experiments (Re=40,000) for the wake flow past a rectangular body.  Especially, under the present unsteady turbulence modelling it is shown that the dynamic characteristics of the organised, alternating eddies are predicted satisfactorily.</td>
