		<td>The onset of turbulent flow at moderate Reynolds numbers are predicted by a direct 2-D numerical simulation and by an unsteady turbulence model, respectively.  The global dynamic characteristics of the flow (mean drag, Strouhal number, oscillating lift coefficient) are accurately predicated, in agreement with the physical experiment.  An original type of large-eddy simulation is developed for the unsteady turbulence modelling of flows with coherent stru
