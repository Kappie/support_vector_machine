o look at similar genes in the related species <em>C. remanei</em> and <em>C. briggsae.</em> Like <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>C.&nbsp;remanei</em> has a total of four such genes, while <em>C.&nbsp;briggsae</em> has five. All code for  zinc-finger proteins, all of which are distinct from one another. </p>
      <p>&quot;These different species of <em>Caenorhabditis</em> are evolving rapidly away from one another,&quot;  says Dernburg. &quot;The zinc-finger proteins bind to different sites in the  Pairing Cente
