ccurately represent the atmospheric processes while at the same time are computationally tractable?  Addressing this question will require imaginative development as well as substantial computational resources.  One approach to this issue would be for TAP to tap into the resources that are becoming available through the new DOE computing initiative?  Again, although this is not a process-level question <I>per-se</I>, it is an issue that can be addressed only with process-level understanding.  <B><I>Modeling
