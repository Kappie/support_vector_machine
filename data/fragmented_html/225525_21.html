m does not turn on a distinction between ``minimally 
fermented'' or ``not fermented.'' The amount of sucralose, an intense 
sweetener, used per serving is in milligram amounts. Even if sucralose

involved, the complete and rapid fermentation of the amount of 
sucralose contained in one serving would likely not contribute 
significantly to a change in plaque pH. Thus, whether sucralose is 
``minimally fermented'' or ``not fermented
