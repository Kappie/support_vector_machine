  by studying the work environment, the worker, the task and tools the worker 
  was using, the energy exchange resulting in the fatal injury, and the role of 
  management in controlling how these factors interact. FACE gathers information 
  from multiple sources that may include interviews of employers, workers, and 
  other investigators; examination of the fatality site and related equipment; 
  and reviewing OSHA, police, and medical exam
