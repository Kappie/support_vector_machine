flow. Such accumulated surface water created drainage
channelways which then became gullies of erosion as volume and velocity
of flow increased. In several places erosion had exposed the roots of
sequoias to a depth of a foot and more, threatening the trees' future
stability. Likewise, accumulations of water on impervious pavement had
created similar channels to the side, some of them 3 and 4 ft deep. Yet
to this date, no giant sequoia is known to have fallen as a result of
this channeling.</P>
