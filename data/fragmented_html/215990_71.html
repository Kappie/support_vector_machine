>B. japonicum</em> EPS influences the nodulation of the soybean host, particularly since studies have indicated that effective symbioses are possible with mutants that do not synthesize the high-molecular-weight form of EPS (<a href="#B20" class="cite-reflink bibr">20</a>, <a href="#B26" class="cite-reflink bibr">26</a>).<p>Our discovery of a low-molecular-weight form of <em>B. japonicum</em> EPS was initially made with <em>B. japonicum</em> mutant M1E7, a Tn<em>5</em> mutant of USDA 110. This mutant was se
