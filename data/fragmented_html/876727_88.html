<P>If the pore fluid pressure inside the major right-lateral strike-slip 
  fault zones is very high, then small changes in normal stress like those induced 
  by the Loma Prieta or Landers earthquakes might not have much impact, which 
  could explain the apparent insensitivity of those faults to normal stress changes.
