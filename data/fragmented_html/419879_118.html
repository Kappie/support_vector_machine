The present study confirms this hypothesis.</p><p>Henry et al. (<a href="#CR14" class="cite-reflink bibr">2005</a>) found a relationship between the spectral-ripple threshold and vowel and consonant recognition in quiet for normal-hearing, hearing-impaired, and CI subjects. Their CI subjects had spectral-ripple discrimin
