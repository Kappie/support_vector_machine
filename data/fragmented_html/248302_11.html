course in factors (e.g., consistently high, consistently low, 
consistently increasing, consistently decreasing, increasing then 
decreasing, decreasing then increasing) are associated with 
particularly favorable or adverse effects.  Such trajectories of change 
may be better predictors of outcomes than simply the factorsâ€™ level at 
one age or their average level over some age interval.  This approach 
may provide insights into
