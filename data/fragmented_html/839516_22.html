Large cavities left by underground mining make the ground susceptible to subsidence. Acid water draining from some underground mines reaches surface streams and lowers the <ABBR>pH</ABBR>, causing serious ecological damage. Demonstration projects have shown that injection of alkaline <ACRONYM>CCP</ACRONYM>'s into abandoned mines can help control subsidence and abate acid mine drainage.
