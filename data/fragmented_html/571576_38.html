ition etc.?</B>  While this is seemingly the simplest and most direct question that must be answered, it is in fact very complex.  Aerosol loading, size distribution, and composition vary considerably as a function of location, and at a given location, as a function of time, as governed by season, time of day, meteorological variability, and the like.  The complexity of the problem implies that the DOE program should not attempt, by measurement, to map out the entire four-dimensional field of aerosol loadin
