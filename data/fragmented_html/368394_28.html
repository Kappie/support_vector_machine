l as  epidemiological data for collaborative re-analysis. If tissues are sufficient,  microarrays would be constructed for independent analyses. EBV-positive cancer  cases would be compared to disease-free controls as well as to EBV-negative  cases in case-control and case-case analyses. The goal is to complete initial  analyses of risk factors for EBV associated gastric cancer with specimens and  data from the consortium in FY2009. </p>
