equired are models that accurately represent the controlling properties.  However representation of aerosol processes in climate modeling is in its infancy, and to the extent that this is done, it is done in a quite simplistic way that does not take into account the heterogeneity of size and composition that is characteristic of aerosols.  For example, because of lack of knowledge thus far there has been a tendency, to the extent that aerosol properties are addressed in models at all, to assume treat all ae
