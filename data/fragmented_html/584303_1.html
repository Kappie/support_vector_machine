es are readily removed from barley cuticles. With the
aid of thin layer chromatography (TLC), the component lipid classes can
be separated. The most important wax classes in barley are the alkanes,
esters, aldehydes, primary alcohols, free fatty acids, beta-diketones and
hydroxy-beta-diketones. The latter two lipids are absent on leaf blades
and awns. Waxes on these two organs can be distinguished in Foma, however,
by the presence of secondary alcohols in the awn but not the leaf blade
wax. Secondary alcoho
