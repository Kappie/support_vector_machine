 miscible fluids, that is, fluids that completely dissolve in each other, interact without the interference of gravity. Immiscible fluids, like oil and water, exhibit what is called an interfacial tension because of the different ways that each type of molecules pull on each other. This interfacial (surface) tension allows a water skeeter to walk on water. 

<p>If a stream of one immiscible fluid is injected into another in weightlessness, the stream will break into drops with a diameter equal to p times
