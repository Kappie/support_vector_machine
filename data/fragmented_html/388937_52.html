 &#x0003c; <em>s</em> &#x0003c; (0.35 nm)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in the wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) regime. The x-ray flux was measured with an ionization chamber close to the sample. Synchrotron x-ray patterns were obtained at different temperatures in a continuous scan mode at 1&#x000b0;C/min. The temperature was controlled by a water circulating bath. To minimize the x-ray dose on the sample during the heating and cooling scans a fast solenoid-driven shutter controlled by the data acquisition system
