   CALL <a href="../spicelib/cgv2el.html">CGV2EL</a> ( CENTER, V1, V2, ELLIPS )
</PRE>
   This call produces the SPICELIB ellipse ELLIPS, which represents the
   same mathematical ellipse as do CENTER, V1, and V2.
<P>
 
   The generating vectors need not be linearly independent. If they are
   not, the resulting ellipse will be degenerate. Specifically, if the
   generating vectors are both zero, the ellipse will be the single point
   represented by CENTER, and if just one of the semi-axis vector
