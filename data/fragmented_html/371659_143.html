TT>--</TT> To find the image under gnomonic projection onto a plane (camera
projection) of an ellipsoid, given a focal point, we must find the
intersection of the plane and the cone generated by ellipsoid and the focal
point. Applying the distortion map to the ellipsoid, plane, and focal
point, the problem is transformed into that of finding the intersection of
the transformed plane with the cone generated by a unit sphere and the
transformed focal point. This `transformed' problem is much easier to
solve.
