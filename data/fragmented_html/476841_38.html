bassy, Gentleman from the Corps, Family and Friends; it is a high and humbling honor for me to stand before you this evening to deliver remarks on the occasion of the birthday celebration of the United States Marine Corps.</p>
  <p>It has been almost 100 days since Helen, Cameron, Laura and I landed in Denmark with the opportunity and the obligation to serve our country. I can think of no more appropriate way to honor that service than to stand with you tonight.  </p>
  <p>I would like to use this occasion
