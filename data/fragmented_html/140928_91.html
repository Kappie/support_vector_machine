>The expression and distribution of Fos-LI has been used as a measure of neuronal activity, particularly in the spinal dorsal horn (<a href="#B16" class="cite-reflink bibr">16</a>). There is a rapid and robust elevation in the number of dorsal horn neurons that express Fos-LI in their nuclei after nociceptive primary afferent activation by inflammation or other stimuli (<a href="#B23" class="cite-reflink bibr">23</a>, <a href="#B24" class="cite-reflink bibr">24</a>).
