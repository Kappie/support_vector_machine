<P>We used the program, DLC, written by R. Simpson (based on the 
  subroutines of Okada [1992]) to calculate changes in the stress tensor at points 
  along a specified receiver fault surface caused by slip on a source fault in 
  an elastic half space. We used the 1989 M=7.1 Loma Prieta earthquake in the 
  San Francisco Bay area and the 23 April
