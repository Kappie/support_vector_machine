nt fault responses to normal 
  and shear stress changes, we apply a new three-dimensional fault model for the 
  southern San Francisco Bay area, generated from geological data, to investigate 
  the effects on seismicity rates before and after the 1989 M=7.1 Loma Prieta 
  earthquake on a variety of faults. Additionally, we examine the seismicity rate 
  change on the San Andreas fault in southern California before and after the 
  23 April 1992 M=6.1 Joshua Tree, and the 28 June M=7.4 Landers and M=6.5 B
