  the normal component of post Loma Prieta static stress change plotted (clamping 
  in blue, unclamping in red). There is an apparent association between increased 
  seismicity and parts of the faults that are unclamped.

<P>We calculated that the upper 3-4 km of the southern Santa Clara 
  Valley oblique thrust faults were clamped, whereas the deeper parts were unclamped. 
  Since seismicity rates are lower in the shallowest part of the San Francisco 
  Bay Area crust of
