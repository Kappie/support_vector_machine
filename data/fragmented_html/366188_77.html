n, conservation of predicted amino acid sequences flanking the cleavage sites between viral polypeptides N**pro and C and between C and E**rns and conservation of predicted hydrophilicity plots of N**pro protein. While this data indicated the virus belongs to the pestivirus genus, phylogenetic analysis suggested that it is the most divergent of the pestiviruses identified to date. Comparison of predicted N**pro amino acid sequences of viruses from recognized pestivirus genotypes showed similarity values tha
