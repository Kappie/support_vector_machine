emiconductor. Moreover, there are several
polarizations that can be defined in a ferromagnet. The polarization relevant
to the bulk magnetization is

where <i>n<sub>maj</sub></i> (<i>n<sub>min</sub></i>) is the number of majority
(minority) spin electrons integrated over the filled states. Another commonly
discussed polarization is defined in terms of the dens
