smicity changes on the Hayward, San 
  Gregorio, and San Andreas faults (Figures 4, 5, 7, and 8). On the presumably 
  unsealed, limited-slip faults in the Santa Clara Valley thrust belt, we observe 
  consistent sensitivity to normal stresses from immediately after the Loma Prieta 
  earthquake to 7 years later. To match these observations, either there are negligible 
  pore fluids in the fault zones, or coseismic pore fluid changes diffuse away 
  to rapidly to cancel the imposed normal stress changes. <
