or pendant weakens, the inflow notch occurrence increases.&nbsp; These
peaks occur just after peaks in the RFD occurrence and meso velocities.&nbsp;
The middle graph in Figure 12 shows weak echo region.&nbsp; Notice the
two peaks at 48 minutes and at 23 minutes.&nbsp; Like inflow notch, the
peaks in the weak echo region coincide with the troughs in&nbsp; the hook-pendant
signatures.&nbsp; The weak echo region appears during the times of strong
inflow and near or just after the peak in meso veloci
