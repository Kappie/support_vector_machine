t be taken to depend on
 chain molecular weight in comparison with measurements. Moreover, the 
predictions of the LB model must be
 considered with caution when physically relevant scales in physical problems 
become smaller than
 this coarse-graining scale (lattice spacing) of the LB lattice model.  This limitation is
 natural since the LB model is a mesoscopic description of a fluid
 rather than a microscopic model.
