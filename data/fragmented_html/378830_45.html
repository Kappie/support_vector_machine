
The term greenhouse effect arises from the classic analogy to a greenhouse, in which the glass allows the solar radiation in and traps much of the heat inside. However, the mechanisms are different, for in a greenhouse the glass primarily prevents convection currents of air from taking heat away from the interior. Greenhouse glass is not primarily keeping the enclosure warm by its blocking or re-radiating infrared radiation; rather, it is constraining the physical transport of heat by air motion.<P>
