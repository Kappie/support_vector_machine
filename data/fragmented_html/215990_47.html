">Identification of a novel, low-molecular-weight form of EPS within <em>B. japonicum</em> cultures. </span> TLC is routinely performed in our laboratory to monitor the purification of cell-associated cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans from <em>B. japonicum</em> cultures; however, it can also be used to monitor the purity of cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans obtained from the supernatants of <em>B. japonicum</em> cultures. When the low-molecular-weight, extracellular polysaccharides of <em>
