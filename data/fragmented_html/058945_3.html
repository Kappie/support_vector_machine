nd parental love. In all three arenas, we struggle both 
        with the yearning for perfection and with the marks of a condition largely 
        given and received rather than self-created or chosen. Hawthorne plays 
        out his story in the context of marital love. While I have untold decades 
        of experience in the complexities of self-love and marital, let me spare 
        you comments on these and angle my way back into the Hawthorne story by 
        reflecting for a moment on parenting.
