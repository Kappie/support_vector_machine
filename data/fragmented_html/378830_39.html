not calculate clouds explicitly because individual clouds are typically the size of a dot in this grid box. But we can put forward a few reasonable propositions on cloud physics: if it's a humid day, for example, it's more likely to be cloudy. If the air is rising, it's also more likely to be cloudy. <P>

These climate models can predict the average humidity in the gridbox, and whether the air is rising or sinking on average. So then we can write what we call a parametric representation or "parameterizati
