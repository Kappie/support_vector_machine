Roseate 
                Tern</b><br>
                Listed as endangered, the Roseate Tern resembles the common tern 
                but has a dark (almost black) bill, longer tail points, and has 
                a paler color above. It averages 14-17&quot;. They can also be 
                identified by their distinctive raspy calls that sound like ripping 
                cloth. It winters from the West Indies to Brazil. </font></p>
