e choose to simulate the long-term sequence of glacials and interglacials (the period between successive ice ages), our model needs to include explicitly the effects of all the important interacting components of the climate system operating over the past million years or so. These include the atmosphere, oceans, sea ice/glaciers (cryosphere), land surface (including biota), land sub-surface and chemical processes (including terrestrial and marine biogeochemical cycles), as well as the external or "boundary
