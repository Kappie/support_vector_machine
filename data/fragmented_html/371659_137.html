e semi-definite (its eigenvalues are non-negative).
   Furthermore, since the product

   is non-singular if C is non-singular, and since the columns of C are V1
   and V2, SYM exists and is non-singular precisely when V1 and V2 are
   linearly independent, a condition that we have assumed. So the
   eigenvalues of SYM can't be zero. They're not negative either. We
   conclude they're positive.
