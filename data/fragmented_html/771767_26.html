stlarva I</a></b></p>
<p>Postlarva I is the stage following absorption of the yolk sac but before
disappearance of the oil globule. After disappearance of the yolk, or slightly
before then, larvae begin feeding (exogenous feeding), and gas bladder inflation
begins. Krise and Meade (1986) indicated that first feeding begins at 100-122
TU. Our measurements indicate that the TU to yolk sac disappearance (68 TU) is
much earlier than first feeding (132 TU). Before feeding, the energy
requirements of the larvae f
