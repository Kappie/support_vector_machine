surements of fry for stocking experimental tanks have been made
but the values are variable. Variability may be related to the diversity of
stocks that were used, the care or lack of it in removing excess water, but
especially the age of the fish at the time of stocking. Although the fish have
not begun to feed, the number/mL decreases with age from 1-4 days; measurements
in our laboratory are usually made at the time of stocking, about 2-3 days
posthatch.</p>
