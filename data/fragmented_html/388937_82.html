hese observations prompted us to use ITC as an alternative for the determination of the overall transition enthalpy. It can be assumed that rapid dilution of the putative &#x0201c;nonclassical micelles&#x0201d; (with ordered rather than liquid phospholipid hydrocarbon chains) by injection into a large excess of the detergent alone results in the formation of ordinary micelles. The dilution will be accompanied by the sudden uptake of the latent heat associated with the order-disorder transition, providing th
