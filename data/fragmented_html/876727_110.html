<p> Figure 16. An example extrapolation of frictional dependence on contact time 
  along lines of constant slip velocity with A=0.01 and B=0.005 (see equation 
  4). Fault healing (frictional increase) can occur as long as slip velocity is 
  less than steady state (V=Dc/___where Dc is the critical slip distance required 
  to renew contacts).
