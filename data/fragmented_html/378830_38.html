Now, we've already noted that clouds are very important to the energy balance of the earth-atmosphere system since they reflect sunlight away and trap infrared heat. But because none of us have ever seen a single cloud the size of Connecticut, let alone Colorado, we have a problem of scale -- how can we treat processes that occur in nature at a smaller scale than we can resolve by our approximation technique of using large grid boxes. For example, we can
