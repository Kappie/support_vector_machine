110 Tn<em>5</em> mutant was inoculated into 5 ml of GMS medium. Cultures were grown to an optical density at 650 nm of between 0.3 and 0.6 in a 30&#x000b0;C rotary shaker (7 to 8 days on average), at which time radiolabeled glucose (either &#x0005b;6-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;glucose or &#x0005b;<sup>14</sup>C&#x0005d;glucose) was added to a final concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M and at a specific activity of 0.5 &#x003bc;Ci/ml. Cultures were incubated for 3 to 6 h in the presence of radiolabel. After incubation
