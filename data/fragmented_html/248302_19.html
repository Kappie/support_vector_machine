 
mutations and other genetic variants in nonhuman species. Longitudinal 
studies could address the role in humans of putative mechanisms of 
aging, such as oxidative protein and DNA damage, proliferative 
senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell loss, depletion of 
precursor cells, and others. Analyses of longitudinal data could help 
to identify common mechanisms underlying a variety of aging changes, by 
studying correlations within individuals of the rates of groups of 
aging changes (or the
