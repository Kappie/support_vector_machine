   C     Find the position of the observer relative to the Earth's
   C     center in cartesian coordinates.  Although it's a little
   C     tedious to do so, we'll find the observation point's exact
   C     altitude (according to our ellipsoidal Earth model).  To do
   C     this, we find the unit vector pointing from the Earth's
   C     center toward the observer's surface location, and compute
   C     the cartesian coordinates of the intercept
