dies in nonhuman species have 
identified factors that influence life span, the rate of aging changes, 
and the development of age-related conditions.  It is clearly of 
interest to consider the potential relationship of such factors to 
human age-related changes and conditions. Longitudinal studies in 
humans offer potential opportunities to study predictive factors and 
outcomes suggested by data from life span studies of laboratory 
animals, cross-species comparisons, and studies on the effects of
