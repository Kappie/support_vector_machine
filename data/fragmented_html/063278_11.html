s="report_peggy">The industry standard measure for oil density is API gravity; a lower gravity indicates higher density (heavy viscous oil), and a higher gravity indicates lower density (lighter, thinner oil). Over the past 20 years, the API gravity of imported crude oil has steadily declined, from 32.5 degrees to 30.2 degrees [<I>27</I>]. The standard measure for corrosiveness is the total acid number (TAN), indicating the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide needed to neutralize the acid in 1 gram
