 this time, the cycling period ends
and the strong stable mesocyclone begins to rapidly build.&nbsp; The meso
velocities begin to linearly increase possibly resulting from a steady
increase in mid-level shear.&nbsp; As the meso velocities go up, the meso
diameter steadily shrinks causing the hook to rapidly develop beginning
at 18 minutes.&nbsp; The storm top collapse causes a strong surge of the
RFD beginning at 13 minutes prior to the violent tornado.&nbsp; This causes
the meso to increase in diame
