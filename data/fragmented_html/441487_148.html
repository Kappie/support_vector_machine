restrictive to root penetration generally did not extend much below 6
inches in depth. The compacted layer seemed to form a protective cap
which helped maintain the moisture level deeper down. Another important
factor was the reduced competition for soil moisture by smaller plant
species. The abrasion resulting from human trampling had largely
eliminated these plants and consequently reduced most species'
reproduction. Considering the relatively small volume of soil
