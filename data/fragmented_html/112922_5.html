han 10,000 atoms) exhibit size
quantization behavior similar to that of more familiar semiconductor
quantum dots, as predicted by computational simulations.

"When we model quantum drops," Noid says, "we can predict their electron
energy levels and their chemical potential, or electron affinity - that is,
whether they have the correct symmetry to make it easy to attach electrons.
We can predict the effects of electric and magnetic fields on the drops. We
can predict the melting points of the particle
