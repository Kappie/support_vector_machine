stions resulting
from the observations.  Field observations go hand in hand with more
sophisticated equipment and techniques to form a complete system for monitoring
volcanoes.  Monitoring programs should explicitly include provisions for
geologic field observations and instill in field workers, scientists, and
technicians alike, the need to be flexible and clever in designing simple
experiments and measurements to test important field observations on the spot.
