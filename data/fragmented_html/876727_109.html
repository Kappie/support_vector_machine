red from 'holding' experiments show increases in the static coefficient 
of friction on the order of 0.1-0.2 [e.g., <I>Dieterich</I>, 1978] as do calculated 
extrapolations of the laboratory derived equations to geologic time (Figure 16). 
However, there is significant freedom in choosing the constants of equation 4, 
and little information about the long-term slip rates of the Santa Clara Valley 
thrust belt faults, making a quantification of the potential frictional increase 
with time difficult.
