of study, the region on nasal cavity in rats could have been due to the direct effect of citral. The reason of no effects in mice is not clear sure but it seems likely that a nasal cavity of rats is generally more sensitive than that of mice. ... Several repeated dose oral studies show no adverse effect of citral at less than 1,000 mg/kg for 14 days to 13 weeks exposure and some histological changes in nasal cavity or forestomach at the first exposure sites, probably due to irritation, at more than 1,000 mg
