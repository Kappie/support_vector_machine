 we distinguish the climatic signal of the volcanic eruption from the noise of the natural variability? In any one eruption it is difficult to do so since the signal to noise ratio is about one, i.e. the magnitude of the cooling expected is about equal to the magnitude of the natural fluctuations in non-volcanic years, and therefore for any one event we cannot have very much confidence that a signal has been observed. So the fact that the Pinatubo results showed up about as predicted doesn't, by itself, giv
