        could be reach over 500 ppm, and near the end of the century they could
        be over 800 ppm. Corresponding models for the oceans indicate that surface
        water acidity (pH) drop would be approximately 0.4 pH units, and the
        carbonate ion concentration would decrease almost 50 % by the end of
        the century. This surface ocean pH drop wo
