<p>Intensive culture may be a better alternative for hatcheries that lack the
pond facilities or sites for cage culture. In intensive culture of walleye, a
single interval of high mortality occurs during the critical period when fish
switch from yolk-sac nutrition (endogenous feeding) to active feeding (exogenous
feeding), which coincides with the interval of gas bladder inflation. The
