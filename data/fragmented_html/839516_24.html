<H4>How can cenospheres in fly ash be used?</H4>

Fly ash contains tiny, hollow, particulate ceramic spheres, typically ranging in diameter from 5 to 75 micrometers, which are called cenospheres (<ABBR>fig.</ABBR> 1). They exhibit some unique properties, such as high energy absorption, which results in protection against electromagnetic interference. They are used as fillers in composite materials, in insulations, and in paints. A potential application of cenospheres is
