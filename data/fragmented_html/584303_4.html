with secondary alcohols to 38 without. The results demonstrate
that the ability of Foma awns to synthesize secondary alcohols is determined
by the presence of a single allele originating in Morgenrot that behaves
as a complete dominant. This allele has been designated <i>cer</i>-<sup>soh</sup>
(von Wettstein-Knowles, 1979). Since the presence of <i>cer</i>-<sup>soh</sup>
can not be detected visually, no further genetic experiments are planned.
