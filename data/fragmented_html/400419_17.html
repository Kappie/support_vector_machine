 in the conduction band of the
quantum well. The <i>m<sub>j</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1/2 electrons have spins
that are parallel to those of the majority electron in the ferromagnet (since a
majority spin electron has moment parallel to the magnetization and spin in the
<i>-z</i> direction or antiparallel to the magnetization.)<br>
