have global sst on 0.5 degree resolution...

For @ASN:

define axis/x=0:360:0.5/units=degrees/edges lon
define axis/y=90s:90n:0.5/units=degrees/edges lat
define grid/x=lon/y=lat xygrid
show grid xygrid
let new_sst = sst[gxy=xygrid@ASN]

For RESHAPE:

define axis/x=0:360:0.5/units=degrees/edges lon
define axis/y=90s:90n:0.5/units=degrees/edges lat
define grid/x=lon/y=lat xygrid
show grid xygrid
let dummy = x[gxy=xygrid] + y[gxy=xygrid]
let new_sst = RESHAPE(sst,dummy)

Remember that /edges defines the bounds
