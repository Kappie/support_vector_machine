yo or eleutheroembryo, or
finfold stage. Fish culturists call them sac fry because it is the first period
of life post-hatch when the yolk sac is present. At a mean temperature of 16.4
C, the yolk sac disappears in the 5th day posthatch, about 68 temperature units
(TU), but it may
persist up to about 13 days at a temperature of 13.2C.</p>
<p>The prolarvae are weak swimmers, so water currents in culture tanks should be
low, because larvae are quickly exhausted. Their weak swimming ability also
