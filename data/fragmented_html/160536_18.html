ns arose with these faults
as with the cracks: were they still moving and, if so, might they provide an
indication of future eruptive activity?  Again rebar stakes were driven into the
upper and lower lates of each thrust, and the distance between them was measured
with the steel tape.  The distance between each pair of stakes shortened with
time and indicated that the upper plate was moving across the lower plate. 
Repeated measurements of the thrusts and associated radial cracks soon showed a
