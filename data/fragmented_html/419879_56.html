 bandwidth of 100&#x02013;5,000&nbsp;Hz and a peak-to-valley ratio of 30&nbsp;dB. The level of the stimuli was 65&nbsp;dBA. The starting phases of the components were randomized for each presentation. The ripple stimuli were generated with 14 different densities, measured in ripples per octave. The ripple densities differed by ratios of 1.414 (0.125, 0.176, 0.250, 0.354, 0.500, 0.707, 1.000, 1.414, 2.000, 2.828, 4.000, 5.657, 8.000, and 11.314 ripples/octave). Standard (reference stimulus) and inverted (rip
