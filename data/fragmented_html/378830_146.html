e necessary to run fully-coupled three-dimensional earth systems models in order to "hand off" their results to a variety of regional impact assessment models. In the interim, lower resolution "simple" climate models can be hybridized into more comprehensive models to produce hybrid estimates of time-evolving regional patterns of climatic changes from a variety of emissions and land use change scenarios. Such estimates may be instructive to policy makers interested in the differential climatic impacts of va
