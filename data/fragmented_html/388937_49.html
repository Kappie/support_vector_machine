phospholipids (24&#x000b0;C for DMPC and 41&#x000b0;C for DPPC). The samples were again homogenized immediately before the measurements by incubation for 2 min above <em>t</em><sub>m</sub> and subsequent cooling on ice. This procedure was repeated until optically clear solutions were obtained below the respective phase transition temperatures <em>t</em><sub>m</sub> of the phospholipid components. The pretreatment was particularly critical for the system C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC, which showed a prope
