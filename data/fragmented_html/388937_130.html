below <em>t</em><sub>m</sub>, suggesting that there is a threshold temperature where the phospholipid core of the micelles becomes resistant against solubilization. This finding is in agreement with earlier observations on the low temperature insolubility of gel-state phospholpids in nonionic detergents (<a href="#B22" class="cite-reflink bibr">22</a>, <a href="#B23" class="cite-reflink bibr">23</a>).</p><p>Considering the DSC results shown in Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=55352&amp;rendertype=figu
