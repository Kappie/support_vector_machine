and deposition as these processes govern the loading of these aerosols, their properties, and geographical distribution.  The geographical scale to be considered ranges from urban (tens of km) to regional (hundreds of km).  The following are classes of questions that must be addressed in a program directed to understanding the processes that control loading and properties of tropospheric aerosols.</P><DIR>
