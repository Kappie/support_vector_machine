ically spaced in the frequency domain with an amplitude envelope determined by a sinusoid on a decibel scale. The speech reception thresholds (SRTs) for spondees in two-talker babble and speech-shaped noise were also measured. In this way, we evaluate the predictive power of the spectral-ripple test in the practical task of speech understanding in noise. In addition, test&#x02013;retest reliability was evaluated for the spectral-ripple and speech-in-noise tasks. If the spectral-ripple test is reliable and s
