cluding the metal abundance discrepancy in some X-ray faint galaxies, 
the deviation from the solar abundance ratio of alpha elements, the wide 
range of hot gas contents for a given stellar mass, the effects of 
AGN-feedback on the dynamics and energetics of the hot ISM. This conference is 
intended to review the observational constraints available on the physical 
properties of the hot ISM and to confront the predictions of the latest 
simulations and analytical models of the dynamical/chemical evolution
