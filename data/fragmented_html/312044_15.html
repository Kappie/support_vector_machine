hat Congress did not 
intend for the operators to possess it as a valuable right to be bought 
and sold. IOA was designed as a temporary solution to allow operators 
already conducting air tours at the time of the enactment of the Act to 
continue to operate pending completion of the ATMP. If we allow IOA to 
be transferred, however, then operators may grow an existing business 
by adding allocations to their current allotment without FAA and/or NPS 
approval.
