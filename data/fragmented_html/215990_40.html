, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 &#x000d7; <em>g</em> for 5 min) and washed twice with water (1 ml), and cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans were extracted with 160 &#x003bc;l of 70&#x00025; ethanol at 70&#x000b0;C for 30 min. The level of radiolabeled cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans within each ethanol extract was determined by adsorption onto C<sub>18 </sub>silica gel resin (Supelco, Bellefonte, Pa.) followed by selective elution using 30&#x00025; methanol.
