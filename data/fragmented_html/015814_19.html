HICH INDICATES IDEAL SETUP FOR
HEALTHY MOUNTAIN WAVE. FLOW JUST ABOVE STABLE LAYER INCREASES INTO THE
50-60 KNOT RANGE BETWEEN 21Z AND 00Z SO WOULD EXPECT HIGH WINDS BY
THEN. FLOW INCREASES EVEN MORE TONIGHT SO A HIGH WIND WARNING IS
NECESSARY FOR THE FRONT RANGE FOOTHILLS AND ADJACENT PLAINS WEST OF
I-25. <p>

HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE ALSO INCREASING ACROSS THE STATE SO WILL WORD AS
PARTLY CLOUDY BUT SHOULD BE A GENERAL INCREASING TREND THROUGHOUT THE
DAY. GUIDANCE TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD. <p>
