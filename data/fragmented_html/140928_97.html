ffecting escape responding, and especially by the blockade of systemic &#x003b2;-casomorphin effects on forepaw latency through i.c.v. injection of naloxone (<a href="#B37" class="cite-reflink bibr">37</a>).</p><p>An important finding from the present study is that the forepaw and hindpaw hyperalgesia are differentially modulated by gustatory and orotactile inputs in 10-day-old rats. Although there was a clear inhibition of forepaw response and Fos induction by sucrose and suckling, the hindpaw withdrawal r
