  a 'positive' stress change). Earthquake hypocenters are plotted for 7 years 
  before (blue spheres proportional to magnitude) and after (red spheres) the 
  Loma Prieta earthquake. A significant decline in seismicity rate beginning just 
  after the Loma Prieta earthquake was attributed to the calculated decrease in 
  right-lateral shear stress (~1-2 bars) by <I>Reasenberg and Simpson</I>, [1992]. 
  We calculate a stressing rate of about 0.06 bars/yr for the southern Hayward 
  fault using the meth
