Samples and standards (fucose, xylose, mannose, galactose, glucose, <em>N</em>-acetylgalactosamine, <em>N</em>-acetylglucosamine, <em>N</em>-acetylneuraminic acid, rhamnose, and galacturonic acid) were hydrolyzed using methanolysis. Potential amino sugars were then re-<em>N</em>-acetylated, and the products were finally derivatized with TMS to render them volatile for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. T
