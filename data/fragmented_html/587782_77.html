roduction of 
							short rotation woody crops is dependent on development of highly productive 
							growing stock and land management practices that conserve the biotic and 
							abiotic tenants of soil and water resources. This project was developed in 
							response to needs identified by the Department of Energy (DOE) and the American 
							Forest and Paper Association. It is a cooperative effort between DOE, Oak Ridge
