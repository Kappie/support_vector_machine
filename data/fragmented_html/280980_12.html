suggestive neolithic and Paleolithic vestiges 
            are still visible: the grottoes of Favignana, the carvings and murals 
            of Levanzo. Splendid beaches are to be found at San Vito Lo Capo, 
            Scopello, and Cormino, and a wild and rocky coast around Monte Cofano: 
            all at less than one hour&#8217;s drive from Erice.<br>
