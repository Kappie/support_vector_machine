-statistical approach is desirable. However, observations can lead to a hypothesis of cause and effect -- "laws" -- that can be tested (for example, see Root and Schneider, 1995). The testing is often based on simulations with mathematical models run on a computer. The models, in turn, need to be tested against a variety of observations -- present and paleoclimatic. That is how the scientific method is typically applied. When a model, or set of linked models, appear plausible, they can be fed "unprecedented
