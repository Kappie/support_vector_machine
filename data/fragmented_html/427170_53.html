ult and old Wistar rats /was assessed/. Neuronal vacuolar degeneration with preserved nuclei of PG neurons was observed in untreated senescent, but not young rats. Citral significantly increased the rate of vacuolated neurons in old rats (from 3 to 14%), but only slightly in young ones (from 0 to 0.5-0.3%). Similar lesions were not found in inferior cervical or celiac ganglia, in either group.
