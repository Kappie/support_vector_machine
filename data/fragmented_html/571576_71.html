<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Field measurements:</B> This component must clearly be the center of TAP.  It is only through field measurements that confidence can be developed in the physical understanding and model representation of processes responsible for aerosol loading and properties.  This evaluation starts with emission inventories, for example by comparisons of measured and modeled loadings of specific aerosol components, or of ratios of loadings
