</SUB></ABBR>), a greenhouse gas that may be associated with global warming. Portland cement manufacture requires the burning of fossil fuels and decomposition of carbonates, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Use of <ACRONYM>CCP</ACRONYM>'s can potentially reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 10-14 <ABBR>Mt</ABBR> annually. In 1998, 10.5 <ABBR>Mt</ABBR> of fly ash was used in cement and concrete, replacing 7 <ABBR>Mt</ABBR> of portland cement and thereby reducing carbon dioxid
