s approximately four
times that of the years immediately preceding. In fact, the upper third
of the foliated portion of the Castro study tree contained nearly as
many new cones as those of all other age classes combined, so that their
total number on this tree rose from about 19,000 one year to more than
39,000 the following year. Gelechiid moth activities increased
considerably at the same time. In the 1969 study, 1 of 11 cones showed
evidence of gelechiid moth damage, while the proportion in the 19
