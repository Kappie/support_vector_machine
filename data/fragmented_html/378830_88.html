tion from classical economic cost-benefit analysis is that carbon taxes should be levied sufficient to reduce the GNP as much as it is worth to avert climate change (e.g. the damage to GNP from climate change). He assumed that the impacts of climate change were equivalent to a loss of about one percent of GNP. This led to an "optimized" initial carbon tax of about five dollars or so per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. In the context of his modeling exercise, this would avert only a few tenths of a degree of
