nbsp; This deepens the
mesocyclone and the meso velocities go up.&nbsp; Near or just after this
time, inflow notch and weak echo region signatures appear relating to strong
inflow.&nbsp; As the RFD weakens, inflow takes over, the meso velocities
go down and the meso shrinks ending the cycle.&nbsp; At 23 minutes prior
to the violent tornado, the hook or pendant, RFD and meso velocities are
all decreasing.&nbsp; As a result, the cell top collapses causing the V-notch
to disappear.&nbsp; However, during
