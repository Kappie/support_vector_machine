For standard ripples, the phase of the full-wave rectified sinusoidal spectral envelope was set to zero radians, and for inverted ripples, it was set to <em>&#x003c0;</em><img src="corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" " />/<img src="corehtml/pmc/pmcents/x2009.gif" border="0" alt=" " />2. The stimuli had 500&nbsp;ms total duration and were ramped with 150&nbsp;ms rise/fall times. Stimuli were filtered with a long-term, speech-shaped
