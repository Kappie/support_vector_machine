 a prerequisite for the next two, since
   many SPICELIB subroutines make use of the ellipse data type in their
   calling sequences.
<P>
 
   The second chapter lists the SPICELIB routines that deal with ellipses
   and ellipsoids.
<P>
 
   The third chapter presents some extended examples that illustrate the
   use of SPICELIB ellipse and ellipsoid routines to solve practical
   geometry problems.

   The fourth chapter presents some of the mathematical background
   necessary to fully understand the
