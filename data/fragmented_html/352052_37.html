products can cause problems when using whole-cell systems. For such reasons, cell wall mutants of <em>Salmonella enterica</em> serovar Typhimurium were developed for use in mutagenesis tests (<a href="#B10" class="cite-reflink bibr">10</a>). One approach to overcome these problems could be to engineer CYPs that can be exported to the periplasm or the cell exterior. Previous studies with cytochrome <em>b</em><sub>5</sub> have shown that cytosolic hemoproteins can be efficiently exported for their enhanced ac
