ervatory image</A> represents the best view of the X-ray emission from 
the Crab ever obtained.  The Chandra image shows tilted rings or waves of 
high-energy particles that appear to have been flung outward over the 
distance of a light year from the central star, and high-energy jets of 
particles blasting away from the neutron star in a direction perpendicular 
to the spiral.
