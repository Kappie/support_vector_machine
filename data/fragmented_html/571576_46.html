s the interaction of atmospheric aerosols with water vapor?</B>  Aerosol particles undergo phase transitions and exchange water with the gas phase as a function of relative humidity and temperature.  These processes affect the size distribution and can otherwise affect aerosol dynamics such as accretion of material, coagulation.  How is this dependence influenced by particle composition and/or surface properties?  <B><I>Field measurements, with guidance from laboratory experiments and theory.</B></I>  </P>
