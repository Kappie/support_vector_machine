nk bibr">11</a>&#x0005d;), as well as 1-D <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis. Methylation analysis revealed the presence of terminally linked galactose, 3-linked glucose, 3-linked mannose, and 3,6-linked glucose. Unfortunately, methylation analysis could not be used to identify uronic acid residues; thus, galacturonic acid could not be detected. However, NMR analysis revealed the presence of an <em>O</em>-methyl group, an <em>O</em>-acetyl group, and resonances consistent with a 4-<em>O
