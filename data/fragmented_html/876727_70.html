 in blue (denoting the 'negative' 
  normal-stress change convention of frictional failure), and the unclamped parts 
  of the faults shaded in red (denoting a 'positive' normal-stress change). Earthquake 
  hypocenters are plotted for 7 years before (blue spheres proportional to magnitude) 
  and after (red spheres) the Loma Prieta earthquake. Post-1989 seismicity occurred 
  primarily on parts of the faults that we calculated were unclamped by the Loma 
  Prieta earthquake, and was rare on the parts of th
