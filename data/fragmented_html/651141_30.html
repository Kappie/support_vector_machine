 item non-response. However, given the PSID's low rate of non-response, estimates of spending are relatively insensitive to the imputation strategy. Table 2 reports average PSID spending for each category when
the missing data are dropped (implicitly assuming that spending for families with item non-response is equal to the average among families who responded), and when the missing data are imputed using a model that includes a third-order polynomial in age, and an unrestricted spline for family size.
