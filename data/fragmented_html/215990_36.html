oaching up to sevenfold higher than levels associated with cells (<a href="#B22" class="cite-reflink bibr">22</a>). As part of our ongoing research efforts, we recently developed a radiolabel screening strategy to isolate mutants of <em>B. japonicum</em> impaired for the synthesis of cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan (H. A. Louch and K. J. Miller, Abstr. 95th Gen. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1995, abstr. N-197, p. 366, 1995). During the course of screening putative cyclic &#x003b2;-glucan mutants of <
