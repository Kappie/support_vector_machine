             MR. VERSHBOW:  Well, both sides in the Geneva agreement
reaffirmed their acceptance of 51-49 -- excuse me, in the Serb case, for
the first time they've now endorsed it.  So that is the basis for the
territorial negotiations.  Now, that document says that adjustments are
possible by mutual agreement.  And if the parties themselves decide that
a 52-48 split serves their interest, we're not going to stand in the
way.  But 51-49 in the starting point.
