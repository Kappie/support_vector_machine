<P>The calculation of static stress changes associated with large 
  earthquakes has provided a potential explanation of aftershock patterns [e.g., 
  <I>King et al.</I>, 1994], microseismicity rate changes [e.g., <I>Reasenberg 
  and Simpson</I>, 1992] as well as triggered sequences of larger events [e.g., 
  <I>Stein et al.</I>, 1994, 1997; <I>Harris</I>, 1998]. These studies suggest
