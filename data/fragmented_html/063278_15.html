al method for reducing sulfur content in fuels is hydrotreating, a chemical process in which hydrogen reacts with the sulfur in crude oil to create hydrogen sulfide gas that can easily be removed from the oil. Hydrotreaters are specialized for the refinery streams they process. In aggregate, the dramatically lower sulfur specifications for petroleum fuels will necessitate a doubling of U.S. hydrotreating capacity by 2030, to 27 million barrels a day, from 14 million barrels a day in 2004. Most of the new ca
