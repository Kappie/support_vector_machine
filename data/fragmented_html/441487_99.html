each organism possesses
its own distinguishing set of genetic traits. To be sure, there are
similarities between one and another species but, like human
fingerprints, no two are exactly alike. Thus, no two species of plants
or animals react identically to a given set of environmental conditions,
which insures that every species fills a specific niche in time and
space, and the species' distinct genetic traits enable it to compete
with other organisms present in that niche.</P>
