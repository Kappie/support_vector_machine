   C     Step 4.  Create a plane that is orthogonal to the instrument
   C              boresight vector.  Orthogonally project the limb
   C              onto this plane.  Under this projection, every
   C              point on the limb maps to a point that is the same
   C              distance from the boresight as the pre-image of
   C              that point.
