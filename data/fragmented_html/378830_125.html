fixed, then at equilibrium (i.e. the change in steady state after a few hundred years) the earth's temperature would warm up some one and a half to four and a half degrees centigrade -- the uncertainty, as noted earlier, in this climate sensitivity range largely being associated with the well recognized processes that we treat crudely in our climate models, mostly clouds and water vapor. The reason that very few scientist set the climate sensitivity range above four and a half degrees or below one and a hal
