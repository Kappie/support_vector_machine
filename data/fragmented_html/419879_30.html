ne of the most practical measures of success with a cochlear implant; however, with experience, this ability can change dramatically over time, making it a less than ideal tool for comparing performance among different processing strategies. This study examined performance on a spectral discrimination task and compared it to speech perception in noise. An adaptive procedure was used to determine the spectral-ripple density that subjects could discriminate. A closed-set, forced-choice adaptive procedure was
