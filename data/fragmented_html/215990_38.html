om and coworkers (<a href="#B17" class="cite-reflink bibr">17</a>). Tn<em>5</em> mutants were plated onto GMS (<a href="#B32" class="cite-reflink bibr">32</a>) containing (per ml) 100 &#x003bc;g of streptomycin, 100 &#x003bc;g of kanamycin, and 50 &#x003bc;g of trimethoprim. Approximately 2,100 Tn<em>5</em> mutants of <em>B. japonicum</em> USDA 110 were isolated, and each was screened for defects in cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan biosynthesis as described below.<p>Each <em>B. japonicum</em> USDA
