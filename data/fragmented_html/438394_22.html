        experiments indicate that coral reef organisms do not acclimate to decreasing
        carbonate saturation states over several years. Thus, if calcifying organisms
        cannot adapt to the changes in seawater chemistry that will occur, the
        geographical range of some species may be reduced or may shift latitudinally
        in response to rising CO<span class="smaller">2</span>. Based on the best available understanding,
