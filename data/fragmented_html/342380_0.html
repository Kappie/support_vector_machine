John Keller of Code 691 makes plastic models of spacecraft parts - and planetary
surface features.  The same plastic extrusion device obtained to support mission
development work can be used to make 3-dimensional models of volcanoes, river
valleys, impact craters and other features - provided a really good topography data
set exists.  MOLA (Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter) has provided such data for Mars
