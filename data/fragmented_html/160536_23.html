s no question that the more sophisticated techniques fill
important gaps, because most have the capability to acquire data almost in real
time, 24 hours a day under any weather condition.  But one of the principal
limitations of these techniques is one of the principal strengths of field
observation and simple measurements: flexibility and the ability to integrate
several observations on the spot and to design a measurement to test that
integration.  Continuous measurements often can proxy for an on-s
