pon an aircraft
 altitude of 20 km and an
 aircraft speed of 200 ms-1, this scan rate will yield
 contiguous footprints for the 85.5
 GHz channel within a 40 km wide swath. The other three
 channels will be oversampled
 by the factors given in the Table given below which also lists other
 performance characteristics of the
 radiometer. The alignment of the feedhorns has been adjusted
 such that vertical
 polarization is received 45o to the left of nadir and
 horizontal is received 45o to the righ
