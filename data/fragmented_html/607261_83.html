 It's a nice token of gratitude, and we appreciate your
	help in promoting the Plone name.

	Plone is powered by the combined forces of Zope and CMF, two absolutely
	great systems made by Zope Corporation (http://zope.com) and they in turn
	are based on the best programming language in the world - Python
	(http://www.python.org). We owe these guys a lot, thanks for making Plone
	possible!
