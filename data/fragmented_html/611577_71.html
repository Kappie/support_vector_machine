 20 km is 0.6 km for the 85.5 GHz channel, 1.5 km for 37.1
 GHz, and 2.8 km for both
 the 19.35 and 10.7 channels The AMPR calibrates with external
 cold and warm loads
 after every fourth data scan. A total calibration sequence or
 a total data scan are each
 performed in a three second time period. 
 <p>The AMPR scanner
 sweeps through a total
 90o (+/- 45o from nadir) data scan collecting a sample for
 each channel every 1.8o for
 a total of 50 samples per channel. Based u
