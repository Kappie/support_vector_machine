ixed micelles containing DMPC or DPPC undergo an order-disorder transition upon sudden dilution into an excess of the detergent was further confirmed when these lipids were replaced by 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<em>sn</em>-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), which has a chain-melting transition at <em>t</em><sub>m</sub> &#x02248; &#x02212;3&#x000b0;C (<a href="#B17" class="cite-reflink bibr">17</a>). The only calorimetric response to be expected here is the heat of dilution of the detergent/phospholipid mixture int
