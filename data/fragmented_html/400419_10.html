a common reference frame. A widely used geometry is that shown in Fig.&nbsp;1
where the magnetization axis is parallel to the light propagation along the
surface normal (out-of-plane), taken to be the +&nbsp;z-axis. The angular
momenta of the light, and of the electrons in the ferromagnet and semiconductor
are shown in Fig.&nbsp;2. The electron states in the semiconductor are
designated by their total angular momentum quantum number <i>m<sub>j</sub></i>
relative to the quantization axis +z. In the con
