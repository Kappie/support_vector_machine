meiotic hotspots of recombination we compared computed recombination rate profiles between four human populations sampled by the HapMap project and found that more than 10% of hotspots of recombination vary among populations. Then we asked how well these computed \"historical\" hotspots calculated from patterns of linkage disequilibrium predict genetic crossovers in present-day individuals. We find that up to 30-40% of present-day crossovers are located in regions without \"historical\" hotspots. In additio
