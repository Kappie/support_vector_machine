On June 9, 1994, the Office of Supplemental Security Income (OSSI) issued  
teletype instructions in compliance with &#182; 7 of the court order.  
Final POMS instructions were published in November 1994 (Attachment 2).  
These technical instructions involve the modification of SSI payment  
calculation procedures that are generally performed at the SSA field  
office (FO) level. The FOs have been provided with special computer  
software for performing RMA payment calculations
