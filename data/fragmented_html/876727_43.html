<P> In addition, we calculated that the southern end of the Hayward 
  fault was unclamped by ~2-3 bars, a larger difference than the shear stress 
  change on most parts of the fault. In Figure 4 the fault is shown with the clamped 
  parts shaded in blue (denoting the 'negative' normal-stress change convention
