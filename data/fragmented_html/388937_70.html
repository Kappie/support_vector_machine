(<a href="#B14" class="cite-reflink bibr">14</a>), i.e., the ordering of the aliphatic chains in the gel and ripple phase of lipids vanishes above the main transition temperature <em>t</em><sub>m</sub> and the sharp x-ray reflection fades out into a broad maximum centered around (4.6 nm)<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. It is noteworthy that the WAXS reflection of the sample containing DPPC is sharper than the one with DMPC, which reflects the better ordering of the aliphatic chains in DPPC due to two additional CH<su
