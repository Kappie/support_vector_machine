igh-resolution NMR spectroscopy. Motional restriction results in appreciable line broadening in <sup>13</sup>C- and <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectra of mixed micelles containing the fully saturated phospholipids. Natural abundance <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC and C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/POPC mixed micelles (molar ratio 2:1) were acquired at 13&#x000b0;C (see Fig. 7, which is published as supplemental data on the PNAS web site, <span class="ext-reflink"><a href="redirect3.cgi?&
