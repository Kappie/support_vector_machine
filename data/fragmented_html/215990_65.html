eviously published for high-molecular-weight EPS of <em>B. japonicum</em> strains is in good agreement with our spectrum (<a href="#B25" class="cite-reflink bibr">25</a>, <a href="#B27" class="cite-reflink bibr">27</a>). Based on the apparent size of this low-molecular-weight polysaccharide, as indicated by gel permeation chromatography and negative-ion FABMS, it may be concluded that this material corresponds to a dimeric form of the pentasaccharide repeating unit of the <em>B. japonicum</em> EPS.  </p><di
