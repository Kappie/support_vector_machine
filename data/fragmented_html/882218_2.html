     (in this case, each XY pair corrsponds to a different reconstructed Z, obviously).
     This is a more accurate representation of the beam intensity, because the background contribution from
     spurious tracks is greatly reduced, as well as that from out-of-time tracks (these categories of tracks
     seldom make a vertex in space). <Br>
     For historical reasons (essentially due to precision requirements in the computation), the X-Y of a 
     reconstructed vertex are expressed in
