#x003bc;l syringe. Solutions containing 2.5 mM DMPC or 2.5 mM DPPC and variable amounts of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> in water were titrated into a 10 mM aqueous C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> solution. The volume of the calorimeter cell containing the detergent solution was 1.41 &#x003bc;l. Typically 5-&#x003bc;l volumes of the detergent/phospholipid mixture were injected into the detergent solution, and 20 injections were executed. Baseline corrections and integration of the calorimeter signals were done by
