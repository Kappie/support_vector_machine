. Further analysis revealed that this contaminant could be bound to DEAE-cellulose at pH 8.4 and subsequently eluted using a buffer containing 200 mM KCl, indicative of anionic character. This is in contrast to the cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucans, which are uncharged and do not bind to DEAE-cellulose under these conditions.<p>Additional characterization of the extracellular anionic contaminant material isolated from mutant M1E7 was performed using negative-ion fast atom bombardment mass spectomet
