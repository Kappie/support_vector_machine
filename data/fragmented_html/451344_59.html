Both strands of DNA were sequenced and each sequence trace was carefully checked to make sure that each base was unequivocally designated.</p><p>A sample of European mouflon (<em>O. musimon</em>) was also analysed both for the D-loop fragment and <em>Cyt b</em> gene. Other sequences, obtained from Genbank, were <em>O. aries</em>, two D-loop sequences of Merinolandschaf breed, corresponding to the mtDNA types B and A, as de
