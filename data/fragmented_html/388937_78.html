In the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DMPC mixture (1:2 mol/mol) a narrow heat capacity maximum was found at 23&#x000b0;C that shifted to somewhat higher temperatures upon increasing the detergent/lipid molar ratio, in contrast to the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC system (not shown). A quantitative determination of enthalpies from individual signals was not feasible, due to the broadening of the transitions. However, estimates obtained by
