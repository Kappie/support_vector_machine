  Cumulative slip is estimated to be 50-70 km during the past 6 m.y. [<I>McLaughlin 
  et al.</I>, 1996]. Slip during the Loma Prieta earthquake changed stresses by 
  up to 3 bars at the southern end of the Hayward fault. In Figure 4 the fault 
  is shown with the parts subjected to a left-lateral stress change shaded in 
  blue (denoting the 'negative' stress change convention for a right-lateral fault), 
  and the parts subjected to a right-lateral stress change shaded red (denoti
