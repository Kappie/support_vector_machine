er of earthquakes 
  than between shear stress change and earthquake occurrence. The significance 
  of this difference is measurable and ranges from a 0.00008% to a 65% chance 
  that the difference is a result of random chance (Figure 12). It should be noted 
  that the apparent differences in correlation between the occurrence of earthquakes 
  and normal stress and with m=0.8 is not significant. The resolution of this 
  analysis is more suited to statements about correlations between high friction
