tos continues to represent a public health concern for at least three reasons (Chiappino 1998). First, people exposed in the past (especially in the work environment) are still at risk because asbestos-induced desease, especially cancer, may develop up to 40 years after exposure (Lanphear and Buncher 1992; Vogelzang 2002). Projections based on epidemiologic data suggest that the number of men dying from pleural mesothelioma in Western Europe each year will almost double until around 2018 (Peto et al. 1999).
