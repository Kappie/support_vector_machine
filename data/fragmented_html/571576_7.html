<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One can turn to the similar air-quality problem of tropospheric ozone to gain some insight into what is required to develop the knowledge base required to effectively address the aerosol problem.  Ozone air quality standards have been in place since the 1970's, yet aside from very few places very little progress has been made in reducing ozone.  It is only through years of research that we have recently come to appreciate that many of the measures that were implemented were
