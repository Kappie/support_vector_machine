 class="body"> 3) The "Screaming Ted." The Screaming Ted Nugent, 
            or Screaming Ted (named after a loud heavy metal guitarist from another 
            era), produces ultrasonic white noise. It sounds like a high pitched 
            hiss. Most of the sound generated by the Screaming Ted can't even 
            be heard by humans, but dogs can probably hear most of it! </td>
