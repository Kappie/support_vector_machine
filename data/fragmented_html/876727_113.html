<P>In contrast with the major strike-slip fault zones, seismicity 
  on the faults of the Santa Clara Valley thrust belt shows strong dependence 
  on changes in normal stress. The static reduction in normal stress (unclamping) 
  that occurred after Loma Prieta on many of these faults was followed by a closely 
  correlated increase in seismicity. The characteristics of these faults with 
  more limited slip, and most likely with less gouge [e.g., <I>Scholz</I>,
