> Figure 7. (a) The calculated shear stress changes resulting from the Landers, 
  Joshua Tree, and Big Bear earthquakes are shown resolved on the San Andreas 
  fault in southern California. The pattern of shear stress change matches (b) 
  the pattern of calculated seismicity rate change (5 year background rate calculated 
  before the 1986 North Palm Springs earthquake compared with the 5 year period 
  after the Landers shock) shown below. (c) The normal stress changes resulting 
  from the Landers, Jos
