statory pathways and also are sites of origin of descending inhibitory input (<a href="#B33" class="cite-reflink bibr">33</a>, <a href="#B34" class="cite-reflink bibr">34</a>). The NTS has connections with nucleus raphe magnus (<a href="#B35" class="cite-reflink bibr">35</a>). Electrical stimulation of NTS produces descending inhibition, and local anesthetic block of the NTS blocks inhibition produced by stimulation of the vagus nerve (<a href="#B36" class="cite-reflink bibr">36</a>). Thus, gustatory and or
