l chain methyl and methylene carbons were severely broadened in the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC sample, in contrast to the respective signals in the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/POPC mixture. Similar observations were made by <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectroscopy, i.e., a strongly broadened &#x003c9;-methyl signal appeared in an up-field position from the narrow triplet signal of the detergent terminal methyl resonance in the micellar detergent/phospholipid mixtures (spectra not shown).</p></div></td></tr><tr
