igh-energy missions such as XMM-Newton, Chandra and Suzaku 
for energy spectra and RossiXTE for fast time variability, as well as the 
discovery of a new binary radio pulsar, have spurred these lines of research. 
The results from high-energy Cherenkov experiments like MAGIC and HESS are 
opening a new window to study the extreme environment close to compact objects.
Agile and GLAST will be fully operational, providing an unprecedented view of 
this type of systems. The proposed Joint Discussion aims at get
