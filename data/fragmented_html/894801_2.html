<P>It is apparent from the examination of the LB mixture model above that the
 critical properties of this fluid are described by mean-field theory and
 that the critical exponents predicted by this model are inconsistent with
 those measured for many real mixtures.  This limits, of course, the
 comparison of LB model calculations to certain qualitative trends in the
 equilibrium properties of near critical fluid mixtures. (The theory should
become more reliable, however, away from the c
