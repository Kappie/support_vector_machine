ts is that faults 
  with more cumulative slip evolve toward a lower apparent coefficient of friction. 
  Four possible effects that could reduce or mute the impact of the frictional 
  terms in the failure criteria presented in the introduction include: (1) low 
  intrinsic friction in the fault zone materials, (2) a very high pore pressure 
  state in the fault zone, (3) stress-induced pore fluid pressure changes in the 
  fault zone that balance normal stress changes, and (4) time and velocity dependent
