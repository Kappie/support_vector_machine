ancisco Bay area after 1989 shows lasting 
  lobes of increase and decrease consistent with static changes [e.g., <I>Reasenberg 
  and Simpson</I>, 1997] as is observed in many other regions [<I>Harris</I>, 
  1998, and references contained therein]. Additionally, <I>Cotton and Coutant</I>, 
  [1997] demonstrate for unilateral ruptures that the dynamic and static Coulomb 
  stresses do not produce the same patterns. The relative magnitude of dynamic 
  vs. static Coulomb stress is much higher in the far fie
