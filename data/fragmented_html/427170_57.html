tro assay for genotoxicity based on the ability of cells to increase their level of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 in response to DNA damage /was developed/. Cultured cells are treated with various amounts of the test substances, and at defined times following treatment, they are harvested and lysed. The lysates are analyzed for p53 by Western blot and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis. An increase in cellular p53 following treatment is interpreted as evidence for DNA damage. To determine the
