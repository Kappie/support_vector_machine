light-scattering effect of the turbidity may have better illuminated each
feed particle (i.e., some light would be reflected on all sides of the feed
particle as opposed to only the top half in clear water), thus increasing the
ability of the fry to see the feed. Nonfeeding would be expected of larvae that
are clinging to the walls of the culture container, or in walleye that had not
inflated their gas bladder.</p>
