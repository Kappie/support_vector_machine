etected as a contaminant within extracellular cyclic &#x003b2;-1,6-&#x003b2;-1,3-glucan preparations from <em>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</em> USDA 110 cultures. Compositional analysis, methylation analysis, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed that this low-molecular-weight polysaccharide was composed of the same pentasaccharide repeating unit previously described for the high-molecular-weight form of the exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesized by <em>B. japonicum</em> strains.
