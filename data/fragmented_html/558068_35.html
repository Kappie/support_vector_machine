typical clinical conditions (21 CFR 900.12(e)(2)). If you routinely use the cushion pad on both the bucky and the compression paddle, you must use 2 layers of the cushion pad when performing the phantom and dose QC tests. When used clinically, the cushion pad is a single-use device. Because of this, QC testing with the cushion pad in place is most appropriate when performing the phantom and dose tests. Therefore, the facility does not have to include the cushion pad when performing other QC tests. </p>
