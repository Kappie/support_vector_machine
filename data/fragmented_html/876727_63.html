  correlations. Because the amplitude values are not directly applied in the rank 
  order correlation, the measured strength of correlation may be weaker than in 
  linear correlation; however, if a rank order correlation can be demonstrated 
  then it is significant [e.g., <I>Sachs</I>, 1982].</P>
<P>We calculated a non-parametric correlation between rank calculated 
  stress change per fault dislocation element and rank seismicity rate change 
  for the three major strike-slip faults discussed above.
