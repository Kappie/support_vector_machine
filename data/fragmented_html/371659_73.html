ure mathematical problem embedded in this application
   C        is finding the nearest point on a triaxial ellipsoid to a
   C        specified point.  The SPICELIB routine <a href="../spicelib/nearpt.html">NEARPT</a> solves this
   C        problem.  <a href="../spicelib/nearpt.html">NEARPT</a> deals with an ellipsoid that is centered
   C        at the origin and whose axes are lined up with the x, y,
   C        and z coordinate axes.  So to use <a href="../spicelib/nearpt.html">NEARPT</a>, we'll have
