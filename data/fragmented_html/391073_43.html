<strong>LNG Interchangeability Issue</strong><br>
<br>
<ul>Imported LNG may have different physical characteristics from domestically produced gas.  The ability to substitute one gas supply for another is known as interchangeability. Interchangeability is often measured by Wobbe Index of the gas which is derivative of the higher heat content and specific gravity of the gas.  The differing characteristics of imported LNG may appear to present operational issues
