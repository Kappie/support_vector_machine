d. (b) The post-Loma Prieta change in normal 
  stress is resolved on the San Gregorio fault. Increased seismicity occurred 
  even where the fault was clamped by the Loma Prieta earthquake.

<P>Following the Loma Prieta earthquake, seismicity along the 
  Monterey Bay segment of the San Gregorio fault increased (Figures 5,6). To investigate 
  whether the seismicity rate increase resulted from triggering by the Loma Prieta 
  earthquake, we projected the post Loma Prieta shear and normal componen
