<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.&#9;What fraction of the aerosol mass observed at a given location derives from primary emissions versus secondary</B>, i.e., particulate matter formed in the atmosphere by chemical conversion from gaseous precursors?  This is an example of a question that can be answered only by characterization of the material, together with accurate characterization of primary sources and gas-to-particle conversion processes.  Although this is not a process
