e of astronomers and 
high-energy physicists that traditionally form separate research communities 
but are all involved in some way in the detailed studies of the very nearby, 
active, massive galaxy Centaurus A/NGC 5128. Since its discovery as a radio 
source 60 years ago, the radio galaxy Centaurus A (NGC 5128) has attracted 
great interest from the international astrophysics and high energy physics 
communities, and yet this will be the first conference devoted to this 
intriguing source.<p>
