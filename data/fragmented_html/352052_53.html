Whole lysates derived from <em>E. coli</em> after 20 h under expression conditions displayed the defined spectral maximum of this CYP at 448 nm. The progressive increase in the Soret absorbance peak from cell extracts over time was accompanied by an intensifying red color of the bacteria and the periplasmic fractions.</p><p><span class="head3">CYP105D1 is ta
