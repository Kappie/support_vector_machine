ay and an ellipsoid, apply the distortion
map to both. Because the distortion map is linear, the ray maps to another
ray, and the ellipsoid maps to the unit sphere. The resulting intersection
problem is easy to solve. Having found the points of intersection of the
new ray and the unit sphere, if any, we apply the inverse distortion map to
these points, and we're done.
