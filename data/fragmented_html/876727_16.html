 on the San Andreas fault after 1985, whereas the imposed stresses appear 
  instead to have inhibited seismicity [<I>Miller</I>, 1996], perhaps through 
  a compaction weakening mechanism [<I>Miller et al.</I>, 1996] that was inhibited 
  by unclamping from the 1982-1985 thrust events. Based on these calculations, 
  it appears possible that some faults respond to normal stress perturbations 
  in a predictable fashion while others such as the San Andreas might not.</P>
