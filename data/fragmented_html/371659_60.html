<H3> Finding the semi-axes of an ellipse from generating vectors
</H3><P><BR><BR>
   The routine <a href="../spicelib/saelgv.html">SAELGV</a> finds the semi-axes of an ellipse in
   three-dimensional space, given two generating vectors. The generating
   vectors are not required to be linearly independent. If V1, V2, SMAJOR,
   and SMINOR are declared as follows,

   DOUBLE PRECISION      V1     ( 3 )
   DOUBLE PRECISION      V2     ( 3 )
