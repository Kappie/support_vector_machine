   fact an ellipse as we've claimed.
<P>
 
   Since the vector CENTER simply translates the set, we may assume without
   loss of generality that it is the zero vector. So we'll re-write our
   expression for the alleged ellipse as
<P>
 
<PRE>
   cos(theta) * V1    +    sin(theta) * V2
</PRE>
   where theta is a real number in the interval (-pi, pi]. We'll give the
   name S to the above set of vectors. Without loss of generality, we can
   assume that V1 and V2 lie in the x-y plane. Therefore, we can tre
