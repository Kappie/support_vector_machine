  belt increased where the faults were unclamped. The strong dependence of seismicity 
  change on normal stress change implies a high coefficient of static friction. 
  In contrast, we observe that faults with significant offset (&gt; 50-100 km) 
  behave differently; microseismicity on the Hayward fault diminished where right-lateral 
  shear stress was reduced, and where it was unclamped by the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
  We observe a similar response on the San Andreas fault zone in southern C
