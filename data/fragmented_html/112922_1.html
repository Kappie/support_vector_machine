<b>In this molecular dynamics simulation, 
a nanosized polymer droplet is formed in a solvent
and forced through a micron-sized orifice.
Submicron polymer particles exhibit unique
properties that could make them extremely useful for optical
displays and industrial coatings.</b></font>

In 1998 Don W. Noid, Bobby Sumpter, and
Michael D. Barnes, all CASD researchers,
developed a novel way to prepare electrically
charged, submicron-diameter, spherical composite
particles of organic poly
