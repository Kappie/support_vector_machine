ress component. 
  Here we attempt to quantify the strength and significance of those associations 
  using a nonparametric or rank order correlation. There are two main advantages 
  to a rank order correlation: (1) correlation is made between two distributions 
  of the rank of data values rather than the amplitude of the values, which prevents 
  outliers from having an undue affect on correlation strength, and (2) the complete 
  distribution of ranks is known, which allows significance tests on measure
