r.&nbsp; Take a scenario for instance.&nbsp; If a tornadic storm
followed the averages for the 38 storms, the hook or pendant signature
would become apparent at 53 minutes prior to the violent tornado.&nbsp;
The radar operator would see the meso max rotational velocity and gate
to gate shear increase at 48 minutes prior to the violent tornado.&nbsp;
With the radar signatures and meso velocities coming up, the radar operator
issues a tornado warning valid for 30 minutes.
