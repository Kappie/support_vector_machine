velength studies and associated synergies with major facilities 
at all wavelengths, and on the perspectives for future high energy 
astrophysics missions.<p>

The main scientific issues to be addressed are:<p>

* STELLAR OBJECTS AND SUPERNOVA REMNANTS

	 - Cool and hot stars
	 - Star-forming regions 
	 - Neutron Stars
	 - Supernovae and SN remnants and pulsar wind nebulae
	 - Pulsars and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters 

* BLACK HOLES AND COMPACT OBJECTS  

        - Matter under extreme conditions
