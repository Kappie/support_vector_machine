. Thus the San Gregorio fault appears 
  insensitive to normal stress changes despite their relatively greater amplitudes. 
  This result indicates that the San Gregorio fault has low friction if standard 
  failure criteria are applied.</P>
<P>Most of the earthquakes that we have ascribed to the San Gregorio 
  fault occurred beneath Monterey Bay (Figure 6), and were more poorly located 
  than events of similar size onshore because of the lack of network stations 
  offshore.
