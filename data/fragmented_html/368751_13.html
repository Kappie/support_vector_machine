th low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. mecA transcription its regulated by its repressor and signal transducer, mecI and mecRI, respectively. Expression of mec encoded methicillin resistant is often heterogeneous. In these isolates the majority of the bacterial population expresses resistance at a low level upon exposure to beta-lactam antibiotics, a highly resistant population is selected. We grew S. aureus and S. epidermidis isolates with heterotypic resistance expression in broth containing oxacill
