ozone.  They are very heterogeneous in composition and sources, ranging from seasalt, dust and tire particles, to sulfates, nitrate, organics and soot, as well as mixtures of these materials.  Some of the aerosols are emitted directly as particles whereas others form in the atmosphere from gaseous precursors, both anthropogenic and natural.  While in the atmosphere aerosol particles grow in size and evolve in composition through gas adsorption and coagulation and can change phase by deliquescence and efflor
