       So's my youngsters and my wife,<br>
              When, the papers is a tellin&rsquo;<br>
              Of the good and solid lump<br>
              Of money sent to help the poor,<br>
              He who works must be a chump!<br>
              Every corner of our back room<br>
              Is piled solid up with coal,<br>
              And my wife's got such fine clothing<br>
              You can't touch her with a pole.<br>
              Every cupboard, box and. barrel<br>
