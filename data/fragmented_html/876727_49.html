  (using the slip model of <I>Wald</I> [1991]) shows good agreement with the seismicity 
  rate change as shown in Figure 5; the best fit to the seismicity pattern is 
  with an oblique rake of 160û that matches in a broad sense the oblique focal 
  mechanisms calculated for the San Gregorio fault [<I>Gallardo et al.</I>, 1997;
