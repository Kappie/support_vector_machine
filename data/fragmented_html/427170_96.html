	         <li> Citral is a naturally occurring aliphatic aldehyde of the terpene series and is an isomeric mixture of geranial and neral. In this study, urinary metabolites of citral in male F344 rats were characterized. Stereospecific oxidation of citral at the C-8 methyl was investigated, as was the hydrolytic sensitivity of biliary and urinary metabolites. For metabolite identification, urine was collec
