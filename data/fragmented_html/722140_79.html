ve results of CEA and Ber-EP4 immunohistochemistry allowed us to exclude reactivity of the bioptic samples with epithelial-binding antibodies, whereas results of immunohistochemistry for cytokeratins, calretinin, EMA and HBME-1 indicated reactivity of the neoplastic tissue with antibodies that preferentially bind cells of mesothelial origin (Attanoos and Gibbs 1997; King and Hasleton 2001). As a discrminant marker, calretinin (a calcium-binding protein) shows high sensitivity and specificity for mesotheliom
