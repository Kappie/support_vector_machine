fungi, desiccation, and direct radiation.</P>

<P ALIGN="justify">Chickarees are small, very active mammals with very
high rates of metabolism. Smith (1968) and others estimate that their
basal metabolic rate is 1.76 times that expected from the
weight-to-metabolism relation for most mammals. He suggests that, if the
metabolic rate for most mammals were
