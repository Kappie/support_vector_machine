direct changes are sometimes expressed as damage to the ecosystem; yet
these damages are restricted to relatively small areas and do not seem
to affect adversely the larger specimens. The more subtle, indirect

many necessary changes now being implemented will better ensure the
future integrity of the species.</P>
