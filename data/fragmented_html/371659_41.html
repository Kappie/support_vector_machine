   <a href="../spicelib/surfnm.html">SURFNM</a> is useful in any application requiring a local surface coordinate
   system with one coordinate plane tangent to the surface at a specified
   point. It is also useful for computing emission and solar incidence
   angles at a surface point. <a href="../spicelib/surfnm.html">SURFNM</a> is also used as a utility by SPICELIB
   routines that convert between geodetic and other coordinate systems.
