<I>Byerlee's</I> [1990] model, fluid pressure could 
  increase gradually from below hydrostatic following an earthquake to nearly 
  lithostatic just prior to the next earthquake. <I>Rice</I> [1992] suggested 
  that metamorphic fluids from beneath the seismogenic zone could be tapped by 
  vertical faults and kept at high pressures. In his model, the mean stresses 
  are much higher inside the fault zone than outside which keeps the high pore 
  fluid pressures less than the least principal stress inside
