y and orotactile inputs.</p><p>Withdrawal of the inflamed hyperalgesic forepaw was significantly inhibited by the combination of intraoral infusion of sucrose solution and nonnutritutive suckling. Future studies will need to analyze the contribution of each component including intraoral sucrose, nonnutritive suckling and maternal contact, and hyperalgesia attenuation. The present result is consistent with that obtained from noninflamed naive animals. Sugar solutions or milk produce antinociception in infant
