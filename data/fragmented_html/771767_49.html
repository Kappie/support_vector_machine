eft">Walleye are predaceous fish, consuming zooplankton, aquatic
insects, and fish in that order as they grow from first-feeding to juveniles in
ponds. Cohort cannibalism is the name given to sibling cannibalism, where fry of about equal size attack each other.
Most mortality from cohort cannibalism occurs from trunk attacks, not the result
of successful consumption of the prey, which is from the tail first. Cannibalism
begins as soon as the fry begin feeding and it can be a major factor in total
mortality
