impermeable through gouge buildup; coseismically pressurized pore fluids could 
  be trapped and negate imposed normal stress changes, whereas in more limited 
  offset faults fluids could rapidly escape. The difference in behavior between 
  minor and major faults may explain why frictional failure criteria that apply 
  intermediate coefficients of static friction can be effective in describing 
  the broad distributions of aftershocks that follow large earthquakes, since 
  many of these events occur bot
