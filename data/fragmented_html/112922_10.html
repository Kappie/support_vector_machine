mory elements on each nanoparticle,"
Barnes says. "If we are successful, this technique could be useful for the
proposed development of a quantum computer."

"We have to learn how to make a variety of mixed-polymer particles and
sort them by size," Noid says. "Then we must use spectroscopic tools to
measure their electron energy levels experimentally and verify that the
mixed-polymer particles behave like artificial atoms, as predicted by our
simulations."
