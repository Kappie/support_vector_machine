turns the location of the intercept point in XPT and sets FOUND to
   .TRUE. if the ray does intersect the ellipsoid. Otherwise, FOUND is set
   to .FALSE. and XPT is set to the zero vector.

   A typical use of <a href="../spicelib/surfpt.html">SURFPT</a> would be finding the surface intercept of an
   instrument boresight ray on an extended body. <a href="../spicelib/surfpt.html">SURFPT</a> can also be used to
   for a low-accuracy determination of whether a star is occulted by an
   extended body. S
