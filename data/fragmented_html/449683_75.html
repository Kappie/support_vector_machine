ase of <b>Jones et al. v. Shalala</b>, SSA must cease &#8220;triple counting&#8221; nonrecurring income for the purpose of determining Federal and/or State supplementary payments in supplemental security income (SSI) cases for residents of the Ninth Judicial Circuit. Triple counting, or a reduction of three months' benefits because of income for a single month, occurs because the first month of eligibility is the budget month for each of the first three months' payments.</td></tr>
