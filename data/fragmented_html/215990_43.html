 25 ml of YM salts buffer at pH 7.0 (<a href="#B23" class="cite-reflink bibr">23</a>), and culture supernatants were frozen. After thawing, culture supernatants were concentrated 25-fold by rotary evaporation. Next, high-molecular-weight EPS was precipitated from concentrated supernatants by adding 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol as described by Breedveld and coworkers (<a href="#B10" class="cite-reflink bibr">10</a>). High-molecular-weight EPS was then removed from concentrated supernatants by centrifugation
