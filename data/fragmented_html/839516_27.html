hortage of almost 11 <ABBR>Mt</ABBR> of elemental sulfur for agricultural applications could be supplied by 45 <ABBR>Mt</ABBR> of ammonium sulfate (Ellison, 1999). This much <ACRONYM>FGD</ACRONYM> product could result from 170,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity production if plants burned coal containing 2.5-3 percent sulfur. A relatively large powerplant generates 1,000 <ABBR>MWh</ABBR> of electricity per year. Thus, 170 large powerplants burning high-sulfur coal and using <ACRONYM>FGD</ACRONYM> metho
