escribed in the text, can explain the observed seismicity 
  rate decrease. (b) A Coulomb failure criterion with a high coefficient of friction 
  (0.8) does not match the seismicity as well as the shear stress component. (c) 
  A Coulomb criterion with a high coefficient of friction (0.8) and including 
  stress-induced pore pressure changes can describe the seismicity rate change 
  following the Loma Prieta earthquake.

Thus the apparent low frictional state of the southern Hayward fault can be
