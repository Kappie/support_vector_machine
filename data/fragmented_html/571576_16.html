<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Climate influence of anthropogenic aerosols.</B>  Anthropogenic aerosols scatter solar radiation and modify cloud reflectivity, thereby exerting a cooling influence on climate.  This cooling influence is thought to be offsetting a substantial fraction of anthropogenic greenhouse warming, but its magnitude is highly uncertain.  This uncertainty precludes confident empirical detection of climate change due to
