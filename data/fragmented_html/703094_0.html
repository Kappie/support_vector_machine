 Also, notice
the lack of data to the left of the dish.  This image illustrates well, the
continuity of coverage of the RASCAL scanning system.  Each spot is 
approximately 1.0 meters in diameter and spaced 1.67 meters in both along
track and cross track.  This produces a very nice sampling of the terrain 
below (when your energy stays within bounds).
