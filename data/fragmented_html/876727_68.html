ry oblique faults of the southern 
  Santa Clara Valley thrust belt for responses to changes in the calculated fault-normal 
  component of stress. Because of the proximity of the faults of the southern 
  Santa Clara Valley thrust belt to the Loma Prieta slip plane at depth, the calculated 
  stress changes are large (approaching 25 bars between 5 and 10 km from the rupture 
  zone) (Figures 9,10,11). In our analysis we assumed that the strain in the Santa 
  Clara Valley thrust belt involves right-lateral
