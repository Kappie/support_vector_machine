   working group report [1]. Many geometry problems involving triaxial
   ellipsoids give rise to ellipses as `mathematical byproducts'. Ellipses
   are also used in modelling orbits and planetary rings.

   SPICELIB contains a substantial set of subroutines that solve common
   mathematical problems involving ellipses and triaxial ellipsoids. This
