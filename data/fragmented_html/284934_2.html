 the research by lining up 200 meters (656 feet) away and walking towards the net, shooing the birds ahead of them. Birds captured in the net are easy to identify before banding and release.

Although other species are captured, Grasshopper Sparrow and Baird's Sparrow are the mist-net target species.">
