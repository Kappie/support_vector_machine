nce of the RFD with only a very slight reaction by meso max
rotational velocity (Figure 5).&nbsp; The mesocyclone during the rapid
building period is very strong and stable.&nbsp; The lack of fluctuation
and the linear increase can partially be explained by an idea taken from
(Brooks et al. 1993) which states that mid-level shear is important to
sustaining stable long-lived mesocyclones especially at low-levels.&nbsp;
This idea is supported by the synoptic portion of our study which showed
that 34 of
