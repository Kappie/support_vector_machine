vation of these pathways did not affect lumbar spinal dorsal horn neurons until neonatal day 10, with patterns similar to the adult profile not appearing until neonatal days 22&#x02013;24 (<a href="#B38" class="cite-reflink bibr">38</a>). The delay in functional activation of descending pathways may be due in part to delayed maturation of spinal interneurons or to insufficient levels of serotonin or norepinephrine in descending axons (<a href="#B38" class="cite-reflink bibr">38</a>). The maturation of the s
