We found higher correlation 
  values between shear stress change and seismicity rate change than between normal 
  stress change and seismicity (Figure 8). Additionally, we substituted numerical 
  values for the coefficient of friction and calculated Coulomb stress changes 
  for the three faults. Correlations were stronger for the lowest values of friction. 
  We calculated that the change in correlation is stronger for the Hayward and 
  San Gregorio faults than with the San Andreas fault; the significa
