anges implies higher 
  than hydrostatic pore fluid pressure within the fault zones, low intrinsic friction, 
  or pore fluids distributed in fault-parallel cracks such that coseismic fluid 
  pressure changes counteract the inhibition or encouragement of slip expected 
  from normal stress changes. Our results do not allow us to discriminate among 
  the various sealed-fault-zone models, but do suggest that fault permeability 
  may be the most important aspect to the apparent strength of a fault, with the
