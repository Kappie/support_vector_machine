membrane and processed to yield authentic, heme-incorporated P450 within the periplasmic space. Cell extract and whole-cell activity studies showed that the periplasmically located CYP105D1 competently catalyzed NADH-dependent oxidation of the xenobiotic compounds benzo&#x0005b;<em>a</em>&#x0005d;pyrene and erythromycin, further revealing the presence in the <em>E. coli</em> periplasm of endogenous functional redox partners. This system offers substantial advantages for the application of P450 enzymes to wh
