ughly the field of view of the Galileo SSI camera and
   slightly more than the field of view of the Voyager 2 narrow angle ISS
   camera), this technique will work for observations of the Earth as long
   as the limb of the Earth is in the field of view, and as long as the
   altitude of the observer above the Earth is at least 52 meters (assuming
   a spherical Earth with all radii equal to the equatorial radius).
