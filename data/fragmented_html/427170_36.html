 treated rats. The hyperplastic and normal rat prostates did not show immunoreactivity towards the other epithelial cell markers such as epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembrionic antigen and alpha-fetoprotein antisera. Prostatic specific acid phosphatase and to a lesser extent prostatic specific antigen might represent valuable markers for comparative studies of prostatic hyperplasia in rodents.
