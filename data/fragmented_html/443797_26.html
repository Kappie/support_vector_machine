             Q  Sandy, as you said earlier, the Bosnian government
doesn't have at this stage an incentive to stop the fighting outside of
Sarajevo since they are on the offensive.  What kind of argument can you
use to convince them to accept this general cessation of hostilities?
Or is it maybe that you think that it's not the right time to stop the
fighting since there is maybe a possibility to change the map on the
ground to make negotiations easier later?
