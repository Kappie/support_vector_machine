With increasing detergent/phospholipid molar ratios the signals became considerably broader and the heat capacity maxima shifted toward lower temperatures, e.g., an up scan in an equimolar C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC mixture yielded a maximum at 37&#x000b0;C and a small peak at 38.8&#x000b0;C (Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=55352&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F3" class="fig-table-link
