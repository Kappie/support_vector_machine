<P>The Coulomb failure criterion assumes that the coefficient 
  of friction <IMG SRC="/research/deformation/modeling/papers/baystress/Image15.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11> 
  is a constant. However, it has been demonstrated that <IMG SRC="/research/deformation/modeling/papers/baystress/Image15.gif" WIDTH=11 HEIGHT=11> 
  is not constant, but is instead time and velocity dependent [e.g., <I>Dieterich</I>, 
  1978; <I>Ruina</I> 1983]. The dependence is suggested
