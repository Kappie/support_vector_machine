in. Conversion to homotypic resistance occurred 6-12 hs following exposure to concentrations of oxacillin (0.4-1.0microg/ml) that induce a lag in growth. No other antibacterial agent and no change in growth conditions caused the conversion to homotypic resistance; it was beta-lactam specific. We also confirmed previous observations that conversion to homotypic expression did not require on increase in mecA transcription and that the conversion was due to selection of mutation(s) rather than induction of reg
