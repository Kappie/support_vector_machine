 1992 M=6.1 Joshua Tree, and the 28 June 
  M=7.4 Landers and M=6.5 Big Bear earthquakes in southern California as sources. 
  We investigated the stress transfer using four different rupture models for 
  the Loma Prieta event [<I>Lisowski et al.</I>, 1990; <I>Beroza</I>, 1991; <I>Marshall 
  et al.</I>, 1991; <I>Wald</I>, 1991] because many of the faults in our Bay area 
  model are located very near the rupture plane (as close as 5 km) and are thus 
  sensitive to small differences in the slip model as p
