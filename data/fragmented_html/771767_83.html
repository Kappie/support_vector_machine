turbidity and other factors. Because
walleye fry have been too difficult to raise in experimental systems, relatively
little information is available on their sensitivity. High pH (&gt;9.8) may be
lethal to walleye in the absence of ammonia, but pH as low as 8.3 shifts the
equilibrium of ammonia to the unionized form (NH3) that is more toxic to fish.</p>
