ulatory pathways. Finally, we looked for changes in the transcription of some genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis or stress response by Northern Blot analysis. There was an increase in femAB and femC, but not change in femD, PBP1, 2 and 4 or SigB transcription. The increase in femAB expression following the heterotypic to homotypic conversion was not associated with mutations in DNA sequence suggesting involvement of regulator(s).</p>
