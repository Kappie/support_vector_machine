e variability of mtDNA was analysed in local sheep breeds reared throughout Turkey, for which a fragment of the <em>D-loop</em> region and the complete cytochrome <em>b</em> were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses performed independently for the <em>D-loop</em> and the <em>Cyt b</em> gene revealed three clearly separated clusters indicating three major maternal lineages, two of which had been previously described as types B and A. The new type, C, was present in all the breeds analysed and showed considerable
