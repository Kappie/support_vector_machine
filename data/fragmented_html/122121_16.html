d wings, sharp 
                bills, and deeply forked tails. They catch small fish by hovering, 
                beak pointed down, then plunging into the water. There are many 
                species of terns but only two are regularly seen in the Sanctuary, 
                often on their way to and from shore on their fishing trips for 
                sand lance. <img src="images/tern.gif" width="150" height="114" align="right"></font></p>
