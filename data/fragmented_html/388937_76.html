ncentration was kept constant (2.5 mM) so as to enable a direct comparison with respect to the transition enthalpy of the lipids. A heating scan in the C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub>/DPPC system at a molar ratio 1:2 yielded endothermic peaks at 36&#x000b0;C, 38&#x000b0;C, and 38.7&#x000b0;C, respectively (Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=55352&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F3" class="fig-table-link " onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)">3</a><em>A</em>). The signal at 36&#x000b0;C shifted to 3
