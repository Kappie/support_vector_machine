med during the activation of serum complement, are extremely potent biologic peptides and are thought to be under the rigid control of specific serum-derived regulators or inactivators, including the anaphylatoxin inactivator (AI) and the chemotactic factor inactivator (CFI). Our understanding of the biologic importance and implication of these regulators in inflammatory reactions is primarily based on <strong>in vitro</strong> observations, and there is only limited data on their <strong>in vivo</strong> i
