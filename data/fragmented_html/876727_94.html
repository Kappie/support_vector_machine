consider two end-member cases of coseismic fluid 
  pressure changes below, one in which fluid-filled pores are isotropic, and one 
  in which they are strongly anisotropic.</P>
<P><B>5.2.1. Isotropic coseismic pore fluid pressure changes. 
  </b>If we make some simplifying assumptions, we can calculate a theoretical 
  maximum pore fluid pressure change inside the major right-lateral faults we 
  investigated. We assume that these faults are undrained because of low permeability
