al processes clearly play an important role in determining concentrations of air pollutants generally and of aerosols in particular, these fundamental processes do not vary greatly from day to day.  What does change is the meteorology.  This meteorological variability makes it crucial to accurately describe the meteorology in order to establish the accuracy of model representations of aerosol chemical and physical processes.  As indicated above it is intended that TAP closely coordinate its activities with
