 explained 
by pore fluid pressure changes using an isotropic model without invoking higher 
than hydrostatic pressures. However, when we applied similar calculations to the 
San Gregorio and San Andreas fault zones, we found that the magnitudes of calculated 
normal stress changes were much greater than the shear stress changes (Figures 
5 and 7), so that the Coulomb failure stresses calculated with pore fluid changes 
using an isotropic model could not be fit to the seismicity using high coefficients 
of
