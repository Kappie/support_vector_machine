1,000 nmol of CYP105D1 has been obtained from this expression system, comparing well with previous studies on this and other CYPs. Previous studies reporting the heterologous expression of CYP105D1 under the control of the strongly inducible <em>tac</em> promoter obtained levels of CYP105D1 of just over 400 nmol of cytosolic CYP per liter of culture (<a href="#B20" class="cite-reflink bibr">20</a>). The present results indicated that heme could be successfully incorporated into CYP during folding of matured
