Research efforts to find new applications and increase the use of <ACRONYM>CCP</ACRONYM>'s continue. Researchers at the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale are working on the design for utility poles made of <ACRONYM>CCP</ACRONYM>'s and organic binders. The researchers expect that the final product will be comparable to or even superior to the traditional creosote-coated wooden poles. In addition to eliminating the need for weatherproofing with creosote, which poll
