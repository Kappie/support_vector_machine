r of earthquakes during 
  the 7 years after the Loma Prieta earthquake per fault element plotted against 
  calculated post Loma Prieta up-dip or thrust shear stress changes. Little or 
  no correlation is observed.

<P>A similar relationship between earthquake occurrence and normal 
  stress changes was observed in the 1997 Umbria-Marche earthquake sequence in 
  Italy. In this sequence, Coulomb stress changes (with m'=0.4) could explain 
  3 of the 5 ruptures, while unclamping could explain all
