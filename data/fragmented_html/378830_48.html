 wavelengths than to terrestrial radiation. These properties create the large surface heating that characterizes the greenhouse effect, by means of which the atmosphere allows a considerable fraction of solar radiation to penetrate to the earth's surface and then traps (more precisely, intercepts and re-radiates) much of the upward terrestrial infrared radiation from the surface and lower atmosphere. The downward re- radiation further enhances surface warming and is the prime process causing the greenhouse
