savings and productivity gains. These systems offer unique capabilities for enhancing indoor air quality and comfort and are the best choice in many applications. In supermarkets, TAT humidity control is used to reduce the need for expensive, energy-consuming defrost cycles. Conventional vapor-compression cooling designs don't treat temperature and humidity loads separately. Consequently, oversized compressors are installed to dehumidify the incoming air. To meet humidity requirements, vapor-compression sys
