A commonly observed feature of meiotic recombination is the highly non-uniform distribution of meiotic crossovers in the genome. It is still not clear, however, why crossovers are preferentially localized in hotspots instead of being uniformly distributed. To study the mechanisms responsible for the formation and disappearance of
