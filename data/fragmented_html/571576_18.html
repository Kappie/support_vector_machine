rties that govern their light scattering and cloud nucleating ability.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-micrometer aerosols are highly efficient scatterers of solar radiation; this is the phenomenon that is responsible for impairment of visibility associated with urban photochemical smog.  A further consequence of this light scattering is that some of the scattered radiation is returned to space instead of being absorbed at the surface of the earth, as would otherwise be the case.  This direct light scattering
