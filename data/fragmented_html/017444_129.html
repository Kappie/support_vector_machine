something is inequitable, then you ought to have some real, bona fide evidence
as to whether it is inequitable or not. It doesn’t surprise me though, that
your data is unreliable. When I first came to Congress 17 years ago, I had the
greatest confidence in the GAO, but since then, I have seen the GAO conduct two
investigations in my district. Now I have no more confidence in the GAO and
their conclusions than I have in the man in the moon.
