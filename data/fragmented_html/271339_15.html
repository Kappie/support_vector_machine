food intake of the dams and growth of the pups did not vary, selenium and GPx activities were dependent upon quantity and form of Se consumed.^Using slope-ratio analysis linear increases in blood, tissue and milk Se content the bioavailabilities were SEM>SEY>SEL.^Maximal GPx depended on the form of dietary Se with SEM>SEY>SEL.^Maximal GPx occurred at 0.25 ppm dietary Se as SEM and SEY, but did not reach this activity when fed at 0.5 ppm Se as SEL.^These results indicate that regardless of form, the NRC requ
