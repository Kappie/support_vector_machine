transonic flow&#190;developed in 7- by 10-foot wind tunnel at
NACA Langley Laboratory. A similar development was conducted by
Lockheed in the California Cooperative Tunnel during the same
period. This technique was a logical step from the earlier wing-flow
technique developed by the Langley Flight Research Division, and
it permitted testing in the range of Mach numbers from low subsonic
to Mach 1.2 until the slotted-throat transonic tunnel was developed
and put into operation at Langely
