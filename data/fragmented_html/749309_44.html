 high resolution
X-ray spectroscopy workshop, to take place on 19-20 March 2009 at the
UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory.<p>

For the first time this year we will also be running a 'high resolution
X-ray spectroscopy school', prior to the workshop, on 17-18 March 2009.
Aimed at PhD students and postdocs working both in and outside X-ray
astronomy, it will be an opportunity to learn the principles and
practice of high resolution X-ray spectroscopy as applied to a range
of stellar, Galactic and extragalact
