<I>Scholz</I>, 1987; <I>Chester et al.</I>, 1993]. Thus, if fault-zone 
  fluids are important, the differences we observe between faults with limited 
  slip and those with more significant slip may have less to do with fault strength 
  or internal friction than their relative permeability.</P>

<P>We have sought to test the hypothesis that static stresses 
  affect seismicity rates on nearby faults. Such stresses may also affect local 
  pore flu
