 Boy Scouts of America, all hikers must maintain a high standard of conduct along the Scout Trail in order that others may also enjoy the hike. Stay off the paved roads as much as possible. Show courtesy to the people you meet along the way.<br />
<br />
In some areas, the Al Scheller Scout Trail runs parallel to privately owned property. Stay on the trail and away from private property. Do not stop at any of the homes along the way, and do not stop to pet dogs or other pets you may encounter.<br />
