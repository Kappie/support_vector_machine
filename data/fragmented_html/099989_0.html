n: Hi, again.  I understand that a slice of my 4-d object would be a 
3-d object, but can I put a series of 3-d objects together, and find an 
approximation of a 4-d object?  I mean, with a lot of squares, one on the top 
of the other, I could get a cube.  If I put many cubes on top of one another, 
would that be my 4d object? I guess not...

There is a representation of a 4-D cube called a "tesseract."  It 
is similar to what you have described but n
