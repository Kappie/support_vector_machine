star rats the maximal increases recorded being 81 and 27% respectively. No alterations in plasma triglycerides or total cholesterol were detected. The differential induction of the mixed-function oxides system and the differential proliferation of peroxisomes in these two strains of rat suggest that citral may be metabolized differently in the two strains. Peroxisomal and possibly also mitochondrial changes are involved in the action of citral on lipid metabolism. [Jackson GM et al; Food Chem Toxicol 25 (7)
