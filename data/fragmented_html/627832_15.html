						<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Corals that grow in sunlit areas depend on tiny algae called zooxanthellae that live in their soft tissue. The zooxanthellae help provide oxygen and food for the polyps. Corals that live in deep water, where there is no sunlight, do not have zooxanthellae.</font>
