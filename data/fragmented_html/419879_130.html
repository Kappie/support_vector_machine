 to second sets, so a difference of 5&nbsp;dB or greater would be clinically significant. We speculate further that if listeners heard 12 repetitions of speech in babble before receiving a treatment, additional improvements due to learning would be slight. Further study would be required to confirm this.</p><p>Because the SRT in babble improves over time, we speculated that stronger correlations might result from comparing the acute ripple threshold with more stabilized, chronic SRT data.
