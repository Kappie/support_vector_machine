or book lice, are also numerous within the diminutive labyrinthine
passageways of the cone scales. Possessing chewing
mouth parts, they cause minute
damage to seeds that the opened cones may still retain, although

75% viability. This may result from strong vascular connections between
the seeds and cone scales.</P>
