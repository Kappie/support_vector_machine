es are necessary for various 
reasons. In some cases, there are inherent restrictions in test methods 
which warrant a deviation from a specific requirement in the method. 
For example, the sampling equipment specified in Method 5 is not 
appropriate at stack temperatures greater than 1200 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and in such cases, water-cooled probes are necessary. As another 
example, it is problematic to measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
at concentrations below 50 parts per million (ppm) usi
