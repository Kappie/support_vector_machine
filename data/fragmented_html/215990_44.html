 (12,000 &#x000d7; <em>g</em> for 10 min). Low-molecular-weight, ethanol-soluble polysaccharides were then purified from concentrated supernatants using gel permeation chromatography as described below.<p>Concentrated supernatants containing ethanol-soluble, extracellular low-molecular-weight polysaccharides were concentrated under vacuum. Samples were applied to a Sephadex G-25 column (1 by 52 cm) which was eluted at room temperature with 0.15 M ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) containing 7&#x00025; propanol (vol
