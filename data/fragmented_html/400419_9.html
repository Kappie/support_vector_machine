nt parallel to the magnetization and spin
antiparallel to the magnetization. Of course another potential source of
confusion is that the terms majority and minority in semiconductors are usually
used to refer to the carrier type, a different usage entirely.

Confusion can be avoided in communicating experimental results and relating
the sign of the electron spin polarization in the semiconductor to that of the
ferromagnet by carefully specifying quantities in terms of angular momentum in
