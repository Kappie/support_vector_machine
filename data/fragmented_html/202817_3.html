verlay target appropriate for placement inside the patterned wafer die. &nbsp;The NIST Scatterfield Targets feature groupings of eight lines and/or trenches which are not resolvable using visible bright-field microscopy. &nbsp;However, these repetitive patterns do yield a zero-order reflectivity which can be imaged; as our lines and trenches are formed in different photolithographic steps, the overlay offset can be derived from the relative displacement of these zero-order responses. &nbsp;Modeling of this
