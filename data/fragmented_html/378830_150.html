ameterizations against high resolution process models or data sets, testing models against proxy data of paleoclimatic changes and testing the sensitivity of models to radiative forcings of anthropogenic origin by computing their sensitivity to natural radiative forcings (e.g., season radiative forcing, volcanic dust forcing, orbital element variation forcings etc.) comprise a necessary set of validation-oriented exercises that all modelers should agree to perform. Similarly, impacts models should also be s
