setting up mist nets in the center of an 
        hourglass-shaped plot (7 hectares, or over 17 acres), 15 to 30 local volunteers 
        help conduct the research by lining up 200 meters (656 feet) away and 
        walking towards the net, shooing the birds ahead of them. Birds captured 
        in the net are easy to identify before banding and release. The same people 
        then herd birds from the other side of the nets and repeat the procedure 
        for five other plots at each site. Alth
