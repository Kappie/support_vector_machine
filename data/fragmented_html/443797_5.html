he battlefield, the Bosnian government is not immediately drawn to the
idea of a country-wide cessation of hostilities.  They, and in tandem
with the Bosnian Croat forces, have been making some substantial gains
in Western Bosnia, which goes well outside the
scope of the safe area commitments that NATO and the U.N. are
upholding.  But I think inside Sarajevo the assurance of restraint I
think played at least a part in the Bosnian Serb decision to comply
with the conditions.
