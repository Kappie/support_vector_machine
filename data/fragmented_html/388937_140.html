at the temperature-driven solubilization of saturated phospholipid bilayers by a nonionic detergent involves an ordering of the lipid acyl chains. A simple model of the ensuing mixed micelle is in good qualitative agreement with measurements of the residual latent heat. We believe that our results bear relevance to the issue of detergent solubilization of partially ordered microdomains in biological membranes.</p></div></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="sidebar-cell" width="145"><div class="side-section-
