watts of energy over every square meter of the earth were taken away in the ice age by some other mechanism at a global scale. But what could be such a mechanism? The obvious candidate would be a change in the composition of the earth's atmosphere which affects both its reflectivity and its heat trapping capacity (e.g. decreases in the well-known greenhouse effect or increases in atmospheric dust). But what evidence is there that greenhouse gases, for example carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, or water
