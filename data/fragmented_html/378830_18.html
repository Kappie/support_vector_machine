our climate theories embodied in mathematical models. Are there any other such natural experiments? The answer is "yes there are many," the two most prominent being (1) episodic volcanic eruptions which throw dust in the stratosphere that reflects for a few years a few watts per square meter of solar energy that otherwise would have reached the lower atmosphere and (2) the seasonal cycle. Let's consider volcanic eruptions first. Volcanic dust veils should cool the planet. In fact, the last major eruption, M
