assigning popular names was adopted by the Army and Navy.
Basic designation adopted was two-letter combination of the three
letters A (Air), S (Surface), U (Underwater), the first letter
indicating origin of missile, the second letter its objective,
to be followed by the letter &quot;M&quot; for missile. Thus a
surface-to-air missile was designated &quot;SAM.&quot;
