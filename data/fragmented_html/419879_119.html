ation ability ranging from 0.13 to 1.66 ripples/octave. The spectral-ripple threshold of our CI subjects, excluding the best performer, ranged from 0.60 to 3.33 ripples/octave. These thresholds were better than Henry et al.&#x02019;s previous results. There are two potential reasons for this difference: (1) We employed ripples which were sinusoidal in a decibel amplitude space, whereas Henry et al. used ripples which were sinusoidal in a linear amplitude space. Thus, the gaps between the ripple peaks were b
