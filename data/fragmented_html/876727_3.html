alifornia 
  after the Landers earthquake sequence. Additionally, the offshore San Gregorio 
  fault shows a seismicity rate increase where right-lateral/oblique shear stress 
  was increased by the Loma Prieta earthquake despite also being clamped by it. 
  These responses are consistent with either a low coefficient of static friction 
  or high pore fluid pressures within the fault zones. We can explain the different 
  behavior of the two styles of faults if those with large cumulative offset become
