<p> Figure 12. (a) Rank-order or nonparametric correlations between calculated 
  shear stress and the number of post-Loma Prieta earthquakes per model dislocation 
  element for 4 faults in the Santa Clara Valley thrust belt. The shear and normal 
  stress changes are considered as are Coulomb stress changes using a variety 
  of coefficients of friction. The strongest correlations are between seismicity
