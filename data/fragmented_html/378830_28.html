II. Overview Of Climate Modeling Fundamentals<P>

Engineers and scientists build models -- either mathematical or physical ones -- primarily to perform tests that are either too dangerous, too expensive, or perhaps impossible to perform with the real thing. To simulate the climate, a modeler needs to decide which components of the climatic system to include and which variables to involve. For example, if w
