				Most offices at the NIEHS are within a short distance of a set of recycling bins, which are emptied regularly by EAAC staff. In addition, most employees have wastebasket-sized receptacles at their desks that make it even more convenient to participate in the recycling effort. The well-designed recycling program at the NIEHS reflects the institute's commitment to protecting the environment.
