nge in 1&nbsp;dB steps) to minimize level cues. Subjects were asked to click on an on-screen button that was labeled 1, 2, and 3 after they were presented the stimuli. One stimulus (i.e., inverted ripple sound, test stimulus) was different from two others (i.e., standard ripple sound, reference stimulus). The subject&#x02019;s task was to discriminate the test stimulus from the reference stimuli. Feedback was not provided. The threshold was estimated by averaging the ripple spacing (the number of ripples/oc
