 
of +2.5).  I will present results of inelastic neutron scattering 
experiments on polycrystalline YBaFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.  In the charge ordered 
insulating ground state, spin dynamics in YBaFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> can be well 
understood in terms of eg superexchange interactions.  However, 
a dramatic shift in the spin wave spectrum at the Verwey transition 
with a softening and severe damping of zone-boundary spin waves in 
the valence-mixed but still antiferromagnetically ordered intermedia
