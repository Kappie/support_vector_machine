sycamore treatments in 
							2000. Nitrate levels for 2000 ranged from 4-6 ppm in the sweetgum planting, 
							12-32 ppm in the sycamore plantings. Calcium and magnesium concentrations in 
							soil water have also increased over the past two years, particularly in the 
							sycamore treatments. Increasing concentrations of nitrate, calcium and 
							magnesium in soil water is probably indicative of increased leaching (e.g., 
							rainfall). </FONT>
