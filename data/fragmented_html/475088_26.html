ditioning systems driven by waste heat are energy efficient and environmentally benign. According to one estimate, desiccant dehumidification alone could reduce total residential electricity demand by as much as 25% in humid regions and save about 400 trillion Btu of energy each year in buildings in the United States. Desiccant dehumidification can also prevent emission of more than 24 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and provide a drier, more comfortable, and cleaner indoor environment with
