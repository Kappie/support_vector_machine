These include cloudiness, radiative energy transport, turbulent convection, evapotranspiration, oceanic mixing processes, chemical processes, ecosystem processes, sea ice dynamics, precipitation, mountain effects and surface winds.<P>

In forecasting climatic change, then, validation of the model becomes imp
