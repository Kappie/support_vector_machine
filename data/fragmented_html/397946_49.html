FD decreases.&nbsp;
And when the RFD decreases, the meso velocities go down (only during the&nbsp;
cycling period).&nbsp; What may be happening during the cycling period
is that when the meso size increases, it has more influence on the neighboring
environment and pulls the RFD around deepening the meso resulting in higher
meso velocities.&nbsp; When the meso size decreases, it loses influence
and the RFD weakens.&nbsp; The meso fills and the meso velocities decrease
ending the cycle.
