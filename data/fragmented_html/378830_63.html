unt of climate change, is now being accounted for by coupling models of the atmosphere to models of the oceans, ice, soils, and biosphere (so-called earth system models -- ESMs). Early generations of such transient calculations with ESMs give much better agreement with observed climate changes on Earth than previous calculations in which equilibrium responses to CO2 doubling were the prime simulations available. When the transient models at the Hadley Center in the United Kingdom and the Max Planck Institut
