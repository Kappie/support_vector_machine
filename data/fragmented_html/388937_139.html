Methods</em>) the micellar solutions tend to aggregate very slowly at 4&#x000b0;C. Visible aggregation and precipitation of gel-state DPPC was observed after 24 h whereas the onset of DMPC precipitation was noticed after 1 week, suggesting that the micellar aggregates obtained after rapid cooling of the mixtures through the phase transition temperature represent a kinetically trapped state the stability of which depends on the gel-state free energy of the phospholipids.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown th
