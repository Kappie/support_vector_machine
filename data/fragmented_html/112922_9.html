uantum computing. In the gas phase these particles could speed up
reactions because their high surface area increases the opportunity for
contact and electron exchange between the particles and the reactant
species diffusing throughout the reaction chamber.

Quantum dots theoretically could be tuned to make each electron represent
a bit of information: Each electron with an up spin could be a "1" and each
electron with a down spin could be a "0." "We propose to use the droplet
technique to encode several me
