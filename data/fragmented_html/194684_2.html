om great distances 
        to explore caves on public lands. But they sometime leave their marks 
        behind. Broken formations, muddy footprints, graffiti, and litter can 
        all damage a cave's fragile ecosystem. BLM is responsible for protecting 
        caves from visitors, but it is also responsible for protecting visitors 
        from the dangers of caves. Passages in caves can go for miles, and visitors 
        can get trapped or lost. </font></p>
