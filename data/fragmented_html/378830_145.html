e, whereas multi- dimensional, dynamical models can provide geographic and temporal resolution needed for regional impact assessments and -- hopefully -- provide more realistic and detailed simulations, even if at much higher costs for construction, computation, diagnosis and interpretability. Since the real climate system is undergoing a transient response to regionally heterogeneous (patchy) forcings (e.g., aerosols and greenhouse gasses combined, which both vary over time and space), eventually it will b
