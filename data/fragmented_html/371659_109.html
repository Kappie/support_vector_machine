 instrument's boresight ray above a the
   limb of a body modelled by a triaxial ellipsoid.
<P>
 
   We assume that the angular separation of the boresight ray and the
   `down' direction (the direction of the normal to the limb plane that
   points away from the observer) is less than pi/2 radians. In practice,
   this criterion will usually be met when the limb of the body is in the
   instrument field of view.

   For example, in the case of a camera with a field of view of eight
   milliradians (ro
