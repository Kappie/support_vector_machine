This outcome parallels the results from behavioral studies and indicates that at least one target of these antinociceptive effects is at the level of the spinal cord.</p><p>There is considerable evidence that spinal nociceptive information is modulated by descending pain control systems in adult animals (see refs. <a href="#B29" class="cite-reflink bibr
