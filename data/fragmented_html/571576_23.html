her programs that are dealing with climate change research like the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) are focusing on the radiative effects of aerosols<B><I>, there is a major gap with respect to research to quantitatively describe the atmospheric life cycle of tropospheric aerosols as it pertains to this radiative forcing</B></I>. This research is again very much in the domain of atmospheric chemistry, building upon the techniques and capabilities of this discipline.  Ultimately what is r
