   C
   C     The ray direction vector is RAYDIR, so the ray is the
   C     set of points
   C
   C        OBSERV  +  t * RAYDIR
   C
   C     where t is any non-negative real number.
   C
   C     The `down' vector is just -OBSERV.  The vectors
   C     OBSERV and RAYDIR are spanning vectors for the plane
   C     we're interested in.  We can use <a href="../spicelib/psv2pl.html">PSV2PL</a> to represent
   C     this plane by a SPICELIB plane.
