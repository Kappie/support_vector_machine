mers of nearly uniform
size. They started by forming droplets of a dilute
solution of two polymers that do not ordinarily mix
together. For droplets less than 10 microns in
diameter, the solvent evaporates faster than the
polymer molecules could disentangle, resulting in
homogeneous mixed-polymer particles. Optical
probes were used to determine the material
homogeneity, size, and dielectric constant of the
particles. The work showed that material properties
of the particles could be tuned simply by adjustin
