.5 C. (Later on we will address the issue of the probability that warming above or below this range might occur, and how probabilities can even be assigned to this sensitivity.)<P>

Transient model simulations exhibit less immediate warming than equilibrium simulations because of the high heat holding capacity of the thermally massive oceans. However, that unrealized warming eventually expresses itself decades to centuries later. This thermal delay, which can lull us into underestimating the long-term amo
