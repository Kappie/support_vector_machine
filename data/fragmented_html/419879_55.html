an average level of 65&nbsp;dBA for the spectral-ripple, SRT, and CNC word test.</p><p><span id="Sec3"></span><div class="head2 head-separate">Experiment 1: Measuring the spectral-ripple threshold</div>Two-hundred pure-tone frequency components were summed to generate the rippled noise stimuli. The amplitudes of the components were determined by a full-wave rectified sinusoidal envelope on a logarithmic amplitude scale. The ripple peaks were spaced equally on a logarithmic frequency scale. The stimuli had a
