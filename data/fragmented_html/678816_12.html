he Keck adaptive optics system are a wavefront         sensor camera, a fast control computer and a deformable mirror. The wavefront         sensor camera measures distortions due to atmospheric turbulence using         light from the guide star. A control computer computes the wavefront distortion         up to 670 times a second and sends commands to the deformable mirror.         The deformable mirror, about six inches (15 cm) in diameter, is made out         of a thin sheet of reflective glass con
