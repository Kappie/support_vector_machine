s. Inflammation and/or hyperplasia of the forestomach occurred in about half of the male and female mice dosed with 1068 mg citral/kg. Citral gavage at doses that were equivalent to up to 10% in the diet (2280 mg/kg body weight) did not cause toxicity in rats, except for minimal hyperplasia of the squamous epithelium of the forestomach in high-dose males.
