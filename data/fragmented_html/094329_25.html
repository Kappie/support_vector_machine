> that replicates efficiently in cultured cells. FCV has become an important model system in our laboratory for the establishment of experimental approaches for study of the noncultivatable human caliciviruses. </p>
<p>Studies in progress include&nbsp;mapping&nbsp;genetic determinants in FCV and human caliciviruses involved in cell tropism and growth restriction, and study of the basic features of the viral replication cycle using infectious cDNA clones.</p>
