</B> 
<P>We test whether seismicity changes result from static stress 
  changes, but do not investigate dynamic stress changes. This is because the 
  temporal and spatial distribution of aftershocks used in this study is irregular 
  and appears consistent with static stress changes. Dynamic Coulomb stress changes 
  by their nature are limited to increases that immediately follow the triggering 
  event, whereas seismicity in the San Fr
