itical terrorist threats countries have faced over the past couple of decades.</p>

<p>And I'm going to argue, in a few moments, that that's not really true, that it's not really similar to those traditional threats. But I'll begin by saying that terrorism, of course, is not a movement, it's a tactic. But terrorism is a tactic that can be used in a war. And in that sense, the fact that one uses tools of terror as opposed to massed armies with flags and tanks doesn't mean that you're not dealing with a war.
