as to highlight common physics among different types of objects, rather than 
treating them separately. Focusing mainly on the results obtained with Suzaku, 
the conference will also cover new results from related missions, Chandra, 
XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, Swift, Fermi, and others.<p>

Topics to be covered include:<p>
<pre>
- Particle acceleration in cosmic shocks and jets (SNRs, Blazars,GRBs,..)
- X-ray diagnostics of cosmic hot plasmas (Galactic diffuse, SNRs, 
    clusters,..)
- Magnetic activities in st
