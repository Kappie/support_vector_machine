Parikh and Loizou (<a href="#CR22" class="cite-reflink bibr">2005</a>) additionally reported that background noise reduces spectral contrast, making it even more difficult for CI users to hear speech in noise. Thus, we expect that CI users with better spectral resolution will have better speech understanding in noise.</p><p>A
