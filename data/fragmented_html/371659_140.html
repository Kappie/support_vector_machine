   The same is true of the inverse of the distortion map.

   The utility of these facts is that frequently it's easier to find the
   intersection of the images under the distortion map of two sets than it
   is to find the intersection of the original two sets. Having found the
   intersection of the `distorted' sets, we apply the inverse distortion
   map to arrive at the intersection of the original sets. Some examples:
