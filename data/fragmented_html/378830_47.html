on. Furthermore, clouds (except for thin cirrus) absorb nearly all the infrared radiation that hits them, and then they reradiate energy almost like a black body at the temperature of the cloud surface -- colder than the earth's surface most of the time.<P>

The atmosphere is more opaque to terrestrial infrared radiation than it is to incoming solar radiation, simply because the physical properties of atmospheric molecules, cloud and dust particles tend on average to be more transparent to solar radiation
