e in Hamburg, Germany were also driven by both greenhouse gases (which heat) and sulfate aerosols (which cool), these time evolving simulations yielded much more realistic "fingerprints" of human effects on climate( e.g., Chapter 8 of IPCC, 1996a). More such computer simulations are needed to provide high confidence levels in the models, but scientists using coupled, transient simulations are now beginning to express growing confidence that current projections are plausible.<P>
