
three peaks occur at about the same time with the meso diameter peaking
a few minutes before the RFD at each peak.&nbsp; On a larger time scale,
the difference is that the meso diameter decreases and the RFD increases
during the hour prior to the violent tornado.&nbsp; On a smaller time scale,
as the meso diameter increases, the RFD&nbsp; increases.&nbsp; The meso
velocities also increase reacting to an increase of the RFD (only during
the cycling period).&nbsp; As the meso diameter decreases, the R
