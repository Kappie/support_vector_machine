  as are Coulomb stress changes using a variety of coefficients of friction. The 
  strongest correlations are between seismicity and shear stress changes or Coulomb 
  stress changes with small coefficients of friction. (b) The significance of 
  the difference in correlation between the lowest and highest correlation values 
  are shown and were calculated using Fisher's z-transformation.
