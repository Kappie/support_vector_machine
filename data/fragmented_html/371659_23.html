   In the code examples that follow, we will repeatedly use the variable
   names CENTER, V1, V2, and ELLIPS. Wherever these appear, they refer to
   the center and a pair of generating vectors for an ellipse, and a
   SPICELIB ellipse. These variables can always be assumed to have been
   declared as follows:
<P>
 
<PRE>
   INTEGER               UBEL
   PARAMETER           ( UBEL = 9 )
 
   DOUBLE PRECISION      ELLIPS ( UBEL )
   DOUBLE P
