 up with the proper number of max movers. I am also not sure if the job timeout settings are correct. Could someone please go through the config files and check the values? For the timeout settings, it should be something like:    Job Timeout Manager  WAN (lastAccess=43200;total=432000)  default (lastAccess=259200;total=432000)    For the max movers, I have compiled a list below.
