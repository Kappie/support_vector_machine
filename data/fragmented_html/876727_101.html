<p> Figure 14. Unlike the Hayward fault, neither (a) the San Gregorio fault nor 
  (b) the San Andreas fault responses to normal stress changes can be explained 
  by coseismic stress-induced pore fluid pressure changes. The faults are shown 
  using a Coulomb criterion with a high coefficient of friction (0.8) and including 
  stress-induced pore pressure changes. The difference between
