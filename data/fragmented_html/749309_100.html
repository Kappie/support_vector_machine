f "feeding" and "feedback." AGN feeding is
tightly correlated with redshift-dependent star formation in the host
galaxy. AGN feedback, in the form of relativistic jets, massive winds,
and intense radiation, has been invoked to solve a broad range of
problems that arise in Cold Dark Matter-based models of galaxy
formation: setting the critical mass scale for galaxies, regulating
cooling in clusters, and shutting down star formation. Such feedback,
feeding, and their mutual interaction might possibly account
