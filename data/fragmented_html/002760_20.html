the diameter of the injector. This is called the Rayleigh-Tomotika instability. We will test if the same breakup occurs with two miscible fluids by injecting honey into water and observe if the honey stream breaks into drops, and if so, measure the size of the drops.

<p>Because the honey is more dense than water, the stream sinks in the water when we try to do the experiment on earth.

A drop of an immiscible fluid in another fluid will always become spherical in weightlessness. We will test if an i
