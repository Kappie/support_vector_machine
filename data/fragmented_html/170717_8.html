and minimize low temperature
 injury, while reducing water requirements in wine grape production. Another
 study found that yield reductions through thinning were necessary to achieve
 adequate levels of soluble solids. Very low water also delayed soluble solids
 accumulation. Other research with grapes focused on development of different
 irrigation systems to apply entomopathogenic nematodes into target pests,
 evaluating the role of annual cover crops, and development of crop protection
 chemicals.
