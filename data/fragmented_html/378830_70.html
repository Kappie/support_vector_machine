tement activities is the question that Integrated Assessment (IA) activities are designed to inform (IPCC, 1996c). The likelihood of various climatic changes, along with estimates of the probabilities of such potential changes, are the kinds of information IA modelers need from earth systems scientists in order to perform IA simulations. We turn next, therefore, to a discussion of methods to evaluate the subjective probability distributions of scientists on one important climate change issue, the climate se
