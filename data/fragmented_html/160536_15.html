nd EDM measurements to these
targets soon indicated that the north flank was moving northward at a steady
rate, so that clearly the volcanic edifice was deforming in response to
intrusion of magma (Lipman and others, 1981).  The theodolite measurements to
the wooden targets provided sufficient data by themselves to define the rapid
displacements of as much as 2.5 meters/day.  The EDM data were useful adjuncts
to the theodolite measurements but were not necessary to trace the movements at
all but the
