o the surfaces coated with 
        MnO2. The polymerization continues until all of the MnO2 oxidant is consumed, 
        resulting in a layer of conductive polymer (polypyrrole) that coats the 
        through-holes. The through-holes are then flash-plated with copper.</p>
      <p> A typical conductive polymer process has six chemical process steps 
        (microetch, cleaner/ conditioner, catalyst, conductive polymer, microetch, 
        and copper flash-plate), as shown in Figure 4.</p>
