tanks with turbid water, fry are concentrated near the surface, but dispersed

going to the bottom of tanks with black lateral walls but gray-colored bottom.
The horizontal dispersal of fry in turbid water seems to be the consequence of
the light-scattering effect of turbidity which reduces the amount of light
