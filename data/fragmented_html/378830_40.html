on" to connect large scale variables that are resolved by the grid box (such as humidity) to unresolved small scale processes (individual clouds). Then we get a prediction of grid box-averaged cloudiness through this parameterization. So-called "cumulus parameterization" is one of the important -- and controversial --elements of GCMs that occupy a great deal of effort in the climate modeling community. Therefore, the models are not ignoring cloudiness, but neither are they explicitly resolving individual cl
