the direction of light propagation. Circular dichroism in the
ferromagnetic film can change the circular polarization of light passing
through it. When it is negligible or <i>P</i><sub>circ</sub> is suitably
corrected, we see by inspection of Fig.&nbsp;2 that
<i>P</i><sub>circ</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>P<sub>s</sub></i>. A positive
<i>P</i><sub>circ</sub> means that there are a greater number of
(<i>m<sub>j</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1/2) electrons than
(<i>m<sub>j</sub></i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1/2) electrons
