ust one set of chromosomes each. For meiosis  to work properly, corresponding chromosomes must first identify each other,  then line up accurately and stay together during the recombination process.  Different organisms use different methods for these critical steps; in <em>C. elegans</em>, the job is initiated by  regions called Pairing Centers, which are found near one end of each of the  worm's six chromosome. Dernburg's lab has been studying the role of these  special regions. </p>
