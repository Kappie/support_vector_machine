 the basins.<BR>Detailed hydrologic studies include drilling wells to collect and analyzeinformation such as water levels and permeability of sediment in order toestimate the size of the water resource, and to collect water quality information.Multiple-well monitoring sites will be developed for these purposes andto provide a long-term monitoring network. The studies will result in GISproducts describing well data, giving three-dimensional depictions of thebasins, and giving detailed cross-sections o
