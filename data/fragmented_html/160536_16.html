<h3>Measurements of Cracks and Thrust Faults Used for Prediction of
Dome Growth</h3>


Geologists first observed cracks on the crater floor in mid-September 1980. 
Would they continue to widen, or had they formed quickly in response to some
short-lived but unknown event?  Simple measurements provided the answer.  Short
stakes of steel reinforcement rod (rebar) were pounded into the ground on either
side of several cracks, and the distances between the stakes were meas
