tion enthalpy also suggests that the components are almost completely segregated. This may be no longer true, however, when the temperature approaches <em>t</em><sub>m</sub> where the heat consumption decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. <a href="articlerender.fcgi?artid=55352&amp;rendertype=figure&amp;id=F4" class="fig-table-link " onclick="startTarget(this, 'figure', 1024, 800)">4</a><em>B</em>). There is also an abrupt decrease of the heat uptake when the micelles are added more than 15&#x000b0;C
