at V1
   and V2 as two-dimensional vectors.
<P>
 
   If V1 and V2 are linearly dependent, S is obviously a line segment or a
   point, so there is nothing to prove. We'll assume from now on that V1
   and V2 are linearly independent.
<P>
 
   Every point in S has coordinates ( cos(theta), sin(theta) ) relative to
   the basis

   Define the change-of-basis matrix C by setting the first and second
   columns of C equal to V1 and V2, respectively. If (x,y) are the
   coordinates
