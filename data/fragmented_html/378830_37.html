coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations exactly. We approximate the solutions by taking the equations, which are continuous, and breaking them down into discrete chunks which we call grid boxes. A typical GCM grid size for a "low resolution" model is about the size of Colorado horizontally and that of a "high resolution" GCM is about the size of Connecticut. In the vertical dimension there are two (low resolution) up to about twenty (high resolution) vertical layers that are typically spanning the
