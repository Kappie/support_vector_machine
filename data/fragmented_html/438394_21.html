ktonic molluscs, on which other marine organisms
        feed. Calcification probably serves multiple functions in calcifying
        organisms. Decreased calcification would presumably compromise the fitness
        or success of these organisms and could shift the competitive advantage
        towards non-calcifiers. Carbonate skeletal structures are likely to be
        weaker and more susceptible to dissolution and erosion. While long-term
        consequences are unknown, experimental results fro
