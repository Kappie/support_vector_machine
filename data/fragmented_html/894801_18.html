cal properties in comparison with the LB model of fluid phase
 separation:

<P>

(1) Polymer blends are reasonable candidates for comparison
 with the LB mixture model.

<P>

(2) The mean-field model gives rise to universal scaling relationships that 
 should allow fixing the parameters of the LB model according to the blend
 molecular characteristics.  This gives some insight into the qualitative
 variation of the LB parameters with the variation of molecular structure.
