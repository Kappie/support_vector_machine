Furthermore, CosmoStats09 will host the GRavitational lEnsing Accuracy
Testing 2008 (GREAT08) Challenge Final Workshop.
Observed galaxy images appear distorted due to gravitational lensing and 
their shapes must be precisely disentangled from observational effects 
of sampling, convolution and noise. The GREAT08 Challenge is open to all, 
and aimed at those from outside the gravitational lensing community, including 
statistical inf
