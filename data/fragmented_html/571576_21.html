quence of this uncertainty is that it limits the ability to empirically detect the climate change due to increased greenhouse gases or to quantitatively infer the sensitivity of climate to greenhouse gas forcing.  It also precludes evaluation of performance of global climate model simulations of climate change over the industrial period.  In 1996 a NRC panel, convened at the behest of DOE, NASA, NOAA, and NSF, issued an urgent call for a coordinated program of research to quantify this aerosol forcing.  Sin
