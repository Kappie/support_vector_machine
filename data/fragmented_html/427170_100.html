rates of this isozyme in the presence of citral lead to the estimation of a Ki of 360 nM. It was observed that citral was readily reduced to the corresponding alcohol by alcohol dehydrogenase in the cytosolic fraction. The reduction of citral in the presence of NADH proceeded at two distinct rates. It is possible that the differential alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated reduction rates of citral are the result of varying affinities for the enzyme of two citral, isomers, geranial (trans) and neral (cis).
