football, bread, bread. and more bread, 
Spoop, AWESOME food, "If you could be any 
room in a house...," Koinonia moments, 
liturgical bingo, " fish, Italy SNOW, Vivian 
'clowning around,' glitter, walking down stairs 
with your eyes closed, prism, "He loves me, 
He loves me not," "my room's too hot...my 
room's too cold," 19 guitars playing God is 
Love, the blessing
