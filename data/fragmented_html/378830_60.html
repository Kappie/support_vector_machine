 context of coupled climate simulations. Until recently, climate modeling groups did not have access to sufficient computing power to routinely calculate time evolving runs of climatic change given several alternative future histories of greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations. That is, they did not perform so-called transient climate change scenarios. (Of course, the real Earth is undergoing a transient experiment.) Rather, the models typically were asked to estimate how the Earth's climate would event
