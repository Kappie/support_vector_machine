Hierarchy of models. A hierarchy of models, ranging from simple zero or one- dimensional, highly parameterized models up to coupled three-dimensional models that simulate the dynamics and thermodynamics of connected physical and biological sub- systems of the earth-system are needed for climatic effects assessment. The simpler models are more transparent -- allowing cause-and-effect processes to be more easily traced -- and are much more tractable to construct, run and diagnos
