ng. Dipping faults are represented by a grid of roughly equilateral triangular 
  dislocation elements approximately 1-2 km per side (Figures 1 and 2). Vertical 
  faults were segmented into rectangular elements. To avoid spurious fault crossings 
  or contacts, the fault model was repeatedly tested visually using a virtual 
  reality viewer to examine projected fault interactions at depth with adjustment 
  of fault dips as needed. Lesser oblique-slip and thrust faults were assumed 
  to end at or before t
