is inversely proportional to its momentum. When electrons are confined to
a "box" whose dimensions are comparable to their wavelength, discrete, or
"quantized," energy levels are observed whose spacing increases with
decreasing "box" size. Thus, such systems are termed artificial atoms
because the colors of light they absorb or emit depend on the size of the
particle. The researchers will investigate whether these spherical 2- to
10-NM drops (which may contain more t
