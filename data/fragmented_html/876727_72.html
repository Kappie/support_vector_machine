ation between increased seismicity 
  and parts of the faults that are unclamped. (b) The oblique shear stress component 
  (rake=135û) [e.g., Zoback et al., 1998] is plotted with right-lateral/thrust 
  shown in red and the left-lateral/normal in blue. There is not a strong association 
  between the shear stress changes and the post-Loma Prieta seismicity.

Because the seismicity rate was comparatively low on these faults before the Loma 
Prieta event, one must examine a number of faults to ensu
