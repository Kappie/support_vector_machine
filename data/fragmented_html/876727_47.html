egorio fault plane with a dominantly 
  right-lateral rake (3-4% thrust component) best matched the uplift patterns. 
  We thus modeled the San Gregorio fault strands with a constant 70û northeast 
  dip (Figure 5). </P>

  160û) is calculated on the San Gregorio fault and is increased where the post-Loma 
  Prieta seismicity is most increase
