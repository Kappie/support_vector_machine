Barnes, Noid, Sumpter, Thomas Thundat of the
Life Sciences Division (LSD), and M. Alfred
Akerman of ETD have received LDRD funding to
refine this technique to make "quantum drops,"
clusters of one or more different types of charged
polymer molecules predicted to act like "artificial
atoms" with tunable electronic properties. Electrons, like photons, possess
both "wave" and "particle" properties; the characteristic (DeBroglie)
wavelength of a particle (usually v
