s distribute itself on existing aerosol particles, as a function of particle size and composition and the nature of the condensing substance?  To what extent does this process take place in clear air versus clouds?  What is the importance of coagulation in controlling number concentration and size distribution of tropospheric aerosols?  Are condensation and coagulation rates calculated on the basis of diffusion and surface area sufficiently accurate to describe this process, or must composition and/or surfa
