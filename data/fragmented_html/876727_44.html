re), and the unclamped parts of the faults shaded in red 
  (denoting a 'positive' normal-stress change). The ratio of the normal stress 
  change to the right-lateral shear stress change ranges from ~1:1 to ~1.8:1 in 
  the seismically active parts of the southern Hayward fault. Thus if a frictional 
  failure criterion is applied with intermediate to high friction (m=0.6-0.8), 
  the overall effect is neutral or slightly discouraging to seismicity. Achieving 
  a Coulomb failure stress commensurate with t
