	<b>Interpretive Summary:</b> Increased understanding of manure phosphorus (P) chemistry is needed for developing best P management practices to optimize recycling of manure P while minimizing the adverse environmental effects of animal manure application. Whereas manure P chemistry can be investigated by various approaches, characterizing labile organic P is a challenge due to their susceptibility to hydrolysis. In this
