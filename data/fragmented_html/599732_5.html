ssessment of water resources and water quality is aimed atthree water basins: Fort Irwin, Bicycle lake, and Langford Well Lake basins.<BR>These basins are initially studied by geologic mapping and by collectingand interpreting gravity and aeromagnetic data. These initial studies giverough descriptions of the extent and depth of potentially water-bearingsediment and result in GIS products including geology, aeromagnetic, andgravity data; three-dimensional depictions of the basins; and cross-sectionsof
