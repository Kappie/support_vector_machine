3</a><em>B</em>) may be attributed to chain melting and component mixing, respectively.</p><p>A tentative understanding of the temperature-induced micelle formation described here may be achieved, taking account of previous work. It has been shown recently by deuterium NMR that the presence of C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> strongly affects the the elastomechanic properties of bilayer membranes on a mesoscopic length scale (<a href="#B13" class="cite-reflink bibr">13</a>). The decrease of the elastic constants
