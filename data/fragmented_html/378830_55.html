ortant. In fact, we can not easily know in principle whether these parameterizations are "good enough." We have to test them in a laboratory. That's where the study of paleoclimates has proved so valuable ( e.g., Hoffert and Covey, 1992). We also can test parameterizations by undertaking detailed small-scale field or modeling studies aimed at understanding the high resolution details of some parameterized process the large-scale model has told us is important.
