sol loading and properties.  The aircraft would fly missions at certain times of the day to probe specific questions such as particle growth rates downwind from the source, nighttime processes, boundary layer formation and the influence of these processes on aerosol loading, composition, and microphysical properties.  Other components of field studies might focus on the role of clouds in transforming and scavenging aerosols and aerosol precursors; mechanistic description of dry deposition of aerosols and pr
