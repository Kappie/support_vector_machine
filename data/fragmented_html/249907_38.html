<p>FDA has the ultimate decision in determining if a device study is SR or NSR. If the
Agency does not agree with an IRB's decision that a device study presents an NSR, an IDE
application must be submitted to FDA. On the other hand, if a sponsor files an IDE with
FDA because it is presumed to be an SR study, but FDA classifies the device study as NSR,
the Agency will return the IDE application to the sponsor and the study would be presented
to IRBs as an NSR investigation. </p>
