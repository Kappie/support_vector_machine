              carbonate shells and skeletons</strong>. When carbon dioxide reacts
              with seawater it forms carbonic acid, which is corrosive to calcium
              carbonate shells and skeletons. The impact is likely to be disruptions
              through large components of the marine food web. The potential
              for ecological adaptation is unclear at this time; however, both
