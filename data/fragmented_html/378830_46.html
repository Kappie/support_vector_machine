though most of the earth's surface and thick clouds are reasonably close approximations to a black body, the atmospheric gases are not. When the nearly black body radiation emitted by the earth's surface travels upward into the atmosphere, it encounters air molecules and aerosol particles. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and many other trace gases in the earth's gaseous envelope tend to be highly selective -- but often highly effective -- absorbers of terrestrial infrared radiati
