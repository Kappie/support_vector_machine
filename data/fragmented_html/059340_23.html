ucleolar RNA synthesis, but leads to an increase in synthesis of nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic poly(A)-containing RNA. Cytosol isolated from phenobarbital-treated, but not from 3-methyl-cholanthrene-treated, animals facilitates an enhanced transport of RNA from nuclei. At the time points investigated, 3-methylcholanthrene or its metabolite shows a 10-15-fold higher concentration in the chromatin than that of phenobarbital or its metabolite. It is suggested that the primary effect of phenobarbital is at the
