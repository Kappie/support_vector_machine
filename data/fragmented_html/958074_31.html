notice if any of the ox cart paintings was by Victor Hartmann, did you? Modeste Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition" was a tribute to his friend Hartmann's artwork, but very, very few of Hartmann's original paintings/drawings that inspired the music are known to still exist. One of the pieces is about an ox cart. <br/><br/>Just curious.
