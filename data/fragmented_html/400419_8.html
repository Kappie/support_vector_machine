<p>In the semiconductor community one refers to the orientation of the carrier
<i>spin</i>, while in the magnetic metals community one refers to the
orientation of the electron <i>magnetic moment</i>. Since the electron spin and
magnetic moment are antiparallel in magnetic metals, the terms &quot;majority
spin&quot; and &quot;spin up&quot;, which are synonymous for a ferromagnet,
refer to an electron with mome
