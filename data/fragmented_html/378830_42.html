context, the change in globally-averaged surface air temperature to a fixed doubling of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide above pre-industrial levels. This brings us to one of the most profound controversies in earth systems science, and one of the best examples of the usefulness, and fragility, of computer modeling.<P>

The Greenhouse Effect. If the earth only absorbed radiation from the sun without giving an equal amount of heat back to space by some means, the planet would continue to war
