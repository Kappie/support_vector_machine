hereby these particles are removed from the atmosphere in precipitation, but it also has the effect of increasing multiple scattering of solar radiation by clouds, thereby making them more reflective, leading to an additional cooling influence on climate.  The  shortwave radiative forcing of climate by aerosols by these two mechanisms has been identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the greatest uncertainty in forcing of climate change over the industrial period.  A major conse
