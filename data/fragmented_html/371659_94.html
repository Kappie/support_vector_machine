   C     Extend the unit vector from the origin and find the surface
   C     intercept.  The output argument FOUND indicates whether the
   C     intercept point was found; there's no need to check this
   C     when the intercepting ray has its vertex inside the
   C     ellipsoid.  OBSPT is the su
