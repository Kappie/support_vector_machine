 the 38 violent tornado events occurred either just ahead of
or in the core of the 700 mb or 500 mb jet.&nbsp; With the approach of
the mid-level jet, the 3 to 7 kilometer shear would steadily increase.&nbsp;
In the 34 cases, this approach of the mid-level jet coincides with the
building period of the mesocyclone during the 23 minutes prior to the violent
tornado.&nbsp; It is possible that increased mid-level shear from the approach
of the mid-level jet explains why the strong stable mesocyclone stren
