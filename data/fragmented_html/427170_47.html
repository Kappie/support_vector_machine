lower vapor exposure levels. The number of corpora lutea, implantations, resorptions, fetal viability, litter size, and sex ratio were not adversely affected by citral at any exposure level tested, and no exposure-related malformations were observed. At a maternally toxic exposure level, a slight reduction in mean fetal body weight and a slight increase in the incidence of hypoplastic bones were noted. Citral does not produce developmental toxicity in the rat when administered by inhalation at concentration
