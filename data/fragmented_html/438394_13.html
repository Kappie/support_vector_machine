                of 280 ppm. The 2x CO<span class="smaller">2</span> concentrations
                are for a surface ocean in equilibrium with an atmospheric CO<span class="smaller">2</span> level
                of 560 ppm. Current model projections indicate that this level
                could be reached sometime in the second half of this century.
                The atmospheric values are in units of ppm. The oceanic concentrations,
