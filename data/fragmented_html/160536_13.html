formation was obvious on glaciers, which apparently were buckling
and bulging upward.  Was this deformation confined to the glaciers and the result
of rapid advance caused by subglacial melting, or was the underlying edifice
also taking part in the deformation.

The obvious way to test for deformation of the edifice was to make repeated
measurements to targets on snow-free parts of the volcano.  Quickly a standard
theodolite used by most surveyors was obtained and angles measured to prominent
