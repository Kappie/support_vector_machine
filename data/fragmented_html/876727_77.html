ent fault in Figure 11, where the number of hypocenters 
  per fault element are plotted against the components of calculated post Loma 
  Prieta stress. During the 7 years after the Loma Prieta earthquake, there was 
  a relationship between the magnitude of normal stress change and the number 
  of earthquakes occurring on each fault patch. No such dependence was observed 
  for the calculated components of shear stress in either the thrust or right-lateral 
  directions (Figure 11), although more earthqu
