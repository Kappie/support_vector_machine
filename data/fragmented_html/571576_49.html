bles such as lapse rate?  What is the importance of diffusional scavenging of non-nucleated aerosol particles?  What is the importance of cycling of aerosols through nonprecipitating boundary-layer cumulus?  What is the importance of clouds in transporting aerosol material and precursor substances, especially vertical transport?  What is the influence of aerosols on cloud microphysical structure influencing precipitation and cloud persistence, feeding back into the rate and extent of in-cloud reactions, rat
