      -50%. For example, decreased carbonate ion concentration has been shown
        to significantly reduce the ability of reef-building corals to produce
        their calcium carbonate skeletons, affecting growth of individual corals
        and the ability of the larger reef to maintain a positive balance between
        reef building and reef dissolution. Scientists have also seen a reduced
        ability to produce protective calcium carbonate shells in species of
        marine algae and plan
