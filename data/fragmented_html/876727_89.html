en a number of ways suggested to maintain high pore pressure in 
  faults with large cumulative offset. <I>Byerlee </I>[1990] noted that fluid 
  overpressures are commonly observed in the crust and that the permeability of 
  fault gouge is so limited that a 1-km-wide thickness at the base of the seismogenic 
  zone could support pore pressures equal to the greatest principal stress. <I>Sleep 
  and Blanpied</I> [1992,1994] derived a model that, rather than maintaining uniform 
  high pore pressures as in
