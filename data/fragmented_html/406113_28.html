t 4 hours after glycogen injection, reaching levels 4-8 times higher than the preglycogen serum CFI levels. Additional studies demonstrated that acute elevations of serum CFI levels could also be induced in rabbits by intravenous infusion of activated rabbit serum or C5-derived chemotactic factors. Infusion of saline, albumin, or the synthetic chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe did not cause elevation of the serum CFI levels in rabbits. Thus, we take these data to support our hypothesis that 1) CFI is a &#x0
