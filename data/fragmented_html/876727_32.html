<p> Figure 4. (a) The post-Loma Prieta shear stress change on the southern Hayward 
  fault is calculated and shows an inhibition of right-lateral slip. A corresponding 
  decrease in seismicity is observed (red hypocenters are post-Loma Prieta and 
  blue occurred before). (b) The normal component of post-Loma Prieta stress change 
  is plotted. The strongest reduction in seismicity also correlates with the
