s in the drops, which become
lower as particle size gets smaller."

"We think our drop technology will enable us to tune, or select, the size of
the drop particles and the number of electrons on each particle," Barnes
says. "The particle size is determined by the droplet size and the
concentration of polymers in the droplet solution. The material properties of
the quantum drops are determined by the polymer composition.

"The electronic properties of quantum drops, such as their ability to emi
