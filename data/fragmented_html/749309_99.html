an important
ingredient in shaping the evolution of galaxies. With the advent of
techniques for estimating AGN black hole masses, even at large
redshifts, and the availability of large quasar samples over a broad
range of redshifts and selected at wavelengths ranging from the radio to
the X-ray, the field has undergone transformational change. A major
focus has become observational and theoretical investigation of nuclear
activity in the context of the galactic environment, which can be
described in terms o
