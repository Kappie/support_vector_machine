he viscous 
cement paste.  The cuvettes have the additional advantage of being transparent, 
so that the drying behavior may be directly inferred from changes in the 
&#34;brightness&#34; of the sample.  The basic experimental setup, illustrated for 
the composite (layered) cement paste specimens to be described below in the 
Results and Discussion section, is shown in Fig.
