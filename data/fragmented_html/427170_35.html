 hyperplasia in rats. Intact adolescent rats 142 days old were treated with citral (3,7 dimethyl-2,6 octadienal) for l0, 30 and 100 days and their ventral prostate compared to untreated matched-age animals. Among the epithelial markers studied, the prostatic specific acid phosphatase was present in hyperplastic prostates of rats. The immunoreaction showed a fair correlation with the severity of lesion and duration of treatment. The prostatic specific antigen showed equally immunoreactive in both control and
