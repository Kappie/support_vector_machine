cal, if not theoretically impossible, to validate the precise future course of climate given the uncertainties that remain in forcings, internal dynamics and unpredictable surprise events, many of the basic features of the coupled physical and biological sub-systems of the earth can already be simulated to a considerable degree. Testing models against each other when driven by the same sets of forcing scenarios, testing the overall simulation skill of models against empirical observations, testing model par
