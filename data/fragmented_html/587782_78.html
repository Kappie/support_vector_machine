							operational treatment designs is being used. The project involves research on 
							both experimental catchments (i.e., &gt;10 ac) and second order watersheds 
							(i.e. &gt;1000 ac) and is designed as a long-term experiment to address 
							productivity and environmental questions regarding short rotation woody crops 
							over the length of the rotation (10-12 years). </FONT>
