g Fermilab have helped the development of IHEP.  This was recognized by Director Hesheng Chen in his opening remarks: <em>Collaboration is the key word in particle physics.  Looking to the past, we can see no successes in the field could have been achieved without collaboration....  Looking to the future, we have reason to believe that collaboration will be again the basis for ILC success.</em></p>
