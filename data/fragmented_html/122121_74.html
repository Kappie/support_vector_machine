                      Juveniles have much smaller, gray, unpuffin-like bills. 
                      However, juvenile puffins can still be identified by their 
                      gray cheeks and chunky shape. Some ornithologists speculate 
                      that juveniles, after fledging, actually drift south to 
                      the Massachusetts coast, following the Labrador current 
                      instead of flying. </font></p>
