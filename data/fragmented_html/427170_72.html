sive effects but increased spontaneous firing at lower doses (threshold 2.5 x 10-4 M). Similar effects occurred in dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurons, recorded intracellularly in the isolated terminal abdominal ganglion of P. Americana. ... citral produced biphasic effects (excitation at 10-4 M, depression at 2 x 10-3 M). All oils decreased excitability of silent DUM neurons that were depolarised by applied currentÂ… All oils reduced spike undershoot. Low doses of citral and geraniol (threshold ca. 10-4 M
