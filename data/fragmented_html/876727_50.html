bars/yr for the San Gregorio fault, which implies that the ~0.5 bar 
  shear stress changes might withstand tectonic erosion for about 10 years after 
  the Loma Prieta quake. The calculated post Loma Prieta normal stress change 
  does not appear to have encouraged earthquakes (Figure 5), with most of the 
  active part of the fault clamped. The ratio of the normal stress change to the 
  right-lateral shear stress change ranges from ~3:1 to ~6:1 in the seismically 
  active parts of the San Gregorio fault
