by aerosols thus exerts a cooling effect on climate change (climate forcing); the upper limit of present estimates of this forcing is thought to be comparable in magnitude over the industrial period to the perturbation in the infrared budget associated with increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, while the lower limit is near zero.  To make matters more complex, aerosol particles serve as the nuclei on which cloud droplets form in the atmosphere (cloud condensation nuclei, CCN).  This is the process w
