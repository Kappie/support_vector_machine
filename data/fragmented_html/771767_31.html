p>Juvenile stage begins about 15-18 days posthatch at a length of about 20 mm.
At the end of the postlarval II stage, fin rays are limited to the lower lobe of
the caudal fin, but as the juvenile stage progresses the fin rays develop in the
rest of the caudal and other paired fins, and spinous rays develop. Further
maturation of the gastrointestinal tract takes place, gill rakers differentiate,
and pigmentation increases. Scale development begins at 24 mm but it is not
completed until they are 45 mm.</p>
