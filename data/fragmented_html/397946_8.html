orithm Testing and Display System (WATADS) to
display the radar data on the Scientific Applications Computer (SAC).&nbsp;
As we gathered the data from each violent tornadic storm, we entered each
value from the cell and meso tables on a form.&nbsp; We also recorded the
violent tornadic storm’s radar signatures, cell type and the positioning
of the storm relative to other storms around it.&nbsp; After we gathered
all the data, we entered the values onto separate spreadsheets for each
characteristic.&n
