 in rat pups is mediated, in part, via supraspinal descending pathways that modulate hyperexcitability in the spinal dorsal horn. The endogenous descending pathways are not fully developed in the newborn, and differential analgesic effects are demonstrable across spinal segments in early postnatal life. This model can be used for further studies on developmental modulation of nociception in newborn rats. In addition, these studies will lead to a better understanding of the development of analgesic mechanism
