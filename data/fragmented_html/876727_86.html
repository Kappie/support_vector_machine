istent with long-held models 
  of frictional faulting in that they appear to have high coefficients of friction 
  and are consistent with laboratory simulations. For example, a Coulomb criterion 
  can explain seismicity rate increases on these faults using a coefficient of 
  friction between 0.6-0.8. In contrast, however, major fault zones that accommodate 
  significant slip (&gt;50-100 km) appear to be relatively insensitive to changes 
  in normal stress. Thus a possible interpretation of these resul
