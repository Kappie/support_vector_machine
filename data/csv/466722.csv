Appendix A.  Records of Wells at Averill Park
Definitions of column headings
Well #  Well number.   Serial numbers used to identify wells.    Letters following a number indicate successive wells on 
"             same property; lower-case letters indicate a deepening of the previous well, capital letters indicate a separate well. Numbers "
"             1–320 were assigned by LaFleur (1989). Well locations are shown on plate 2, but successive wells on the same property are "
             plotted and numbered only if far enough apart to be shown distinctively at map scale.

"Date drill  Date drilled (or deepened). Format is month/day/year; “1” denotes unknown month or day of drilling. Therefore, a date of "
"             1/1/50 generally indicates that the well was drilled at some unknown date in or about 1950, and a date of 8/1/85 indicates that "
             the well was drilled sometime in August 1985.

"Depth  Well depth below land surface, in feet."

"Csd  Depth of casing below land surface, in feet."
 
"D S  Source of well depth (and of casing depth, if known):"
"     D  From driller’s bill or well-completion report, or from driller’s office records."
"     M  From memory of well owner or some other individual, not from a written record.  "
"     R  From written notes or report by owner, plumber, or some individual other than the well driller."
     U  From measurement with steel tape 1999–2002 by U.S. Geological Survey.
     Note:  all wells listed are drilled wells of 6-inch diameter unless noted otherwise in Remarks column.

"Yield  Maximum well yield, in gallons per minute."
 
 Y S  Source of yield data:
"      D   From driller’s bill, well-completion report, or office records, generally measured with water level drawn down to bottom of "
        well by bailing or air-lift pumping.
    M   From memory of owner or some other individual; generally a recollection of the driller’s measurement upon well 
"        completion, but some represent results of more recent pumping."
"    R   From written notes or report by owner, plumber, or some individual other than the driller."
    U   Based on specific capacity as determined during prolonged measurement of water-level recovery by U.S. Geological 
"        Survey in 1999–2002, extrapolated linearly to depth of pump. (This method used only for low-yield wells, and probably "
        overestimates maximum yield because specific capacity can be expected to decrease as drawdown increases beyond the 
        depth range of recovery data.)
    A   Well yield not known but judged adequate from experience of residents.
    S   Well yield not known but judged small from experience of residents.

Use­  Use of water from well:
"     C   Commercial (store, restaurant)."
    D3   Domestic; number denotes the number of residents served on date of well inventory in 1999–2002. 
"     I      Institutional (church, firehouse, hall)."
    N    Water not used (generally because well had been replaced or deepened prior to date of well inventory; also applied to wells 
        for new houses not yet occupied as of the summer of 2002 and to a few test boreholes in which no well casing was 
        installed).

"Sp C  Specific conductance, in microsiemens per centimeter at 25° Celsius, as measured on date of well inventory in 1999–2002 "
             with a calibrated portable conductance meter (Electronic Switchgear Model MC-1 Mark V).

"Hard  Hardness, in milligrams per liter as CaCO3, as measured on the date of well inventory in 1999–2002 by EDTA titration with a "
"             Hach model 5B field kit, which could generally be read to + 8 milligrams per liter; the kit is designed for a hardness range of "
"             0–30 grains per gallon (0–513 milligrams per liter). All tests represent water that was not softened, and at nearly all sites was "
            free of any chemical treatment. 

"Cl   Chloride concentration, in milligrams per liter, as reported in written records from a laboratory. Most samples were collected by, "
"             and analyzed for, the Rensselaer County Health Department."

Cl_date   Date on which sample was collected for chloride analysis (month/day/year). If results of multiple analyses are on file for a 
"             particular well, results for the most recent sample are given here."

"Qual   Water-quality information, or problems reported by well owners:"
    C   Chemical analysis in table 4 of SIR 2008-5087.
"    S   Sulfur odor (hydrogen sulfide), strong and persistent. (Occasional or slight sulfur odor not listed here.)"
    Sx  Water treatment to remove sulfur (generally chlorination followed by carbon filter).
"    I   Iron and(or) manganese, generally in suspended or particulate form, but at some sites dissolved in large concentrations. "
"         (Slight iron/manganese staining is not listed here. For wells equipped with softeners, current iron/manganese "
         concentrations of untreated water are seldom obvious and are not listed here unless reportedly severe prior to installation 
         of softener.)
    Ix   Water treatment to remove iron (generally a cartridge-type sediment filter to remove suspended iron and manganese).
    L   Abundant carbonate crystals trapped in sediment filter. (Many other well owners report modest amounts of “sand” 
"        (generally carbonate crystals) in screens on faucets or washing machines; this condition is not listed here, but is "
         occasionally mentioned in Remarks column.)
     NOTE:  Many wells are equipped with water softeners; this information is not reported in appendix A because hardness 
         of untreated water is given in another column.
    T   Persistent and(or) severe turbidity in water from well.
"    Tx  Cartridge filter, sand-bed filter, or alum treatment followed by filter, to remove turbidity."

"Alt LS  Altitude of land surface, in feet above NGVD29. Altitudes estimated from the topographic map (some modified on the basis "
             of leveling to nearby sites) are reported as whole numbers. Altitudes determined by leveling to top of casing and measurement 
"             from top of casing to land surface are reported to the nearest tenth of a foot; for most of these wells, measurements of water "
             level are tabulated in appendix B.
